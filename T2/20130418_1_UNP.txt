Executive Vice President of Operations.
This morning, we're pleased to announce that Union Pacific achieved record first quarter financial results, leveraging
the strengths of our diverse franchise despite significantly weaker coal and grain markets. Earnings of $2.03 per share
increased 13% compared to 2012. We efficiently managed our operations in the face of dynamic volume shifts across
our network, as evidenced by our record first quarter operating ratio and customer satisfaction results. Putting it all
together, it translates into greater financial returns for our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it over to Eric.
Eric L. Butler
Thanks, Jack, and good morning. Let's start off with a look at customer satisfaction, which came in at 94 points for the
quarter, tying an all-time quarterly record. It's up 1 point from the first quarter last year, setting a new first quarter
record, and along the way, March tied our best-ever month at 95. We appreciate customer recognition of the strength of
our value proposition and continue to work to make it even stronger.
As expected, some key markets were a challenge in the first quarter, and as a result, overall volume was down 2%.
While Chemicals, Intermodal, and Automotive grew and Industrial Products was flat, it wasn't enough to offset the
challenging market conditions that drove steep declines in Coal and Ag Products. Softer coal demand has continued to
have the largest impact on overall growth. Setting the decline in coal loadings aside, the other five groups grew 2.5%
despite the drought-related shortfall in Ag. Note that the volume comparisons were subject to last year's leap year,
which included an extra day of car loadings.
Core price improved 4%, which, combined with a modest benefit from positive mix and increased fuel surcharge
revenue, produced nearly a 6% improvement in average revenue per car. With price-driven average revenue per car
gains outpacing the volume decline, freight revenue grew 3% to $5 billion.
Let's to take a closer look at each of the six groups, starting with the two that saw declines. Coal volumes were down
19%, as high coal stockpiles created by last year's low natural gas prices continued to impact demand. Core pricing
gains and positive mix led to a 16% improvement in average revenue per car, holding the revenue decline to 6%. High
stockpiles and inventory reduction initiatives by a specific utility drove the decline in the southern Powder River Basin
shipments, with tonnage down 19%. Although coal stockpiles started to decline from last year's peak, they remain
above normal levels. Also contributing to the decline was the previously mentioned loss of a legacy customer contract
at the beginning of the year, which more than offset business gains. Colorado-Utah coal shipments also declined. Soft
domestic demand, mine production problems, and the weak international market for Western U.S. coal limited
shipments, with tonnage down 15%. Before we move on to Ag, please note that this slide shows the easing comp we
had year over year in the second quarter.
Ag Products revenue declined 9%, with volume down 9% and a 1% improvement in average revenue per car. Last
summer's drought continued to impact grain car loadings, with first quarter down 19% from last year. Domestic feed
grain shipments declined, as tight U.S. corn supplies, especially in UP-served territories, led to reductions in livestock
feeding and increased reliance on local feed crops. Export feed grain shipments also declined, with improved world
production and lower U.S. supplies.
Grain product shipments were down 4%, as reduced demand for gasoline has increased use of lending credits from
previous years to meet the mandate to over 10% decline in ethanol shipments. A reduced supply and greater emphasis
on meeting local demand impacted DDG volumes, which fell 26%. Food and refrigerated shipments also declined 3%,
driven by lower sugar imports from Mexico and new restrictions in Russia and China that limited imports of U.S. meat
and poultry.
The Automotive volume grew 2%, which combined with an 11% increase in average revenue per car to over 13%
increase in revenues. The growth rate of the automotive industry continued to outpace that of the overall economy
during the first quarter. Drivers that helped the momentum in the automotive market last year continued into the first
quarter, largely pent-up demand and an improving overall economy. New fuel-efficient models equipped with more

features and technology appear to be compelling consumers to replace vehicles. In addition, a rebound in the housing
and construction markets have increased demand for light trucks. While sales continue to grow, our finished vehicle
shipments lagged, as OEMs had unscheduled downtime to deal with product refreshes and dealers sold off existing
inventories to support sales. Parts volume increased 5%, while pricing gains and the previously announced Pacer
network logistic management arrangement increased average revenue per car.
Chemicals revenue increased 14%, reflecting a 12% increase in volume and a 1% improvement in average revenue per
car. Crude oil volume increased 11% from the previous quarter, more than doubled when compared to the first quarter
of 2012. Growth was driven by increased shipments from Bakken, Western Oklahoma, and West Texas shale plays,
UP-served terminals for [indiscernible] (06:25) and St. James, Louisiana, and the Texas Gulf Coast. Plastics volume
was up 3%, driven by the increased domestic demand and new business. Growth in the export market was the primary
driver of the 4% growth in soda ash. Strong demand from Eastern origins, Louisiana, as well as new business to the
Gulf Coast, led to growth in LP gas, with shipments up 13%.
Industrial Products revenue increased 6%, even as volume remained flat, driven by a 7% improvement in average
revenue per car. Nonmetallic minerals volume was up 11%, as continued growth in shale-related drilling increased frac
sand shipments. Growth in housing starts and residential improvement increased the demand for lumber, with
shipments up 18%. Hazardous waste shipments declined 63%, as cuts in government spending resulted in production
curtailment during the first two months of the year, impacting uranium tailings shipments. The slow start for pipeline
projects lowered steel production, and softer demand for export scrap was reflected in a 10% decline in steel and scrap.
Continued mine production issues continued to hamper export iron ore shipments, leading to a 5% decline in metallic
minerals.
Intermodal revenue grew 9%, as a 4% improvement in average revenue per unit combined with the 4% increase in
volume. Although the pace of recovery is slow, continued strengthening of the economy drove international Intermodal
up 8%. While we continue to secure highway conversions with motor carrier and premium LTL customers, our overall
domestic Intermodal shipments were flat, as these gains were offset by declines in select markets.
I'll close with a look at the remainder of 2013. Most economic projections continue to forecast slow economic growth.
Although we face continued challenges in some markets, our diverse franchise still provides opportunity to grow in
others. Despite softness in coal demand and the previously announced loss of a customer contract at the beginning of
the year, we expect coal volumes in the second quarter to see slight gains against an easing comp last year. This
assumes the continuation of recent trends in natural gas prices and further coal stockpile reductions. For the full year,
we still expect coal volumes to be down slightly.
We'll continue to feel the impact of the drought on last year's grain crop through the first half of this year, with second
quarter Ag Product volume expected to be down in the low double digits. Expectations for a more normal crop harvest
in 2013 should provide opportunity later in the year. First quarter auto sales were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
15.2 million, the highest quarterly level in five years. This steady pace is expected to continue throughout the year,
which, combined with declining dealer inventories, should be good news for our Automotive business.
Crude oil should continue to drive Chemicals growth, but the pace will ease against the ramp-up of volumes realized
throughout 2012. Most other Chemical markets are expected to remain solid. Industrial Products should also continue
to benefit from share-related growth, with increased drilling activity and a ramp up in pipeline projects after a slow start
to the year. The housing recovery continues to gain momentum, which is expected to drive demand for lumber. Iron ore
moves are expected to decline due to softer export demand and mine production issues. Successful conversion of
highway business is expected to drive domestic Intermodal growth, while modest economic growth and the
strengthening housing market should keep international Intermodal ahead of last year.
For the full year, our strong value proposition and diverse franchise will again support business development
opportunities across our broad portfolio of business. So when the economy cooperates and we see a more normal
summer weather pattern, we expect a slight volume increase combined with price gains to drive profitable revenue
growth. With that, I'll turn it over to Lance.

Lance M. Fritz
Thank you, Eric, and good morning. Let's start with our safety results. Our first quarter reportable personal injury rate
increased from first quarter 2012. The reportable incident rate was abnormally high in February but moderated
substantially in March and continues to show improvement year over year at the start of this quarter. Severe injuries
declined sharply in the first quarter, reflecting our work to reduce the risk of critical incidents and the growth and
maturation of our total safety culture. Rail equipment incidents or derailments improved to an all-time quarterly record.
This improvement is largely the result of a reduction in track-caused derailments, which is a direct reflection of the
investments we've made to harden our infrastructure. We also reaped the benefits from technological advancements in
equipment defect detection.
Moving to public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased about 14% from the first quarter 2012. Our grade
crossing incident exposure is increasing due to growing rail and highway traffic in the South, which has a higher grade
crossing density than our overall network. Driver behavior was a meaningful contributor, with an increase in vehicles
striking our trains or not properly stopping at crossings. As I said in January, we continue to focus on identifying and
improving or closing high-risk crossings and reinforcing public awareness and safe driving practices.
Now let's take a quick look at the traffic pattern shifts we continued to experience on the network. Volumes on the
Southern region of our network continue to grow. In the South, we are near all-time peak carload volume last seen in
2006, and we are moving it more efficiently, with train speed up about 14% compared to 2006. While service was good
by historical standards in the South, we experienced some modest operational challenges during the first quarter, which
were reflected in our monthly velocity and terminal dwell numbers. We responded aggressively by leveraging our fluid
routes and terminals and realigning critical resources. As a result, we completed an aggressive first quarter capital
renewal program in the South, and I am pleased to report fluidity has improved substantially over the last few weeks.
We're also making continued capacity investments to support volume growth across our diverse portfolio of businesses
in the South. We expect 2013 capacity spending to top 2012, which includes critical double track additions, siding
extensions, and terminal capacity. These projects, along with continued process efficiencies, should support further
improvement in network fluidity and service performance. The first quarter service results were solid, and our network
is well positioned to handle future volume growth. Velocity was basically flat compared to the first quarter of 2012,
with the modest slippage I mentioned in the South offset by strong results in other parts of the network.
We continued to provide outstanding local service to our customers, with a first quarter best 95% industry spot and
pull, which measures the on-time delivery or pulling of a car to or from a customer. Our service delivery index, a
measure of how well we are meeting overall customer commitments, declined modestly compared to the first quarter of
2012. The decline reflects tighter service commitments to our customers, the service challenges discussed earlier, and a
mix shift from coal to manifest. Network fundamentals remained solid. We're increasing capacity in the Southern
region, and we have available capacity in many other parts of the network, as well as roughly 450 employees
furloughed and about 800 locomotives in storage.
Moving on to network productivity, slow order miles declined 25% to a best-ever first quarter level. Our network is in
excellent shape, reflecting the investment in replacement capital that has hardened our infrastructure and reduced
service failures. And we continue to leverage existing resources, as our intermodal and manifest business volumes
grow. During the first quarter, we turned a 4% growth in intermodal volume into an average train size increase of 2%.
Intermodal, manifest, coal, and grain train size lengths all set new first quarter records. Continued deployment of DPU
locomotives, our capital investment strategy, and process improvements should continue to drive efficiency gains going
forward. Car utilization was 1% unfavorable versus the first quarter of 2012 due to mix. Mix being equal, our car
utilization rate would have been unchanged from last year's first quarter. The UP Way is playing a vital role in these
results. Employee engagement is critical to the success of our operating strategy, and as the teams doing the work take
ownership of improving the process and outcomes.
We remain optimistic on our full-year operating outlook for 2013 and our ability to achieve continued network
improvements on various fronts. Our first quarter results were solid, and there is room for improvement. I am

encouraged by what I am seeing at the start of the second quarter, and for the full year, my expectation is that we will
operate at record safety levels while improving service and bringing more productivity to the bottom line. We are
committed to operate a safer railroad for the benefit of all of our stakeholders: our employees, customers, the public,
and our shareholders. We will remain agile, managing network resources in response to dynamic market shifts, while
handling growth with efficient and reliable service. Our continuous improvement efforts, particularly the UP Way, will
generate further efficiency improvements that add value for our customers, and we will continue to make smart capital
investments that generate attractive returns by increasing capacity in high-volume corridors while also supporting our
safety, service, and productivity initiatives. With that, I'll turn it over to Rob.
Robert M. Knight
Thanks, Lance, and good morning. Before I get started, I'd like to make everyone aware that the 2012 Fact Book will
be available tomorrow morning on the Union Pacific website under the Investors tab.
So with that, let's start by summarizing our first quarter results. Operating revenue grew 3% to a first quarter record of
nearly $5.3 billion, driven mainly by solid core pricing gains. Operating expense totaled $3.7 billion, increasing 2%.
Operating income grew 8% to $1.6 billion, also setting a best-ever first quarter mark. Below the line, other income
totaled $40 million, up $24 million compared to 2012. A one-time land lease contract settlement added roughly $0.02
in earnings per share compared to last year, which we do not expect to repeat going forward.
For the full year, we're projecting other income to be in the $100 million to $120 million range, barring any other
unusual adjustments. Interest expense of $128 million was down $7 million, driven by lower average interest rate of
5.6%, compared to 6.1% last year. Income tax expense increased to $588 million, driven by higher pre-tax earnings.
Net income grew 11% versus 2012, while the outstanding share balance declined 2% as a result of our share repurchase
activity. These results combined to produce a first quarter earnings record of $2.03 per share, up 13% versus 2012.
Turning now to our top line, freight revenue grew 3% to nearly $5 billion. Volume was down a little over 2 points,
partially offset by more than 0.5 point of positive mix. Fuel surcharge recovery added roughly 0.5 point in freight
revenue compared to 2012. We also achieved solid core pricing gains of 4%, which was a key contributor to our record
first quarter financial performance. Lower coal volumes again hindered further pricing gains.
Moving on to the expense side, slide 22 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which was
about flat compared to 2012. Lower volume, costs, and productivity gains mostly offset inflationary pressures of about
2.5%. And as Lance just discussed, shifts in traffic mix and significant capital replacement work in the South had an
impact on operations and associated costs during the quarter. Workforce levels increased 2% in the quarter, mostly
driven by a shift in traffic mix to more manifest business, which required additional resources. Increased capital and
positive train control activity also contributed to the growth.
Turning to the next slide, fuel expense totaled $900 million, decreasing $26 million versus 2012. A 5% decline in
gross-ton-miles drove the reduction in costs. Although our average fuel price was flat year over year, our consumption
rate increased 3%, mainly driven by lower coal volumes.
Moving on to the other expense categories. Purchased services and material expense increased 6% to $557 million due
to higher locomotive and freight car contract repair expenses. In addition, under the new Pacer agreement, we're seeing
higher costs in the form of logistics management fees and container costs not incurred under the previous agreement
structure. These costs hit both the purchased services and equipment rents expense lines and are recouped in our
automotive freight revenue line. Depreciation expense increased 2% to $434 million. The impact of increased capital
spending in recent years was partially offset by a new equipment rate study that we discussed with you earlier this year.
Looking at the full year 2013, we expect depreciation expense to be up in the 2% to 3% range versus 2012.
Slide 25 summarizes our remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $313 million,
up 6% compared to 2012. Increased container expenses and growth in automotive and intermodal shipments resulted in
higher freight car rental expense. Lower freight car and locomotive lease expense partially offset these increases. Other

expenses came in at $237 million, up $21 million versus last year. Higher property tax expense and increased
equipment and freight damage costs were the primary drivers. Lower personal injury expense partially offset these
increases. For the remainder of 2013, we expect the other expense line to moderate slightly, more in the neighborhood
of $225 million a quarter, barring any unusual items.
Turning now to our operating ratio performance, for the first time in our history, we achieved a sub-70% first quarter
operating ratio of 69.1%, improving 1.4 points compared to last year. Our performance highlights the positive impact
of solid core pricing gains and network efficiencies and is also noteworthy given the fact that we had 2% decline in
volume levels this quarter. Looking ahead, we remain committed to achieving a full-year sub-65% operating ratio by
2017.
Union Pacific's record first quarter earnings drove strong cash from operations of more than $1.5 billion. Free cash
flow of $401 million reflects the 12% increase in cash dividend payments versus 2012. Our balance sheet remains
strong, supporting our investment-grade credit ratings. At quarter end, our adjusted-debt-to-cap ratio was 40.2%, which
includes our March debt issuance of $650 million. Opportunistic share repurchases continue to play an important role
in our balanced approach to cash allocation. In the first quarter, we bought back nearly 2.9 million shares totaling $349
million. Since 2007, we've purchased over 94 million shares at an average price of around $80 per share. Looking
ahead, we have about 12.2 million shares remaining under our current authorization, which expires March 31, 2014.
So that's a recap of our first quarter results. Looking at the second quarter, although our coal comparison is much
easier, we'll see ongoing challenges with weak grain volumes. However, assuming continued growth in the other
market sectors, we would expect our second quarter volumes to be flattish year over year. Aside from volume levels,
we'll continue to target inflation-plus pricing gains. We'll also realize the benefits from continued productivity and
network efficiency. For the full year, assuming the economy continues along its positive trends with industrial
production growth of around 2%, we would expect to see volumes on the positive side of the ledger. We're well
positioned to achieve yet another record financial year, with best-ever marks in earnings and operating ratio, driving
even greater shareholder returns this year. So with that, I'll turn it back to Jack.
John J. Koraleski
Thanks, Rob. While there's still much uncertainty in the year ahead, our diverse franchise does really support our
continued focus on profitable growth opportunities. We continue to pursue evolving business development prospects,
supported by our value proposition and the efficiencies that rail transportation provides. We're well positioned for
upside, but we are just as prepared if our environment should take a turn for the worse. We remain committed to
providing safe, efficient, and reliable service for our customers to drive greater customer value and increased
shareholder returns in the future. So with that, let's open it up for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Yes, good morning. And congratulations on the strong results. Wanted to ask you about
one of the popular topics, crude by rail here. How would you view the potential impact of a decline in oil prices and
also changes in the WTI-Brent spread, or if you look at other spreads that might be helpful for inland crude moves? Is
that a material source of risk in the near term to volumes, or are your contracts set up in a way that you have
commitments and so you don't have much sensitivity to the price and the spread moves?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: You know, Tom, I think certainly it depends on the order of magnitude of the moves that
were to take place. We don't see anything in the horizon at this point in time that gives us any concern. But, Eric, why

don't you expand on that?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Hey, Tom. There are a couple of factors. We've said previously crude by rail provides a great
value proposition to the producers in terms of agility, in terms of being able to get to destinations that they previously
couldn't get to, so all of those values – factors – remain. Certainly, if the price of oil goes to levels, pick a number, the
low $70s, mid-$60s, that's going to impact the amount of production, which, as the total production numbers come
down, the total numbers that will go crude by rail will come down. So that clearly will have an impact if price of oil
goes down.
In terms of the spreads, we're probably less concerned about the spreads narrowing. You know, again, there's the value
proposition we've talked several times in the past publicly with crude by rail that, again, gets to you to destinations,
allows you – the producers flexibility and agility, so we think that even if the spreads get to some narrow, some low
single digit number, there's still a value proposition for crude by rail. The biggest factor is if crude production goes
down, then certainly that impacts us.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Okay. And what about the structure of the contracts that you have in place into the St.
James market? Are there some commitments that are multiyear, where you would have some minimum volumes into
those markets, or is it set up in a way that if things really change, that there wouldn't necessarily be volume
commitments?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, as we said, we don't really talk about specific customer agreements. What I would say that
you can look at is the fact that the destination providers and the origin producers, they're investing huge dollar amounts
of capital to do crude by rail, both in terms of freight cars and facilities, so that should be a comforting indicator in
terms of their long-term commitment to crude by rail.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Okay, great. Thank you for the time.
Operator
Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Great. Good morning, and, again, congrats on some solid performance. Rob, can you just
talk about the outlook there that you just ran through? If you look at flat carloads for second quarter, do you still see
coal moderating? Is Ag accelerating on the downside? Maybe if you can give a little bit more insight onto some color
on what's in your target there?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah. Ken, just to kind of reiterate what both Eric and I talked about, keep in mind, as I
think you know, the coal fall-off that we saw year over year in the first quarter of being down 19%, last year, you recall
we just sort of hit the trough on coal. So we do have clearly an easier comp on coal as we head into the second quarter.
But, as Eric mentioned, we do envision that the Ag drought will continue certainly through the second quarter, and we
estimate that's going to down in the, call it low double digits, which is a little bit worse year over year, if you will,
compared to what we saw last year.
So when you add it all up, the guidance that we're giving is, assuming all the other markets remain about constant with
what we saw in the first quarter, that feels flattish to us. But full year, again, if the economy continues to cooperate,
which thus far it is, all of those things will sort of neutralize, if you will, when we get to back half of the year, and we
think at the end of the day, at the end the year, we'll have volumes that overall are on the positive side of the ledger.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Okay. And if I can do my follow-up on pricing. Was there any – on the Coal side, were
there any contract settlements within the yields? And then also within pricing, you mentioned the Pacer agreement a
couple times. Can you kind of talk about or walk through the level of increase? I know you don't like talking about
specific contracts, but maybe just magnitude of what we're looking at or continue to go forward on that contract? And
then similarly on pricing on the domestic Intermodal side, I think you mentioned it was flat. Can you just kind of run
through what you're seeing impact on that as well?

<A - Robert M. Knight>: Ken, this is Rob. Let me take the first point, and you asked about the settlements in the coal
line. There's a little bit in there. We're not calling out precisely what it is, but it was just a little bit of an impact on the
ARC on the coal. And in terms of the other pricing discussions, we don't break out by -
<A - Eric L. Butler>: We don't talk about pricing on particular arrangements or agreements. So, Ken, I'm not sure
what your question was.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: I guess you mentioned that auto pricing was up significantly because of the Pacer
agreement. So you kind of called it out on there. I mean, can you give us, I guess, an understanding of what auto would
be like without the agreement? I mean, it was a big number in terms of the 10% increase. It is half of that in terms of
magnitude?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Ken, this is Rob again. I mean, the impact on the autos ARC of that new agreement, it's in
that number. So it clearly inflated, if you will, the ARC number, but that Pacer agreement, as I think everybody's
aware, as previously announced, is really just kind of a neutralizing effect. I mean, it's showing up both on the revenue
and expense line, but it doesn't change the full-year economics to us at the bottom line. But there is a positive impact
shown up in that ARC number on the autos line.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: And you will see that all year.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Okay. And then lastly, just on the domestic Intermodal, I think you had mentioned
something about flat there. I just want to understand that as well?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Domestic Intermodal.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah. We are continuing to see strength in our domestic Intermodal business. As I think I
mentioned, our conversion strategy is going well. We're continuing to price to the market, and we're continuing to be
pleased with the performance in that business.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: The volume was flat in the first quarter, Ken. Was that your question?
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Oh, it was volume, okay. Not price. Yeah.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: It was volume, not price.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, volume was flat.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Ken, this is Rob. If I'd just make one clarifying point on the Pacer question that you asked. I
said that the autos ARC reflected this new agreement, but it's not reflected in our 4% core pricing number that we
report. That doesn't factor anything related in that number.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Trahan. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. So just wanted to follow up on a couple of those things
from the last question. With the coal yields being so strong, if it's not legacy repricing, can you give us a sense of
maybe what's driving that strength, and if you think it's sustainable? And then, Rob, you mentioned you're getting get
good coal yields even without the volume. As the volume starts to come back, can the coal yields – or should they get
even better from what we saw in first quarter?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: You know, Scott, when you look at the pricing of our coal overall, there was some legacy
impact from prior contracts that had been settled, and there was also just the normal escalations that we have in our new
contracts going forward. There was some incremental fuel surcharge. There was a little bit of liquidated damages, but
not very much. So that's really it.

<A - Robert M. Knight>: Scott, if I – just one comment. The ARC number that we reported in the first quarter for – in
addition to the comment that Jack just mentioned – there is some mix effect in there. So that – again, if you look at our
overall pricing as an enterprise, we reported 4% price, and as I mentioned in my comments, it was hindered somewhat
by the lack of volume in coal, but if you're searching – and of course we don't break it out by commodity group what
the pricing actually was, but it is appropriate to take into consideration that the ARC number we reported in Coal did
have some mix effect in it.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: So when you add up all those kind of moving parts of maybe some liquidated damages that
don't continue and maybe coal coming back in some parts of – on the network, does this kind of double-digit run rate
on ARC feel sustainable for the year?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: It will depend upon the mix. Again, what we're looking at overall in our pricing is to be
inflation-plus kind of pricing overall, and that's how we approach the business overall. But when you look at any
individual commodity group's ARC, you can get swings either way depending on the mix of traffic that we move that
quarter.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay, that makes sense. And just last thing on the domestic Intermodal. I'm a little confused
that you're talking about the highway conversions going well, but domestic volumes were flat. What's offsetting that in
the quarter? And just any color you can give us there would be great.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, as I mentioned, in a couple of select markets, there was some competitive – select markets
that had some volume reductions, and -
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Hey, Scott, let me take you back to our past comments, which is as we take our prices up,
there are some businesses going to fall away from the railroad because it doesn't meet our reinvestible standards, and so
we saw some of that. So we were taking some prices up. We've got some new business in highway conversions, and we
lost some business that didn't meet our reinvestibility threshold.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay, that makes sense. All right, thanks for that, guys. Appreciate it.

Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Yeah, good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask a question on the cost side. When
we look at compensation and benefits, it's actually been flat to down for the last four quarters or so. How should we
think about head count and wage inflation and some of the offsetting efficiencies that you're getting in the network for
the rest of the year?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Hey, Rob?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: The guidance that we've given on the – let me start with the head count question first.
Overall head count for the year we would expect to float with volume. So, again, our projection is that, assuming the
economy cooperates, that our volume will be on the positive side of the ledger. So the way I would look at it is that we
would expect volume to be up year over year, but not necessarily one for one, because there certainly is productivity
savings that we will achieve throughout the year. On the cost side, the way I think I would guide to you look at the way
I would expect costs to flow through is we think our labor inflation is going to be around 3%. There were some timing
issues that resulted in it being flat – you're right – this quarter and the previous couple of quarters. But probably the
right way to look at it is expect that that inflation on the wage line's going to be around 3% going forward.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Hey, Rob, one other thing to note, and we mentioned it in our commentary, head count will
also flux with CapEx and with mix shift to manifest.

<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Well, then I take it from that guidance, Rob, then, I mean, should we be looking for
more normal comp and ben inflation of 3% throughout the year, I mean, depending obviously on the volume outlook,
then?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: I think that's the right way to look at it.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Okay. And then quickly on purchased services, you mentioned that the Pacer
agreement did escalate costs there. Is that the new run rate that we saw in the quarter for the rest of the year as well?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: There could be lots of factors. Obviously volume overall will play a part in there, but that
particular item that we saw in the first quarter will repeat throughout the year.

Our next question comes from the line of Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - William Greene>: Yeah, hi there. Good morning. Jack or Rob, can I just ask you to comment a little bit on the
return of capital approach? When you think about sort of the circumstances that might cause you to be a little bit more
aggressive there or maybe change the way you think about leverage, because I know you do debt to capital. But I think
if you look at it on a debt-to-EBITDA basis or an interest-coverage basis, you'd be pretty conservatively levered. So
maybe you could just comment a little bit on what circumstance you might be willing to be more aggressive in that
regard?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Sure. Rob?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, Bill, I mean, as we've said before, we haven't changed our approach. We don't look at
just debt to cap. We just sort of use that as one of the measures that we talk publicly about. We look at all the measures.
But where it all starts is we're focused on generating the cash to begin with. We will continue then to deploy the cash
by making investments in capital projects where we're confident the return is there. We expect the 30% payout on the
dividends, but we would expect that as earnings continue to grow, we expect the dividend to continue to grow along
with it. And then we will continue to be opportunistic on the share repurchase activities that in fact we've been
deploying for the last X number of years. So in terms of when you add it all up, Bill, as you've heard me say before, we
are still comfortable in that low 40s debt-to-cap ratio. That's not how we drive our business, but that's kind of a
resulting measure that we are still very comfortable with it.
<Q - William Greene>: Okay. Rob, you also made a comment in your comments about core price, and I just want to
make sure I understood it. And that is that some of the coal that's repriced didn't move, and I think if we think back to
2012, that kind of caused the reported core price metric to be a little bit lower than might have otherwise been the case.
Was that a material impact this quarter again? I would have thought we're starting to lap it. But maybe you can just give
a little clarity there.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, Bill. Compared to sort of normal run rate, which is always the elusive part of that
calculation, we'd call it about 0.5 point of price that did not materialize had the higher levels of coal volume moved
under those repriced contracts. So we reported 4% core price. Had it been sort of normal run rates of volumes in the
coal world on those repriced contracts, it would've looked more like 4.5%.
<Q - William Greene>: All right. And then one last one just on nat gas. How soon is it at nat gas prices like this when
we see the customers start to react? Is that a lag of like six months or 12 months? How do we think about that? Thanks
for your time.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: You know, Bill, actually overall, we have seen customers start to make the shift back from
natural gas to coal. The bigger problem right at the moment is there's not much demand for electricity, or the demand
for electricity is softer. So even though we've actually seen some customers start shifting back and taking more coal, we

have not seen a substantial increase in coal shipments yet.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: This is Eric. If you look back at last year at this time, coal market share of electrical generation
was down in the low 30s, probably 32%, 33%, 34%. Today, it's about 40%, so clearly coal has regained market share at
$4 or $4.20 natural gas. As Jack said, the demand for overall electrical generation is still down as the economy is still
coming back, and we're in shelf months in terms of weather patterns, so both of those are impacting the overall
electrical demand.
<Q - William Greene>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question is from the line of Justin Yagerman of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Hey, good morning, guys. It's Rob on for Justin. Eric, could you talk a little bit more with
regard to your coal outlook? This morning, Peabody raised their expectation in terms of the coal burn by about $20
million on both the high and low end for the U.S. What sort of growth are you guys expecting in terms of consumption
across your utilities, and would that imply upside to what's baked into your guidance currently?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: I think in Rob and our comments, we kind of indicated – we said slightly increased on the
second quarter with the easier comp. The fundamental issue, really, is going to come down to the overall demand and
then how competitive coal will be against natural gas. So you need the economy to come back strong. You need the
large steel mills to start using electrical generation. You need normal weather patterns in the summer. And as all of
those things happen, you'll see the demand for electricity go up. And, again, as I said, current coal market share has
grown back to 40%. It'll never get back to the 50s that it historically was, but it's better than the low 30s. So I haven't
seen that Peabody outlook, but my guess is that they're expecting normal weather patterns and continued economic
growth in the economy to drive electrical demand.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: No, that's fair. Coal's always a tough one to model looking forward. I guess, Rob, circling
back on Bill Greene's prior question, when you're saying with coal getting back to kind of normal type burn levels,
would flat year over year in Q2 imply normal coal levels, and we should be thinking about kind of a 4.5% core
improvement looking forward?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: It's always difficult to predict what normal is, but we are assuming, as Eric said, the positive
news of coal being a greater market share. We do have the easier comp. And if volumes materialize, we would hope to
see that in our margins on that business that we've repriced. So I guess I would say that we are looking at things to be
more normal as we look out for the balance of the year.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: That's helpful. And I guess before I turn it over, Lance, if you could talk to the intermodal
train length extension. You saw over kind of 2% year-over-year improvement on intermodal boxes. Could you talk how
that played out on both the domestic and the international train starts across your Intermodal franchise? And thanks a
lot for the time.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Sure. Off the top of my head, I do not have the detail on how that splits out between the two. I
can tell you that we do have size opportunities on both. I would say they're probably more on the domestic side, but
we've got plenty of train size opportunity on both sides.

Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Christian Wetherbee>: Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just a question on the coal inventories. Eric, I know you
mentioned that they were still elevated. Could you just give us a rough sense of kind of where they stand relative to
historical norms? I mean, are we still pretty far away from getting back to normalized levels?

<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah. So the numbers haven't come out for the latest month, but as of the numbers that came out
in March, they still showed overall for the whole country 11 days above normal. There's probably some pretty wide
swings in that number between Eastern utilities and Western utilities. I would expect a large number of the utilities in
our serving area are getting pretty close to normal. There are probably some that are below normal because they've
taken some aggressive inventory actions. So I would expect that when you see next month's number come out, you'll
see some pretty normal, and may even perhaps below-normal inventory numbers.
<Q - Christian Wetherbee>: Okay. And is there any reason to think that the level of what should be normal changes
at all with going forward just with the relationship between natural gas and kind of where we are currently with the
shale activity? Or kind of old normal's the right way to think about it?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, I don't really see a huge change for the coal-centric utilities. They're still – it's in their best
interest to burn coal, and they're, in essence, competing against the natural gas-centric utilities. And so they're going to
get their burn patterns up, and they need a certain run rate to protect their burn patterns to protect against outages. So I
don't see a significant shift in what has been historical normal inventory patterns for coal-centric utilities.
<Q - Christian Wetherbee>: Okay. That's helpful. And I just want to come back to – and I apologize – just on the mix
aspect within coal yields, I'm trying to get kind of a handle on how to think about that. Can you give us a little bit of
color of what kind of drives the big mix changes? Is just seeing more volume that had been repriced, legacy volume
that had been repriced, moving relative to other business with in the commodity group? Or – I guess we're just trying to
think about how to project this out in the next couple of quarters. So just any little bit of color around the positive mix
dynamic in the first quarter would be helpful.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, so when we talk about mix, we're talking about the mix of southern Powder River Basin
coal, Colorado-Utah coal, export coal, et cetera. And so if you look at some of the places where there are volume –
where volume reductions, we've had positive mix in other areas because of some of the new southern Powder River
Basin coal opportunity that we have.

Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Chris Ceraso of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: Hey, thanks. Good morning.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Good morning.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: So not to beat a dead horse, but I do have a couple of follow-ups on coal. First of all, you can
just give us a ballpark, out of the, let's say, 19 percentage point decline that you had in coal in Q1, how much of that
was associated with the lost business? Was it 5 points out of the 19 or something in that neighborhood?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Rob?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, Chris, the contract that we've spoken about previously was about 5 percentage points
on the volume.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: Okay. And then if I kind of put together all the things that you talked about so far that – coal
back up to 40% of the burn, that inventories at the utilities in the West are back to normal or maybe below normal, your
comps are getting easier, if we start to see increased volumes of coal, should we expect that the pricing gets better,
because you'll start to move some the stuff that you didn't move last year where you had recontracted at higher rates?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: You know, it's really largely dependent on which customers grow in what areas and how
those kind of play themselves out.

<A - Eric L. Butler>: And, again, as we've talked in the past about our pricing calculations, certain things may not
come up in our pricing calculations, but they will show in improved margins as repriced business that those volumes
come back. You'll see that in our margins, even if you don't see it in our pricing calculation.
<Q - Chris J. Ceraso>: Okay. And then just one follow-up. The depreciation, bonus depreciation, Rob, how much of a
drag on cash flow do you think that might be for UP in 2013 versus 2012?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Of course, as you know, we're getting still the benefit of 2013 of 50% bonus depreciation,
which is what it was last year, so that is not a huge driver in 2013, but starting in 2014, we'll start to feel the impact of –
assuming there's no bonus depreciation beyond 2013 – we'll start to feel more of an impact. There's a slight benefit this
year when you add it all up.

Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin, RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to follow up again on the
Intermodal side. I think when we look at the highway conversion opportunity, I think largely the assumption has been
that given your length of haul, you have somewhat less of an opportunity than perhaps some of your Eastern peers.
Have you looked at the market for hauls of above, say 500, 600 miles to address what that upside opportunity is, and
you can share that with us, if you've had a look at that?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Sure. We have. Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, Walt, I guess I'm not necessarily sure I'm tracking why a longer length of haul should
result in fewer opportunities. We actually think the opposite, that longer lengths of haul should result in more
opportunities. The current total size of our Intermodal book of business is about 3 million units a year, closely, equally
divided between domestic and international. We size the domestic attainable market opportunity – and we talked about
this in Dallas, I think, last fall – we size that as somewhere around 10 million units. Now, not all of that will be easy to
[audio gap] (51:08-51:40) sell the value of Intermodal to them, and some of that requires them to tune their supply
chains a little differently, but that's the market opportunity, the business development opportunity, and frankly why
we're so excited about the future potential.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: And, Walt, when Eric talks about the 10 million opportunity, that does not include another
2.5 million to 3 million trucks that move back and forth between Mexico and the United States. And as you know,
we're building a new intermodal facility down in Santa Teresa to really target that northern Mexico, the maquiladoras,
and those kinds of things, which will hopefully make a dent in that 2.5 million to 3 million unit opportunity as well.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: That's great color. Can you give us a sense of the available capacity on average of your
intermodal trains? Roughly how much incremental volume could we see go onto your intermodal network without – at
fairly high incremental margin?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Sure. How about Lance?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Sure. So, again, that depends very much on the lanes that the opportunities show up in, but just
giving you an aggregate sense, I think we've averaged, what, 170 units a train in the first quarter, and most of our lanes
could probably handle 250 plus/minus units. Again, very dependent on where it shows up and lane specific.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: And you're fully double-stack capable [ph] roughly (52:55) your network?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Virtually everywhere.

Our next question comes from the line of Cherilyn Radbourne of TD Securities. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Cherilyn Radbourne>: Thanks very much. Good morning. I just had a question about your Ag business.
Obviously the USDA is forecasting some pretty large crops this year. I just wonder, as you look out over your draw
territory, what's your read on soil moisture conditions and I guess the risk of continued dryness in some areas and
floods in others?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Well, I tell you what, right here in Nebraska, after the past month or so, we're about ready to
stick a fork in this drought. We've had some nice heavy rains and heavy snows and things like that, and hopefully that
is doing its job in terms of replenishing the moisture content in ground. Eric, do you want to put some Technicolor
around that?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: If you look at last year, Cheryl, the USDA said last year was going to be one of the five best
years in all of history, and then we know what happened. So I take forecasts with a grain of salt at this time of the year,
simply because so much of it is weather dependent. As Jack said, it appears to be a great start in our growing season.
Nice moisture in our key breadbasket; we're all excited about that. We're not out of the woods yet, and we do need it to
continue, and you not only need it certainly for the spring planting season, but you also need moisture in the critical
part of the heat of the summer. So there's a long tail left before we can feel comfortable about the predictions of what
will happen in the harvest at the latter part of the year.
<Q - Cherilyn Radbourne>: Okay, and switching gears, just in terms of the public crossing accidents that you're
experiencing in the South, which is really a function of your growth there and the whole region's growth, how
disruptive for you from an operational standpoint are those, and how quickly do you think you can bring that back
down?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Okay. Lance?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yeah, sure. Excellent question, and just to predicate this, this is an extremely frustrating
statistic for us. We've been working very hard on impacting the trend for the past several years, particularly down in
Texas. The short answer on how disruptive – it varies, but generally speaking, it's a couple hours of downtime as the
accident gets investigated and cleaned up. So they have an impact. It's variability. It's not the same order magnitude,
typically, as a derailment. And in terms of when can we start moving the needle on the number, I'm telling you, we're
doing everything in our power right now to try to impact that number.
As we look at it in large aggregate, we're about on top of last year's statistics. They're pretty volatile. So what you saw
in the first quarter is a little degradation, but in general, absolute number, we're a bit worse but trying to navigate on top
of last year's number. It involves a lot of things like an audit and blitz of our railroad to find where the risk is. The risk
moves and grows rapidly with development of industry around us, and then engaging the local authorities to care as
deeply about the issue as we do to impact driver behavior. So there's a lot of activity going on there.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: It's a very difficult issue, and sometimes you just – I was surprised, actually, that we don't
have the power to even put a stop sign up without getting the approval of local authorities, and sometimes they just say
no. So there are some pretty significant obstacles out there towards changing driver behavior and getting everybody on
the same page we are as to how important this is.
<Q - Cherilyn Radbourne>: Okay, thank you. That's my two.

Our next question is from the line of Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Tom Kim>: Thanks very much. I'd like to follow up on the comment about cross-border. Can you just remind us
how much Mexico contributes to the bottom line presently? And given the tremendous growth prospects, what do you
think it might look like over the next few years?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Rob?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, Tom, we don't give the bottom line, but I'll give you the top line. It represents about
10% of our business levels currently, and it's been growing nicely the last several years. Across the board, a mix of
commodities, it's been growing at a pace greater than our overall volumes have been growing.
<Q - Tom Kim>: Okay. And then just a more housekeeping-related question. With regard to the $40 million in other
income, we estimate that – I think you mentioned land sales contributed about $0.02 a share. What's the remainder of
the $40 million?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Rob?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: So it's miscellaneous transactions. I wouldn't call anything out in particular that is driving
that. The balance would represent a relatively normal run rate for us.
<Q - Tom Kim>: Okay. All right. Well, thank you very much.

Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Good morning, guys. I guess my question is more longer term here. I look at your 65% OR
target by 2017, and to me, it seems fairly attainable. I mean, you just reported a first quarter that had fewer working
days in it; you had a record OR. Coal's under pressure. Ag's under pressure. Talk to me about that goal that you have
out there and what some of your underlying assumptions are in terms of some of the commodity groups and also your
core pricing, which also seems fairly strong ex coal at 4.5%?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Sure. We think it's attainable, too. Rob, you want to – ?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, Jason, I mean, you've heard me say this over the years. I mean, it's not an end game.
It's the next target that we've put out there. Not unlike when we set the original 75% target, we got there as efficiently
as we could, and got there a little early. Then we set the low 70s, got there as efficiently as we could, and got there a
little early. We hoped to get to the previous sub-67% earlier, as we mentioned last fall, and I'd make the same comment
about the sub-65%. So we're going to get there – the same way we're going to get from where we were to the sub-65%
is the same way we got from the high 80s down to where we are today, and that is efficient, safe operations, leveraging
productivity, providing great service to our customers, allows us to price it fairly. Fuel can obviously be a whipsaw on
us depending on what fuel does in terms of the calculation on the operating ratio. But I would just take comfort that
we're going to – our assumption is a normal economy, the economy cooperates, and fuel prices are normal, if you will.
And we're going to go after it as efficiently and as quickly as we can.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: And in terms of your assumptions for coal and its market share versus nat gas in that 65% OR?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: I mean, we don't get into that level of detail other than I would say it's sort of a normal. And
we certainly think that Powder River Basin coal is here to stay. Perhaps at lower levels than what we historically
experienced, but our assumption is that it's a normal from here on out, if you will.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Okay. And my follow-up question, on your Southern region, it seems like you had a little bit of
challenges operationally, and is it starting to feel better already in 2Q, and how should we look at that throughout the

year?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Sure. Lance?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yeah. It is starting to look better. The actions that I mentioned in my comments regarding
utilizing fluid routes, terminals, making sure we adjusted our resources rapidly, that made a difference in the tail end of
March, and we're looking much more favorable in the South right now in the first few weeks of this quarter.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Plus we've had – our maintenance programs were very heavy in the first quarter; that was
planned. Those are now starting to be completed, and some additional capacity projects coming on as we go through
the year with capital. And each one of those adds a margin of fluidity and improvement in our variability.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Okay, so all things being equal, we should start seeing that come out in your weekly
performance numbers?

Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Yeah, thanks. This is probably related to Jason's question there, I guess, on how the
improvements were accomplished in Southern region fluidity. But, related, [ph] of your $1 billion (1:01:18) or so
growth in productivity CapEx, at this point, can you cite a couple of projects that are perhaps most material, likely to
impact the income or ROIC over the rest of the year and next?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Lance?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Sure. So we've got some new capacity in commercial facility spending. That'll have some
impact. We've got a very large facility in Santa Teresa. It includes an intermodal ramp that we think is going to really
aid what Jack talked about in terms of cross-border truck traffic and conversion to intermodal.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Plus fueling.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Plus the fueling for the facility.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Efficiency.
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: We've got some excellent work going on in terms of more fluid operations to our crude oil
destinations. We should see benefits of that over the years. We've got capacity that's being spent up in the northern tier
of our network, as well as in Texas, to enable incremental, more fluid frac sand movement. We've really got it spread
all over the railroad, largely concentrated in Texas and Louisiana, but there are key projects all over the railroad that are
unlocking critical pieces of capacity for us.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: There are some things, Keith, that we have kind of scaled back given the volumes that we're
seeing and the way the economy is running, like, for instance, the double-tracking of the Sunset Corridor. We're 70%
done with that, but we're pacing it a little differently to watch in terms of the volume, but long-term potential is the
ability to take that from 55 trains a day to 90, which would be a huge step forward for us. We have the Mississippi
River bridge that we're continuing to work on. That is a key bottleneck that would be eliminated as we go through that
project. And we have a Blair cutoff that is not order of magnitude that big, but anything that would save three to four
hours of transit time on the trains that go through our central corridor to Chicago eventually helps the bottom line

enormously.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Great. Thank you. And maybe one quick, shorter-term question, perhaps for Eric. We're
seeing stronger growth in housing at last. Lumber improved 18%, probably as a result of that. Could you comment on
where and how material housing improvements are showing up elsewhere, be it light trucks, some intermodal, et
cetera?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Sure, great question. We're excited about the housing improvements. Finally, housing's actually
running ahead of the original Global Insight estimates, and I think the housing – or the lumber producers are pretty
positive about the trends that they're seeing and the housing start numbers that are seeing. Housing, in addition to
impacting lumber, is also going to impact our Intermodal business. As you know, once homes are built, you have to
furnish them, and so both on the international Intermodal business and the domestic Intermodal business, we think that
housing will have an impact on that. We think housing would also have an impact on ancillary businesses like our steel
rebar business, which goes into construction, our cement business – our cement business, we think that that will
strengthen as housing strengthens. So all of those are things that will go as housing goes.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Eric, it sounds like you're using future tense, though, that those are sort of pending
improvements. Am I reading that correctly?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: No, I've been around here long enough where I remember when housing was regularly 1.7
million, 1.8 million starts a year, so even though we're back up to around 970,000 off a low of below 600,000, 970,000
still feels low to me. So I'll feel like it's back – regular, normal when it gets above 1.3 million, 1.4 million, 1.5 million.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: But if you look, Keith, like at our cement business, I think it was up about 6% in the first
quarter. Our plastics business, which would include things like PVC pipe and those kinds of things that are using in
housing construction, were also up in the first quarter. So we are seeing the residual impact that goes along with the
incremental lumber.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of John Mims of FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - John R. Mims>: Yeah, thanks. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my call. Just one quick one for me this
late in the call. Eric, I had to step away for a minute. Could you repeat what you were saying about international
Intermodal and maybe add to any comments related to outlook for any sort of a peak season in 2013?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: What I was talking about international Intermodal is that as housing starts increase, you need to
furnish the homes. And so we do see a trend between international Intermodal upswing as housing starts improve. That
was the connection that I was making. Last year, what we said was that it was a muted peak season – I think we used
those words last year. It's early in the year, and at this point in the year, what happens in peak will determine on
economic conditions, consumer confidence, retail sales. All of those things will determine kind of what happens in
peak volumes.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Right now, we are expecting the intermodal peak to be stronger than last year.
<Q - John R. Mims>: Okay.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: The order of magnitude is – we're not sure of yet. It really depends a lot – bidding season is
just coming in right now for a lot those international contracts between the retailers and the ocean carriers and things
like that. So there's still a lot to be determined in terms of how that'll play out for summer.
<Q - John R. Mims>: Right. Okay, so as of right now, though, it's still just more of a read on the macro versus you
having real conversations as far as staging capacity with the liners or with major shippers?

Our next question comes from the line of Ben Hartford of Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Benjamin John Hartford>: Hey, good morning. Just to expound on that, I guess, this 8% growth in the first
quarter, I'm assuming that's not a run rate for the balance of the year and that the first quarter you did benefit to some
degree from certain shippers shifting away from the East Coast to the West Coast ahead of any sort of East Coast ILA
strike during the first quarter. Is that right? Is that the right way to think about the volume in the first quarter?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, we do not expect to see that kind of run rate for the year. There were some nominal
impacts of shifts from the East Coast, but very small. The bigger factor, frankly, was the timing of the Chinese lunar
New Year this year versus last year, and there was some advance shipping because of that. That was probably the larger
impact. Plus, we did see an impact – inventories were pretty thin after the holiday season last year, and you did see an
impact of inventory catch-up in January.
<Q - Benjamin John Hartford>: Okay, good. And then on the coal side, I know you've kind of earmarked a number
of different, various items that drove RPU above expectations to the $2,300 level. Is this a good level to be thinking
about then? I mean, you hit on mix, legacy fuel surcharge, and some liquidated damages as well driving that number.
But is this $2,300 level a good level to think about for coal as it relates to RPU for the balance of the year?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Ron?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: You know, as we indicated in some previous discussions, I'd be careful using a run rate of
ARC, because mix can have such an impact on that, up or down. So, again, we're going to aggressively go after
providing the good service and repricing where we can, but the ARC number can move on you.
<Q - Benjamin John Hartford>: Okay. Good, thanks.

Our next question is from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Yeah, thank you for taking the question this morning. Maybe more of a conceptual question on
the Intermodal side. UP's service levels have improved dramatically over the last 10 years or so and have generally
caught up to the other big Western railroad. And I guess the question is, as you see the service levels right now, where
do you think you have a competitive advantage versus the competitor? Where you think the competitor has an
advantage? Is that you how think of marketing this service in particular power lanes where you might have better
on-time performance or better velocity? And based on some the investments that you're putting into the ground now,
will you see that competitive positioning change at all here over the next couple of years?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Yeah. Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, good question. To start with, as we look at our intermodal network, we are actually proud
of the fact we go to many more places than our competitor in the West in terms of our franchise, in terms of origin,
destination points where we have service to, and that's really the power of the diversity of our franchise. We just get to
and from many more places, and the customer base – a large portion of the customer base – does see value in that.
Having said that, for the places where we do compete head to head, we kind of assess where we are very regularly, and
we are pleased that in most of the places where we compete head to head, we think our service is as good or materially

better in the majority of the places where we compete head to head. There are a couple of places where our competitor
has a slight advantage, and we're continuing to put initiatives and strategies in place to ensure that we have the best
service in the industry.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Thank you, Eric. And then maybe one question that you don't need to answer if you don't want
to, but I'll ask it anyway. With respect to operating ratio as the key metric to focus on for the future, you've said again
here today that you believe you'll get to a 65% or lower for the full year 2017. That seems like a very achievable target,
as one of the other analysts mentioned. But what happens if in 2016, Eric comes to Jack with a $400 million project
that has a 68% operating ratio on it? Does that put you in the position of perhaps saying no to that project, or do you
feel as though you can still accommodate that and access that incremental traffic? Would return on invested capital be a
better measure or some other measure that takes into account the generation of free cash flow? Just conceptual thought
in terms of whether operating ratio is the correct metric.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: You know, John, when we look at business opportunities at a high level and at a specific
level, we're really focused on the reinvestibility of the business, our ability to provide good, efficient, safe, and
consistent service for that customer, and then we deal with it on that basis in terms of the acquisition or whether we
take on the business or not. We don't really think about it in terms of the operating ratio. But I will turn that over to Rob
in terms of a broader discussion of the key metrics.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, John, I mean, I get your point, and I would say that we set operating ratio target out
there just as a way of kind of speaking in our organization as setting our mind toward making financial improvement.
But at the end of the day, it's focused on returns. So we know we've still got room to go in improving our operating
ratio, which will improve our earnings, which improves our cash, which if we do all the investments correctly improves
our returns. So they all kind of go together. But at the end of the day, it's improving our returns.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: It's really a portfolio of measures.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah.

Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Kauffman of Sterne, Agee. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Kauffman>: Thanks for taking my question, guys. It's been a long call, and most of mine have been
answered, so I may just throw a quick one out there. I see the carloads for the crude business. If I thought about that in
terms of trains per day and how to allocate those carloads, roughly how many trains a day are you doing in the crude
business relative to how many trains a day for the system total? And is it fair to assume – this would be the follow-up –
that it's longer-haul business and therefore a higher RPU than your average Chemical RPU?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Lance?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Sure. Trains per day, we're in the five plus/minus ballpark. Length of haul -
<A - John J. Koraleski>: 750 miles...
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yeah.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Kauffman>: All right. And how many trains per day for the total network?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Oh, in the total network. Boy, it varies by day of week and moment in time, but for instance,
right now, we probably have 820 trains on our network.

Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: So, Rob, there's a note in here talking about a new equipment rate study on the
depreciation line. Did that lower the rate that you guys are depreciating the equipment at on a go-forward basis? Or
could you just add some color to that?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yes. I mean, the result of the study was – elongated, if you will, the depreciation on those
assets. Combining that with the fact that we're running fewer gross-ton-miles resulted in a lower depreciation rate than
what we've previously experienced.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: I think it was – the depreciation number was 5.6% in the last Q. Do you know the
number off the top of your head, or should we just wait for the Q?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: In the first quarter, the depreciation rate was 3%.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: 3%, okay. And the fuel surcharge revenue in the quarter?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: I'm sorry?
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Fuel surcharge revenue in the quarter?

Our next question is from the line of Justin Long, Stephens. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Justin Long>: Thanks and good morning. In the quarter, your volumes were down a little over 3% sequentially,
but operating expenses were up nearly 4% if you look on a sequential basis. Just on a high level, you can talk about
some of the puts and takes that drove that discrepancy? And would you say that's not a trend you would expect going
forward?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: You know, mix is always a factor in that particular calculation, when you look at car
loadings sequentially and expense going forward. So I guess I would say that take the guidance that we've given you in
terms of the components as best you can is the best way of looking at it, rather than trying to calculate that particular
sequential relationship.
<Q - Justin Long>: Okay, fair enough. And then as a follow-up, could you comment briefly on CapEx and remind me
where you stand from a rail car equipment perspective? And any investments you might need to make there given you
volume outlook for the remainder of the year?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Sure. Our current CapEx is targeted at about $3.6 billion for the year, which is down just a
bit from last year. It does include some equipment acquisitions that are needed for business growth and replacement of
retiring assets. If you had some specific question beyond that -
<Q - Justin Long>: Maybe specifically on the car types that you're looking to purchase this year?
