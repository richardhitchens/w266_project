Okay, thank you very much. Welcome to The Priceline Group's third quarter conference call. Thank you for joining us
before the markets open this morning in New York. I'm here in Amsterdam with Priceline Group's CFO, Dan Finnegan.
The group reported consolidated gross bookings for the third quarter of approximately $13.8 billion, up 28%
year-over-year or about 29% on a local currency basis. Non-GAAP net income was $1.2 billion, up 29% year-over-year
and earnings per share was $22.16, up 28% versus prior year surpassing FactSet consensus estimates of $21.08 per
share and our guidance for the quarter.
Our customers booked accommodation reservations for 95 million room nights in the quarter, up 27% year-over-year
versus 29% in Q2. This modest deceleration reflects the benefit of higher growth rates in new markets, which continue
to become an increasing share of our worldwide business. Growth rates also benefited from strong execution in
building supply and availability during our peak booking season.
Booking.com's platform now has over 540,000 hotels and other accommodations in 207 countries, up 52% over last
year. Booking.com is establishing clear global leadership in the online accommodations markets. We continue to see
market share gains in every geography with particular strength outside of Western Europe. The business is also
growing in the non-hotels area as we continue to experiment and invest in adding these properties to our inventory and
taking friction out of the booking process.
Growth in our vacation rental bookings including villas, chalets, apartments, apart-hotels and other self-catered product
continues to exceed the growth of our hotel business and as a result comprises an increasing share of our business.
Our marketing mix is also diversifying favorably. We believe the offline branding investments of Booking.com have
been a key component of our growing mix of direct business, and we intend to continue to complement our substantial
online advertising investment with effective offline branding. We will likely invest in offline advertising in additional
markets during 2015, provided we continue to observe acceptable ROIs on our total advertising spend.
Priceline.com posted 10% growth in gross bookings versus 21% in Q2 reflecting the impact of tougher comps from
increased advertising on KAYAK last year and a difficult environment for OPEG availability. Conversely, retail hotel
and rental car growth helped offset this challenge with solid performance. Total rental car days accelerated in the
quarter reflecting strong performance of both Rentalcars.com and Priceline.com. Between KAYAK, Priceline.com and
Booking.com, we feel good about our growing position in the United States travel market and we plan to continue to
profitably invest to improve our services and bring more customers to our sites.
Asia-Pacific also continues to be a bright spot for the group, and we believe we delivered market share gains through
the efforts of Agoda.com and Booking.com. We saw strong growth in particular in North Asia with some recovery
from the political unrest in Southeast Asia. We're also well into the planning and execution of our latest commercial
agreement and investment in Ctrip, China's largest OTA.
We were excited to have OpenTable join our quarterly leadership team meetings in Amsterdam and the knowledge
sharing between OpenTable and the balance of the group is underway. Pay with OpenTable, our mobile payments app,
is off to a strong start with great adoption rates and feedback from diners and restaurants alike. International expansion
will be a longer-term rollout and the team is hard at work laying the ground work for success. We've also completed
our plans for co-marketing between our brands and experimentation and execution on those plans has now begun in
earnest.
The group performed well in the third quarter with market leading growth on both the top and bottom lines and
sustained leadership and profitability as well. I believe our teams are executing very well in an intensely competitive
marketplace and against a mixed global economic and political backdrop. We continue to build our brands through
smart investments in mobile, marketing, people, best-in-class customer service and product, and service innovation.
This includes new opportunities also like dining, mobile payments and hotel marketing services.
We also continue to invest in building trusting win-win relationships with our partners across accommodations, flights,
rental cars and restaurants. I want to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication in
delivering terrific performance during our peak summer seasons. We also continue to be very optimistic about the

many opportunities that are still ahead of us.
I will now turn the call over to Dan for the detailed financial review. Dan?
Daniel J. Finnegan
Thanks, Darren. I'll discuss some of the highlights and operating results and cash flows for the quarter and then provide
guidance for the fourth quarter of 2014. Growth rates mentioned in my remarks are in relation to the prior-year
comparable period unless otherwise indicated.
OpenTable is included in our income statement from the acquisition close date of July 24 through the end of the
quarter. OpenTable revenue included in Q3 results amounted to $41.2 million and is included in advertising and other
revenues in our consolidated statements of operations. There was no cost of revenues for OpenTable in our reporting
format so gross profit equals revenue. We will report OpenTable's revenue for the first year to help investors
understand the impact of the acquisition on our top-line growth.
Q3 was a strong quarter from a top and bottom line perspective. Room nights booked grew by 27% in the third quarter,
decelerating modestly compared to the 29% growth rate for Q2. Average daily rates, or ADRs, for Q3 2014 were up on
a local currency basis by about 3% for the consolidated group.
The FX rate for the euro to the U.S. dollar for the third quarter was about the same as the prior year. However, the euro
weakened as compared to the $1.34 exchange rate that prevailed at the time we gave Q3 guidance. The impact on
bottom line was mitigated by our hedging program, but currency exchange rates had a slightly negative impact
compared to our guidance for gross bookings, gross profit and operating profits.
Q3 gross bookings grew by 28% compared to prior year. Our Q3 international gross bookings grew by 32% both in
U.S. dollars and on a local currency basis. Gross bookings for our priceline.com brand business in the U.S. grew by
10%, driven by good performance for retail travel services, which benefited from increased retail air advertising
placements on KAYAK. We lapped the start of these ad placements in Q3, which caused gross bookings growth to
decelerate for Priceline in Q3 and will result in further deceleration in Q4.
Hotel Express Deals performed well, but our Name Your Own Price hotel, air and car services were all down
year-over-year due to limited availability of discounted rates and share shift to Express Deals. I highlight that Name
Your Own Price impacts merchant gross bookings and disproportionately impacts merchant revenues, since we record
Name Your Own Price revenues on a gross basis, while our other revenues are recorded on a net basis.
Gross profit for the quarter was $2.6 billion and grew 32% as compared to prior year. Our international operations
generated gross profit of $2.34 billion, which constituted an increase of 33% both in U.S. dollars and on a local
currency basis, as compared to the prior year. Gross profit for our U.S. operations, including OpenTable, which is
largely a U.S. business, amounted to $275 million, which represented 24% growth versus prior year.
Non-GAAP operating income amounted to 54% of gross profit for Q3, which is 191 bps lower than last year. Operating
margins were impacted by investments we made in offline advertising and other OpEx to build our brands and support
growth initiatives in restaurant reservations and hotel marketing services.
Operating margins came in better than our guidance, due mainly to less than forecasted year-over-year decline in online
advertising ROIs. Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 amounted to $1.43 billion, which exceeded the top end of our guidance
range of $1.37 billion and represents 28% growth versus prior year.
Non-GAAP net income grew by 29% and non-GAAP EPS grew by 28%. In terms of cash flow, we generated
approximately $1.3 billion of cash from operations during third quarter 2014, which is about 33% above last year. We
spent $29 million on CapEx and repurchased $148 million of our common stock in Q3. We spent about $2.5 billion of
U.S. cash in Q3 to complete the OpenTable acquisition, and we used non-U.S. cash to invest $500 million in a Ctrip
convertible bond and $151 million in Ctrip stock.

We raised about $2.3 billion of additional capital in the U.S. during the quarter at what we believe to be attractive terms
by completing a $1 billion convertible debt offering and raising about $1.3 billion through a euro-denominated bond
offering. Our cash and investments amounted to $8.2 billion at quarter-end, with about $1.6 billion of that balance in
the U.S.
Now for Q4 guidance. OpenTable is included in our forecasted results for the entire quarter. It is still a relatively short
period of time since the deal closed, but our current intension is to increase investment in OpenTable from an
advertising and OpEx perspective in Q4 and coming quarters to position the business for future growth. For Q4
guidance, we are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 8% to 15% in U.S. dollars and by 13% to 20% on a local
currency basis with U.S. gross bookings growing by about 0% to 5%, which reflects lapping certain retail air ad
placements on KAYAK during Q3. We expect international gross bookings to grow by 10% to 17% in U.S. dollars and
by 16% to 23% on a local currency basis. Obviously, the deterioration in the euro exchange rate over the last couple of
months is indicative of weakening economic conditions in our most important market, which is of concern as we look
at the business going forward.
Our Q4 forecast assumes that local currency ADRs for the consolidated group will be up about 1% compared to the
prior year period. Our Q4 forecast assumes that foreign exchange rates remain at the same $1.25 per euro and $1.60 per
British pound as Monday's closing rates, which would result in average exchange rates that would be weaker by about
8% for the euro and about 1% for the British pound as compared to the prior year. I highlight that the euro exchange
rate assumed in our forecast is about 7% weaker than the $1.34 exchange rate that prevailed at the time we reported Q2
and most analysts last updated their forecasts.
We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our fourth quarter EBITDA and net earnings from any
fluctuation in the euro or the pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter, but these hedges do not
offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit or operating income and do not hedge our
earnings beyond the fourth quarter.
We expect Q4 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 11% to 18% and gross profit to grow by
approximately 17% to 24%. We expect that declines in our Name Your Own Price service will continue to negatively
impact revenue growth rates in Q4.
We expect about 350 bps of deleverage in non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit compared to
prior year, as we invest in advertising and other expenses to support our brands and new initiatives. Our Q4 online
advertising forecast reflects our actual results to-date and assumes further pressure on ad efficiency throughout the
remainder of the quarter based upon the trends we've experienced over the last couple of years.
We estimate that we will spend about $50 million to $55 million for offline advertising in Q4. These investments in
advertising and other OpEx can have a more pronounced impact on profitability in Q4 and Q1, which are quarters
where we typically earn a lower percentage of our annual profit due to the normal seasonality for our business. As a
reminder, Q4 2013 personnel expense included a $12 million charge related to a payroll tax levy in the Netherlands.
We do not expect to incur a similar charge this year.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $625 million and $665 million, which, at the midpoint, represents 12%
growth versus prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an estimated cash income tax rate of approximately
15%, comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and state income taxes in the U.S.
Our non-GAAP EPS forecast also reflects the cash interest expense related to the two bond offerings we completed in
Q3 that I mentioned a moment ago. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $9.40 to $10.10
per share, which at the midpoint represents 10% growth year-over-year. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully
diluted share count of 53.2 million shares based upon Monday's closing stock price. We forecast GAAP EPS between
$7.55 and $8.25 per share for Q4. The difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP operating results is driven by
non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our earnings release.
In summary, we believe that our forecast represents strong top-line and bottom-line growth and exceptional profit
margins.

Our Q4 forecast implies full-year EBITDA growth of 26% to 28% with an operating profit margin in the mid-40%
range. We would be pleased with this outcome under any circumstances, but particularly in a year where we made
substantial investments to support our brands, including increasing offline brand advertising support by over $100
million.
Our guidance reflects the actual deceleration in growth experienced to-date and our assumption that we will experience
further deceleration over the remainder of the quarter, as we compare against a period where our room night growth
accelerated last year. Although, we are increasingly concerned about economic conditions in general, and in our key
European market in particular, our forecast does not assume any further deterioration in macroeconomic conditions.
We will now take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Heath Terry with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Heath P. Terry>: Great. Thanks. You commented on seeing higher online ROI in the quarter. And then
obviously, guiding towards seeing pretty significant weakness, particularly in the U.S. in that in the fourth quarter.
Wondering if you can tell us what's changed from Q3 to Q4. Is it a specific channel, is it a mix from independent to
more chains on the hotel side? What would you say describes the difference? And to the extent you see quarters like Q3
where ROI and online spend is higher, how quickly can you adjust your spend to take advantage of that, and were you
able to do that in the quarter?
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: Hi Heath, it's Dan. So for Q3, we actually didn't have an increase in ROIs year-over-year.
They just weren't down to the extent that we forecasted when we gave guidance. And we don't really adjust based upon
the ROIs coming in better. We follow a consistent and disciplined approach that targets what we consider to be a
reasonable ROI based upon conditions in the variable channels at that point in time.
As far as the U.S. growth rate goes, that's more a function of lapping ad placements that Priceline.com has done on
KAYAK over the past year, particularly powering the retail air booking pad on KAYAK. So that drives a significant
amount of gross bookings dollars, not a significant amount of gross profit. So the impact from a bottom line perspective
is not as dramatic.
<Q - Heath P. Terry>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: You're welcome.
Operator
Our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
<Q - Justin Post>: Thank you. Just a couple questions on Q4 guidance. You mentioned ADRs are going from plus
three to plus one in local currency. I'm just wondering if you are seeing a real slowdown in travel so far this quarter and
are you seeing some cancellation in room nights? And then has the competitive environment picked up as Q4 has
started? Thank you.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Dan, why don't you take that one?
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: Yep. So as far as the ADRs go Justin, it reflects our particular business mix. We have seen
some market-to-market impacts that could be more macroeconomic or currency driven; for instance, European travelers
going to the U.S. with the significant slide in the euro versus the dollar having a tendency to trade down in terms of
what they're willing to spend in dollars for a hotel room to try and keep the cost of the trip consistent from a euro

perspective.
In terms of European economic condition in particular, we're concerned about what we've seen over the last couple of
months. I think the results we posted for Q3 are very strong from a top line and bottom line perspective. For Q4, we
have seen some deceleration and then our forecast reflects an expectation that we'll see further deceleration as we go
forward. If you remember last year, we accelerated during the back half of Q4, and so whenever we have a difficult
comp like that, we're a little bit more cautious with our approach to forecasting.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yeah, maybe I, Justin I'll just add, this is Darren. That competitively I don't feel that
that's the issue. We track market share of all of our accommodation partners around the world and we believe we're
increasing market share everywhere. So this is – there's a little bit of a geographic mix and as Dan points out, exchange
rate challenges obviously for us are translation issues into U.S. dollars, but they do actually have real impacts as well.
People rethink their travel. We're a very internationally travel oriented company. We're more weighted into people
coming from one country to another and it's not just the euro, it's the ruble, the Australian dollar. There's other
nationalities who like to travel internationally who may change their plans or still execute their plans and as Dan said,
they'll actually trade down to maybe a three star versus a four star accommodation to reflect a fixed family budget.
<Q - Justin Post>: Got it. And maybe one follow-up; in 2012, I think you saw a slowdown and in 2013, you kind of
re-pivoted, did more offline advertising, bought KAYAK. As you look forward to next year, are there some levers and
different adjustments you can make maybe to try to reaccelerate growth? Thanks.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yeah, maybe I'll take that on. I'm actually very optimistic. Obviously what we
constantly face is just the sheer size of our business relative to others, and we always have a strong focus on
profitability. So there are things we could do, but if we don't feel good about it from an ROI standpoint, generally as a
group those aren't things we will do. But we have many plans. We're really bullish on, of course, OpenTable and its
opportunity to add to us longer-term. Hotel marketing services as you know is an area that we're investing in and have
seen some real positive signals from our hotel partners of people interested in that kind of product, which is a great new
vehicle.
We're also doing a lot in the mobile front and other plans that I'm not prepared to announce on this call for competitive
reasons. But I feel good about the pipeline of innovation that we have and it's still a very big market. I mean, we're the
largest player now in online travel, but we're still small proportionate to the market opportunity. And it's always good to
remind ourselves as well that travel is growing twice the rate of GDP. Online travel within travel is growing. The share
is shifting to large players in the OTA space. I mean, there's a lot of things that are working in our direction and we
would hope over time to continue to take advantage of those.
One other thing I will flag is our property count, because some people have brought this up. You see that it's been a
little slower in the last month or so, but that's really a seasonality effect. These are – we have a significant amount of
stock that comes online in the spring, and then goes offline in the fall. So we don't count that on our total until it comes
back online, though we don't see any barrier there as well. We have a very strong pipeline of new properties ready to be
completed and signed on and verified. And I still think the opportunity to add properties is still very significant for our
business going forward.
<Q - Justin Post>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Great. Thanks for taking my question. Guys, I was hoping you could just talk more about
Booking.com into the U.S. and perhaps also just help us parse out the growth rates a little bit across the international
business by geography. And just to clarify on 4Q, going from 32% ex-FX bookings growth in the third quarter down to
16% to 23%, and you're saying, you don't think it's competition. So we can interpret it as macro and perhaps the law of
large numbers. But is there anything else that we should be thinking about there? Thanks.

<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Dan, you want to start off first on that?
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: Yeah, so I'll take that second part. I'd say you hit it pretty well there, Doug. I think we look
at it as the law of large numbers. So generally we expect the business to decelerate given the size of it. There is some
macro concerns, particularly in Europe. And then, in addition, we just have a very difficult comp because growth
accelerated last year. So because it's our normal expectation that we're going to decelerate when we have a period of
particular strength like that, it gives us more caution and when we forecast against it.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: And I would – this is Darren just adding on. The United States in particular, it is one
real highlight on the global travel market, it's a real positive. And it has been a real positive for us. Our retail business is
very strong. In particular Booking.com, we believe is, of all the bigger players, is the fastest growing player in the U.S.
accommodations market. And we continue to expand our properties. We've got great repeat rates, a lot of growing
business in direct customers. So we're very bullish that we can get significant growth out of the U.S. market looking
forward. But it's a very competitive market. And we certainly stand ready to compete for that business and feel good
about the progress our team has made. But so much more to do. It's one of a number of very large markets where I
think our product deserves more market share, and we plan to go out and make that happen.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Ross A. Sandler>: Yeah, just two quick questions, guys. I think a follow-up from what Doug just asked. But if
you look at the growth rate for core Booking.com implied by the 700,000 room nights per day, you decelerated fairly
meaningfully from 2Q to 3Q. And I know Easter had an impact on the 2Q growth rate, but where do you think we are
in terms of Booking.com's share gains story globally in most of these markets? Is it still happening or are you guys
basically the market and, in particular, where does that stand in the U.S.? And then, Darren, you just mentioned new
mobile products or some new initiatives. Can you just elaborate a little bit on what you were implying from that
comment a few minutes ago? Thanks.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: All right. Doug, I'll take the first piece. So, I'm not sure what you're referring to there. In
terms of local currency growth rate for our international business, we went from 34.5% to 31.8% from Q2 to Q3. So,
what I would classify as modest deceleration. I believe that Booking.com is growing its share across the board in all of
the markets in which we're operating. So growing still at a very good rate within Europe and, as we've said several
other times on prior calls, Europe is still such a big part of the business that the overall growth rate pretty closely tracks
to the trends that you're seeing with the European business. And then our other, newer markets, North America, Asia
Pacific and South America growing at a faster rate than the U.S.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yeah. And let me take on, I think you were asking perhaps about mobile specifically.
We, yeah, we're – it's an area that doesn't cease to amaze me in terms of the potential out of mobile. If anything,
particularly bookings through mobile phones have been extremely strong. Tablets are becoming a little more like PCs I
think for everyone, and there's just a curiosity with all the new tablet type form factors coming out and also the growth
in ultra-light PCs et cetera where the tablet ultimately will fit in. But certainly we are seeing more and more of the
business coming through mobile, and I think that really does play to a strength. If you look at the ratings of our
products on Google or on the iTunes store, we have some of the most highly rated products.
So we've spent a lot of time as a team working on the plumbing to make sure that they're all cloud connected, that the
consumer has a great experience walking in with an electronic version of their booking et cetera, et cetera. And a lot of
new innovation which we aren't announcing on this call really relates to how do we enhance the experience for the
consumer.

So now that the plumbing is working really well and we're getting great feedback, how do we take our mobile game to
the next level so that it connects end-to-end from looking, booking to staying for the user? And I'm very excited and
optimistic about the opportunities that that will bring for us. These things are not easy to do. They make executing an
online business more complicated but they really play to our scale and our ability to invest across a very large base of
properties. And we can then bring pretty amazing value to our consumers and their sort of multi-screen lifestyle. So
hopefully that helps.
The other thing I think, I don't think Dan totally touched on it, but we feel also very good that our productivity per hotel
continues to increase. So if you take a hotel that was on our website four years ago, they'll see more bookings per day
from booking today than they did a year ago, than they did the year before that and the year before that. So our core
hotel partners are getting more production from us. But still there's so much more to do, and we still represent a small
share of the total accommodation space. So I don't frankly see any limits to that at this time.
<Q - Ross A. Sandler>: Great. Thanks, guys.

Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC. Your line is open.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Thanks. If I could try to get off three questions, you talked about Ctrip, I think somehow
being still in the planning stages. Could you talk about when or the extent that that's already operational, what's the
path, to that being fully operational and material perhaps? Second in terms of competition, can you just talk
qualitatively; it's always been a competitive marketplace. Is there something that's changed in terms of where the
competition is coming from? Are you seeing it more from direct travel, wholesalers or hotels or airlines directly as
opposed to other online travel agencies? Has the direction of the competition changed? And then finally on alternative
accommodations, you talked about it becoming more material. Is that having an impact on the rest of the business?
Like, do you view those alternative accommodations as purely incremental, somewhat cannibalistic? Could you
describe what impact that has on kind of the rest of the business? Thanks a lot.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yeah, thanks a lot, Mark. So maybe I'll take you to the – just quickly one-by-one. On
the Ctrip deal as you know we've been in a commercial relationship with them for some time. Part of the new
commercial relationship with a deeper integration for Ctrip being able to then book – Booking.com and Agoda hotels.
And a lot of that integration has happened and we're seeing some very strong results, from it. Obviously those accrue to
both us and to Ctrip, because it's now on a branded basis and more and more Chinese are traveling outbound.
The other side of the agreement was for us to put Ctrip product on the Booking.com website in particular. There's a lot
of work going on, to get the – the technical term is APIs worked out, so that we have the right connection points
because they want those bookings to be able to happen for the consumer very seamlessly. But we hope to be in test
with their product on our website say by the middle of this quarter, so the end of this month. And then, we'll see where
we go from there. We're going to take a slow rollout approach just to make sure that consumer experience is absolutely
perfect as it relates to that particular integration. But I don't see any barriers to making that happen.
In terms of competition, there's obviously a lot of noise in the marketplace; it's an extremely competitive marketplace. I
don't see anything really that materially has happened. If anything our dependence, particularly on Google, has lessened
which is some of the challenge Google has in growing their clicks relative to the rest of the Internet. More of our
business is coming direct, which is very healthy. I think that's partly related to offline, but also partly that we offer our
guests a great direct experience. A much higher percentage of them are using accounts now versus finding us through
indirect channels.
And in terms of us versus hotels or hotel chains, I don't see any material change there. I think there's always going to be
business that goes direct to hotels, and to hotel chains. We frankly embrace that fact, but there's also lot of travelers
who travel less frequently, and are really looking for a bed in a particular city versus a particular property and I think
that continues to play to our strength.

And then your last question was on non-hotels. No I don't see this at all cannibalistic. If anything, if you look at the
millennial travelers, the younger travelers, they prefer to stay in non-hotels, they prefer to stay in secondary cities.
Certainly with the rise of players like Airbnb et cetera, it's making people more courageous to try new things. And if
anything the non-hotels have really significantly increased the variety of product on our site, and it's made the world of
accommodations more transparent and more exciting frankly for people. Non-hotels also help us a lot, when cities get
sold out, which does happen; convention times, things like that. So they provide nice shoulder availability for people
and particularly for leisure travelers and families, sometimes a non-hotel can feel like an upgrade, because they've got a
lot people, they don't want to stay in the same house, they don't mind traveling into the city to see the museum, but
want to have more of a self-catered versus a catered experience.
So I really don't see any negative in it. Hotels still do very well; occupancy rates in many parts of the world are quite
high. I don't see there being any sign, at least at this time, that the phenomenon of more non-hotels entering sort of the
legitimate space as having any big effect on hotels or kind of the more traditional product.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Thank you, Darren.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Naved Khan with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
<Q - Naved A. Khan>: Yeah, hi. Thanks. Darren, you touched upon opportunity for TV spending in some of the
newer markets. Can you elaborate on that a little bit? Where are you seeing those kinds of opportunities?
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yeah, so we don't – as you know, we advertise the three brands. Priceline.com is still
primarily U.S., although we do do ads in Canada now. With KAYAK, it's been a North American story, although we
have increased our offline marketing in Europe, and still working the model, but feeling some success there. And then
for Booking.com, it's really not been that long but we're now in the U.S., Australia, Canada, the UK and then recently
launched in Germany. And as time goes on, if anything, we're feeling better about that investment, that it fits well in
our mix. It gives us a really nice drive towards our direct business.
It's also helped diversify our sources of demand really nicely that allows us to – the more we diversify source of
demand and better understand sources, we can act a little more strategically vis-à-vis our source of demand. We don't
have to lean in to everything at all times, because some of our sources demand can have strategic conflict. And this has
been a real breakthrough for us to know that we can be out on our own and to build our brand and to build customer
relationships for the long term, rather than having to consistently be in the market, buying them on a transactional basis.
So that's the story. And then in terms of future plans, unfortunately nothing to reveal at this time, although I know you
were hoping for that. But we're looking at a number of options going into 2015 and we wanted to make sure we
signaled at this time that quite likely it will involve more markets.
<Q - Naved A. Khan>: Okay. Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up if I may. Turning back to your Q guidance,
especially for international bookings growth, what kind of impact are you taking in from Ebola, or the threat of Ebola?
And have you – what have you seen so far in your numbers?
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Well, I would – that's a great question. I would say, again, it's a very mixed
environment. And before I get into the negative, it's always worth highlighting, the summer was actually quite stable in
Europe and a lot of sickly Brits and Germans did go to Southern Europe. There were other pockets like France,
Benelux and of course Russians weren't traveling a lot. So it was kind of a mixed picture, but relatively stable.
And I should also, it's important to highlight that the U.S. has been very strong as has North Asia, and we also did great
business during the World Cup, out of Brazil. But I think what's happening now, the primary is not Ebola; it's more, the
travel business is very headline driven and headlines create perceptions that can lead to reality. And of course people
already know in a lot of our core markets that their currencies have devalued, that is a discouragement for maybe

international travel, so maybe they'll stay more domestically, which will often lead to maybe a lower ADR or even a
lower length of stay. And we do see that a little bit and are more concerned that those perceptions can become a more
significant negative reality, even though to-date we haven't seen any major drop off. It's just been more a concern that
there are concerns building, particularly outside the United States.
Ebola is out there. We've had issues in the past like SARS that have been much more impactful. I want to be clear,
we're not seeing that kind of impact in our numbers, but I would have it on the list of negative things. It's big enough to
be on the list, but probably at the bottom of the list relative to other effects that we've already highlighted on this call.
<Q - Naved A. Khan>: That's very helpful. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Kevin Kopelman with Cowen & Co. Your line is open.
<Q - Kevin C. Kopelman>: Hi, thanks a lot. Could you just give us an update on KAYAK, how that's performing as a
standalone business and how international expansion is going? Thanks.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yeah, why don't I – well, maybe I can answer this Dan, maybe you can chime in if
there's anything you want to add. I'd say the KAYAK, since the day we acquired it, has exceeded our expectations from
a profit standpoint. And I'm really proud of the work that Steve and his teams have done. I would say we're not as
aggressively investing. We certainly don't want to invest at a loss to build the KAYAK business. But we have done a
lot of experimentation and feel pretty good about the results, in particular, in Europe.
We've also expanded KAYAK very methodically into other languages, and we continue to want to see the brand grow
and be more successful, but in a very sustained fashion. The other area that I'm really proud of at KAYAK is the
product continues to improve. We get great accolades from the customers who use KAYAK, and the investments that
we're making there seem to be, at least from the data, seem to be paying off very well.
And we're still very optimistic that there's more that we can do with the KAYAK investment over time. But to-date, I
would say overall quite pleased and beyond our expectations, but look to see the effect of the various experiments that
are going on, and our ability to profitably roll this business out to more parts of the world.
<Q - Kevin C. Kopelman>: Thanks. And if I could just ask a follow-up on FX impact, you talked about having
hedging contracts in place that cover you for one quarter. Are those included in the Q4 EPS guidance? Thanks.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: They are, Kevin. So we take the contracts out right around the point where we are
reporting. And so, we're essentially hedged against any movements from FX from here forward for euro and pound.
<Q - Kevin C. Kopelman>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Ken Sena with Evercore Partners. Your line is open.
<Q - Ken Sena>: Hi, yeah. I was just wondering if you could update us maybe on the enterprise efforts in terms of
Buuteeq and Hotel Ninjas, and just what's the reception that you're seeing from suppliers at this point in terms of the
new products? And also their willingness to allow a demand channel to manage that for them? Thank you.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yeah. Thanks a lot, Ken. Overall, what we've done with those acquisitions is they are
– they become the cornerstone of what we call hotel marketing services. We continue to market Buuteeq as a website
quite successfully, but we've really been spending, let's call it this dark period, really architecting the products and
rethinking them to put together on what I would call a hotel marketing software stack, and it's something we haven't yet
launched. But we have been doing a bunch of testing, we've been doing many focus groups, talking to our property

partners and I would generally say that reception has been very positive.
The large majority of our partners are I would call in a lean-in mode. They like Booking.com in particular as a very
cost-efficient way to build demand and they're very receptive to us helping them with their direct websites and helping
them build demand. So to-date, yeah, very positive, experiments are going really well and I'm excited that we're getting
into it and the team's integration has been seamless and we hope to have further things to announce in 2015.
<Q - Ken Sena>: Great. Thanks.

Our next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brian, if your line is on mute, can you
please un-mute it?
<Q - Brian P. Fitzgerald>: Thanks. Wanted to drill down a little bit on OpenTable. Is the integration so far happening
as expected? Is the cadence as you expected? Any unique insights as you go through that process? And then I might
have missed it; could you comment on the ability to cross-sell that you're seeing so far from travelers into diners, do
you see it going the other way also? Thanks.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Okay. Well, thanks, Brian. So with regard to OpenTable, as you know the major
pillars of that integration are co-marketing, international expansion and Pay with OpenTable, which we highlighted at
the time of acquisition, were there's been a lot of planning that has gone into those. We're now in experiment. If you
looked hard enough, you'll see us co-marketing and promoting off of various tools within Booking.com. And we'll
expand that over time to other brands. International expansion, if you look carefully, you'll see we posted a number of
positions. We are now – our plans are complete and we look to expand the product to many other top cities around the
world.
So all of that, and Pay with OpenTable, we're expanding that to more cities around the United States and the pickup has
been very, very good. I would say, outside of those three pillars though, the biggest learnings have been in how much
we as a team can help OpenTable with their B2C efforts. So in a way, OpenTable was really built as a B2B software
play into restaurants. And they've had success in B2C, but they've only come very recently. And they've done some
great work to re-architect the B2C; this is their website basically for consumers. And it just is happening at the right
time, that they can learn a lot from the group on how to experiment and optimize and do various forms of marketing to
drive more and more diners to the OpenTable restaurants. And that's been a real positive and a ton of learnings have
gone back and forth and we've put a couple of folks now into OpenTable from Booking.com to help them with that
B2C side of the business.
I'd also say that their B2B competency, back to the previous question, is also assisting us in how we think about hotel
marketing services. They've had a tradition of selling in basically software annuity contracts into restaurants and
building relationships that were both B2B and B2C and that's something that we as a group have not had that
experience and we've really learned a lot from them on how to manage that and how to manage expectations around
how that delivers, and how to manage any inherent conflict in providing both software and B2C booking experiences.
So, to-date, I'd say, as we've highlighted, OpenTable financially has performed about where we thought it would
perform, if not maybe a little bit better than that. But really what I'm most excited about are the things that we're doing
to build a new, more exciting platform for OpenTable as part of the group looking forward into the future.

<Q - Ron Victor Josey>: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Two please. Wondering if you can give us an update
on how you're preparing for the spring/summer travel season in Asia and Latin America. Anything different this year as
those markets increasingly shift online? I think, Dan, you mentioned that things have recovered somewhat in Southeast
Asia. And then, the second one, second quarter in a row where we've seen sort of increased percentage of users who are
now logging in to Priceline. Wondering if this increase is due to mobile or something you're doing in the marketing
spend. Thank you.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Okay. Do you want to – Dan, do you want to take Asia a little bit and then I'll jump
into the account.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: Sure. So getting ready for spring and summer is just kind of normal operating procedure in
the business. It's going out and trying to make sure that we've got – we're constantly adding properties. And then for the
properties that we've got in our system, making sure we've got good availability, best prices for our customers. And
then, aggressively tapping into demand through variable channels at reasonable ROIs. And then when we bring the
traffic to our websites, having what we think is the best in market experience for our customers to make sure that we
convert that traffic into a booking.
<Q - Ron Victor Josey>: And Southeast Asia is completely is back online, to a certain extent, given the unrest in
Thailand?
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: I wouldn't say completely back online. We've said it improved to an extent, but still not
back where it was prior to the unrest there and martial law.
<A - Darren Richard Huston>: Yeah, I would say generally that Dan framed it well, that Southeast Asia is no longer
in the hole. But with the combination of everything that happened there, the burning of factories in Vietnam and of
course the two Malaysian air tragedies in particular have shaken a lot of confidence for a lot of travelers who are not
experienced travelers, maybe their first, second time out of the country. And but I – obviously time is what will heal
that, but I think that's also been part of the reason why you've seen such a pickup in North Asian travel, is that I think
for a lot of North Asians, right now it just feels a little bit more safe. But I'm really confident that over time obviously
these things will work their way through.
And your second question was just about, how do we get more logged in users? We're using various techniques. We
have tens of thousands of closed user group rates on the site that you have to be logged in to be able to see. You don't,
by the way, see these rates on any meta, you don't see them on Google and that's been a real asset to us to get people
logged in, because they basically say, log in to see lower rates. That's pretty compelling.
And but also I think, having an account allows you, as you had noted, to go across screen. So if you book on a PC,
having your account is what allows you're booking to show up on your mobile phone. It sounds like so simple, but it's
extremely powerful. Then you don't have to print off your confirmation. And also, I think logging in gives consumers
just more comfort that they're able to get to their stuff a lot easier.
The other thing is generally speaking, we've done a lot of work to make the creation of account and the maintenance of
an account have a lot less friction than it did in the past and I think that's been a big positive for all the brands, actually.
<Q - Ron Victor Josey>: Great. Thank you very much.
