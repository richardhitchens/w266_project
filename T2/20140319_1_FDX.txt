Frederick W. Smith
Thank you, Mickey. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our discussion of results for the third quarter of fiscal 2014.
First, I'd like to say that on behalf of more than 300,000 FedEx team members around the world, we are deeply
saddened by the disappearance of the Malaysian Airlines flight and extend our deepest concerns to the families and
friends of those aboard.
Now as we all know, historically severe winter weather has been a factor in all of our lives these last several months,
and it has significantly affected our third quarter earnings. In fact, it's been the toughest winter in which FedEx has ever
operated. We're very proud, however, of the FedEx team for delivering outstanding service despite the hardships posed
by severe weather during December's peak shipping season, when many team members volunteered to work on
Christmas Day, and then in January and February when it really got bad. So let's hope for spring.
Delivery metrics for this year's peak shipping season were among our best ever, I might note, thanks to the unique
FedEx culture based on our Purple Promise to make every FedEx experience outstanding. The FedEx strategy of
maintaining separate Ground and Express networks with multiple hubs proved to be especially important during the
season and an advantage for our customers during that severe weather and the peak shipping season. On days when the
weather was closer to normal seasonal conditions, our volumes were solid and service levels were high.
Despite the near-term impact of weather, the $1.6 billion profit improvement program at FedEx Express remains on
track. Our accelerated stock repurchase program, initiated in January, reflects our confidence in achieving our
ambitious financial goals.
A couple of points worth noting, FedEx Express next month is scheduled to formally open its North Asia-Pacific
regional hub at Kansai International Airport in Osaka, reaffirming our commitment to providing customers with greater
access to and from markets in Asia-Pacific, the Americas, and Europe. Express will be opening a new hub station and
call center in Mexico City in the coming weeks and recently reached a significant milestone in its European growth
initiative, which started in October 2011, and now has seen FedEx Express Europe opening its 100th new station in
Seville, Southern Spain.

I'd like to call your attention to two recent speeches on global trade and transportation that I gave for the company to
both air and ocean transport professionals. These two presentations are posted on the Investor Relations website, and I
think they'll give you a good view of our view of the overall market.
In closing, I'd like to congratulate the entire FedEx team for making FORTUNE'S World's Most Admired Companies
list once again. FedEx is ranked number eight overall and number one in the delivery industry.
Now let me turn the call over to Mike Glenn and Alan Graf.
T. Michael Glenn
Thank you, Fred. I'll give some brief comments regarding our economic outlook as well as our yield performance
during the quarter.
We expect economic growth to look better in calendar 2014 than in calendar 2013, though growth remains moderate
overall. Our U.S. GDP growth forecast is 2.6% for calendar 2014 and 3% for calendar 2015. For industrial production,
we expect growth of 3.4% in calendar 2014 and 3.7% in calendar 2015. On a global front, we expect growth of 2.8%
globally in calendar 2014 and 3.1% for calendar 2015.
Turning to yields, in the Express domestic segment, excluding the impact of fuel, year-over-year Express domestic
yield per package increased 1.9%. This increase was primarily driven by rate and discount improvement, followed by
weight per package and service mix.
In the Ground segment, yield per package increased 2.4% excluding the impact of fuel. The year-over-year increase
was driven by product mix, rate and discount improvement, and an increase in extra service charges. In the
International Export Express segment, excluding fuel, yields increased 1.7%, primarily due to a change in service mix.
In our FedEx Freight segment, excluding the impact of fuel, yield per hundredweight declined 1.9% year over year.
Rate and discount improved during the quarter and weight per shipment increased.
Overall, FedEx had a very strong peak season and I want to thank all of our team members for delivering on the Purple
Promise.
And now I'll turn it over to Alan Graf.
Alan B. Graf
Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Winter weather often negatively impacts our third quarter results, but
the impact of multiple severe storms during the third quarter of 2014 was more pronounced than usual reducing
earnings by an estimated $125 million versus last year. Our results for the third quarter also include a negative impact
of fuel. These headwinds were partially offset by the benefit across all of our transportation segments of one additional
operating day as well as reduced growth in salaries and benefits.
Revenues increased 3% to $11.3 billion primarily due to higher volumes at Ground and Freight, and as Mike
mentioned, yield increases at FedEx Ground. Express revenues were flat due to the negative impact of lower freight
revenue, lower fuel surcharges and as I mentioned, the unusually severe winter weather offset by a stronger base U.S.
and International Export Package business and one additional operating day. The demand shift from our priority
international services to our economy international services continued to negatively impact our results in the near-term.
Express operating income and operating margin increased due to stronger U.S. and International Export Package
business and lower pension expense, partially offset by the lower freight revenues, the estimated $70 million
year-over-year negative impact on operating income of winter weather, as well as higher depreciation expense. In
addition, operating income benefited from one additional operating day and the inclusion of costs associated with our
business realignment program in the prior-year results. Operating income also reflects a negative net impact on fuel.

Turning to our Ground segment, revenues increased 10% to $3 billion due to both volume and yield growth at Ground
and volume growth at SmartPost. In addition, revenues were negatively impacted by the severe winter weather and
were partially offset by one additional operating day. Average daily volume at Ground increased 8%, while SmartPost
volumes grew 2%. Ground segment operating income increased 2% to $477 million driven by the higher volumes and
yields. Operating income includes the estimated $40 million year-over-year negative impact of winter weather at
Ground.
In addition, the increase to operating income was partially offset by higher network expansion costs as we continue to
invest heavily in the growing FedEx Ground and FedEx SmartPost businesses, as well as the net negative impact of
fuel. The Ground segment results also benefited from the delayed start of the holiday shipping season this fiscal year
and one additional operating day. The decline on operating margin is primarily attributable to the negative impact of
the severe winter weather and the negative net impact of fuel.
At Freight, revenues increased 9% due to growth in average daily less-than-truckload shipments of 7%, as well as
weight per LTL shipment. In addition, the quarter was positively impacted by one more operating day, partially offset
by the negative impact of winter weather. Freight segment operating income and operating margin increased due to the
positive impacts, the higher average daily LTL shipments, higher LTL weight per shipment and greater utilization of
rail in the FedEx Freight Economy service offering. Fuel costs increased 3% due to higher average daily LTL
shipments. On March 3, Freight announced it will increase certain U.S. and other shipping rates by an average of 3.9%
on March 31.
As we look at our outlook, I should remind everyone that as of February 28, 2014, approximately 75% of the 3,600
employees accepting voluntary buyouts vacated their positions. The remaining 25% will depart by May 31, 2014. Our
third quarter results included benefit from the voluntary severance program, and additional benefits realized from our
voluntary severance program will continue as the fiscal year progresses. We expect earnings growth to continue in the
fourth quarter driven by ongoing improvements in the results of all of our transportation segments.
Our expected result for the fourth quarter will continue to be constrained by the low-end of moderate growth in the
global economy and continued challenges in the demand shift trends from our priority international services to our
economy international services at FedEx Express. We project earnings to be $2.25 to $2.50 per diluted share in the
fourth quarter and $6.55 to $6.80 per diluted share for fiscal 2014. We're reducing our full year earnings per share
guidance largely as a result of the weather impact in Q3 and the beginning of Q4. The outlook also assumes the market
outlook for fuel prices and continued moderate economic growth.
This outlook reflects share purchases made to-date but does not include any benefit from additional share purchases.
We do plan to continue purchasing shares under the program but at no specific timeframe for completion. As of
February 28, we have 15.2 million shares remaining under our current authorizations.
We continue to execute on the profit improvement programs we announced in October 2012. These activities are
focused primarily at Express and services. The majority of the benefits from our profit improvement programs will not
incur until fiscal 2015 and to a greater extent in fiscal 2016. Our ability to achieve the profit improvement target and
other benefits from these programs is dependent upon a number of factors including the health of the global economy
and future customer demand, particularly for our priority services which has not returned to the growth trends that we
assumed in October 2012 when we announced the profit improvement program.
Our economic outlook that Mike discussed, coupled with continued execution of our profit improvement programs at
Express and profit growth at Ground and Freight, earnings, returns and cash flows should all increase over the next
several years.
I too would like to thank all of our team members for their hard work and dedication during the severe bad weather the
past several months. Our service levels were outstanding and they are truly an amazing team.
Now we'll be happy to answer your questions.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Justin Yagerman, Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Hey. Good morning, guys. It's Rob Salmon on for Justin. I guess, Alan, going back to the
profit, $1.6 billion profit improvement plan at Express, could you give us a sense what the cost run rate was on that
profit improvement at the end of the fiscal third quarter, and how much you're expecting to see that ramp up in fiscal
2015 and 2016? If you could talk a little bit about some of the cost challenge you've got from the opening of the Osaka
hub looking out later this month?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Rob. I'll be happy to start the conversation and then I'll ask Dave to make some comments. I think
what I'm most pleased about our profit improvement program is our cost management, not just at Express but really
across all of FedEx Corporation. It's been an outstanding job. We're seeing a lot of traction. I'm pretty excited about
what we're going to deliver in 2015 and particularly towards the end of 2015 on our outgoing run rate. We are in our
business planning cycle right now for 2015, so I'll have a lot more to say about that in June when we tell you about the
end of our year and what we think 2015 is going to look like, but that is not only on track but probably ahead of plan.
As I alluded to in my opening comments, we are not seeing a strong international trade in global growth right now as
we had anticipated back in October of 2012, so we're going to have to continue to work very hard on right-sizing our
networks, as Dave is going to talk to you about here next, to match our new strategy which is to embrace International
Economy, and we're doing a good job there and we're going to really pick up a lot of traction on that in the next 12 to
18 months, so let me pass it to Dave.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Thanks, Alan. Thank you, Rob, for the question. We are having great success with our fleet
modernization. Our Boeing 777s are flying at well in excess of 99% plus reliability and service performance. Our new
767s are flying even greater than that in the high 99% range. We're very pleased with that. Obviously, the aircraft
maintenance fees and so forth are reflected in that because we have brand-new engines and new planes. So we're very
pleased with that.
We're pleased with the voluntary buyout at Express. It's actually more along the lines of 90% of our people have now
accepted the plan, even though corporately it's at 75%. And in the United States, if you look at our numbers there, you
saw the 1% decline in our salaries and wages and benefits line. That's in spite of the fact that we had the bad weather
and so forth. We're making tremendous progress there and really across the board in all of our five pillars for profit
improvement.
But on the issue of Osaka, that actually affects and improves our profit improvement for International. We're very
excited about that. I'll be there in April to do the ribbon cutting. We have a lot of customers that are joining us there. It
gives us a tremendous amount of flexibility on volume, increases or decreases, quite frankly, of a lot of flexibility to
move up and down in our change of gauge operations in Asia Pacific coming into the United States. So we're very
pleased that that's allowing us more flexibility.
We're also taking advantage of the underbelly capacity that's around the world and moving our deferred traffic in
several planes that are lower cost for us. So right across the board, we're executing our plans and we're very confident.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take our next question from Nate Brochmann, William Blair & Company.
<Q - Nate J. Brochmann>: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the question. Just want to talk a little bit.
Clearly there is a lot of network disruption both on the revenue and cost side during the quarter. Could you break that
down for us a little bit in terms of what was the revenue impact and what rebates you might've had to give back up if

there was any service disruptions over the holidays versus what's on the cost side? And as you talked about some of
those costs going into the next quarter, where you're seeing the biggest impact in trying to make adjustments there?
Thank you.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Nate, this is Alan. I'll start and I'll have the OpCo CEOs all comment on it. This was really
unprecedented winter weather. We had bad weather in fiscal 2011, but we're so much more advanced and so much
more productive today than we were back then. To have $125 million impact to us was really beyond the realm of
believable for almost all of us. Express, we estimate probably lost 40,000 packages a day for the quarter. Ground
probably lost 100,000 packages a day for the quarter. Obviously, we had a significant amount of overtime, deicing,
planes in the wrong place. We had a number of service disruptions that we had to declare.
But fortunately, because of the flexibility of our separate operating companies and the number of hubs that we have at
Express, we were really able to maintain an unbelievably high service level. And our customers were very excited
about that. We were open on Christmas. Henry will talk to about how he ran his hub seven days a week to meet
customers' demand and service levels. And so even though it was a big impact, we were very pleased with how well we
performed and we would have had an unbelievable quarter had it not been for the weather and the fuel headwinds. And
I'll let Dave add to that, and Henry.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Thanks, Alan. That's right. We showed an improvement of 14% this quarter year-over-year
and that, of course, we should have done much better than that if the $70 million of weather impact wouldn't have
impacted this quarter. But we ended up having the flexibility once again, although it cost us some money, to move
planes around and move customers' packages around. When Indianapolis got clobbered with weather and ice and snow,
we were able to move it to Memphis and vice versa, and Newark was the same.
So we weren't paralyzed with one hub that would be shut down over a long period of time. We were able to be more
flexible. Our customers have told us repeatedly how greatly they appreciated the fact that we were able to move their
packages around over the holiday peak and through January and February. And quite, frankly, it did cost us a little bit
more money and more overtime and more deicing, but I'm very, very proud of our team at Express. They did a
tremendous job.
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Hey, Nate. This is Henry Maier. FedEx Ground operates a highly engineered and automated
network that enables us to be faster and more reliable than the competition. A significant weather event therefore can
disrupt the precision of our network, driving increased costs. I think at last tally, I think we had 20 significant weather
events in the quarter.
While safety is always our top priority, if line-haul loads don't move due to unsafe conditions or road closures, our hubs
get behind, causing sort times to be extended. This puts the end-of-the-line stations behind, requiring them to work
more hours to recover.
As Alan said, while we plan to work seven days a week at peak, in the months of January and February we had a
weekend operation running somewhere every single weekend. So the impact of weather and fuel on our margin for the
quarter was roughly 1.5 points. But thanks to the incredible dedication and professionalism of FedEx Ground people,
we were able to provide safe and reliable service despite the worst weather we've seen in 40 years.
<A - William J. Logue>: This is Bill; on the Freight side, again, revenue up 9% for the quarter. It was an excellent
quarter for us from that perspective. It certainly was impacted on certain days by the weather. I would say the overall
impact was large on our operating income. Although we had a really good quarter, it was held back due to the impact of
the weather for sure.
On the line-haul side of it, particularly the rail side, we saw some good utilization of rail to help us work through these
winter challenges. That was a positive. And the front-line efficiencies, obviously, anytime you go through these
weather events, they really slow you down and impact you significantly on your cost structure. I would say, from my
perspective, the big challenge this winter was, it wasn't one big event here, one big event there; it was weekly. It was
always some event every week, which is very challenging to run a line-haul network when you have constant events
week to week. Overall, I think the team did a fabulous job of working through the situation.

Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ben Hartford of Baird.
<Q - Benjamin John Hartford>: Good morning. Alan, could you provide a little bit of context to the CapEx number
falling $200 million? We've got the flight schedule here. It looks like there's some shifting here in 2014. Can you talk
about the reduction in CapEx, what the source of that reduction here is for the fiscal year? And then can you provide
any context to the next couple years? I know it's early. I know you're in your budgeting process, but whether the $4
billion CapEx number over the next couple years is still the right number that we should be thinking about? Thanks.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Largely timing, and also we continue to scrub and purchase better and push things out. Again,
we're at the low end of the moderate economy growth. Frankly, as a CFO, I'd say it's slow, in my opinion. It's been the
weakest recovery from any recession ever for a lot of reasons, and so that's enabled us to delay some things.
But having said that, we still are committed to our refleeting at Express and our expansion at Ground. And I think if
you take note of our great improvement that we're having at Freight, we're very pleased with where that is and
expecting great things from them over the next couple years. So we'll probably stay in the pretty high range of $4
billion or so. And a lot of that will be determined by timing, whether a plane is delivered in May or June obviously can
impact that, but we don't have anything other than some pushing back and timing issues right now. We're still
committed to that. We need those 767s. Every time we get a 767 and it replaces an MD10, it's a $10 million annual
positive impact to the P&L despite the higher depreciation, so we're going to continue that.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Wetherbee of Citi.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Thanks, good morning. When you think about the total value of the profit improvement plan
relative to some of the progress you've made so far, which sounds like it's working in the right direction and doing well
relative to expectations, and then comparing that to the economic backdrop, which is maybe a little disappointing
relative to what you initially thought, does that change your thoughts and your ability to get that full $1.6 billion? I
guess I'm just trying to understand the puts and takes, both the short-term and longer-term, as you think about that total
number.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: I'll start and then I'll pass it over to Dave. We still are committed to having $1.6 billion profit
improvement as we exit fiscal 2016 going into 2017. We can still see it very clearly, but it's not the same way we
constructed it back in October 2012, no question about it. Fuel prices have been working against us. They could end up
being a benefit over the next couple years in terms of that timing. We've had some benefit from pension, and we'll see
where long-term interest rates go. But basically, as I said earlier, our cost programs are working exactly as designed, if
not better. Our productivity improvements are very good, although they were totally masked by the bad weather in Q3.
You'll see them in Q4. I think the range I gave you for Q4 is pretty heroic for us and that will give you an idea how
we'll be exiting FY 2014. Dave?
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Yes, Alan is right about all the expense initiatives. They're all performing exceptionally
well. We didn't put in, if you recall, in our $1.6 billion profit improvement very much incremental revenue. It was
mostly expense. The challenge for us is the base revenue, of course, so if the base revenue deteriorates, we'll have to
find more opportunities on expense. And that's the balancing act that Alan has mentioned several times and that we're
reviewing all the time. So yes, we are performing well in all the areas of our expenses. The global economy isn't what
we thought it would be, and so we're looking at other opportunities on expenses. Now that being said, if the global
economy gets a little bit better, it's all good news.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Group of Wolfe Research.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask about the Ground segment. First, on the
volume side, so last quarter there was the issue of Cyber Weekend pushed into this quarter, and we didn't see that show
up in better volumes this quarter. I know there's some weather here. But how should we think about Ground volumes
going forward? Can we get back to a double-digit volume growth rate, or is that unreasonable here? And then along the
same lines just on the Ground side, when do you think it's reasonable to think Ground margins turn positive year over
year again?
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Scott, this is Henry Maier. Let me talk for a minute about peak. The Ground segment
experienced record peak in terms of revenue, volume, and service. And despite certain challenges, including the
compressed calendar and weather, our on-time service for the month of December exceeded 99%, so we feel really
good about that. Some of the volume decline in the quarter was driven by the fact that customers worked shorter days
or were closed. We saw more customer closures in the quarter than we have in memory. Certainly in my 30-some-year
career in this business, I've never seen the number of major cities in the Midwest and East entirely shut down for a day
due to weather, and unfortunately we don't see that volume come back when things recover.
I think also Fred said in his release that on days where we had good weather, our volume performed exactly the way we
expected it to. When we didn't have good weather, we were off considerably from what we expected it to be. So I think
a lot of what you're seeing in the quarter is driven by this very severe weather situation we've had in the last quarter,
and I'll tell you that nobody more than the Ground team and the rest of the Express team are looking forward to spring
coming.
With respect to our margins, I can tell you that we expect margins in the mid-teens. As I've said before on this call,
there isn't anybody on the Ground team that would be satisfied with anything less.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter of Bank of America.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Great. Good morning. I just want to follow up on the cost side. I guess if you look at your
profit improvement plan and if you add the 1 point of impact to Express, you would've done a 3% margin ex the
weather. That's up about 70 basis points. In the first quarter you had a 50 basis points year-over-year. Second quarter is
a little murky given the Hurricane Sandy a year ago. So it doesn't seem like the benefits are accelerating to a very large
extent in terms of hanging in that 50, 70 basis-point improvement year-over-year. In order to try to get to your
double-digit margin target, I guess how much more of the profit improvement plan do you still have to execute on?
And can you still meet that 75% done by the end of next fiscal year target?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Ken, I will just tell you that not trying to time it anymore because of the changes that we've seen
in the course of our strategic change. I feel very good about how we'll be exiting FY 2015, although we're not done
with our business plan. And, as we look at where we're going to go, this is going to continue to build as we said. We
still have not exited all the people that we said we were, and Dave takes a very big burden in the services expenses.
Fuel has worked against us again this year, and it's a fairly significant number on an annual basis. And we're hopeful
that that will turn, because it should average out in the long run, and that should be also a benefit in the next couple
years; we'll have to see. But as I've said and as Fred said, we're still on track. We will be on pace by a year from now to
be pretty close to that number one an exit basis, not an average for the year but on an exit basis. Dave?
<A - David J. Bronczek>: That's right. The end of FY 2015 and by the end of FY 2016 is what we've always targeted.
Of course, the profit improvement includes the voluntary buyout and the fleet monetization. All those things start
building on each other and they accumulate. But one thing that has been a major drag for us this year has been fuel, the
net fuel. And they always reverse, but this year has been an incredibly difficult year for us on net fuel. And so when

you look at our expenses, it's masked in a big way. I mean we talked about weather this year in the third quarter. Well,
fuel dwarfs that for the FY 2014 year.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Also, one last thing, Ken. We are learning and doing a very good job of handling this very strong
growth in International Economy. We're getting our cost structure right there. That's going to take a little bit longer than
I might have anticipated in October of 2012, because frankly we didn't see how much the shift was going to be. IP is
still growing but at a low rate. International Economy is growing very strong and so as that continues to grow and we
continue to manage that cost structure that will also accelerate our profit improvement program.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Kelly Dougherty of Macquarie.
<Q - Kelly A. Dougherty>: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Fred, I just want to throw out a bigger picture question
to you, kind of the changing landscape with e-commerce. I'm sure you've heard about the suggestion that FedEx and
UPS can't be fast enough and nimble enough to meet the needs of some of these guys and they're more relying on
regional delivery companies. I just want to get your thoughts on that suggestion and then maybe what you may be
doing to adapt to some of those changes that e-commerce is obviously bringing despite your peaks, things like that?
<A - Frederick W. Smith>: Let me say couple of things on a broad scale and then I'm going to ask Mike Glenn if he
will comment about e-commerce overall. A couple of things that you've got to remember about e-commerce, in certain
ways it is back to the future. There was a very large business of catalog shopping a long time before there was
e-commerce. It's just the order entry system was a piece of paper or a telephone versus a mobile iPhone or a wonderful
app or excellent software by an e-commerce provider.
And the primary delivery mechanism for e-commerce or for catalog deliveries was in the past and it will remain for the
foreseeable future, the postal services around the world, because you are moving mostly lightweight items into
residences. And the challenges of moving lightweight items into residences are very formidable in terms of the cost
structure. So our operations in the residential sector we very carefully manage, and I think one of the reasons we've had
a great peak season is because Mike's sales and solutions group, run by Don Colleran, do a very good job of contracting
with our customers so that we don't over-promise or say we can do things that we end up not being able to do.
And when we launched FedEx Home Delivery, Henry was very involved in that, and you'll recall as well, it was
important that we had traffic demographics of a certain weight per package and certain revenues that made it profitable
from the get-go. So the real challenge about the e-commerce world is delivering those lightweight items to residences
and Amazon talks about this constantly, the postal service is getting a lot of business from various sources because of
e-commerce. And probably the biggest challenge is the fact that so much of the business comes in such a short period
of time.
And obviously, it is not possible to make these enormous capital investments for two or three weeks out of the year. So
I suspect that what you'll see on a go-forward basis is a bit of realism on the part of consumers and providers as to what
these infrastructures can provide, even the postal service, because remember the postal service is not geared up to
operate for just those two or three weeks either. So there'll be lots of innovative solutions in this regard.
One thing is very clear, and that is the information systems that the consumer-driven mobile society have today are
very, very important. You can't just drop a package for an e-commerce shipper into an anonymous hole and they're
going to be satisfied with it coming out sometime in an indefinite delivery window. They actively want to be a part of
that process, they want to know when it's shipped, they want to be able to redirect it to a location. This is an incredible
capability that we have and UPS also has, and it's going to become a bigger and bigger feature. So it's hard to see the
landscape as this thing rolls out, but we'll take a very disciplined approach in our presence in that business because you
can clearly go broke trying to deliver non-compensatory packages into people's homes. Mike?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Thank you, Fred. Let me just say e-commerce has a long runway of growth opportunity for
FedEx both domestically and internationally, and we're poised and well positioned to benefit from that. The range of

services that we have running from SameDay delivery in select markets to Home Delivery and SmartPost align
perfectly with the needs of e-commerce customers, and I can tell you based upon our discussions with small and large
e-commerce customers, there's certainly a need for the service and they appreciate the portfolio that we offer.
Regarding regional carriers, they have long played a role in this market segment and will continue to do so. Having said
that, they do not offer the same features and service that FedEx offers, and certainly, the same level of reliability that
FedEx offers. Regarding speed, let me just make the point that nobody operates faster networks than FedEx. So, we are
very comfortable with our ability to provide the flexibility that we need to meet the needs of e-commerce customers. I
think the point that Fred made that is critical for us though, is to be selective. You can go after a lot of e-commerce
volume and be pretty pleased with your year-over-year growth rates, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's going to fall
to the bottom line.
So, we have taken a very disciplined approach, and one of the things that we have to take into consideration is the
peaking factor. You can't, as Fred said, invest significant capital to operate three weeks to four weeks out of the year.
So when we're pursuing growth opportunities in e-commerce, we make sure that we have a proper balance between
growth in the 11 months of the year versus the growth in peak. So, we have a disciplined process but I can tell you that
nobody operates faster networks than we do, nobody has the breadth of services that we do to serve e-commerce, and
we're pleased with our position. And as I said, there's a long runway of growth opportunity for FedEx here.
<A - Frederick W. Smith>: I might just ask Rob Carter to comment on the incredible demands that consumers are
placing on carriers in the e-commerce sector.
<A - Rob B. Carter>: Well, not just consumers but the entire information ecosystem is so explosively growing around
this. As our volumes peak in our networks or information systems peak at an even greater rate, so when you watch this
technology, you can see the consumer interacting with the shipments at a far greater percentage than they ever did in
the past. They carry it with them in their pockets and on their tablets, so the shopping phenomenon is certainly a big
part of it, but also the tracking and accountability of that delivery is a big deal in today's consumer world and with the
technology that they're equipped with.
<A - Frederick W. Smith>: I'll just make one final comment and then hopefully we've answered the e-commerce
landscape question. One of the things that happened during the peak season this last time is there was a disconnect
between when the merchants in some cases were shipping the items, they in essence showed that they had been shipped
when they actually had not been tendered to the carriers. And of course if you don't have a possession scan or know
that you have it, that creates a lot of pressure and extra work on the part of our customer service folks, TechConnect in
our particular case. I think you'll see that very much change this go round and that will eliminate a lot of the, I think,
the angst that a lot of people had when they placed an order, they think it's underway, it actually hasn't been tendered to
a carrier. That gap is going to be closed and people will have a much better visibility of what's actually going on.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer.
<Q - Scott A. Schneeberger>: Thanks. Good morning. Shifting to FedEx and International, the 8% volume growth,
obviously very strong. We've seen it above double digits recently. Just curious, is that something that you see returning
to higher growth rate? Was there something regional moving around there? And then as a follow up, could you just
address the capacity issues in trans-Pacific? Any update there? Thank you.
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Yes. That's correct. We've been running double digits and of course it was 8% International
Economy and we feel strongly that, that will continue to grow. Don't forget, in the International export and Economy,
U.S. International is part of that International number and we did get some weather impacts into our volumes even in
U.S. International outbound. And to a certain degree from Asia back into the U.S., because of the plants being shut
down because of the weather back here in the U.S. We have a tremendous market share as you know, so we're very
bullish on International Economy. We've repositioned our network so we can move our more-lighter-weight deferred

traffic into the bellies of some of our partners now and leaving our very valuable, very fast, very reliable purple tail
fleet available for that higher yielding package.
<A - Frederick W. Smith>: This is Fred Smith. Let me make a comment here because I suggested that you read these
speeches we put up on our IR network. It's important to focus on the details of what we say in those speeches and not
just the top line. The reality is the express market continues to grow. The global express market continues to grow, and
we continue to take market share within the global express market. The sea container business continues to grow.
What's changed is the commodity air freight, the big consolidations going generally airport to airport. That cohort is
being squeezed from both the door-to-door express, which if it's very urgent and time critical moves on our priority
network, and the opening of the new Osaka hub will be terrific in that regard of giving us these unprecedented transit
times. And if customers are willing to take another couple of days in transit, same pickup and delivery, same IT
interface, customs clearance, and so forth, but that can be moved in these prolific underbellies.
And electronics – technology products are a very big part of the total air cargo market in its broadest sense, but many of
those products are much lighter weight today. The new products are not being introduced, so the type of door-to-door,
small shipments, light freight, and packages, is continuing to grow because the Internet in this perfect shopping
universe of everybody being connected to everybody else is creating this force field. That's why Mike Glenn said that
international e-commerce has a long runway. So it's important that you separate these market segments to be able to
correctly analyze the marketplaces that we're working in. And we're also in that sea freight and commodity air freight
business with FedEx Trade Networks. We can handle that too. But the growth area is basically the door-to-door
Express segment.
Operator
Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Jack Atkins of Stephens.
<Q - Jack Atkins>: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the time. I guess to focus my question, I'm curious if you could
maybe comment on what sort of abnormal weather impact, if any, that you're assuming for the fourth quarter guidance.
And could you maybe quantify the negative impact from fuel to consolidated operating income relative to your
expectations in the third quarter? Thank you.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: We didn't give any guidance on the third quarter, so I'll just say that our guidance for the year has
always anticipated that we would have some negative impact in fuel year over year, and that's about as far as we're
going to go on quantifying that. It's not a GAAP number. I'll just remind you that there is a lag time between when we
buy fuel and when we can surcharge fuel, and that means that there is an anomaly between and a disconnect between
year-over-year this year and year-over-year last year. In the long run, it should even out. That of course ignores the
elasticity of the fuel surcharge itself. But from a pure cost standpoint, it should average out. So we weren't surprised by
that, but we thought it was important to remind everybody that it did have a year-over-year impact.
Operator
Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Good morning. Alan, I know this is a quarter early really to talk about fiscal 2015.
You've already mentioned you haven't done the full planning. But I was wondering if perhaps you could provide a
broad comment. If I look at your guidance for fourth quarter, I believe you had versus an adjusted number; it's
something like 12% earnings growth year over year. If I look at the Street consensus for next year, fiscal 2015 implies
something like 28% growth. So clearly the Street is expecting some big acceleration I would think primarily in the cost
initiatives. Maybe there's a little implicit improvement in the economy. But I was just wondering if, given what you
broadly see, if you think that that's just an unrealistic ramp up in terms of what you would see coming in on the cost
side, or if you could offer any broader comment of expectations versus what you might see for fiscal 2015. Thank you.

<A - Alan B. Graf>: Tom, you're exactly right. It is too early to talk about FY 2015. And I really don't know what you
and others have in your FY 2015 number. I'm assuming that a lot of that EPS is from our accelerated share repurchase
program, which will have a very big positive impact to EPS next year, as we will be largely done by the end of this
fiscal year with maybe some to go in the first quarter of next. That will have a big impact. I think our run rate in terms
of our cost reduction programs, which you can see in Q4, will only improve from that. And I guess I'll just have to fill
in the blanks in June because we've got a lot of planning going on right here. We've got a lot of initiatives underway.
We've got some things that we want to do that probably won't pay off in FY 2015 but will towards the end of 2016 and
beyond that we're debating. So a lot of work to go and I look forward to having that conversation in June.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Art Hatfield, Raymond James.
<Q - Art W. Hatfield>: I was going to ask about 2015 too but I won't even try. Alan, if you could, I'm assuming your
fourth quarter guidance assumes the ice storm you had in Memphis the first week of March. Is there any way at this
point in time you can quantify what kind of impact that has on fourth quarter? And finally, can you tell us what the
diluted share count was at the end of Q3?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: I'm sorry I didn't answer that question earlier. It's just that at the very beginning of March, we just
had another one, and so we're not really used to that in the fourth quarter. It's probably not going to be significant but
it's going to have some impact and we're trying to assess that right now looking at the same methodology that we used
in Q3. It's okay to ask about 2015. I think that's what everybody's wanting. And like I said, we should have a good
show for you in June, Art. And that's about the best that I can say at this point.
<A - Frederick W. Smith>: Share count?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Oh, and the share count, yes, the share count for the three months ended in the quarter, average
diluted shares were 307 million versus 317 million a year ago. So obviously, what's happening in that share count is
that not only are we buying shares back but the increase in the stock price has brought back into the calculation
previously anti-dilutive options. There were 8 million of them a year ago. There were just a few of them this year, so
that's why there was only a few cent impact to the quarter of share buyback in Q3.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski of Barclays.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Good morning, everyone. I won't be the third in a row to ask about fiscal 2015. But
maybe the longer-term question for Fred or Mike, we obviously see that you guys delivered some pretty good service
results here for customers in the quarter even with all the challenges and the big peak. But what's the ability long term
to drive better price outcomes? Because obviously even adjusted, a 3% Express margin isn't the best return and I think
if you look at your cost improvement plan, obviously the targets are much higher from here. Is there anything structural
that can be done in this industry to extract a little bit more price for that service that you're going to offer?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: This is Mike. We make pricing decisions regarding the economic conditions to market
conditions and the value of the service that we provide and obviously that's a critical component of our
yield-management activities that we do on a week-in and week-out basis. The main issue is to make sure that it's not a
list-rate issue. The main issue is, as we work with customers, to make sure that we get an appropriate price for the value
of the service that we provide. A lot of factors go into that. Obviously the productivity of certain lanes and head-haul
versus back-haul in the Freight business, and how we utilize and configure networks in International, so it's not a
one-size-fits-all by any stretch of the imagination. It's in OpCo by OpCo, service-by-service plan that we work very
closely with the OpCos.

Having said that, I think our yield performance given the situation that we've been in, and the weak economy has been
quite solid. And it will be a continued focus area for us, yield improvement is an important part of our profit
improvement plans and one that we focus on on a regular basis. And I'm confident in our ability to execute that. Our
sales team does an outstanding job negotiating with our customers in making sure we get an appropriate yield for the
service that we provide and they'll continue to stay focused on that. But we have a very disciplined process around that
where we work with the OpCos week-in and week-out to manage our yields. But it's not a one-size-fits-all, and it will
continue to be a focus area for us.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Greene of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Hi, there. Good morning. Mike, I'm curious if you could elaborate on something that Fred said
earlier about e-commerce and being careful about growing some of the high-cost residential deliveries too quickly.
Does the UPS experience in December create an opportunity? Or is it more of kind of a lesson learned about what can
happen when you do grow that business too fast or don't have sort of the proper controls in place to measure it into a
network?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Well, we have enough to worry about at FedEx as opposed to commenting on issues that
UPS may have. But I can tell you that we take a very disciplined approach working with our customers and it's already
started for next peak, to make sure that we have a balance between the volume that we carry during non-peak versus the
volume that we carry in peak. One of the biggest challenges that you can have is over committing your resources
during peak season because that's a recipe for service failure.
I think one of the strategic advantages that we have is the two separate networks: Express versus Ground. And the hub
configuration that we have allows us to have more flexibility and manage our networks independently so we can make
commitments at Express, or make commitments at Ground that don't necessarily impact the other operating company.
So we work very closely with our customers. We make firm commitments about the traffic that we're going to carry for
them during peak and then obviously it's a daily dialogue with these customers during peak season. If we happen to
have excess capacity on the next two days or three days, we will work with customers and say we can take a little more
volume or we're going to have to stay at the level that we pre-negotiated.
So it's an art, it's not a science. There's a lot of science built into it, but when you actually get into the battle it becomes
an art and the flexibility in our networks and the outstanding job that our solutions team does in pre-planning peak is a
strategic advantage for us combined with the different operating networks. So, I think we've got a pretty good track
record of performing during peak season and delivering outstanding service for our customers, and I think if you were
to talk to our customers and based upon our performance during peak and our ability to meet the commitments that we
made to them, they would give us a very high score for this past peak season.
<A - Frederick W. Smith>: This is Fred Smith speaking here. I would make this comment. During the peak season,
there was a lot of press reports about the issue of e-commerce and so forth, and many times you would see that the
FedEx name up on the collar of the TV or in a story. The reality is by historical standards we had a terrific peak, and
the Express company just did a fantastic job measured relative to years past and I think the reason for that was the very
disciplined approach we take that Mike just talked to you about, the network design that we have and we just have this
incredible commitment to the Purple Promise like our volunteers out there on Christmas cleaning up anything that was
held up in the network because of weather and so forth.
I think the change this year is we live in a world where Twitter and social media make anecdotes much bigger than
perhaps they are and this whole phenomenon of e-commerce as people get better and better, mobile devices as Rob was
talking about where you can shop and monitor things coming in, that was the big difference from our standpoint. From
an operational standpoint, at the Christmas time we had a very, very good peak relative to years past. So we just plan to
continue on doing that and planning very carefully to make sure that we don't disappoint people and that we provide
that high level of service because at the end of the day that's the business. That's the franchise. So I just could not be

more proud of our folks and we were disappointed that we kept getting pinged with the big problem in e-commerce.
And I would top by saying one of the things for those of you who are interested in the e-commerce world, the
e-commerce world is growing very fast. And there are a lot of people trying to gear up and meet this demand. And
quite frankly, a lot of the processes that a lot of the e-commerce folks use have many quality issues with them. There
are packages that are fore-ordained to be damaged because they're not packed well. There are labels that are not affixed
to the packages very well. As I mentioned earlier, there are e-commerce shipment advices when the shipment actually
hasn't been tendered to the carrier.
I can promise you that the customers are not going to tolerate those types of things over the long haul. So the
e-commerce shippers that succeed long-term are going to be the ones that work with us and other folks to try to
improve those processes and the quality of their service because no one wants to order something over the Internet, get
it three days before Christmas and it's smashed or the label comes off of it and the package goes into the ether. So we're
working very carefully with our customers on these aspects as well, but it's a big part of the e-commerce business that
really didn't get enough publicity last year because they were an integral part of the problems even more than the
weather and the carrier performance.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Troy of Susquehanna Financial.
<Q - Matt L. Troy>: Thank you. Fred, in your comments on March 11 you made some pretty detailed remarks and
chose to isolate protectionalism as something that had been hampering world trade. I was wondering when you look at
that dashboard, what are the one or two key items you see coming down the pike that may, depending on how they
break either be favorable or unfavorable for FedEx specifically? And just more broadly long-term, how do you engage
to help steer some of these issues in a more pro-business way whether it's engaging on the political front or reallocating
capital? I just want to get a sense of your dialog and how you guys approach being part of more business-oriented
solutions? Thanks.
<A - Frederick W. Smith>: Well, first, let me just give the highest accolades to Ambassador, Michael Froman and the
U.S. TR team for the efforts that they have underway on multiple fronts. The WTO agreement on trade facilitation was
a great accomplishment. That was the first agreement that WTO in its long existence as ever concluded. So it was long
in nature, in other words, many of the trade improvements that were agreed upon by the signatories take forever to put
in place but at least there was an agreement. They had the transpacific partnership, they had the transatlantic initiative
underway and the trade and services initiative.
So the most important thing that we do are, as we were trying to do in those speeches is to point out to folks the great
benefits of world trade and expanding it. Because at the end of the day, increased prosperity comes from innovation,
investment and increased scale for your markets. And even a market as big as NAFTA is tiny in comparison to the
world population. So you've seen over the last few years partially because of lack of determined American political
leadership as it was this country that really pushed this thing from the beginning of World War II on and so we're stuck.
The Congress in the United States today is not willing, as was famously noted in the press by the Senate majority
leader, to even countenance taking up trade promotion authority. There's no way to consummate any of these trade
agreements without TPA because our negotiating partner simply will not seriously engage if they think that Congress is
going to renegotiate the agreement after the U.S. Trade Rep has concluded his work.
So we just tried every possible venue to push these things forward and the purpose of those two speeches in the main
was to talk to those two audiences about getting involved with this. Growth is low. Trade has gone from 2.5x world
GDP growth to roughly into parity. There's been no endeavor in human history that has lifted so many people out of
poverty than the opening up of world markets, particularly the United States leadership and opening up ours, often
permitting other countries to trade with us on a mercantilistic basis.

So hopefully, after the mid-term elections, the administration will turn to on this, the Congress will see the light. I think
it's particularly important to try to respond to the very strong position taken by the Prime Minister of Canada and the
President of Mexico that we need to negotiate NAFTA 2.0. That has been a fantastic success. We've seen trade between
the NAFTA countries go from $200-some-odd billion to over $1 trillion in the last 20 years. That's a lot of jobs. No
question there have been local pain here, there and the other place, but overall the opening up of these markets has been
very strong. So that's the concern I expressed in the speech on behalf of the company. That's our prescription for doing
it and I appreciate your giving me a chance to make these remarks to a sophisticated group like this because it's a big
issue.
