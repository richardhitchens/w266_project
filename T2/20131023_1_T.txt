MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the AT&T third quarter earnings release 2013
conference call. [Operator Instructions] Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be
given at that time. [Operator Instructions] Also, as a reminder, this teleconference is being recorded.
And at this time, I will turn the conference call over to your host, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, Ms.
Susan Johnson. Please go ahead.
Susan Johnson
Thank you, Tony. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome. It's great to have you with us today. I am Susan Johnson,
Head of Investor Relations for AT&T. Joining me on the call today is John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer.
John will provide an update with perspective on the quarter, then we'll follow with Q's and A's.
Let me remind you, our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website at
www.att.com\investor.relations. I also need to cover our Safe Harbor statement, which is on slide 2. This presentation
and comments may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks. Results may differ materially. Details
are in our SEC filings and on AT&T's website.
Before I turn the call over to John, let me cover our consolidated financial summary, which is on slide three.
Consolidated revenue was $32.2 billion, up 2.2% driven by continued Wireless growth, impressive U-verse gains and
rapid growth in strategic business services.
Reported EPS for the quarter was $0.72. That's up more than 14% over last year's third quarter. This includes $0.03
from the previously disclosed transfer of spectrum and $0.03 from income tax items. When you exclude these items,

earnings per share was $0.66, an increase of almost 6.5% year-over-year.
Cash flow continues to be strong. Cash from operating activities for the quarter totaled $9.2 billion, and free cash flow
was $3.2 billion and more than $11 billion year-to-date. Also, in the third quarter, we bought back about 55 million
shares for $1.9 billion and year-to-date, we have returned more than $18 billion to shareholders through dividends and
buybacks.
With that overview, I'll now turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens. John?
John J. Stephens
Thank you, Susan, and good afternoon everyone, and as always, thank you for your interest in AT&T. Let me start with
an overview on slide four.
There is a lot we really like about the quarter. We grew revenues and EPS, and cash generation continues to be robust.
But when you look at what's driving the business, the one thing that stands out is Project Velocity IP or Project VIP.
As you recall, we announced this plan just about a year ago. We said we would invest aggressively to expand our 4G
LTE footprint, that we'd expand our U-verse broadband reach and that we'd take fiber connectivity to a million new
business locations. Thanks to the great work of our network organization, we've made terrific progress on all of these
fronts, including having the nation's fastest and most reliable 4G LTE network, and you can see the positive results in
our third quarter results.
Our total Wireless subscribers increased by nearly one million and our Mobile data revenues grew nearly 18%.
Revenues from our strategic business services, including VPN, Ethernet, hosting and other advanced IP services posted
strong growth of nearly 16%. And the one thing that has me the most excited is the outstanding performance and future
potential of U-verse.
We reached 10 million total U-verse subscribers this quarter thanks to our best TV net gains in nearly five years and
record third quarter broadband sales. That's quite an achievement in this tough economy. This helped drive our first $1
billion U-verse revenue month ever. And that's growing at 28% year-over-year. This has been an incredible seven years
since we first introduced the service but Project VIP has allowed us to take this platform to a whole new level and we're
obviously excited about the road ahead as we build on the VIP platform to create a network that is increasingly
software-defined and video-centric.
With that in mind let me give you a quick update on the progress of Project VIP starting on slide five. Our Project VIP
initiative focused on expanding the growth platforms of our business. These include: expanding our 4G LTE to 300
million POPs by the end of 2014, executing on our spectrum and network quality initiatives, expanding our highly
successful U-verse services to 8.5 million new customer locations with high-speed broadband going to 57 million or
approximately 75% of our wireline customer locations while also bringing faster speeds and bringing fiber to one
million additional customer locations. We were going to get this done but at the same time we were going to move to
enhance our spectrum portfolio to meet the massive growth needs of our wireless data business today and into the
future.
Underlying all this we're strengthening in our financial structure and our balance sheet to give us the ability to invest
and maintain financial flexibility. Even though it hasn't been a full year since we first laid out our plans we are on track
or ahead of schedule with each of these initiatives.
Let me give you a build update on our wireless progress on slide six. Our 4G LTE build continues to exceed our
original expectations. We now reach nearly 250 million POPs. The performance of our network has been outstanding.
We have the nation's most reliable 4G LTE network according to our analysis of data from Nielsen, a well-known and
leading global information and measurement company. PC World and PC Magazine also said our speeds are the fastest.
And RootMetrics who studies national network performance in 125 cities said our overall call, data and text networks
ranks first or tied for first in 56 of the 78 cities studied to-date in the second half of this year.

At the same time, we have also made significant progress in our spectrum position. Last November we laid out a
carefully planned spectrum strategy that would help us meet our midterm needs. I'm pleased to say we have
successfully executed those plans. That includes the purchase of WCS spectrum, 700 MHz B Block and other recently
closed deals. And we've already placed into service a substantial part of the acquired 700 B Block spectrum. Along
with other pending transactions this gives us a strong runway for our LTE expansion as we look ahead to future FCC
auctions to address longer-term spectrum needs.
Our U-verse deployment is also well underway. Those details are on slide 7. We have increased our U-verse broadband
customer locations by about 2.5 million this year with about 1 million of those being video capable. Ultimately, all 8.5
million customer locations will be video enabled.
In the third quarter we also increased U-verse broadband speeds up to 45 megabits per second. We continue to roll out
new markets but we already offer those speeds in every region to almost two-thirds of our U-verse base and we're
moving forward with plans for speeds of 75 megabits per second and faster.
We've also begun deployment of 100% fiber broadband network in Austin, Texas that will deliver speeds up to 1
gigabit per second. And while all of this helped drive the strong U-verse sales for the third quarter, almost all our gross
adds in the third quarter came from non-Project VIP areas. This means that there's even more room for growth, more
opportunity, as we go forward with our VIP footprint.
On the business side, our fiber build to multi-tenant buildings now reaches about 200,000 new customer locations.
That's well on our way to reach our year-end target and our one million locations target by 2015.
We've also made tremendous progress with our financial objectives, let's turn to slide 8 for those details. We committed
to optimize our capital structure, while investing aggressively in our networks. I am pleased to report that we are on
target across-the-board.
First, we have moved to equalize our pension plan assets and liabilities for essentially a fully-funded pension plan. The
Department of Labor has published a proposed exemption for our voluntary contribution of our preferred equity interest
in our Wireless business and this, along with an expected increase in discount rates, would move us to essentially
fully-funded status with our pension plan by the end of this year.
We are very proud that we are one of the few companies that still provide a pension benefit and, with these moves, our
employees and retirees can have the confidence in knowing that these benefits are very well funded. At the same time,
we have also taken steps to help manage our healthcare costs, both for employees and retirees, and continuing to move
toward low premium, high value consumer driven plans.
We have also been focusing on finding efficiencies in financing our debt, and even though our total debt is up
year-over-year, our interest expense this year is down. Our average effective interest rate is down more than 60 basis
points per year, while the weighted average time to maturity of our portfolio has basically remained unchanged.
We've also been active in monetizing assets, which improves our cash position. The recent tower sale adds to our
financial strength and adds to the flexibility provided by earlier transactions. These moves help support our single-A
credit rating, the highest credit rating among U.S. based telecom companies, and the foundation for all of this, cash
flow, continues to be strong.
On top of our capital investment, we have continued our share repurchase program. To date, we have bought back 684
million shares with annualized future dividend savings of more than $1.2 billion per year. Combining share buybacks
with our dividend, we have already returned more than $18 billion to shareowners this year, more than $40 billion
returned since the beginning of 2012 and we're doing this while maintaining a best-in-class credit rating, a significant
achievement at a time of increased capital investment. That's a quick update on Project VIP.
Now let's turn to our operational performance, starting with Wireless, on slide 9. Data revenue continues to drive
Wireless revenue growth. Data is now a $22 billion annualized revenue stream, and it's growing at nearly 18% and it
has a lot of runway as customers continue to increase their data bundles. That helped drive 3.7% revenue growth –
service revenue growth this quarter, and total Wireless revenues were up more than 5% in the quarter.

Postpaid ARPU continues to be industry-leading. For the 19th consecutive quarter, we saw total postpaid ARPU
growth. That's a record unmatched in the industry, and our phone-only ARPU again increased by more than 3%. Our
phone-only ARPU includes smartphones, but also includes our lower ARPU feature phones and wireless home phones
as well, which makes the growth even more impressive.
We also had a very strong net add quarter. Those details are on slide 10. In fact, we added close to a million total subs
and versus the third quarter a year ago our postpaid net adds more than doubled. Our 363,000 postpaid gain in this
quarter included 178,000 new smartphone net adds. They're part of our overall 1.2 million new smartphone customers
which I will walk you through on the next slide. This was accomplished even though we did see some impact from
handset supply constraints.
We also lead the industry in postpaid tablet gains. Tablets continue to be a strong growth opportunity for us with strong
margins and much lower subsidies and the vast majority of tablets added in the quarter were LTE devices. While we
are positive on smartphone net adds we are seeing some pressure with our more price sensitive subscribers on low-end
2G feature phones. We continue to be excited about our pending acquisition of Leap Wireless that will allow us to
better compete in the prepaid space and we're continuing to move forward to an expected first quarter 2014 close.
Speaking of prepaid, it had its best performance in two years, and as many of you know, the migration of tablets to
postpaid plans has pressured this part of the business and we're still seeing that. But the introduction of LTE capable
GoPhones and new pricing plans has helped spur growth at the higher end of the prepaid space for customers interested
in usage-based pricing. When you add up the acquisitions on top of our organic growth, we added more than 1 million
retail postpaid and prepaid subscribers in the quarter.
Connected devices are also doing well as more businesses turn to us for productivity through machine to machine
solutions. Reseller revenues increased year-over-year. However, resale had a net loss of 285,000 subscribers primarily
due to losses in the low revenue 2G subscriber accounts. We're also seeing solid results in churn. Postpaid churn was
down slightly year-over-year and total churn fell both sequentially and year-over-year. Both are notable achievements
in this noisy, competitive environment.
Let's now talk about our smartphone growth which I mentioned earlier. Details are on slide 11. We continue to growth
our smartphone subscriber base both from new customers and from current feature phone subscribers upgrading to
smartphones. A record 89% of our postpaid phones sales were smartphones and we now have 75% of our postpaid
phone base on smartphones. We expect that percentage to keep growing. These are the premium subscribers in our
business. They have twice the ARPU of non-smartphone subscribers and much lower churn. And the average usage on
smartphones is continuing to grow at a rate more than 50% year-over-year. Smartphones set another third quarter sales
record of $6.7 million and we added 1.2 million new smartphone subscribers in the quarter.
We also continue to see subscribers moving to usage-based data plans. Overall, 72% of our smartphone base have
selected these plans and a growing number are choosing Mobile Share plans. We added more than 1 million new
Mobile Share accounts in the quarter to reach 5.3 million. These accounts include more than 16 million devices on
Mobile Share keeping us on a pace of about three subscribers per account. We continue to see strong take rates on
high-end data plans for both Mobile Share and tiered data customers. In the last year take rates on the high-end plans
have grown from 9% to 22% with 58% of the remaining on medium-sized data plans. So we've got a strong base but
we still have room to grow. We've announced earlier this month that all new customers will now be on Mobile Share
plans. Mobile Share plans have already been popular with new customers and we offer several different plans that will
best meet their needs.
Now let's take a look at margins on slide 12. Our Wireless EBITDA service margin was 42%. That does not include the
impact on the gains from the transfer of spectrum. We sold 600,000 more smartphones in the third quarter than the year
ago, and we had a third quarter record number of postpaid tablets as well. But even with this growth, our Wireless
EBITDA service margins expanded 40 basis points year-over-year.
Upgrades were far ahead of last year's pace and flat sequentially, and our upgrade rate for the quarter was 7.3%. The
upgrades continue to solidify our high-value customer base and move them to more efficient LTE phones. And with a

high level of upgrades, we have increased the number of subscribers under contract in the quarter.
These subscribers continue to bring long-term value including higher ARPU, lower churn and strong data growth and
increasing the number of LTE devices on our Network is driving greater network efficiency, as well as increasing data
usage. It is also moving customers off our 2G network, which eventually will allow us to repurpose that spectrum for
other uses. More than 40% of smartphone subscribers are now on 4G LTE devices.
These efficiencies were offset somewhat by costs associated with new product offerings, such as Digital Life and
expanding our prepaid Wireless offerings. We now offer Digital Life in more than 50 markets.
Looking ahead, we expect lower year-over-year upgrades in the fourth quarter as we start seeing the benefits from our
new 24-month upgrade model. Customers are also responding well to AT&T Next, as sales increased through the
quarter, and we are continued – we have continued to expand the program to additional channels.
The strength of our network is becoming a real selling factor for our Wireless business. We're seeing outstanding speed
and reliability performance, and greater efficiencies as more and more customers upgrade to LTE devices. Our
accelerated Project VIP LTE build and improved coverage add to this momentum.
Now let me turn to U-verse, and I would simply say that I don't think there is a better wireline growth story in the
industry than U-verse. Turn to slide 13 for those details. Strong revenue growth and record net adds are a compelling
combination, and when you add in expansion of our platform to millions more customer locations it's pretty easy to see
the runway for U-verse is very long.
We had several important U-verse milestones in the quarter. First, we reached ten million total U-verse subscribers,
more than doubling the number we had just two years ago. That includes high-speed broadband subscribers where we
had a third quarter record of 655,000 customers. Almost 60% of our broadband subscribers are now on this U-verse
platform.
We also had our second best U-verse TV net adds ever and the most in almost five years, which keeps us as the fastest
growing pay TV provider in the country. In fact, we now have more pay TV subscribers than any other telco. U-verse
revenues growth has been just as impressive and is the fastest growing part of our business.
We had our first $1 billion U-verse revenue month in the third quarter, and this 7-year-old start up is now a $12 billion
annualized revenue stream, growing at more than 28%. U-verse now represents 54% of total consumer revenues, which
grew 2.4% in the quarter. The record of success gives us even more confidence in Project VIP and the U-verse build
that goes with it.
Now let's move to wireline business, which you can see on slide 14. The broad outlines of our wireline business trends
continue what we've seen in recent quarters. Obviously, there's a challenging economic environment for business
services. At the same time we're seeing growth in productivity services like advanced data, the cloud and mobility. In
fact, as I mentioned earlier revenues from strategic business services were up almost 16% in the quarter and have
grown to almost a quarter of business wireline revenue. Our U-verse broadband is definitely making noise in the small
business space with record gains of nearly 100,000 new high-speed broadband customers in the third quarter. That's
quite an achievement in this tough economy.
One of our best business growth areas are integrated solutions that take advantage of our global network and mobility
strength. We had several key wins recently. For example, GE announced that it will connect its machines to the AT&T
network and cloud creating the first highly secure wireless communication network for GE's industrial internet.
Another recent win with Delta Air Lines will put over 19,000 mobile devices in the hands of flight personnel to help
personalize the in-flight experience for Delta's passengers.
These contracts highlight the importance of mobility and integrated IP networks. The majority of our larger business
customers also purchase wireless services from us. We think the integration of wireless and wireline services for our
business customers will be a big advantage going forward.

Now let's look at consolidated and wireline margins on slide 15. For the quarter, our reported consolidated operating
margin was 19.2%. This includes a 70 basis point benefit from the previously disclosed transfer of spectrum. On an
adjusted basis year-over-year margins were down. Margin pressure was largely due to record smartphones sales and
expenses related to Project VIP investments.
We told you a year ago that there would be pressure on wireline margins with Project VIP. We're seeing that this
quarter including success-based U-verse customer addition costs and trailing expenses from our capital spending. This
pressure was partially offset by growth in consumer revenues, operational improvements in network sales and support
functions and a solid execution of cost initiatives.
Now let's move to cash flow. Our summary is on slide 16. In the first nine months of the year, cash from operations
totaled $26.9 billion. Capital expenditures were $15.8 billion as Project VIP investing grows. And free cash flow before
dividends was more than $11 billion. In terms of uses of cash, total debt was stable in the third quarter with a debt to
capital ratio of 46.9% and a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.76. If you include the cash from the recently announced
transaction with Crown Castle our net debt to EBITDA ratio would drop to around 1.64.
We also continue to buy back shares. We repurchased about 55 million shares in the quarter for just under $2 billion.
With our dividend this makes our total return to shareholders year-to-date of more than $18 billion and more than $40
billion since the beginning of 2012. We continue to look for opportunities to improve our business.
We're working with regulators on our proposed acquisition of Leap Wireless and we continue to expect that deal will
close in the first quarter of 2014. And we expect to close our recently announced tower transaction before the end of the
year. As I mentioned earlier keeping a strong financial foundation is a priority for us. Our balance sheet is sound, our
debt metrics are solid and our strong cash flow gives us the flexibility to invest in growth initiatives while returning
substantial value to shareholders.
Now, before we take questions let me close with a quick recap of the highlights for the quarter. Those are on slide 17.
Project VIP network initiatives continue to move ahead of schedule. Revenue growth was solid, consolidated wireless
and consumer wireline. Consolidated wireless margins were stable even with pressure from strong smartphone sales
and Project VIP expenses, and EPS continues to grow.
A solid Wireless quarter was complemented by a tremendous performance by U-verse and when you add in strong
strategic business service results, our confidence in Project VIP growth platforms gets even stronger. We're looking
forward to finishing the year strong and building momentum as we move ahead.
With that, Susan, let's go ahead and take some questions.
Susan Johnson
Thank you, John. Tony, I think we're now ready to open it up for some questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question in queue will come from Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Philip Cusick>: Hey, guys. Thanks. John, I guess the first question is, how do you think about using the tower
proceeds? And the 1.64 you just mentioned, is that the way the rating agency looks at it given the sort of shifting
obligations?
<A - John J. Stephens>: It's a good question, Phil. First of all, I think the rating agencies will take into account the
lease commitment, and we're working through that with them for the stated first lease plus some level of renewals.
We're going through that process now. Don't have a certain number for how much they will. But I would expect it

would be somewhere in the 10-year to 15-year range of lease payments is what it seems to be approaching, which is
certainly less than half of the total proceeds. I know those are real general numbers, but, you're right, they will take
some of that into account. That's the first question.
The second question is with regard to what are we going to do the proceeds? I don't have a specific answer for you on
that. I think the – we're going to follow the same pattern we've had before: one, keep the dividend strong; two, keep
investing money in our networks to grow the business and to transform the business; three, keep financial flexibility.
We've been able to do all of that before we got these proceeds, so feel good about that.
The next issue is, then what do you do with the money afterwards? Do you pay down debt? Do you buy back shares?
Do you keep it for additional flexibility? We'll go through that evaluation. But I will tell you, we're going continue to
be opportunistic in buying back shares. I think we've shown that over the last year and a half, and that hasn't changed.
But we'll be careful and opportunistic with that.
<Q - Philip Cusick>: And if I may, just one other quick one. What have you seen from the last 30 days, in terms of the
impact of the government shutdown and sort of business decision-making, government decision-making? And how
should we think about that for the fourth quarter?
<A - John J. Stephens>: Yeah, Phil, it's an interesting question. First and foremost, from – directly from the business
that we get from the government, I wouldn't suggest to you that it's a significant or material amount in any way, there
has been some changes. There's certainly some usage changes and some adjustments in the amount that they were
using. So from that perspective, it's not material and not significant in any way.
From a overall perspective on just the business environment, the regulatory environment and now the instability of the
government environment, I think it affects all businesses, and we're seeing that our customers are being careful and
being prudent. Because of that, business investment in general has been slower and, as you can see in the employment
levels, employment may also be impacted. So I think it's much more of an indirect impact on us than a direct impact.
<Q - Philip Cusick>: Got it. Thanks, John.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Thanks a lot. John, you went through Project VIP in some detail and, obviously, some good
add results. Can you help us think through the trajectory of the wireline margin? When do you see the peak dilution
from some of this investment? Is this something that we're kind of close to bottoming? Or is there a few more quarters
of pressure? And, related to that, CapEx was up significantly. If you spent the same level in Q4, you'd be above your
21. Any sort of changes in the timing there? Or might you be a little bit higher than the 21? Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: So first and foremost, Simon, with regard to the CapEx spend, we are not trying to limit
CapEx spending by a standard compared to last year. We are trying to smooth it out and get into a normal course. So I
think we're on track for the guidance we provided and comfortable with that. But I will tell you that, the team that is
building our networks is keeping things moving very quickly and we are encouraging that activity in the sense that if
they can build it we're going to be supportive of it. We think that's really good for the customer and the services and the
company as a whole but I don't expect any variance from the guidance we've provided previously on CapEx.
Secondly, with regard to margins, I will tell you that the way the sales activity has gone and the way the build has gone
I would expect some continuing pressure because of success based customer cost and quite frankly trailing expense on
the build out of the U-verse base. And we're going to have build-out in the U-verse base certainly well into – certainly
throughout 2014 and into 2015 – certainly expected into 2015. So we'll see some continuing pressure. I don't mean to
suggest that it would be accelerating in any way but I don't expect us to get back to a higher level of normal margins for
at least another year. But I'm more than happy to pay for the success the team is having with regard to the customer

<Q - Simon Flannery>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Hey. Thanks, guys. Hey, John, over on the wireless side I've heard you guys say that you're
seeing pressure on the low end of the postpaid with some subscriber loss there. Is there any way one, you could maybe
trend that for us – how that's been trending or talk about anything you can do to address it or maybe even size the
exposure there? Because I think you guys have mentioned it before and I think it does give some focus. And then
related T-Mobile made some announcements today related to tablets. How do you guys think of that in terms of the
competitive environment? Is that another relatively small change or something that could be more meaningful?
<A - John J. Stephens>: Let me go with the first question. With regard to the wireless market overall it continues to be
competitive and there continues to be a lot of, as I mentioned in my comments, noise around what's going on. I think
the first thing to step back from is to realize that our churn was down year-over-year and total churn on a postpaid basis
the churn was down sequentially. So even with all this activity, our churn numbers are doing really well. I'd expect
them – we're hopeful to improve on that but we think the power of our network and the power of our customer service
is certainly helping that churn aspect. And that's the real measure of the business.
Secondly, I really want to point out, we are seeing some pressure in feature phones. We're seeing it from quite frankly
two perspectives. One, it's about close to 70% of our feature phone losses come to us as smartphones. If you see in the
quarter we added 1.2 million smartphones customers to our base but only 180,000 of those were new adds. The rest of
them were conversions basically from our existing feature phone base. So that's where the most of them came from. So
that's the pressure on those 2Gs. It's a lot of our customers are stepping up and effectively doubling their revenue with
us.
Now there are some customers who are really price-sensitive who are looking to others and we have come out with new
plans both in Mobile Share and in the tablet area to address those needs and try to give value on a reasonable basis to
those customers. So I view this as a normal competitive process and we're going to – with a great network, great
customer service we're going to be able to work through this very quickly. Lastly, when we get Leap closed in the first
quarter we'll have even another avenue, another methodology, another process really to put into our portfolio and to
challenge that low end side of the business.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from line of David Barden with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Please go ahead.
<Q - David W. Barden>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I want start off just by maybe taking that question
another step, John and just on the network conversation we're having today it's night and day. You guys have really
started to try to take ownership of that most reliable network position in the marketplace. But if you look at the
subscriber performance year-over-year this year versus two years ago, you aren't really seeing, I think, a commensurate
amount of market share that you're able to take from the rest of the marketplace with that ownership position of the
most high quality network in the market. Can you address how you want to try to monetize the increased capital
investment that you've been making in creating this network in terms of more than just converting existing customers
into smartphone customers but trying to make more of it in terms of share gains?
And I guess the second question if I could, just in terms of the Next program obviously getting people to take the Next
program is very value-accretive to the business both in terms of the absolute value that these guys pay you and also
from an accounting perspective you get better margins from that. Can you talk about what percentage of growth you're

seeing that are taking this program so we can think about how it's going having an impact positively on the fourth
quarter? Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Okay. Good questions. Let me comment on both the questions, right? First and foremost, I
would suggest to you that more than doubling our postpaid phone adds is something that I'm impressed by. I
understand your challenging of it, but I'm very pleased with it especially at the same time where we're growing the
prepaid market with regard to the GoPhone because of the challenges we've had there. When you add that performance
to some 100,000 connected device adds we are adding about one million customers to the network in the quarter. That's
very good and the reseller customers and we add, as we've said, were low revenue. We still grew reseller revenue in the
quarter even with the reduction in customers and they're mainly 2G type customers, which quite frankly, as everyone
knows, we're in the process of repurposing that spectrum anyway. So it's dealing with a situation we're going have to
deal with over the next few years.
So we are, if you will, recognizing the fact that there's been real improvement. We certainly are striving for further
improvement. When you get into the getting a return on the investments we're making, I would suggest it to you this
way: when you look at the total revenue growth of 5% you really bring that Next issue into the revenue story in the
sense of it is real economic revenue we're getting. And so our revenue growth when you take into account our both
service and equipment is now at a 5% level. But if you look more at just what you call the service revenue piece of it,
David, the story goes like this: First, we're growing smartphone penetration so we're getting more people on
smartphones. As they do that, they're using more data. That's where that key data growth of nearly 18% is. When you
look at that then we look at what they're buying and they're continuing to buy in high level data usage plans.
So we doubled the percentage of customers who are buying the 10-gig plans over the year, went from 9% to 22% of
that customer base on usage plans. If you think about that, that's just the start. There's a long way to go to add revenue
to the existing customers. When we complete the LTE build and we have this video-centric network out there on the
wireless base we expect to see continued growth. All of that is just on the existing customer base and then you move
forward with the things like Digital Life, like the connected car, like the additional prepaid business we will be
investing in. We're pretty excited and pretty confident in our ability to get really solid returns out of our investment.
<Q - David W. Barden>: All right. Thanks, John.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Joe Mastrogiovanni with Credit Suisse. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Joseph A. Mastrogiovanni>: Hi. Thanks. John, you mentioned that the competitive environment is getting a
little more aggressive. As we look over the next six to twelve months in wireless, how should we think about the
balance between subscriber growth and profitability and are you willing to except some pressure on the margins to
maintain or even pick up share if there's an opportunity with the new network quality metrics that you've been
showing?
<A - John J. Stephens>: Joe, I think good question. We're always interested in growth but we're always interested in
smart growth or profitable growth. We're not going to do anything to build one stat up at the cost of our shareholders
returns or investment. But yes, we're going to watch it very carefully.
The biggest change over the next six to nine months we'll see I think is the continued build out and completed build out
of our 4G LTE network because that's a big advantage for us. And two, it'll be our ability to close the Leap transaction
and use that Cricket brand and infrastructure to really take advantage of that marketplace in a different way, with
different capabilities than we have today. And that's a real positive for us.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Jason S. Armstrong>: Great. Thanks. Maybe a couple of questions. First, John, in relation to your comments on
– and you said this a couple times, the best credit rating amongst U.S. telcos. Is that merely sort of a statement of where
you are now? Or is that a commitment to maintaining this credit rating in the future? And I guess I'm getting at the
obvious question here, clearly there's an ability to add a lot of leverage. Verizon just proved that out, and you've
pointed to rather large opportunities for potential global M&A. So just trying to synch that up.
And then secondly, on U-verse, as you talk about the speeds, 45 megs and moving higher, just how quickly can you
sort of cover the footprint with these type of speeds? And has this started to change the market share momentum in
those markets at all? Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Great. Jason, let me take the second one first. We're – on the 45 megs we're out in all of the
regions today, two-thirds of the footprint today. And we're already seeing – not – it's still early with a 45 megs. But just
with U-verse platform, we're already seeing significant changes, improvements in churn and customer retention
capabilities. It's what's fueling the decision to invest not only in the capital, but also in the success-based expenses of
converting these customers to this U-verse platform. So we are already seeing that today. We expect, that with the 45
meg speeds become standard and, as we move even towards 75 or higher speeds, we think that just improves our
opportunity to be sticky, to lower churn and to retain the customers.
We're also seeing some good ARPU activity in the overall broadband segment that also gives us confidence. So we are
– two – with the direct question on 45 megs, two-thirds of our customer have that capability receiving today in
footprint. We're ramping that up and we're moving forward to go to toward 75. It's early to say a specific tied into the
45 megs, but what we've seen with the U-verse platform in total has been really positive.
With regard to the credit metrics, quite frankly, having the best credit rating and having a solid A is just the facts of
where we are today. We're very proud of that. We've committed back last week – or last year, when we did the VIP
announcement, that we were going to strive to stay at a single-A rating. We've done that and we've done that while
we're paying great dividends, while we're buying back shares and while we're making capital improvements. And so it's
worthy of note that we, if you will, did what we said we were going to do, and we continue to hold those ratings and
continue to have a lot of flexibility.
With regard to any transactions, I've got no comments. We've – there's been enough written and said about a variety of
M&A. There's nothing new to add there. Not – no comment with regard to any of that.
<Q - Jason S. Armstrong>: Okay. Thanks, John.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Michael Rollins with Citi Investments. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple, if I could. First, as you think about the
multi-year trajectory for the Wireless margins, what would you say the three key things are there, to deliver a better
margin? And especially in the context of the performance that you're looking for this year versus last year, where the
change maybe was a little bit more muted than maybe what the anticipation was at the beginning of the year?
And then just secondly, could you talk a little bit more about the evidence that you're seeing in terms of more usage
from the customers? You mentioned the tiers of rate plans that customers are on in terms of high versus mid for data
consumption plans. Is the upgrade rate of people going to more data usage driving a meaningful amount of that
Wireless service revenue growth yet? And is that something that you'd expect to continue to get better as we progress

each of the next number of quarters? Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Thanks, Mike. Let me kind of give you four items with regard to your first question, as
opposed to three. Because I think one, continuing the network efficiency that LTE provides and driving that efficiency
that LTE provides as we give our customers LTE devices, as we show you that efficiency and are able to groom our
networks, I think will be a real driver of margin expansion. I think as we continue to manage the subsidy side, not only
in educating the consumers about what these phones cost, not only getting value from a trade-in process and capturing
the economic value of the trade-ins that Next might do. But also getting fair pricing in the equipment side, I think will
drive our margins.
I think the data growth you just talked about is a real driver of revenue growth and it's a driver of revenue that doesn't
come with any of the normal billing, administrative, sales costs. It's existing customers getting more value by using
more and buying more from us.
And then the last thing is just a real focus – a management focus on efficiency and a management focus on streamlining
our cost structure. We've had that around here and under a One AT&T initiative and we're going to continue those
efforts. Those are the four things I think from a company perspective that really will drive continued progress in our
wireless margins.
On the data growth, definitely believe there's more opportunity for data growth. If you look at the $5.5 billion quarterly
revenue base or about a $22 billion annualized revenue stream, it's growing at nearly 18%. That is coming from having
this great network experience which enables people to use it more so they want to use it more. They're getting a better
experience so they're buying up.
As we mentioned, our usage-based plans – only 22% of them have high data buckets today on Mobile Share. That's
10-gig. On individual plans, that's 4-gigs. But we've seen that more than double over the last year. It was only 9% last
year – now it's 22%. That's a lot of runway to grow and so we feel really good about that. We think as these customers
have this good experience and continue to use it more, they're going to buy more gigs and be happy with it because of
the experience. So that's where we see the data growth.
I won't get into specifics about how much of the 5.1% growth related to that or how much of the buy up related to that,
but we're excited about the opportunity it provides.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Thanks for all those details.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Brett Feldman with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brett J. Feldman>: Thanks. I'm going to stick with the wireless margin theme. You mentioned Next, which you
launched during the quarter. You have new upgrade policies that are taking effect now. In light of all that, how should
we be sort of sizing the margin trend in wireless into the fourth quarter and along those lines what are the some of the
key inputs? In other words, what's your outlook for things like postpaid upgrade rates or overall smartphone sales
within the context of levels that we've seen in the past?
<A - John J. Stephens>: So, Brett, it's a good question. And obviously a lot of the comments you had will be parts of
the answer to the question. First and foremost we're not giving any specific guidance for the fourth quarter on those
margins but we're not changing our overall guidance for the year. And we're going to stick by the guidance we gave,
specifically on wireless margins, that we're going to grow margins year-over-year. So that will give you some
indication of what we expect in the fourth quarter.
Secondly, the push points you mentioned, the upgrade cycle going to 24 months tied to the contract is a policy now tied
to the contract, the Next improvement, this data revenue growth that we've seen, other efficiencies we put in not only
from the LTE network being more efficient but what we put in the cost structure. All of those things give us confidence
that we're going to be able to meet that year-over-year LTE objectives. So that's really how I think about it and why I

feel comfortable with standing by the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year.
<Q - Brett J. Feldman>: And do you have any initial color you can give us on the adoption rate of Next?
<A - John J. Stephens>: Yeah, we haven't been giving that publicly and quite frankly we're still pretty early in that.
And so as we get through a full upgrade cycle with the new device and plenty of supply on those devices and go
through a holiday season, we'll probably have a lot better insight. I'm not committing to release that data at that time but
I will tell you it's early in the process. We've been pleased and we think it's been a good customer experience where
they can capture the value of the trade-in phone, which is really the key to it. It's the economics that makes it makes
sense for both parties.
<Q - Brett J. Feldman>: Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question in queue will come from line of Jennifer Fritzsche with Wells Fargo. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Jennifer M. Fritzsche>: Great. Thank you. Thank you for taking the question.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Hi, Jennifer.
<Q - Jennifer M. Fritzsche>: Just a question on the Mobile Share plan. I think you said 72% of your smartphone base
is now under it. You have a year under your belt with this experience. Are these customers proving be stickier
customers? I would think so because your postpaid churn was lower than I was looking for.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Yeah, thanks, Jennifer. I think 72% of our smartphone customers are on usage-based plans.
So, Jennifer, that would be – include not only the Mobile Share but the tiered data. The Mobile Shares are about 16
million of our customers, it's about five million accounts, about three per account. But, yes, we are having good results
with those with regard to the plans, not only with smartphones, quite frankly, in general, on churn, on revenues and on
– and the quality of the customer experience. So while we don't publish those specific numbers, yes, we are having
good results with that. And we believe, as we've shown with some recent changes to the Mobile Share plan, it's an
appropriate way for us to move forward.
<Q - Jennifer M. Fritzsche>: Thanks, John.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Thank you.
<A - Susan Johnson>: I think we've got time for just one more question, Tony.
Operator
Thank you. And that question will come from line of Amir Rozwadowski with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Amir Rozwadowski>: Thank you very much for taking the question. John, it does seem as though you folks are
benefiting from your investment initiatives that you announced just under a year ago. I was wondering if you might be
able to provide us with some color on where you expect spending trajectory to go, perhaps beyond just the near-term,
because I know you addressed that in an earlier question? And if that has shifted, given the fact that you seem to be
ahead of plan with respect to your initial plans? And also, I was wondering if you could provide any color around the
supplier domain 2.0 initiative that you have seen, now that it's been unveiled and to the vendors? Because it does seem
that longer-term that initiative could provide some significant cost savings down line.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Right. Let me try to address your questions. I think we've said, in the past, that we would
expect the CapEx for this year to be in the $21 billion range and for 2014 and 2015 to be in the $20 billion range. And
at this time, we're not adjusting that or changing that. Once again, we're going to be very thoughtful about accelerating

any build programs and where we can do it efficiently, we'll do that.
I will tell you, that the one new issue or one issue that's coming up is, that we, with the Leap announcement and with
our ATNI purchase, we may have some additional capital requirements related to those. As we've said publicly, we'll
announce the financial implications, specifically of Leap, when we close the deal, which we expect to do in the first
quarter.
So we are not changing any of the guidance that we've talked about for the three year. Longer-term, we really do
believe that software-directed networks are an opportunity for us. We think it gives us an ability to not only improve
quality, but manage cost effectively and so we are excited about that. I think early results from that have been
encouraging, and the early results that our network team has been encouraging. But I don't want to suggest to you that
it's going to have an impact in the guidance that we've already given. I don't want to suggest – imply that we're going to
move away from that.

John J. Stephens
Now first let me close with a quick recap. We delivered strong EPS and strong revenue growth. We delivered solid
Wireless gains and terrific U-verse results in the quarter. We continue to make significant progress across our growth
platforms; Mobile Data, U-verse and Strategic Business Services; and our Project VIP expansion brings us even more
opportunity. Our momentum is solid, and we are setting the bar on network performance, which we believe leaves us
well positioned for future growth.
Once again, I'm very sincere in telling you, thank you for being on the call. We really do appreciate your interest in
AT&T, and have a good day.
