Don Thompson
Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. We began 2014 with our strategies and our business model sound and
intact. From a financial standpoint, our System's number one goal remains enduring profitable growth, which starts
with continuing to grow customer business and comparable sales.
From our diversified geographic portfolio that leverages the entrepreneurial power of local ownership, to the breadth of
our menu across dayparts and meal occasions, our strategies, infrastructure and investments support this goal. And
while we expect the market dynamics to remain similar to 2013, we do have experience effectively competing in
challenging operating environments and I remain confident in our ability to be successful at McDonald's.
Our global growth priorities are focused on ensuring that we remain relevant and appealing, so that more customers
will visit us more often. We're focused: on optimizing our menu, so that we offer our customers food and drinks that
have strong appeal; on modernizing the customer experience in our restaurants, so that that experience for each
customer is more memorable; and on broadening accessibility, so that we deliver unparalleled convenience.
The key to our growth lies in our ability to place the customer at the center of everything that we do. Over the past few
months, I've had the opportunity to visit our priority markets, the U.S., Germany, Japan and Australia, with Steve
Easterbrook, Pete Bensen and Tim Fenton. We focused on more deeply understanding how each of those markets are
adjusting their plans to address current challenges and adapt to the environment and to our customers' expectations.
There were four opportunities that were common to these markets and are being fortified in many other countries in
which we operate. First, we're strengthening our planning process to more effectively bridge consumer insights into the
right customer-centered plans and actions, while striking the right balance against our internal financial objectives.
Second, we're strengthening our marketing messaging to better resonate with customers and create stronger awareness.
Third, we're enhancing our affordability platforms to ensure our value offers are consistent and clearly messaged. We
want our customers to feel good about the value that they get when they visit us at McDonald's. And finally, we're more
effectively balancing our focus on the core menu, including the Big Mac, Egg McMuffin and our world-famous fries.
Our core products are familiar favorites for our customers. They truly represent McDonald's to all of our customers and
at about 40% of total sales, they are an incredible business asset for us that requires a constant drum beat of
communication.
Now, our Area of the World and local market teams are translating these learnings, along with specific market findings,
into comprehensive action plans to improve the customer experience. A good example is the recent changes made in
U.S. marketing to more directly align our marketing efforts with targeted consumer segments. I'll talk more about this
change and actions being taken in the other priority markets a little bit later.
It's important to underscore that it will take time for consumers to notice the changes and reward us with increased
visits. This is not about a silver bullet. Rather, it's about optimally sequencing multiple customer-focused initiatives and
executing them very well. While we expect results in these four markets to remain volatile in the near-term, we are
confident in our ability to improve over time.
Now, beyond our priority markets, we continue to pursue targeted growth initiatives that drive System-wide
performance. In addition to our ongoing emphasis on menu, these include brand extensions like McCafé beverages,
dessert kiosks and delivery. They include increasing our global footprint through new restaurant openings, in both
established and emerging markets, and by continuing to modernize our restaurants through reimagining. And also by
leveraging the investments that we've already made in the restaurants, particularly relative to restaurant technology, like
our Global Point of Sale platform and in-store wireless access, to support our digital efforts focused on engaging more
deeply with our customers and differentiating the McDonald's experience. Finally, in addition to market-level activities,
we're also evaluating opportunities to enhance shareholder value, while maintaining long-term financial strength. Now,
Pete will speak more about this area of focus in his comments.

Let me switch gears now and discuss global results. Year-to-date date in March, our global comparable sales increased
50 basis points, with positive performance in all segments except the U.S. Operating income was up 1% in constant
currencies and earnings per share was $1.21, a 2% decrease in constant currencies. Comparable guest counts for the
quarter continue to be negative. Our priority markets of the U.S., Germany, Japan and Australia drove that decline.
Comparable guest counts would have been positive excluding those markets. While recent signs indicate economies
may be stabilizing several of our major markets, the projections from the informal eating-out industry call for flat to
modest growth in 2014. With this as a backdrop, April global comparable sales are expected to be modestly positive.
Let's now move to performance by area of the world and address our priorities going forward. In the U.S., comparable
sales for the quarter were down 1.7% and operating income declined 3%, driven by negative guest counts, due in part
to severe winter weather. The U.S. is focused on strengthening the customer experience through better operations and
service execution, balanced focus between our core and new products and enhancing marketing effectiveness while
maximizing our opportunities to grow our breakfasts.
Because service is such a foundational element of the customer experience, we recognize the need to elevate our
service levels to ultimately build visits. During the first six months this year, our franchise and company-owned
restaurants are engaged in what we call a reset, which emphasizes the importance of proper staffing, scheduling and
positioning of crew to build restaurant capacity, particularly during peak hours.
Now earlier, I mentioned changes that have been made within our U.S. marketing group. We've adjusted our marketing
calendar so that we're introducing the appropriate number of new and promotional products. And we're better
sequencing them to maximize restaurant execution and the contribution of comparable sales. We're also looking to
harness the power of our marketing strength, especially in support of our core menu. We're focused on creating a
greater emotional connection between customers and our core products through our advertising and media spend.
Those things, combined with the fresh perspective of our new U.S. Chief Marketing Officer, these balanced menu
changes and focused media strategies will allow us to strengthen our appeal to customers by offering what they truly
want, great food and great service at an affordable price.
Finally, as the leader of the important and growing breakfast daypart, we'll continue to build on the strength of our
morning business. Today, customers choose McDonald's because of our great products, cooked in our restaurants in our
kitchens. We crack fresh eggs. We grill sausage and bacon. We bake biscuits and we toast muffins, all to serve up a
delicious breakfast that is accompanied by our outstanding McCafé Coffee. These things truly set us apart and position
us to continue growing this daypart into the future.
Now, moving over to Europe, comparable sales were up 1.4% for the quarter and operating income was up 4% in
constant currency. Positive comparable sales performance in the UK, France and Russia was partially offset by
Germany's negative results. While we're encouraged by positive comparable sales trends and recent economic
indicators that appear to be stabilizing in many markets across Europe, we remain cautious in the near-term, given a
tenuous operating environment.
Both the UK and Russia have successfully focused on growing breakfast while balancing the core menu with strong
promotional activity that is resonating with local customers. In France, successful marketing support for premium
products and limited-time offers along with a stronger affordability platform have contributed to the eighth consecutive
month of positive comparable sales growth amid a declining IEO industry.
Germany is one of the priority markets with persistent negative sales and guest count momentum. The new
management team is working to rebuild consumer trust through a more relevant and consistent affordability platform.
We've also adjusted our menu and marketing calendar to do a better job of connecting with customers by reducing and
better balancing our core menu favorites with new food and beverage offers.
Now let's shift to Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, where comparable sales were up 80 basis points for the quarter
and operating income decreased 2% in constant currencies. Solid comparable sales performance in China and many
other markets was somewhat offset by weakness in Japan and, to a lesser extent, Australia.

In China, comparable sales increased 6.6% for the quarter, partly reflecting the lap of the residual effects of consumer
sensitivity related to last year's supply chain issue in the chicken industry. China's ongoing focus on brand extensions
like delivery and dessert kiosks is strengthening our appeal as a convenient brand. Sales from our delivery business
continue to grow at a double-digit pace and while about 30% of the total restaurants in China offer delivery, these
restaurants are concentrated in our key cities and offer additional customer benefits such as minimum delivery times
and 24-hour service.
We continue to see significant growth potential throughout APMEA. In China, we plan to open about 300 new
restaurants this year. We also continue to accelerate our franchising efforts. About 15% of restaurants in China are
franchised as of the end of the quarter. And we are on track to achieve our near-term target of 20% to 25% franchise
restaurants.
In Australia, recent comparable sales are negative, due in part to the shift in timing of the Monopoly promotion this
year. The market is enhancing its affordability platform by adding new meal bundles to the loose change menu to
strengthen our value offer and remind customers that we have something for everyone.
Japan continues to experience negative comparable sales and guest count trends amid a highly competitive
environment. Looking ahead, Japan is focused on offering more relevant food and beverage choices, increasing the
focus on the family business and repositioning the affordability platform to rebuild our customer connection and
stabilize our performance. As we look forward, the market is also monitoring consumer reaction to the 3%
consumption tax increase that occurred on April 1.
Around the world, we're working hard to ensure our actions are driven by what customers want and need from us today
and tomorrow. As our business continues to generate significant levels of cash, our philosophy regarding the use of
cash remains unchanged. Our first priority is to reinvest in the business to capitalize on the sizable long-term growth
opportunities that exist. And after reinvesting in the business, we're committed to returning all of our free cash flow to
shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. In the first quarter, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders
through dividends and share repurchases combined.
I want to close by reemphasizing my confidence in McDonald's future. Approximately 70 million customers per day
across a geographically-diverse portfolio of over 35,000 restaurants is a very strong foundation from which we operate.
Our infrastructure and our fundamentals are sound. We're leveraging the power of our proven business model, our
investments in restaurant capabilities and modernization and our hard-earned competitive advantages to pursue the
sizable opportunities that are before us. At the same time, we're thoughtfully evolving our approach to remain relevant,
making appropriate adjustments to navigate near-term challenges, while driving enduring profitable growth for our
System and for our shareholders over the long-term.
Things, again, everyone, and I'll now turn it over to Pete.
Peter Bensen
Thanks, Don, and hello, everyone. The McDonald's System entered the year with a realistic view of our near-term
opportunities, yet a firm focus on our path to long-term success. We are diligently managing those things within our
control, while continuing to position the McDonald's System for future growth. The battle for market share is expected
to persist, given projections for flat to modest category growth in our major markets this year, but over the long-term,
the $1.2 trillion global informal eating out category should grow more significantly. And I expect McDonald's to fully
participate in that growth.
One of the reasons I'm confident in McDonald's future is the strong base off of which we operate. First quarter results
were in line with our expectations and highlighted the resiliency of our System and financial model. Though top-line
growth was challenged, McDonald's generated $1.9 billion of operating income. This is an impressive number, but I'm
even more encouraged by the significant long-term opportunities we see to drive future growth.

Turning to first quarter performance, we are primarily a franchisor, with 81% of our global restaurants franchised. As
such, our profitability is driven primarily by top-line performance. Modest comparable sales growth, combined with
higher expenses and lower gains from sales of restaurants, contributed to a 60 basis point decline in our combined
operating margin to 28.9% through March. The largest component of operating income is our franchise margins,
representing approximately 70% of total restaurant margin dollars.
Franchise margins, which are driven by a relatively steady and predictable stream of rent and royalties, grew to
approximately $1.8 billion in the first quarter, a 3% constant currency increase, driven primarily by expansion. The
consolidated franchise margin percent decreased 60 basis points to 81.1%, highlighting the need for stronger
comparable sales gains to offset increased expenses and maintain this margin percent. Global Company-operated
margin dollars grew to $723 million, while the margin percent decreased 10 basis points to 16.1%, due to higher labor,
commodity and occupancy costs, which were offset by positive comparable sales.
In the U.S., Company-operated margins decreased 10 basis points to 17.3%, as the positive impact from higher average
check, primarily driven by pricing, was offset by negative guest counts and higher commodity and crew labor costs.
First quarter commodity cost in the U.S. rose nearly 3%, driven primarily by higher protein costs. We expect similar
pressure in second quarter, then easing throughout the second half of the year. The full-year outlook for the U.S.
grocery basket remains a 1% to 2% increase.
At the end of March, the price increase in the U.S. was about 3% higher versus a year ago. While the
food-away-from-home inflation index is 2.3% through March, it is projected to be up 2.5% to 3.5% for the full year. In
addition, we have seen more significant increases over the past two months in food-at-home inflation, which is also
projected to increase 2.5% to 3.5% for the full year. We watch these indices closely, yet are also mindful of cost
pressures, not only in 2014, but next year as well, when making our pricing decisions.
Turning to Europe, Company-operated margins increased 30 basis points to 17%, as strong performance in France and
the U.K. was partially offset by higher commodity costs in Russia, due to the impact of the weaker Russian ruble on
import costs. Europe's grocery bill was relatively flat in the first quarter and we expect more pressure in the second half
of the year, with the full-year increase still projected at 1% to 2%. And across Europe, the average menu price increase,
excluding Russia, is about 2%.
In Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa, Company-operated margins declined 60 basis points to 14%, as positive
comparable sales were offset by higher labor, occupancy and other costs. While the margin percent grew in several
markets, including China and Australia, refranchising in Australia and the weaker Australian dollar negatively
impacted the segment's overall margin percentage. In addition, the new restaurant openings, primarily in China,
contributed to the lower margin percent, though to a lesser extent than in 2013.
G&A for the quarter increased 4% in constant currencies. Over half of this increase was due to our sponsorship of the
Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games in Sochi. We expect to experience a more significant G&A increase next
quarter, due to our worldwide convention and costs related to other initiatives, such as restaurant growth, capacity
enhancements and our digital capabilities. First quarter effective tax rate was 32.4%. It represented a significant
increase versus the prior-year rate of 30.1%, which was aided by a tax benefit of nearly $50 million. We continue to
project the 2014 full-year rate to be between 31% and 33%.
We remain committed to investing in our business to drive future growth and returns. We allocate capital in a
disciplined, measured way, opening new units across a diversified portfolio of markets, while making prudent
investments in existing restaurants. We are on track to open 1,500 to 1,600 new restaurants this year, including about
500 in affiliated and developmental licensee markets. We also expect to reimage over 1,000 existing restaurants. The
rollout of the new kitchen equipment in the U.S. is progressing nicely and we are on track to have it installed in all
restaurants by mid-year.
As I discussed at a couple of investor conferences last month, we are moving with more urgency to address recent
financial performance in our priority markets. In addition to these efforts, which Don covered, we are actively looking
at ways to improve shareholder returns by: optimizing our capital structure, while maintaining our long-term financial

strength; optimizing our ownership structure, including certain refranchising activities, especially in markets outside of
the U.S.; and scrutinizing ongoing G&A, while appropriately supporting our franchisees and our growth initiatives.
As I said at the conferences, these additional areas of focus do not represent a change in strategy or financial
philosophy. They fit squarely within our business model. We are not beginning with a given target in any of these
areas, but instead, are evaluating them with the ultimate screen of creating value by doing what is right for the business
over the long-term. Financial discipline has been a cornerstone of the Plan to Win and that certainly will continue,
because I believe a strong financial foundation is a critical component to building enduring profitable growth. It's
premature to comment on any specifics, but we expect to provide an update on our progress over the next couple of
months.
Lastly, let me touch on foreign currency translation, which negatively impacted first quarter results by $0.03. At current
rates, including the stronger euro, we expect second quarter EPS to be minimally impacted, with a full-year negative
impact of about $0.03 to $0.04. As usual, this is directional guidance only, because I know rates will change as we
move throughout the year.
In closing, I am confident in our fundamental business model and our competitive position. We're the global leader in a
$1.2 trillion industry, yet have less than 8% market share, providing significant opportunity for future growth.
Our geographically-diversified portfolio and various ownership structures allow us to optimize our investments within
a market. We are aligned with our outstanding owner/operators and suppliers to leverage our distinct competitive
advantages. And we are making strategic investments today to seize those opportunities to create long-term value for
customers, shareholders and the entire McDonald's System.
Thanks. Now, I'll turn it to Kathy to begin our Q&A.
Kathy H. Martin
Thanks, Pete. We're going to open the call now for analyst and investor questions.
Q&A
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: [Operator Instructions] So our first question is from Joe Buckley of Bank of America Merrill
Lynch
<Q - Joseph T. Buckley>: Thank you. Could you give us a little bit more color on the U.S. kitchen assembly prep
tables, maybe how many stores have them currently? And I know you said you expected the rollout to be complete by
mid-year, but also, in addition to the number, just what you've learned so far in terms of speed of service or greater
product assortment or variety?
<A - Don Thompson>: Hey, Joe, this is Don. Just a little bit on the prep tables, the high-density prep tables, and I
think that's what you're talking about relative to the kitchen changes in the U.S., are really, they're a key enabler for the
future menu. And the reason that they are is that they give us a few things we don't have today, one of those things
being room to add new ingredients, another being the chilled rail, which enables us to include fresh ingredients. It also
helps us relative to the way that the kitchens are structured, so that we have a mirror image of condiments on both sides
of the preparation table and we won't have to ergonomically, you won't have to reach across the table for our crew to be
able to prepare some of our food, our sandwiches and our products.
These things together really help support our future vision of the menu and that doesn't necessarily mean that we're
going to add a lot of things, but what it does mean is it gives us the capability to optimize some of the products we have
and it gives us the flexibility to have some new toppings that will help us be able to customize some of the food
products we have. The U.S. is on track to meet its completion goal by mid-year and it's going quite well.

In addition to that, Joe, the other thing that the U.S. is doing now, and I mentioned it in my comments, is what we call
reset, which is focusing back on staffing and scheduling and positioning. This is really, really critical, because, at this
point in time and with the volumes that we have in the restaurant, we want to make sure that we can handle the peak
hour capacities that hit the restaurants. And so, a combination of those things, with the way that we're rationalizing the
menu to make sure we're not implementing too many new products, with a better balance of focusing on the core and
the new products, those things all together are really what this major focus in the U.S. is right now. And it's kind of a
back to the basics with some enhancements in terms of our productivity and capability in the restaurants.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Our next question is from Brian Bittner from Oppenheimer
<Q - Brian J. Bittner>: Thank you. It just feels like the biggest opportunity here in the near-term is Europe. It's 40%
of profit contribution, very similar to the U.S. and operating profit did decline in the U.S. and APMEA, but it was
positive 6% in Europe. And I think this was despite your largest European market, Germany, being negative. And so
just focus on Germany for a second, to tell us really what you think is going on that can help turn around some of those
self-inflicted wounds in that country and really I just feel as though if Germany gets turned, Europe can really
accelerate from here and, therefore, the profits of the company can really accelerate from here. So if you could just
focus on Germany for a moment, that would be helpful.
<A - Don Thompson>: Absolutely, Brian, so a couple of things in a broader set, as we talked about the key priority
markets and I mentioned some of the things that we saw relative to commonalities. And those things really are what I
would consider to be a translation of consumer insights into the action plans very strong and making sure that we're not
trying to merely drive profitability on the end, but we're focused on customers and the insights around customers. There
are several things relative to Germany. And these things are being addressed now by the leadership team that's there.
One is Germany is a very price-sensitive market. And if we look at our performance, we have a couple of main issues,
one being our core EVM movement and, from a competitive perspective, actually, the bakeries in Germany are doing
quite well. What customers have mentioned to us is that there's several things that we need to focus on. One is to
reestablish our relevance, because our menu boards have gotten a little bit out of whack. What I mean by that, we've
implemented a lot of new products, similar to some of the implementations in the U.S. system, and it really has
confused customers to a certain extent.
The other thing has to do with our pricing and our strategic relationship on the menu board. And this basically is the
relationship between the value-based components and the rest of the limited-time offers and the core EVMs. And we've
got to make sure that that is a much more rational and strategic pricing structure. Our teams are working on that.
And lastly, it's the balancing of marketing. And that is the balance between our core menu that I talked about with Big
Macs, Royales or Quarters, fries, how we leverage and talk about those things, along with value, along with
limited-time offers, like the [indiscernible] (29:40) products in Germany. And so the combination of having a
consistent balance there, with having a consistent messaging around affordability and also making sure that we
reestablish the relevance, particularly with the offers we convey via our menu boards and marketing, are the things the
market is focused on.
As we're having our session in Germany, it's clear that the new leadership team that we have in place there is focused
on these things. We also had a chance to meet with the franchisees in Germany. They are very understanding of the
situation that we're in there. And, frankly, one of the things that galvanizes the McDonald's System is when you have
poor performance and it impacts cash flow. And I know that our franchisees, along with our company team there and it
is a new team, are all focused on improving the situation there and improving our aggressiveness in the marketplace.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Next question is from John Glass from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - John S. Glass>: Thanks. Pete, when you talked about optimizing the business model a little more, can you – of
the three big buckets you've outlined, which do you think is going to have the biggest impact or potentially the biggest
impact to shareholder returns? Can you talk about how you plan to convey this information? Is it next quarter or is it
intra-quarter? And is this the whole plan or is it just kind of an update and we'll get a lot of these updates along the
way?

<A - Peter Bensen>: Good question, John. I think you have to take – the three levers that I mentioned, you really have
to take those in combination with what Don said in his comments about the focus on the four priority markets. So
taking all of that together is really – the combination of all of that is what's going to drive the value over the long-term
for shareholders and the system, not any one of those items in isolation.
And as Don mentioned, to turn the sales trend lines in those big markets is going to take a little bit of time. And so as
we look at what else is there within our business model that in the meantime we can do to be accretive to value, looking
at opportunities on the balance sheet. As we've said, though, we want to maintain that A rating. That's been a
cornerstone of our business model over the last 50-plus years and is an important piece of our financial strength and
flexibility.
Re-franchising, at 81% franchised, obviously, that's our primary method of doing business. While we've done
re-franchising over the last couple of years, we think there's opportunities to accelerate that. And so of the financial
levers, that's probably the one that has the most opportunity to drive value. And that, by its nature, is going to be a
multi-year plan. When we talk about the details, it's going to be a multi-year plan and it's really primarily focused
outside the U.S. But it's also prudent for us to take a look at our G&A spend, especially as we know there are growth
opportunities in areas like digital, where we want to allocate more funds. And rather than have all of that be
incremental, we're looking for ways to reallocate, so that we can finance those and live within a certain G&A envelope.
So you can expect to hear from us by the end of the second quarter. And I think what you'd expect to hear is something
broadly that covers kind of all of those areas and not just one or two of the specifics.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Next question is from Jeff Farmer from Wells Fargo.
<Q - Jeff D. Farmer>: Great, thanks. Good morning. What are the opportunities you see at breakfast? Have you
increasingly focused on that daypart as a potential same-store sales driver? Seems like it's been – the attention there's
been upped a little bit here recently.
<A - Don Thompson>: Thanks, Jeff. First of all, relative to breakfast, I mentioned in my comments, customers choose
breakfast at McDonald's because our breakfast tastes great. It has very, very high consumer scores, freshly prepared
products. Every morning, as I mentioned, we actually crack eggs. We cook in our restaurants. This is not a microwave
deal. We actually cook. We have grills and fryers and ovens. And so that's the reason that we're able to prepare
breakfast.
The other thing is our breakfast model is also focused on how we serve up that breakfast quickly to customers that are
on the go. And so we continue to focus on those areas of strength that we have. We've been serving breakfast now for
over 30 years and it is one of our strongest day parts, clearly, clearly one of the strongest from a profitability
perspective, the strongest. And so we'll continue to focus on our breakfast opportunities.
The U.S. is focused today primarily on breakfast via coffee and then our handheld sandwiches that we have at breakfast
and also on some of the quality and freshness cues that I've just talked about. And so those things we'll continue to
focus on, continue to focus on the operational opportunities we have there and the staffing and the scheduling and
positioning at breakfast, as well.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Next question is from David Tarantino from Baird.
<Q - David E. Tarantino>: Hi. Good morning. Just one quick clarification on the last question and then a separate
question, first, on the breakfast sort of initiative or focus there, is that being done in response to this competitive
activity, for example, the Taco Bell launch and maybe could you comment on whether that's having an impact on your
business or not? And then the second question comes back to the focus on the reset initiative in the U.S. And it sounds
like maybe some of the initiative there is focused on better handling the complexity, but one of the things that you
haven't talked about is whether you'd be interested in reducing some of the menu complexity to sort of fine tune the
operations and whether or not that's an opportunity. So perhaps, could you comment on that, as well? Thanks.

<A - Don Thompson>: Thanks, David. Just a couple of points, one is, there has been breakfast competition for a
number of years in the U.S. market. We've had some of our major competitors that have made runs at breakfast. And it
seems every year, there's someone new that is making a run. And none of them have really stopped their focus on
breakfast, whether that be the closer-in competitors or if they're sandwich shops, or it that's taco shops or anything else.
Everyone has an opportunity and they wanted to look at breakfast. We have not seen an impact relative to the most
recent competitors that entered the space. One of the things that happens at breakfast if anyone enters, customers will
try the breakfast. It's new. It'll be something that they've not seen in the marketplace, so we expect customers to try it.
But what we also are confident in is our ability to execute at breakfast with, again, the things that I mentioned relative
to being a restaurant that cooks and we have a delivery service that is capable of satisfying the time needs, if you
would, of consumers.
I think that new entrants into the market always bring a different level of attention to breakfast, which, in many cases,
supports us. Our breakfast continues to be a positive driver in our business in the U.S. And actually, sometimes, when
these entrants come in, it forces us to focus even more on being aggressive relative to breakfast. I know you've just
recently seen the coffee execution in the U.S. and our free coffee offers, which really are about supporting our
breakfasts and supporting our breakfast foods, as much as they are about reintroducing Americans to a delicious cup of
McCafé Coffee. And so those are the things we do there.
On the reset end, I did mention in my comments a bit about reducing – potentially, this reduces the complexity. When
you have a number of builds in the restaurant, basically what you're doing is you're leveraging the various condiments
and products in the restaurant to build those sandwiches. If you can go to a more streamlined menu board approach and
then still have those condiments so that customers can customize a bit, it will help in terms of reducing, if you will,
complexity. Having said that, though, customers want varied tastes and so we need to be able to deliver that. They also
familiar favorites, like the Big Macs and Quarter Pounders, Filet-O-Fish, nuggets, fries, and we need to be able to
deliver on that. And we will be able to do both of those things. The system that the U.S. is putting in place on reset just
calls us back to a basic operations focus on our restaurant and it helps us to enable better productivity with some of the
things, such as the high-density prep table and the high-density kitchen set-ups we have.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Next question's from David Palmer from RBC.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Morning. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned that you're strengthening your planning
process to effectively bridge consumer insights with the right customer-centric plans and marketing. I'm curious about
what that means. Have we already seen the fruits of these changes in your marketing? Are big changes coming soon?
Perhaps you can give us a sense of what you think is the marketing opportunity after some self-diagnosis? Thanks.
<A - Don Thompson>: Several different points, thanks, David, for the question. Several points that I mentioned on the
consumer insights piece, we have tremendous amounts of data within the McDonald's System. The question is whether
the data is then being translated directly to the specific action plans that we see being executed in the marketplace. And
that is a combined effort between the franchisees in the market, our leadership teams and our supply chain and our
supply chain leaders. So we've got to make sure that we're translating those consumer insights.
The whole notion here is that you can't be driven based upon optimizing profitability, even in the face of external
pressures relative to the P&L. We've still got to remain grounded in the consumers. And that is what we saw as some
slight gaps in some of the priority markets. So we've got to get back to that consumer focus, while mindful of some of
these additional cost pressures, but make sure that the plans are robust enough. But that is combined with several other
things that I mentioned. One is the marketing messages. So if we are more streamlined and focused relative to this
consumer insights to action plan, then the marketing focus in the messages won't be so disparate and we what we'll be
able to do is focus that strength and highlight that strength a little bit more solidly.
The other thing we saw was that affordability is one of those things that tends to get a little bit of less focus in tougher
times and so in many of the markets, we fell off of our affordability messaging a bit. In some of the markets, they're
coming back on that. And then the core menu balance, we were chasing a few too many limited-time offers, so for
these primary focal markets this is going to take time. I mean, our planning process, you know us well. We plan with
the franchisees and we plan not just two or three months ahead. We plan six months, nine months, and usually a year

ahead of time. And so it's going to take a while to see some of these things layered in, but it is about a series of multiple
initiatives. It's not a silver bullet and these things will take a bit of time, but I feel confident that our markets now are
focused on leveraging the right processes, incorporating the right discussion points with the franchisees and moving the
business for the long-term in the appropriate manner.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Next question's from Jason West from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Jason T. West>: Thanks. Just one around the overall portfolio review, is part of that also looking at CapEx and
the unit growth rate that's been picking up a little bit in the last few years and I know you guys taking a harder look at
whether that's the right growth rate for the business and the right CapEx spend for the business?
<A - Peter Bensen>: Jason, an outcome – so the re-franchising plans are being built up market-by-market. So as we
said, we didn't start this with a particular target in mind, but we want the markets to come back to us based on their
knowledge of the franchisees, their local business environment, their growth potential, etc., and come back to us with a
more aggressive re-franchising plan than they have today. And certainly one of the outcomes of that will be as we get
more franchised, that is less capital-intensive, so it will allow us to grow at the same pace, at this pace that we've been
growing at, that 2.5% to 3% new units, with less capital. And so it is definitely an outcome. It's not the primary
objective of looking at the re-franchising, but it is certainly an outcome. It makes us a little less capital-intensive, but it
also converts that Company-operated earnings stream into the more stable and predictable rent and royalty franchising
income stream, which we think is the most valuable piece of all of this.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Next question is from Will Slabaugh from Stephens.
<Q - Will E. Slabaugh>: Yeah, thanks, guys. Regarding the U.S., can you talk about how you've gauged the customer
reaction so far to the Dollar Menu & More and how you think you're positioned there versus your peers at the lower
end? And at the same time, could you talk about that in the context of the necessity there for dramatic innovations at
the premium end as a big lever or is it as pressing in the near-term, at least, as driving value and getting people in the
door through your value proposition there?
<A - Don Thompson>: Okay, I want to make sure I catch the last part of that again possibly, Will, but I'll give this a
shot. Relative to Dollar Menu & More, again, stepping back relative to Value Menu in the U.S., during roughly the last
10, 12 year history, the U.S. has evolved the Dollar Menu to ensure the menu offers are in line with customer
preferences several times. Those changes have been made over this 10-year period to make sure we stay relevant, but
we're also mindful of the profitability aspects and the execution aspects of these menus within the restaurant. And we
want to make sure that we provide the right things for our customers and we can do that over a sustained period of time.
So when we look at Dollar Menu & More, it is another of those evolutions. Dollar Menu & More as a percent of total
days' sales seems to be relatively in line with our historical averages, and we're not seeing any dramatic change to the
usage of Dollar Menu & More. And so right at this point in time, Dollar Menu & More has performed to the
expectations that we've had.
I think the last part, Will, that you mentioned was relative to – was it relative to premium products and the role that
premium products play? I would say there's a balance between what we just talked about with affordability, Dollar
Menu & More, our core menu offerings and our premium-based products.
So when you see Clubhouse Burger in one of the national windows, you'll probably see coming up in a local window,
maybe some mentions of breakfast, maybe some mentions of affordability or mentions of a limited-time offer product.
So Clubhouse Burger worked great nationally, but you'll also have to marry that along with some of the value
messaging. You'll also hear some beverage messaging and breakfast messaging. So that marketing calendar has to
accommodate all of those. There's definitely a place for new food and innovation, new beverages and innovation. We
just want to be mindful of the core offerings that we have giving them the appropriate leverage in the marketing
calendar, as well as dayparts like breakfast.

<Q - Matt J. DiFrisco>: Thank you. My question is with respect to the price and I wanted to know how that might
look, with obviously a lot of states having some minimum wage and California going up to increasing their minimum
wage over a couple of years here. In your planning process, is that 3% price that you mentioned domestically being
held, is that what we will see carried out and already assumes to absorb some of that minimum wage? Or is there an
ongoing dialogue with franchisees as far as what type of minimum wage response they might have?
<A - Peter Bensen>: Yeah, Matt. There are actually 13 states at the beginning of the year that raised their minimum
wage anywhere from $0.10 to $1, and that's before any Federal, potential Federal minimum wage impact. So as I
mentioned in my remarks, we look at the traditional indices that tend to guide our pricing decisions. So
food-away-from-home projected to be up 2.5% to 3.5% this year. I think inherent in that is you do see franchisees
generally around the industry, not just McDonald's, anticipating some of these higher input costs. So they've got what
the states have already enacted today. They've got the discussion about a potential at the Federal level. For a lot of
them, the healthcare mandate kicks in, in 2015 so they have to be mindful of that. So these cost pressures are definitely
on everyone's mind as you think about pricing, yet, as Don mentioned, you have to strike that right balance between
everyday affordability and providing them premium products that will drive them into the restaurant, as well. But as we
get too focused on individual profitability and less focused on the customer, that's when we start to run into some of
these challenges.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Our next question is from Jeff Bernstein from Barclays.
<Q - Jeffrey Andrew Bernstein>: Great. Thank you very much. Just focus on the U.S. business and the competitive
environment, perhaps, obviously, ex the weather, and I think you talked about kind of the QSR promotional activity
kind of ramping up. I know you mentioned the free coffee promotion you guys are doing. I know more locally perhaps,
we've seen kind of buy one get one Big Mac type products. So I'm just wondering whether you could talk, first and
foremost, just about the competitive environment, especially with you guys having perhaps lost some share to some of
your competitors over the past couple of quarters.
And as it relates to that, the breakfast, which it seems like, so far so good, that it's fairly steady at, I believe, you said
roughly 25% of sales. I'm just wondering if you can give us some insight, that we don't perhaps have, on the broader
category and maybe how the category is growing relative to how your 25% has grown or contracted over the past year
or so. Thanks.
<A - Don Thompson>: Thanks, Jeff. I will try to answer. I think you had about four or five different questions in there,
buddy, but the first one relative to the U.S., U.S. comparable sales trends stabilized during the first quarter of 2014.
And we saw sequential improvement in our reported results, comp results, as well as a narrowing of the gap to the QSR
sandwich competitive set.
And excluding the impact of this year's severe winter weather, our U.S. comparable sales for the first quarter would
have been relatively flat. We had about a 1.4%, a little over a 1.4%, impact due to weather, which we don't often talk
about weather, because next year when it's much better, we probably won't talk about it either. But truth of the matter
is, it did have some level of impact to us, but you all will put that in the appropriate perspective. We don't plan around
weather at McDonald's. We plan around customers.
A couple of other things, we continue to see some – the IEO industry in the U.S. is still relatively flat, so we know that
this is going to be a market share battle. So we've got to focus on those things that our customers are focused on and
desire. So in the U.S., there's a focus around breakfast and coffee, as I mentioned. There's a focus on balancing our core
menu along with some of the limited-time offers, like you just saw with the Clubhouse Burger and Chicken Sandwich.
And we've got this basic focus on operations to ensure that we can satisfy the needs of customers, particularly during
the peak hours. So that gives you a pretty overall perspective, I'd say, of our U.S. business and the state of that.
From a breakfast perspective, I mentioned it a little bit earlier. Our breakfast is strong and it continues to be a solid
performer relative to our overall daypart segments. And what we want to make sure is that we just continue to focus on
the strengths that we have. And actually, we have not talked as much about the quality aspects of our breakfast. We
haven't talked as much about the fact that we're a restaurant business that cooks. There are entrants into the marketplace

that don't have the same capabilities we have. And so we're going to leverage the strengths that we have and leverage
the capabilities we have to inform customers of the facts of why we've been in the breakfast business for over 30 years
and why we have become America's favorite place to eat breakfast. And we don't plan on giving that up.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Next question is from Sara Senatore from Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Sara H. Senatore>: Thank you very much. I just wanted to follow up on the U.S. business and, in particular, in
the context of some of the commentary about maybe focusing on profitability maybe at the expense of resonating with
customers. So can you just talk a little bit about the margin structure there? First, is it still the case that you need a 3%
comp to lever expenses? Should it be higher, because it sounds like you're looking more for traffic-driven comp?
And then I guess, what's the right margin, company-operated, over the long-term? If I look back 20, 25 years, it's
averaged something close to 18% in the U.S. and Europe. Do you see anything that suggests it should go up or down
from here or structurally, just there's really no change with your margins? Thanks.
<A - Don Thompson>: Hey, Sara. I just want to make a quick comment and then I'll turn this over to Pete on margins.
First of all, we have a fantastic group of franchisees in the U.S. business. Matter of fact, next week, we have our
worldwide convention where our franchisees from around the world will be there and we're looking forward to the
dialogue and discussions we'll have. So when we talk about profitability, what we're talking about is very viable, astute
businessmen and women who look at the overall environment and are looking at some of the implications of
commodities along with legislative pressures and then they will make decisions relative to their businesses.
So if we talk about a focus, losing a bit of the focus on the customer, it's not because we don't have solid business
people or we have people that are trying to squeeze the business. They're looking at the overall perspectives of
profitability, which they should do. What we've got to make sure is that our focus relative to profitability starts and
ends with a customer focus and those visits to the restaurant and that's why we talk about the balanced plan. So I just
wanted to reiterate that fact. I don't think we could have better franchisees. But just like us within a company, we've got
to make sure that we all stay focused on the customers.
<A - Peter Bensen>: And in terms of the company-operated margin, Sara, we've historically said in a normal
environment, and we've defined that as being kind of a 2% to 3% inflationary environment, in that kind of normal
environment, we need a 2% to 3% comp to maintain margins. And our assumption in that is that half of that comp is
coming from check and half of that comp is coming from traffic. And so what you saw this quarter is we got a
disproportionate share. The comp was negative, while we had a over 3% price increase. So you had a disproportionate
impact of the price increase this quarter is why you saw margins down only 10 basis points.
So, as Don mentioned, in those four priority markets, getting the sales and guest count trend lines stabilized and going
back positive is what's going to have the most significant impact on our margins. We've always said it's a top-line game
and we really need that comparable sales growth and the traffic growth to be able to benefit and leverage that
profitability. So that's our focus and really there's been no structural change that would cause us to believe that, over
time, we can't continue to grow those margins as long as we're generating those positive comps.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Our next question is from Karen Holthouse from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Karen A. Holthouse>: Hi. In your prepared comments, you mentioned there's going to be some increased
investments on the digital side in G&A. And how does that maybe relate to some of the things we've seen in the press
about testing for a mobile app or what sort of form some of the medium or longer-term digital initiatives might – what
sort of form they might take?
<A - Don Thompson>: Thanks for the question, Karen. Relative to our overall digital strategy, this is something that
we have been looking at in many of our markets around the world for some time. However, it's not been what I would
say a systemic strategy where we've leveraged the overall strength of McDonald's. So our digital vision is to bring an
entirely new level of convenience and fun to the McDonald's experience.
And what we have done to be able to move that forward is identify a couple of areas of opportunity relative to that
digital strategy. One is the field really around experience and the fact that technology can enable us to enhance the

customer interactions with our brand. And many people would know of that by payment, ordering, redemption type
opportunities, as well as customer relationship management.
The second area is an area of engagement and it's really how we engage customers, both with us telling the story of
some of the things we've mentioned, the quality, messages around McDonald's, the opportunities within the
McDonald's System, as well as our marketing campaigns and engaging social media to a stronger level. So we're going
to continue to do that. And from a global strategy perspective, it's really a framework that then allows the local markets
to be able to move forward more effectively. We'll also leverage the strength of McDonald's System globally relative to
our strategic partners as we move forward. So we've got several markets that are our test markets around the world, and
we're leveraging from the things that they've already done. And we're really looking to be able to scale the best ideas
we have, while those things are then combined with some of the global strategies and strategic partners that we have
that are much larger in terms of their scope to help us along on our digital journey.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: Our next question is from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.
<Q - John W. Ivankoe>: Oh, great, hi. Thank you. I think, at this point, just wanted to tie a couple things up. Don, I
don't think anyone, either within McDonald's or outside of McDonald's, would have said that you're an organization
that was not run without consumer insights over the last two years. In other words, you've always been a consumer
insight driven company. So just wanted to get a sense from your perspective what really will change quantitative,
qualitative, what have you, over the next couple of years. And maybe with that, you answered to a question in terms of
how you plan with franchisees over a six or 12 month period in terms of products and promotions, what have you. So
not necessarily in terms of the cost of G&A, but maybe how that G&A is being spent, is there a possibility of changing
the way that decisions are made and the speed of which various decisions are implemented in a market? In other words,
do you need to change kind of your entire decision making process and how things get implemented at the store level,
as we're clearly in a market that's moving much faster than it was over the past decade or so?
<A - Don Thompson>: Thanks for the question, John. We will always remain focused on being locally relevant and
that's the reason we have, as you know, John, some of the market teams out there in the field and they do a great job.
And that is also to help us move quicker. So when it comes to many things at a local level, that's the way we'll continue
to operate by leveraging those local teams and the local insights on consumers. You asked a question about whether or
not things have changed relative to consumer insights and data. We've always had data. We've always attempted to
leverage those insights as we put forth the plans. The only thing that's different, and we've been through this in cycles,
is that when you have external pressures, or a number of them, sometimes our focus can shift a little bit more to how
we ultimately will drive profitability at a restaurant level to handle some of those cost structures.
And we lose a little bit of the front end of those insights and, as a result, we focus more on the margin side of the
business than we do on the guest count side of the business. And we know guest counts correlate to our overall results
of profitability. So all we're saying that's happening in the markets now is a refocusing on that front end of the insights
and a refocusing on how those insights need to translate to plans that are customer-focused first. We always will have
the profitability aspects in mind as we plan, but it's got to be customer-focused first. And all of the markets and our
franchisees are well aware of this, but it can happen in cycles. And when it does, we just have to make sure we call that
out and we go back to the drawing board around how we move this business based on customers.
<A - Kathy H. Martin>: And our last question is from Andy Barish from Jefferies.
<Q - Alexandra Chan>: Hey, guys. It's Alex on for Andy. I want to go back to the European business and ask you a
little bit more about Russia and whether or not you saw any impact from the political unrest in the region and how that
business is trending and if anything has kind of changed in there, in terms of the strategy with respect to value and
premium products.
<A - Don Thompson>: Thanks, Alex. Pete and I will kind of double team this one a little bit. First part relative to
Russia, one of the things at McDonald's and we've done this in all of the markets around the world, first and foremost,
will always be the safety of our employees and our guests. That is of the highest level of importance to us. There's been
no major incidents related to their safety in these current markets, whether it be Russia or the Ukraine or Crimea or

anything that's happened in the current situation. Our restaurants generally are operating as normal. Some are
temporarily adjusting their evening hours, based on customer traffic and we had three restaurants in Crimea that have
been closed, due to suspension of necessary financial and banking services. And so that kind of gives you a state of
relative to Russia. There are some financial impacts and currency impacts and I'll ask Pete to speak to those.
<A - Peter Bensen>: Yeah, Alex. During the quarter, the ruble was down about 14% and it was down a little bit more
subsequent to the quarter end. And why that's relevant is Russia imports almost 50% of their food that they use in the
restaurants. And those imports are denominated both in euro and U.S. dollars. So when the local currency devalues like
that, they have a financial impact. So locally, they had a 200 basis point impact to their margins in Russia from the
devaluation that translated into about a 55 basis point impact on total Europe Company-operated margin, solely from
the devaluation. So if you assume the ruble is going to stay at this depressed level the rest of the year, that's something
we're going to be battling with for the rest of the year in our European margins.
That said, Russia has some of our most profitable restaurants around the System. So they're about 10% of our
consolidated margins, but they're less than 5% of our overall operating income. So in the grand scheme of things to the
overall profitability, they are less than 5%, but they do impact the margin line somewhat disproportionately, because of
those imports and because of the high volumes and the high margins they do run.

Okay. That's all for Q&A, and I'm going to turn it over to Don for a few final closing thoughts.
Don Thompson
Thanks, everyone, again. And as we wrap up this morning's call, I just want to make a couple of comments about where
we are positioned as McDonald's and where I see us. We remain committed to our strategies as we make thoughtful
decisions to mitigate some of the short-term pressures and grow this business over the long-term. This has been
consistent in terms of our approach. I have even more energy and passion around it today than I did 23 years ago when
I joined the company, because I know that this is a solid leadership team and we're well aware of what it is we need to
accomplish. I'm confident about our future. We have defensible competitive advantages. Some of those we've talked
about, a resilient business model and the alignment across our owner/operators, our suppliers and our company teams
to drive enduring profitable growth for our shareholders and our system.
So I thank all of you for your participation and for your thoughts about McDonald's and we hope that you have a great
day. Thanks again.
