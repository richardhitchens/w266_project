These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our
expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to those factors identified in the
release and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Today's presentations may also include certain
non-GAAP measurements. Reconciliations of these measurements is provided on our website.
Now, thank goodness, let me turn the call over to Frank.

Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the second quarter were $23.8 billion, up 5.7% from last
year. Comp sales were positive 5.8% and our diluted earnings per share were $1.52. Our U.S. stores had a positive
comp of 6.4%.
We saw broad-based growth in the quarter across all of our geographies. All three of our U.S. divisions posted
mid-single-digit comps with the variance of performance within 100 basis points of each other. We're pleased with
these results since we were anniversarying double-digit comps in the second quarter of last year. Every region
positively comped, as did 38 of our top 40 markets.
Our Mexican business positively comped for the quarter, making it 43 quarters in a row of positive comps and our
Canadian business continues to perform well with positive comps for the 11th consecutive quarter. Our Dotcom
business had sales growth of over 38%. This was a slight deceleration from the first quarter, but it was well ahead of
our plan. This quarter, our sales comparison included the full rollout of Buy Online, Ship to Store, which we launched
last year.
While our year got off to a slow start because of the late spring, we ended the first half with sales in line with our
original expectations. We believe the housing market remains a modest tailwind for our business. We had growth in
transactions and ticket for both the quarter and the half. Both our Consumer and Pro businesses grew. Our Installation
Services business, which is high ticket and tends to be on the discretionary end of spending, had a strong quarter. And
as Craig will detail, we saw an acceleration of big ticket transactions. These results support the view of a continuing
recovery in the U.S. home improvement market.
Consensus GDP forecasts call for modest growth for the year. And though the housing data is mixed, we believe home
price appreciation is an important positive for our business. Price appreciation isn't setting the pace of last year, but it's
still going in a positive direction, consistent with our expectations at the start of the year.
As Carol will detail, we are reaffirming our sales guidance and increasing our earnings per share guidance for the year
to reflect our outperformance this quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year.
Let me close by thanking our associates for their hard work and dedication. A successful spring season for us requires
flexibility in a difficult environment and our associates met the challenge. This half, over 97% of our stores qualified
for Success Sharing, our profit sharing program for our hourly associates. And we're proud of this result and hope to do
even better in the second half.
With that, let me turn the call over to Craig.

Thanks, Frank, and good morning everyone. We're pleased with our results in the second quarter and saw continued
strength in the core of the store in Maintenance and Repair categories. Our online business continued to show strong
growth and our Pro and Service businesses had another quarter of solid performance. We also experienced a rebound in
our seasonal businesses as spring broke across the country.
I would like to thank our store associates as well as our inventory, planning, replenishment and supply chain teams who
responded to this surge in seasonal sales. Because of them, we were able to deliver a great quarter and we had some of
our highest customer service scores in history for the second quarter. This is particularly notable given the fact that we
had a record number of customer transactions.
From a geographic perspective, all three U.S. divisions had positive comps and beat their sales plans. All departments
had positive comps for the quarter. The departments that outperformed the company's average comp were Tools,
Millwork, Outdoor Garden, Electrical and Kitchens. Baths, Decor, Plumbing, Hardware, Paint, Building Materials,
Indoor Garden, Flooring, Lighting and Lumber were at or below the company average, all at mid-single-digit comps.
The core of the store continued to perform well as we saw strength in maintenance and repair categories across the
country. Appliance Parts, HVAC, Hand Tools, Power Tool Accessories, Water Heaters and Light Bulbs all had
double-digit comps. Pro heavy categories like windows, concrete, insulation, pressure-treated wood, studs, fasteners,
pipe and fitting, and gypsum had comps above the company average.
Seasonal outdoor categories regained strength in the quarter. We lost some sales in Air Movement categories due to the
cooler summer and in Live Goods in drought-affected areas. However, sales in Exterior Stains, Water Sealers, Grills,
Seed, Soils, Mulch and Live Goods in non-drought-affected areas more than made up for the loss.
In Simple Decor, Vanities, Decorative Lighting, Fixtures and Hard Surface Flooring led by laminate tile and hardwood,
all had comps above the company average. Appliances also had another quarter of outperformance, posting
double-digit comps.
Total company transactions grew by 4.1% for the quarter while comp ticket increased 1.7%. Our average ticket
increase was negatively impacted by commodity price deflation, mainly from lumber and copper. The total impact to
ticket growth from commodity price deflation was approximately negative 10 basis points.
Transactions for tickets under $50, representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 3.1% for the second
quarter. Transactions for tickets over $900 also representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 8.4% in the
second quarter. The drivers behind the increase in big-ticket purchases were Appliances, Windows, Water Heaters,
Wood and Laminate flooring.
Our Pro business was strong across the country. Total Pro sales grew at approximately the company average, but sales
from our high spend Pro customers which we defined as those who spend more than $10,000 a year with us, grew
above the company average for the tenth quarter in a row.
Our Services business also had another great quarter, both in comps over twice the company average. In Services,
Solar, Window, HVAC and Countertop installations were the main sales drivers during the quarter.
We continue to drive efficiency through multiple initiatives. While in the early days, our new merchandising tools are
starting to deliver benefits. For example, we can use clustering to better source stores with similar attributes. One
category where we have seen this success is in water heaters that were sorted based on local preferences, regulations
and demographics and as previously mentioned, this category had double-digit comps for the quarter.
We've also changed the way we communicate with our customers and have shifted our approach to support a more
targeted personalized messaging to become more relevant to the customer. As a result, cost attributable to traditional
print advertising have been reduced by over 60% since 2010 and have been shifted to a more efficient digital delivery
method.
Now let me turn our attention to the merchandising and operational activities in the third quarter. We continue to drive
leadership in LED technology and are excited about the launch of our new light bulb reset that will expand our

presence and holding capacity in the category. This reset will add 25 new SKUs to our assortment and provide for a
better, more intuitive shopping experience for the customer. We're also introducing new products for the connected
home, including garage door openers, thermostats, water heaters, and light bulbs. In addition to these new products, we
have an incredible lineup of great values and special buys for our Labor Day and Fall Clean-Up events.
Finally, we continue to enhance the customer service experience in our stores and provide our associates the tools
necessary to do so. In the second half of 2014, we are introducing the next generation of our First Phone, which is an
associate and customer service tool. It will allow for Internet access to assist with questions and online orders and will
be equipped to complete the checkout process in aisle for our customers. These exciting products, events, and tools will
allow our associates to be ready for success in the third quarter.
And before I turn the call over to Carol, I would like to congratulate Ted Decker, who was recently promoted to
Executive Vice President of Merchandising. Ted brings a wealth of knowledge and Home Depot experience to this
role.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.

Thank you, Craig, and hello, everyone.
In the second quarter, sales were $23.8 billion, a 5.7% increase from last year. Our total company comps or our
same-store sales were positive 5.8% for the quarter, with positive comps of 6% in May, 4.4% in June, and 6.8% in July.
Versus last year, a stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted total company comps by approximately 50 basis points.
Comps for U.S. stores were positive 6.4% for the quarter, with positive comps of 6.6% in May, 5% in June, and 7.3%
in July. We were particularly pleased with our U.S. comp performance given that last year we posted an 11.4% positive
comp in the second quarter.
Our total company gross margin was 34.3% for the quarter, a decline of one basis point from last year. We saw
considerable amount of movement in our gross margin during the quarter, as explained by the following factors. First,
we experienced 16 basis points of gross margin expansion, due primarily to higher levels of co-op and rebate and a
modest positive impact from sales mix changes.
This gross margin expansion was offset by 11 basis points of contraction due to higher shrink than one year ago and by
six basis points of deleverage coming from our supply chain as we, like many companies, faced higher transportation
costs. For the first six months of the year, our gross margin was essentially flat from the prior year. And for fiscal 2014,
we expect our gross margin rate to be up a few basis points from what we reported in fiscal 2013.
In the second quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 109 basis points to 19.8%. While our
expense leverage reflects the impact of positive comp sales growth, we also experienced lower expenses year over year
in several areas, including worker's compensation. Further, management bonus expense was $66 million less than last
year, given relative year-over-year performance.
Based on our year-to-date experience and our outlook for the balance of the year, we are now projecting our fiscal 2014
expenses to be lower than what we thought at the beginning of the year. As a result, we are projecting our fiscal 2014
expenses to grow at approximately 23% of our sales growth rate. We would expect our expense growth ratio to be
higher than our guidance in the third quarter and closer to our guidance in the fourth quarter given year-over-year
comparisons.
Interest and other expense for the second quarter was $191 million, a $19 million or 11% increase from last year. The
year-over-year change reflects two items. First, interest expense increased by $34 million, due primarily to interest
associated with long-term debt. Year over year, we have increased our outstanding debt by $4 billion, including $2
billion of long-term debt issued in June of this year.

Second, interest and investment income increased by $15 million in the quarter, reflecting an additional gain on sale of
HD Supply common stock. This brings the total pre-tax gain on sale of HD Supply common stock to $112 million or
approximately $0.05 of earnings per diluted share for the first six months of fiscal 2014, of which $0.04 was recognized
in the first quarter and $0.01 was recognized in the second quarter. We now own approximately 11.8 million shares or
6% of HD Supply outstanding shares.
Our income tax provision rate was 37.1% in the second quarter, and we expect our income tax rate to be approximately
37% for the year.
Net earnings for the second quarter were $2.1 billion, the highest quarterly net earnings in our company's history.
Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $1.52, an increase of 22.6% from last year.
During the second quarter, we opened one new store in Mexico, for an ending store count of 2,264. At the end of the
second quarter, selling square footage was 236 million. And total sales per square foot were $404, up 5.5% from last
year.
Now turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter inventory was $11.7 billion and inventory turns were 4.9
times, flat to last year. We ended the quarter with $43.5 billion in assets, including $4.2 billion in cash and cash
equivalents.
Moving to our share repurchase program, in the second quarter we repurchased $2.25 billion or 23.1 million of our
outstanding shares. This included 6.2 million shares repurchased in the open market and 16.9 million shares
repurchased through an accelerated share repurchase or ASR program. For the shares repurchased under the second
quarter ASR program, this is an initial calculation. The final number of shares repurchased will be determined upon
completion of the ASR in the third quarter. For the remainder of the year, we intend to repurchase approximately $3.5
billion of outstanding stock using excess cash and the proceeds from $2 billion of long-term debt issued in June, for
total fiscal 2014 share repurchases of $7 billion.
Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on
invested capital was 21.9%, 280 basis points higher than the second quarter of fiscal 2013.
Moving to our guidance, there are mixed signals in the housing data, but our planning assumptions remain intact. As
we look to the back half of the year, we believe we will continue to report solid sales gains and the sales plan we laid
out at the beginning of the year is well within sight.
Today, we are reaffirming our sales growth guidance for the year of approximately 4.8% and comp sales growth of
approximately 4.6%. We expect the rate of comp growth for the back half of the year to be about 80 basis points higher
than the rate of comp growth we experienced in the first half of the year.
For earnings per share, remember that we guide off of GAAP. We are lifting fiscal 2014 diluted earnings per share
growth guidance by $0.10 and now expect fiscal 2014 diluted earnings per share to increase approximately 20.2% to
$4.52.
Our updated earnings per share guidance reflects our second quarter performance as well as the impact of raising our
2014 share repurchase target from what had been $5 billion to now $7 billion.
So we thank you for your participation in today's call. And, Audra, we are now ready for questions.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Aram Rubinson at Wolf Research.

<A - Diane Dayhoff>: Good morning, Chris.
<Q - Chris J. Bottiglieri>: Hi, good morning. I just want to ask the question about if you could tell us about your
decision-making process that you're using to deploy and optimize space in your stores. Specifically, we're wondering
like we've see you reset Patio, Flooring, Cabinets. What are the other glaring opportunities? What figures internally tell
you that space allocation is making a difference? And lastly, if you were to change the allocation overnight, what do
you think the ultimate potential could be in terms of sales per square foot or anything else you could tell us? Thank
you.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Chris, from a space allocation standpoint, we obviously use both our financial systems as
well as our planogram software systems to be able to make decisions on the productivity of space. The investments
we've made in our merchandising tools are there to allow for our merchants to make assortment decisions that improve
the productivity of obviously the space that we dedicate to our assortments.
You have seen us make trade-offs as you pointed out in terms of allocation shifts within Patio in this case, as we've
seen customers gravitate to the online space and the ability to customize their own product through the offerings that
we have digitally. That would be much more difficult to execute in a store environment. Or in spaces like Kitchens,
where the customer's shopping pattern has changed in terms of how they begin to shop for kitchens and we could take
some space out of Kitchens, for example, and either apply that to an expansion of our assortment in Appliances or for
that matter, our Hard Surface Flooring. So those are the type of trade-offs that we'll make on a consistent basis and look
for opportunities to continue to drive productivity overall in our store, but for our sales in total.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: And to your question as to how high is up, well, that's for us to figure out. But if we just look at
Appliances, for example, we have our expanded assortment in over 800 of our stores. We're rolling to another 183
stores and Appliances contributed 50 basis points of our comp growth in the second quarter.
<Q - Chris J. Bottiglieri>: That's great. Thank you very much.
Operator
We'll go next to Dan Binder at Jefferies.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Good morning and congratulations on a great quarter.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Thank you, Dan.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Thank you.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Thank you.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: My question was – I had two questions, one around the momentum you're seeing at the end
of the quarter, anything that you would attribute to that, any promotional events and has that continued into Q3?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: So, when we look at the quarter and through the months, very, very pleased, Dan, with the
breadth of growth, if you will, across the store. Probably one of the tightest quarters in terms of when we look at all of
our departments, the lowest comping department was north of 4% and the spread was pretty narrow. So we're very,
very pleased with the productivity across all of our merchandising departments and also across all of our geographies.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: As we look into our performance for August, you may recall that last year our comp in August
was 8.7%, so we're up against our hardest comparison and we are very pleased with our sales performance.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Great. My second question, if I could, was just around the SG&A. The lower set of comp was
detailed. I was wondering if you could give us any color around the workers' comp impact to the quarter.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Sure, I'd be happy to. We've really worked, Marvin and the team, have done a marvelous job of
working on really making our stores a place where we have fewer injuries, et cetera, so our workers' compensation

We'll go next to Simeon Gutman at Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Joshua M. Siber>: Good morning. This is Joshua Siber on for Simeon, congratulations on a great quarter. So
outside of the lower workers' comp, you guys posted nearly flat SG&A dollar growth versus nearly 6% sales growth.
Outside of the worker's comp, do you guys attribute that expense control to anything else?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: There were a few other items I would call out, a legal settlement that we had last year of $23
million that didn't repeat this year. But broadly speaking, we have a productivity cycle that drives our economic engine
and we have a laser focus on just making sure that we've got outstanding expense control and you can see that in the
results.
<Q - Joshua M. Siber>: Okay. And if you don't mind if, I sneak one more in, I'm just curious how have customers
responded to a dedicated space for online orders? Have you guys seen a pick-up in the Pro business because of this?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Roughly, about a third of our online transactions culminate in a store and that is split across
both Consumer and Pro.
<Q - Joshua M. Siber>: Okay, thank you very much.
Operator
We'll move next to Kate McShane at Citi Research.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Good morning.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: For Q2, we assume that some of the comp benefit was from storm-related damage sales.
Do you expect to still see some impact from this in Q3?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: The overall storm comp from a year ago as you move into Q3 is very, very small. We've
pretty much cycled through it as we've come off of Q2.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Are you referring, Kate, to the damage from the winter that we had?
<Q - Katharine McShane>: Yes, damage from the winter.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Yeah. It's hard, to be honest, to tease that out in the numbers. I mean, what you saw was a
very strong recovery of our Outdoor Garden business, but we're not able to pinpoint what percent of that came from
storm damage.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: And to Craig's comment about the storms that we're anniversarying from Superstorm Sandy,
this might be helpful to you. If you look at our six-month comp in the United States, it's a 5% comp. We had about 50
basis points of pressure in that comp coming from the Superstorm Sandy overlap and to Craig's point, we will be
through that beginning in Q3.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: That's very helpful. Thank you.

We'll go next to Brian Nagel at Oppenheimer.
<Q - Brian W. Nagel>: Good morning.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Good morning.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Good morning.
<Q - Brian W. Nagel>: Congratulations on another very nice quarter.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Thank you.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Thank you.
<Q - Brian W. Nagel>: A question I had, you called out big ticket as a driver here and I think in response to one of the
other questions you mentioned Appliances. But the question I have is, maybe give us a little more color around either
the ongoing strength you're seeing in the Appliance category or if you're seeing big ticket of another nature start to
inflect higher here at this point in the cycle?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: We were very pleased, Brian, with our performance in Appliances; double-digit comp
growth, as Carol mentioned, 50 basis points of overall comp contribution. And that's a result of, obviously, the
expanded assortments and the expanded showroom. We also believe we're delivering great value in our events that we
put into play there.
But also in big ticket, we've seen a nice recovery in the Millwork business, as customers clearly feel better about
investing in their homes. We've had an outstanding product in terms of our expansion and use of tools to put our new
Water Heater program in place, as well as growth within our Flooring business, led by wood and laminate with the
investments we've made into our hard-set program there. Roughly, we began the year with about 225 stores with an
expanded assortment; by the end of this year, we'll have about 600 with an expanded presence there. So it's more than
just Appliances that we're seeing. And as our large Pro continues to recover, our Pro's driving a larger ticket than the
Consumer basket on a consistent basis.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: You might also just call out Services because they had such a terrific quarter. The comp, twice
the company average, and the average ticket within our Services business is $1,500.
<Q - Brian W. Nagel>: Very helpful, and then just a quick follow-up. Market share, any color you can give us there on
the heels of a strong showing in sales?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Our area, Brian, is really hard. We look at third-party reports on market share, government
reports on market share, what our vendors say about market share, and they would say it's going in the right direction.

<Q - Mark A. Becks>: Hi, this is actually Mark Becks on for Chris. Congrats on a great quarter.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Thank you.
<Q - Mark A. Becks>: First question, I was just trying to get a sense. We've previously been talking about the
potential bathtub effect impact from weather and seasonal versus what's going on in the core of the store. Is it possible
to put a number or a comp benefit that you think you captured just in terms of share shift in volume from Q1 to Q2?
And then if you could, give a little bit more detail on the core trends of the business. Thanks.

<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Sure. This is imperfect, but directionally correct. So in the United States, we reported a comp of
6.4% in the second quarter. We know we had 20 basis points of pressure anniversarying Superstorm Sandy sales, and
then we think we got about 150 basis points of benefit from the seasonal business. So that would suggest then the run
rate for the business is about 5%.
<Q - Mark A. Becks>: Excellent. And then I'm just trying to tease out expectations for Q3 and Q4 a little bit more.
Previously you've articulated comps being in a pretty narrow range, with Q4 comps slightly ahead of Q2. But given the
large outperformance in the second quarter, do you maybe have any updated thoughts?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Sure. The range will still be very narrow between Q3 and Q4. Q4 should be a higher comp
quarter than Q3 but slightly under what we reported for Q2.
<Q - Mark A. Becks>: Great. And then one other question, the comm and the EDI just rolled out last quarter. I was
wondering if you can give us an update on some of the early results and progress that you're seeing there.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: We're very early on in the rollout of the program, but it is going well. We're excited about
this technology enhancement bringing enhanced visibility for our customers and our associates to special order
programs. Consumers being able to get that update in terms of the status of their order based on how they want to
receive it, whether that be text or email. So it will drive an efficiency in communication and it will drive greater
visibility also for our merchants in terms of overall performance on special orders. So very pleased with the current
status of how that's rolling out, early days still.
<Q - Mark A. Becks>: Excellent, thank you.

And we'll go next to Scot Ciccarelli at Royal Bank of Canada.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Hey, guys. Hi. Understanding that certain expenses, Carol, like you pointed out, shrink and
workers' comp, et cetera will bounce around, is there a structural limit to your EBIT margins? And maybe a better way
to say it, is there a point where your historical 20 bps of EBIT margin expansion per point of comp starts to break
down?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Scot, as you've seen, we continue to outperform our expectations on expense productivity. At
the beginning of the year, we said our expenses would grow at 33% of our sales growth rate. We're now updating the
guidance to 23% of our sales growth rate. But that's really because of what we have seen in terms of lower casualty
reserves coming off of these rate programs in workers' comp. As we would look to 2015 and beyond, it's our point of
view today that expenses would grow more in that 33% of sales growth rate. It doesn't mean that we won't continue to
focus on productivity because we will, but I would think for modeling purposes, that's the number that I would use.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Got you. And then you talked about some mixed signals in the housing market, and I know
we've seen existing home sales a little bit softer than I guess what a lot of us would have expected. I guess maybe the
question is, what parts of the market are you most bullish about, and then what parts are you maybe most concerned
about at this stage? Thanks.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: As we look at the housing indicators, there are three that we pay attention to most closely. That
would be turnover, home price appreciation, and household formation. Turnover is slower than what some people had
hoped for but in line with our expectations, which is about 4% of units. Home price appreciation slower than some
people had hoped, but in line with our expectations; for the year we project home prices to be up around 5% or 6%, and
that's how they're trending. Household formation at 500,000 households is certainly below what all of us would like to
see. We use that number when we built our plan, but clearly we'd like to see that improve because there's something
like a third of the people who are aged 18 to 36 living at home with their parents. Something's got to move.

And so to your question, what are we most concerned about? It's mortgage financing availability. There has been some
modest movement. There was a survey of senior loan officers. Seventy percent of them said that underwriting standards
haven't changed. That's better than last quarter where it was about 74% of them said that underwriting standards haven't
changed. But something's got to move on mortgage financing reform. So for us, we continue to pay real close attention
to that.

We'll go next to David Schick at Stifel.
<Q - David A. Schick>: Hi, good morning and congrats on a very impressive quarter; two things. So first, you
mentioned that you changed the communication – or you've been changing communication with customers, making it
more personalized. Any color you can give on results you're seeing real time from that, whether it's a program that you
turn on, specific program you turn on or a part of the store, so any of the efficacy of that?
And then second, relatedly, you've mentioned the larger Pro customers growing faster than Pro overall, which I think
you said Pro overall was in line with the average. Is the large Pro growth just due to the difference in the health of those
customers, or is it something you're doing specifically in targeting the larger Pros, some work you're doing with them?
Thank you.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: I'll take the digital marketing and then ask Marvin to talk about the Pro. On the digital
marketing, this has been something that we have been transitioning for a number of years now and trying to drive to
greater efficiency. And I think, specifically, you have to look at the overall results of the business and we believe that
this shift in how we've approached communicating to the customer is a piece of what's been driving our results over the
past couple of years.
And so, you know, I don't think it's – we don't focus on it necessarily category-specific. We have programs across the
store that we utilize the digital approach with to really communicate with our customers virtually in every category.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Now here's an interesting data point. Print will be less than 10% of our total advertising spend
this year while digital is 36% and trending higher and we like the return on investment that we see.
<A - Marvin R. Ellison>: David, regarding the Pro, we've been on this journey for quite a while and when we look at
the larger Pro, Craig mentioned that their performance outpaced the total company. And we think it's a couple of
things. Number one, Carol mentioned, just access to capital, that we think that these individuals, because they have
larger businesses, just have greater means to borrow and to grow their business. We also believe that the emphasis we
placed on an outside selling force, the last couple of years, and we have approximately 200-plus individuals that work
outside of the store and their primary responsibility is to go out and make sales calls of job sites, of business locations
and really sell The Home Depot as a value proposition to these large customers, we think that that's gaining traction.
But also, we think a lot of these smaller Pros in the depth of the housing recession, really exited the business and start
to work for some of the larger Pros, so we see some of our smaller Pros as subcontractors, so to speak, that's supporting
the larger Pro business. So we think it's a combination of just a broader economy, but also some of the efforts we
placed on attracting these customers and kind of providing them with a better understanding of the value proposition of
The Home Depot.
<Q - David A. Schick>: Thanks.

And we'll take our next question from Matthew Fassler at Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks a lot. Good morning. Congratulations on a terrific quarter. My primary question
relates to the role of credit in the store and how that ties in to big ticket. What can you judge about the way the
consumer is borrowing and paying for goods based on the tender that they use in the store? And what kind of response
are you seeing from your third-party provider on the private label credit side?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yeah. We're very pleased with what we're seeing within our private label portfolio. The
penetration increased by 57 basis points to 23.2% of total sales on our private label card. And as you would imagine,
Matt, because we use our card as a financing tool and not a discounting tool, we see sales on that card for the larger
ticket purchases. The portfolio itself is very healthy and that's good news too. So on the approval rates, we've seen our
consumer approval rates up 182 basis points year-on-year with an average line of about $5,800. And on the Pro side,
the approval rates are up about 140 basis points, now almost 72% of all Pros who are applying for credit are getting
approved with an average line of around $6,900.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Can you remind us, Carol, on sort of the direction of some of those numbers, the
penetration, the approval rates, et cetera, are those moving up and to the right continuously and did you see any kind of
a step-change here in the second quarter?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: They're moving up continuously. It's a slow, steady move, if you will. No step-change.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Got it, and then just a very quick follow-up. I know weather has come up a couple of
times. If we take a step back from sort of the seasonal spillover and the 150 basis points that you mentioned, looking at
a couple companies, retailers that are the most weather-sensitive, some of them were of the view that the weight of
weather on the business extended beyond some of the core seasonal categories and lasted a bit deeper into the season,
i.e., perhaps into your second quarter period, and only would have really fully abated kind of in the June-July
timeframe. Do you guys share that point of view? Or do you feel like the impact of weather was more limited and more
directed to some of the categories that you specified?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: We did not see it, Matt. I mean you can see with our numbers, we really didn't see that.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Got it, thanks so much.

Next we'll go to Peter Benedict at Robert W. Baird.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. My question is really around your efforts to drive
increased Pro loyalty with Pro Xtra and some of the CRM stuff you're doing. Can you help us maybe frame the
opportunity you see on that front? In think in the past you guys have spoken to your average Pro doing around $6,000
in spend a year. Help us understand what percentage of their wallet you think that is and where you think you can take
that reasonably over time?
<A - Marvin R. Ellison>: Peter, this is Marvin. On the percent of wallet, that's a tough one, that's a tough data point to
kind of vet out, but what we can tell you is that we're excited about Pro Xtra. We have approximately 1.7 million
members signed up, we increased that over 200,000 this quarter and that's been two consecutive quarters we've signed
up in excess of 200,000 new members. And as a reminder, this is just a unique play for us to create a program where
customers can sign up and leverage the buying scale of The Home Depot to take on some opportunities in their
business that they can't afford. Things like satellite roofing for a small roofer. If you're small and independent that's
really an expense that you can't take on, we can allow them to kind of piggyback us.
We've also rolled out recently things like credit protection against any type of fraud. We have discounted background
checks, so you name it, we have quite a few things. Even this week if you want to sign up, we have a great offer, 25%
off special order, inside cabinets and countertops for Pros in this program that's going on this week. So we have unique
offers exclusively for these Pros, so that they can take advantage of some of the great benefits of shopping at The Home

Depot. Very, very early days in this program, we're working with Matt Carey's IT team to make this a more robust
program and we're excited about the possibilities.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: And, Peter, this is just math, but if we had either a 5% increase in our ticket or three more
transactions per Pro per year, it's a $1.2 billion dollar opportunity.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: That's terrific. Thanks, Carol, thank you, Marvin for that. Carol just to follow up on one
thing you mentioned in your prepared remarks, the transportation costs being a headwind, we've heard that from some
other folks. Can you maybe drill down a little bit more detail, why are transportation costs up for you guys?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Let's have Mark Holifield to address that.
<A - Mark Holifield>: Yes, hey, Peter, Mark Holifield. We were pleased with the responsiveness of the supply chain
overall during the quarter. It was pretty challenging with the rebound in seasonal weather. But unfortunately, we did
have to spend more to move our freight. The primary drivers of that really are what's happening on the rails with
declining service there, year-over-year, some of the new drivers, the service regulations causing some driver shortage
issues, and then we saw freight market imbalances brought on by diversion of cargos from the West Coast.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much, guys.

We'll go next to Greg Melich with ISI Group.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Thanks. You mentioned the Dotcom growth, still very strong. Could you tell us what
percentage of sales that made up in the quarter? And do you think that growth you're getting there, is it all additive or is
some of it cannibalistic from traffic you would've had anyway to the stores?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes, Dotcom sales made up 4.2% of our total sales at the end of the second quarter, that's up
100 basis points from a penetration perspective year-on-year. Hard to actually measure incrementality, but I would say
Buy Online, Ship to Store is 100% incremental. And that in the second quarter was $144 million.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Great. And then to follow up, you mentioned, Carol, I think, in gross margin drivers, you hit
some breakpoints and got vendor rebates. Would you expect to continue to have that level of benefit in the second half?
And then also what specifically caused the drag on shrink?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Sure. So to the impact of higher co-op and rebate in the second quarter, that was really a timing
matter. If we look at where our purchases were in the first quarter versus second quarter, it's just a timing matter. Let
me give you a better data point. If you look at the impact of co-op and rebate for the first half, it was a three basis point
benefit.
Now in terms of shrink, you may recall last year we had 10 basis points of benefit from shrink in the second quarter,
and that reversed itself this quarter. There are three drivers of shrink: theft, operational processes, and system
inaccuracies. As you know, we've put a lot of change into our stores, a lot of new processes and systems: Buy Online,
Ship to Store; Buy Online, Pick Up in Store; Buy Online, Return to Store, and the list goes on. It's not uncommon when
you have change inside the stores to see both shrink and swell and that's what we were experiencing. We've got a team
that's working on this, and this will be an issue that goes away over time. We've just got to work through it.
<A - Marvin R. Ellison>: And, Greg, this is Marvin. We're very confident in the processes and programs we have in
place. We have one of the best analytical focuses on shrink reduction that I've seen of any retailer. And it's a
cross-functional effort with the merchants, with the internal audit group, with IT and operations. So to Carol's point,
there are a lot of ins and outs. We've had unprecedented processes changes and systems changes the last three years,
but we're very confident and comfortable with our focus, and we believe that we'll continue to get that number down.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: That's great. Thanks a lot.

Our next question comes from Michael Lasser at UBS.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the connection
between the outdoor categories in the second and third quarter. Is there any possibility that given the extended season
where it was cool in July and you reported a really strong comp during that month that that could draw away some
potential sales from the fall because consumers may have been able to do projects like exterior paint in the summer,
where they may have been waiting for the fall, or alternatively they maintain their lawn and garden much further into
the season this year and so they may have a little less cleanup than they might have in the past?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: We really don't see it that way, Michael. If you think about typical projects that customers do
spring and then in the fall, they're very different. So in the spring, you're actually getting your beds and stuff ready to
plant for the spring season. That then transitions to a whole new planting cycle in the fall, and the absolute best time to
plant any kind of shrubs and trees and so on is in the fall timeframe, so that you're moving away from the heat. I don't
think that changes. Fall cleanup is a big element that drives in the fall timeframe as well. That's obviously going to
happen. I do think we benefited from the fact that it did not move from winter to 95 degree heat straight out of the
blocks. That helped us in terms of people maintaining their yards through the summertime, but don't see that as a drag
in what customers typically do in the fall.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Okay. My second question is on some of the merchandising activities that you did with the
clustering and the tools, and you cited the example of water heaters. If you could, size the percentage of your sales that
have now been touched by the increased analytics or more sophisticated analytics that you're using to give us a sense of
what the future opportunity might be.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: We're very early on. We've just begun on the new tool enhancements to begin to review
categories in this process. We typically review roughly a third of our categories per year. So you're in the early innings
of a three-year cycle, first go-round, and then we'll learn from that process as well.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: And on water heaters, do you think – do you ascribe a big portion of the comp outperformance
to some of the activities that were done?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Definitely. We definitely did a much better job of utilizing our clustering capability and
identifying the opportunities where we could put a more productive assortment into specific stores.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Okay, thank you very much and good luck with the rest of year.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Thank you.

And we'll go next to Dennis McGill at Zelman & Associates.
<Q - Dennis P. McGill>: Good morning and congratulations. As you look at the comp in June, domestically at least,
the comp in June versus July, that acceleration, was that also across the store, consistent with the message for the
quarter where there wasn't a whole lot of variance across categories?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Yes, it's pretty consistent.
<Q - Dennis P. McGill>: Okay. And then, Carol, with respect to appliances, the strong growth this quarter, if I'm not
mistaken, the year-ago appliance growth was maybe the best of the year and very robust. I'm just curious what you're
looking for in the back half of the year as far as benefit from comp or the ability for comps to maintain this double-digit

We'll go next to Jaime Katz at Morningstar Equity Research.
<Q - Jaime M. Katz>: Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. I'm curious about your outlook for capital
allocation strategy. Is there still some free cash flow to be spent longer term? And I'm wondering if you guys think
about either raising the dividend or paying down some of the higher rate debt; and after that, maybe a little bit more
color on Mexico and Canada, please?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes, from a capital allocation philosophical perspective, the first use of cash is to invest it back
in the business, and this year we have a capital plan of $1.5 billion, and we're committed to that plan. Interestingly, we
are tilting our investments more towards interconnected retail and technology as we continue to try to meet the needs of
our changing customer.
The next use of capital is for our dividend. We have a 50% payout target, which means at the end of every year, we will
look back to see what we earned, we will cut it in half, and that will be the new dividend. If we were ever to have an
earnings disruption, it wouldn't be our plan to cut the dividend; we would just earn back into that 50%. Longer term, is
50% the right target? Perhaps it should be higher, but right now we're at a 50% target.
And then we use excess cash to buy back shares. We will use debt capital to buy back our shares if we think it's
value-creating. As you saw, we raised $2 billion in June of this year. The after-tax cost of that debt was 2%. The yield
on our stock was 2.3%, so we thought that was a great trade, and we will continue to look for opportunities like that.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: And, Jaime, on your question on Canada and Mexico, as I indicated, we're very pleased with
the results in both countries. Canada benefited from the same weather and seasonal rebounding that the U.S. business
did and had very strong comps. Mexico is doing very well and has been doing very well for many, many years. The
only interesting curiosity on the results in the quarter was that they were impacted by the World Cup. We could
actually see the divot in sales when Mexico was playing in World Cup matches, but they still performed very well.

<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Michael, first, when I said the expanded assortment of appliances, we have jumbo, we have
jumbo lights, we have bigfoots. We have various themes of the merchandising display within our store, so I just wanted
to make that clarification. A year ago, we were probably 250 stores less than where we are today, yes.
<Q - Michael Baker>: Okay. And so that's the type of – where did you end the year – or start this year?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: About 250 stores less.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Yes.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: We can certainly get back to you on the exact store count.
<A - Diane Dayhoff>: I'll get back to you on that, Mike.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Sorry, don't have it with us.
<Q - Michael Baker>: Okay, fair enough, one more then, if I could. SG&A in the back half, are there any other – so
will incentive comps continue to be a benefit to you? And are there any things like that legal settlement that we should
know about that occurred in the back half of last year that wasn't necessarily called out on the call last year?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: No, I think what I've said in my prepared remarks is that our total expenses we now forecast
will be under our plan year on year, and that's because of really for the most part lower casualty reserves.

We'll go next to Keith Hughes at SunTrust.
<Q - Keith Hughes>: Thank you. Switching back to the Services business, which has done so well in the quarter, give
us a feel for how big of a business that is now and specifically which services are doing well of late?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: So roughly about 4% of our total sales comes from our services businesses today. And we
saw real strength across HVAC, Windows, Water Heaters, so a lot around both Maintenance and Repair, as well as the
Millwork space.
<Q - Keith Hughes>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Diane Dayhoff>: And, Audra, we have time for one more question.

And we'll take that question from Eric Bosshard at Cleveland Research Company.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Thanks. You commented that the first half in total 1Q plus 2Q was similar to what you had
thought it might be coming into the year, but it seems like July and August are probably better, perhaps materially
better, than you might have thought coming into the year. And it doesn't sound like it's weather or seasonal. But could
you just give us again the insights into what's driving the business in July and August, despite the macro housing
indicators not being as great as one might have hoped?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: I mean, Eric, it's really strength across the store. As I mentioned, we've seen pretty tight
performance with the lowest department being north of a 4% comp.
