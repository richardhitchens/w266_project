Nicholas K. Akins
Thanks, Julie, Happy New Year to everyone, and thanks for joining us today. Usually, the new year comes with a sense
of renewed optimism that our best days lie ahead. I can tell you here at AEP, reviewing what has been accomplished
during 2013 and after a more detailed review of the fundamentals during the fourth quarter, there is reason to be
optimistic. The foundation has been set for continued success and perhaps finally a growing economy.
We talk a lot here about infrastructure development, including transmission, the customer experience and the employee
experience and this provides the focus for the actions we take. In that context, I'm very pleased to report several
significant accomplishments during 2013.
Our safety performance, for the second year in a row, we accomplished zero fatalities on our entire system with one of
the best safety records we've ever had. Moreover, we also had our best year from an environmental stewardship and
compliance perspective. We are very proud of both these accomplishments, and in my view, it's a strong indicator of
the health of the organization.
We completed corporate separation on time and accomplished many of our objectives including the transfer of the Ohio
generation assets to APCo, Kentucky, and a new unregulated generation company. I want to thank all the commissions
and the other stakeholders for their cooperation to get this done.
We delivered fourth quarter 2013 GAAP earnings of $0.71 per share, and operating earnings of $0.60 per share,
concluding the year 2013 with GAAP earnings of $3.04 per share and operating earnings of $3.23 per share, solidly in
the upper range of guidance. Rate activity was positive with $340 million of secured rate changes across our state
jurisdictions. I'm pleased to report from last week that PUCT did reverse the AFUDC decision that had previously gone
against us, and I'm very thankful they did that and indicated that we can invest in Texas in a positive fashion.
We completed two securitizations totaling $648 million in APCo in Ohio, with one remaining securitization, and that's
regarding the Ohio fuel. We exceeded our performance improvement targets for the year and our current 2014
initiatives are continuing positively and on schedule. Our previous dividend increases announced during 2013
improved our dividend payout by 6.4% and continues our focus on maintaining the dividend commensurate with
earnings.
We continue to target 60% to 70% payout dividend ratio. Our total shareholder return for the year was 14.2%, so a very
good year. Our employees have clearly responded to the challenges that we faced during 2013 and came through with
flying colors. Our emphasis on execution, culture and financial and strategic discipline are paying dividends, no pun
intended. As an example, the Gavin plant has gone through lean activities and recognized the change in the operating
practices certainly during this event we had with the Polar Vortex. So, it's just an early indication of successes that
we've had relative to the lean activities. I am pleased with the response and energy of our employees, as we redefine the
culture of AEP and, in fact, the future of AEP. So let's talk about the future, 2014.
We are reaffirming our guidance ranges for 2014, 2015, and 2016 and the 4% to 6% growth rate. 2014 guidance is
$3.20 to $3.40 per share. Our continuous improvement initiatives are progressing well with four plants done with the
Lean rollout. Now, we're focusing on Cardinal, Mitchell, Rockport and others. We continue the wires Lean work in
Ohio in OPCo and we'll soon move ahead to I&M and SWEPCO. Our management team, including myself,
participated in the team rollout so we expect the IT and the Mitchell rollout coming up soon, and the energy and the
ingenuity of our employees is just amazing in this process. The new unregulated generation function continues to work
to reform its cost structure and operating parameters in the PJM market and many other activities are progressing as
well.
Transmission growth continues on plan, and we continue to focus on even more capital moving to transmission, as we
showed earlier in the EEI presentation late last year. We are pleased with the progress being made in this segment of
our business. We have great proceedings in the Oklahoma, Ohio, Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky during the
year. We are planning for 2014 of having rate relief of a $175 million in rate recovery, 82% of which is already
secured. Chuck Zebula continues his work to optimize the unregulated business to ensure that it is cash positive and

contributes to earnings. Of course, cold or hot weather helps, but we continue to work on PJM capacity market reforms
to enable investment to occur as well as a focus on any emerging hedging possibilities and cost-related efficiencies in
this business.
Just as an aside to quickly remark on the capacity markets and recent experience with the polar vortex, it is interesting
to note that while daily gas prices are in the $5 to $6 per MMBtu range and energy prices are soaring well beyond that
supported by gas price increases alone, it is clearly evident that capacity rents are being reflected in energy prices,
indicating a need for further reform of capacity markets.
Looking at the physical side, when 89% of our coal capacity slated for retirement in mid-2015 is called upon and
running, natural gas delivery is challenged, and voltage and load reductions are occurring, it is another reminder that
we should carefully plan and design this social safety net we call the electric grid to meet extreme requirements, not
just steady state conditions. We believe the nexus of EPA initiatives, energy market development, and security threats,
whether physical or cyber, is a national security issue.
All of this that we've achieved in the last year certainly contributes to the customers' experience by providing electricity
in a safe, reliable, economical fashion in an environmentally respectful way.
Now let's move to my equalizer chart. We've – that's on page five of the presentation. The overall is approximately
9.9% ROE. This has come down a little bit, but primarily reflects rate recovery lag from rate cases, and the heavy
project spend in transmission. We expect this to improve. So if you look at the chart in the APCo area, we have the
Virginia bi-annual case, the West Virginia rate case. So, we expect that to continue to improve.
Ohio Power is coming down because of the customer switching that's occurring. Kentucky, it's in the midst of a
Mitchell transition that's occurring. We expect the base rate case to move Mitchell over in the base rate. And then I&M
continues to improve at 9.3%. PSO will have a rate case this year. SWEPCO has some transmission related cost to
recover and also some Dolet Hills related generation costs in Arkansas.
And then AEP Texas continues to have significant load growth and amortization and stranded costs included in that
number as well. And then on the Transco Holdco side, it's 9.5%, but there is obviously rapid rate of investment is
occurring there and the developmental expense related to Transource and also CREZ Texas has a TCOS filing that's
occurring as well. So we're seeing continued improvement there and we'll continue to address that.
So as we move into 2014, we're watching clearly some very positive indicators from the fourth quarter 2013 regarding
our load. If you exclude Ormet, the bankrupt aluminum manufacturer, for the first time in not just several quarters but
several years, in fact back to 2007, all of our categories residential, commercial and industrial load increased in the
same quarter. That's the first time that's happened in years. We are seeing significant shale gas and other load related
activity improve. So we are optimistic based upon the quarter that this trend could continue. Brian will address this in
more detail.
2014 will be a year of significant strategic importance to AEP. Our management and the board will focus much
attention on transmission growth, our regulated businesses, the utility model for the future and what that means and we
will continue to review the progress of the unregulated business as well.
So since we've last talked to you all at EEI late last year, we've made some significant progress in several strategic
areas: corporate separation; the transmission allocation of capital; the infrastructure investment; the focus on our
regulated business; defining the business case for our unregulated business; producing quality dividends and earnings
for our shareholders and quality service to our customers; and defining a culture for AEP for the future. In a nutshell,
sticking to our knitting, that of a focused regulated business.
I'll turn it over to Brian at this point.

Thank you, Nick, and good morning, everyone. On slide six, you'll see our comparison of 2013 results to 2012 for both
the fourth quarter and the full year. In the interest of time, I'll focus my remarks on the full year column and only add
comments for the quarterly comparison when necessary. Operating earnings for the fourth quarter were $296 million or
$0.60 per share, up $0.10 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2012.
These results bring the full year earnings to $1.573 billion or $3.23 per share compared to $1.497 billion or $3.09 per
share recorded in 2012, an improvement of $0.14 per share. Stepping through the detail from top to bottom, you can see
that the annual comparison was adversely affected by a combination of certain Ohio transition items that were
unfavorable by $0.26 per share.
This effect on earnings was driven by an increase in customers switching net of the capacity deferrals, lower capacity
payments from competitive retail energy suppliers and the overall – and the reversal of 2012 prior period unfavorable
provisions.
The effective income tax rate was unfavorable $0.17 per share for the year due to unfavorable year-on-year tax to book
differences accounted for on a flow through basis, as well as positive adjustments to state income tax returns that were
recorded in 2012. A significant portion of this effect was recorded during the fourth quarter. Allowance for funds used
during construction or AFUDC was off $0.10 per share for the year, due primarily to the startup of the Turk Plant in
December of 2012.
O&M expense net of offsets was unfavorable $0.05 per share for the year, primarily due to increased spending for plant
outages in 2013. The unfavorable variance for the quarter reflects higher storm and employee-related cost. On a total
system basis, excluding earnings offsets and River Operations, O&M for 2013 was $2.8 billion, which was flat to 2012.
As you may recall, we expect to hold O&M at this level in 2014 as well. Off-System sales margins, net of sharing for
the year, were down $0.05 per share. This decline was driven by lower RPM capacity revenues that hurt results by
$0.03 per share and lower trading results. The annual decline in regulated retail load of $0.02 per share is driven by the
lower industrial demand across much of our service territories. I will discuss the economy and our retail sales data in
more detail in upcoming slides.
AEP River Operations began to rebound during the fourth quarter, but was still off a $0.01 per share for the year. This
decline in earnings reflects the lingering impact of the drought of 2013. Weather helped our annual earnings by $0.04
per share versus 2012 and was favorable $0.07 per share versus normal weather.
Favorable interest income contributed $0.07 per share for the year, due primarily to the recognition of the interest
income from the resolution of the UK windfall tax issue earlier in 2013. Transmission Holdco continues to grow,
adding $0.02 per share for the quarter and $0.07 per share for the year, reflecting significant investment in this area.
Consistent with our goal to allocate available capital to transmission, earnings for this segment were $0.16 per share,
$0.02 higher than originally forecasted with guidance for 2013. Our guidance for 2014 reflects $0.29 per share of
ongoing earnings from this segment.
The quarterly comparison at the parent added $0.11 per share and was due to the make-whole premium for debt retired
late in 2012. The annual comparison for the parent shows a benefit of $0.15 per share due to that debt retirement and
the resulting lower interest expense realized through 2013. Rate changes were favorable by $0.11 per share for the
fourth quarter. This quarterly result pushes our favorable year-to-date comparison to $0.45 per share. This improvement
in earnings reflects constructive regulatory outcomes in multiple jurisdictions. Finally, other items for the annual
comparison were favorable by $0.02 per share, primarily driven by lower long-term interest and lower depreciation
expenses.
In summary, despite considerable headwinds in Ohio, we were able to deliver results near the upper end of our
guidance range. The better than expected results were aided some by weather. But more importantly, we executed on
our regulatory and strategic plans. In all, 2013 was a successful year for American Electric Power.
Turning to slide seven, you'll see our usual detail on normalized retail load with a new feature. On the bottom half of
the slide, you will see a light blue line that adjusts the gross industrial and overall normalized load trends by factoring

out the impact of the Ormet load. We felt that this presentation was helpful because, although the loss of the Ormet
load was significant in terms of volume, AEP did not earn significant margin on that load.
On the bottom right quadrant, you can see that weather normalized total load was down 0.8% for the quarter and 1.6%
for the year. Excluding Ormet, the quarterly number is actually positive 0.9% and was down only 0.6% for the year.
For 2014, we are forecasting total normalized load to be down 1.1%, but the forecast is essentially flat when Ormet is
excluded.
Industrial load was down 3.2% for the quarter and 4.5% for the year. Excluding Ormet, quarterly industrial sales were
actually up 1.6%, and the annual comparison was down only 1.6%. For 2014, we are forecasting gross industrial load to
be down 2.2%, but positive 1.2% when adjusted for Ormet.
There were a number of new industrial expansions, especially related to the oil and gas sector, that we expected to
come online earlier in 2013, but were delayed until the second half of the year. Looking forward to 2014, we expect an
additional 270 megawatts of new industrial load to come online. This will help to offset the negative drag on industrial
growth caused by the loss of Ormet. We will take a closer look at industrial load on the next slide.
Residential sales shown in the upper left quadrant were up 0.9% for the quarter, which brings the annual sales flat to
2012. We continue to see modest customer growth in our western service areas while our east customer counts are
essentially flat. Average usage per customer has been impacted by home energy efficiency programs. For these reasons,
we are expecting normalized residential sales to be down nearly 1% in 2014.
Finally, in the upper right-hand quadrant, you can see that commercial sales were essentially flat for the quarter and the
year. Commercial sales saw some growth in Texas, Ohio, and Oklahoma, where we've seen stronger employment
gains. We are forecasting commercial sales to be roughly flat in 2014.
Let me stop here and provide an update on the economy within AEP's footprint. AEP service territory continues to
experience economic growth despite the drag that the federal fiscal austerity measures placed on our economy. Most
economists predicted that the third quarter would be most impacted by the sequestration, and this was true for us. For
the fourth quarter, GDP growth in AEP service territory was 1.3%, which is an improvement over the 1.1% growth we
saw in the third quarter, but still below the projective fourth quarter growth for the U.S. of 2.3%
Fortunately, employment statistics, which are a better indicator of electricity sales than GDP, were not as weak and
remained steady through 2013. Job growth in AEP's western footprint was up 1.4% and just below the U.S. at 1.7%,
while job growth in the East moderated recently to 0.8%.
With that segue, let's turn to slide eight, where you will see the quarterly and annual results from our five largest
industrial sectors. Our largest sector, primary metals, was down 23% for the quarter and 18% for the year. Earlier I
mentioned the curtailed production of Ormet. And excluding this effect, the sector would have been down closer to
7.7% in 2013. That customer has now fully ceased operations, and so we expect to see this impact through the third
quarter of 2014.
Chemical manufacturing sales were up nearly 5% for the quarter, bringing the annual decline to 0.3%. We saw a
number of customers increase their production towards the end of 2013. As global markets for chemicals continue to
recover, we expect this export industry will grow.
Petroleum and coal products sales were down 2.5% for the quarter and 1.6% for the year. This was mostly due to three
specific refineries that were down for routine maintenance in 2013. Excluding these three customers, sales to this sector
were up 2.5% for the year.
The mining sector excluding oil and gas was up 0.6% for the quarter but still down 1.4% for the year. This decline
reflects the continued impact of low natural gas prices and weak demand from utilities and metal producers.
Paper manufacturing was up 7.5% for the quarter and 3.3% for the year, driven by a major expansion in Ohio along
with higher demand in our western footprint. Although not in our top five sectors, we continue to see growth in the oil
and gas extraction and pipeline transportation sectors, driven by continued gains related to shale gas activity.

Slide nine provides a picture of the financial health of the company. Our total debt to capitalization improved in 2013,
ending the year at 54.3%. We look back as far as 1999, and 2013 had the lowest percentage of debt to capitalization
over that timeframe. Other important metrics, FFO interest coverage and FFO to debt continue to be solidly in the BBB
and Baa2 range at 4.7 times and 18.8% respectively. We also ended the year with a strong liquidity position of $3.5
billion, bolstered by our two revolving credit lines and our term loan facility.
On the bottom left-hand side of the page, you will see that our qualified pension funding has increased to fully 99%.
The company has aggressively funded this plan to the benefit of our employees, retirees, shareholders, and
bondholders. In addition to the funding, the company has been working hard to match the duration of the assets to the
liabilities and to derisk the plan as it approaches full funding.
In addition to our pension results, our other post-employment benefit plan is now more than fully funded at 117%. This
is the result of changes that we made in 2012 to our post-employment medical plans for future retirees. The financial
strength depicted on this slide demonstrates the commitment that our board and management have to growing the
company and at the same time maintaining a very strong balance sheet.
Turning to slide 10, we can review some of our assumptions and sensitivities underpinning our 2014 guidance range of
$3.20 per share to $3.40 per share. As you would expect, a key sensitivity is retail sales volumes, which we have
already discussed. Remember that we base our guidance on normal weather. While you would be right to think that
load has been strong so far with the extreme January weather, please be cautioned that this is only one month in what
should work out to be yet another 12-month year.
Our regulated and competitive businesses have different sensitivities to wholesale prices for power at $0.01 and $0.02
per share per dollar for the year respectively. And of course, O&M expenses and taxes are also key to earnings, with a
1% change in O&M having a $0.04 per share impact and 1% change in the effective tax rate having a $0.05 per share
impact on earnings. At this point in the year, we do not anticipate much variability in the tax rate for 2014.
A significant driver for 2014 earnings is rate changes of $175 million. As Nick said earlier in his remark, of this
amount the company has already secured 82%. Most of the remaining amount is expected to come from wholesale
FERC formula rate customers, where annual rate adjustments are fairly routine.
You can see the power and natural gas prices that were used in formulated in our guidance. Prices have changed since
we developed this guidance last year. But at just 27 days into the new year, it makes a lot of sense to maintain our
operating earnings guidance and to keep it steady as she goes.
More than ever with some of the market challenges we face in 2015 through 2017, we will be actively managing outage
schedules and expenses in response to revenue changes in order to keep inside the guidance cone you see on the left
hand side of the next page.
So turning to slide 11, I want to reiterate a point that Nick made earlier in his remarks, our 4% to 6% growth rate is
predicated on continued investment in our regulated properties and by our continued focus on sustainable cost savings
and O&M discipline. The green flags on the right highlight the major initiatives that are underway.
Let me provide some granularity on two of the work programs in order to provide insight, because it is a serious focus
of management and employees as we began 2014. Management is providing our employees with the tools and
processes to advance continuous improvement, and our employees are providing the ingenuity and the know how to get
the job done.
On the generation side, four of our larger generating plants have engaged in employee led sustainable improvement
programs beginning in 2013. These plants have already experienced expense savings through more efficient work
practices, heat rate improvements, and better utilization of the contractor workforce. Similar programs have started at
additional plants already in 2014 with five more to go during the year. In 2015, four additional plants will be engaged.
Our generating plants are leading the rest of the company in continuous improvement initiatives, demonstrating the
gains that can be realized through these efforts. Similar programs have been launched by our distribution employees.

Two districts began initiatives in 2013 with 16 scheduled for 2014, nine in 2015, and two in 2016. These districts are
using employee led idea generation, benchmarking, and white boarding to streamline their processes, better engage our
workforce and to focus on customer service and savings.
Our transmission, supply chain, procurement and corporate center organizations are engaged in similar programs,
demonstrating the continuous improvement and employee engagement are part of our culture. Our employees are well
aware of the opportunities and challenges presented by our changing business environment. They also have the passion
and drive to make the most of the opportunities to meet the challenges and to serve our customers as they expect to be
served.
On Wednesday of this week, Nick will lead another employee meeting on these subjects, as a way of ensuring that all
18,500 employees are informed, motivated, and engaged as we move forward.
With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And first we go to line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks, guys. Congratulations on a good year.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Thanks, Greg.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: A couple questions. First, can you repeat what you said about your assumption – what was the
buildup for your assumptions on residential sales. Can you extrapolate on what that means sort of going forward over
the next several years of your forecast?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes, so we are anticipating residential sales to be down almost a percentage point in 2014,
and we think it's largely being impacted by a lot of the energy efficiency programs that we have across our service
territory with Ohio, Indiana and some other states having some pretty aggressive programs. So it is impacting load, also
customer accounts are an impact as well. We're seeing positive customer count growth in the western part of our
service territory and pretty stagnant customer growth in the eastern part of our service territory. So when you put those
effects together, it's definitely a drag. We'll see how things work out as we go through the year and we'll obviously be
updating you quarter by quarter, but we are anticipating some low decline in the residential sector in 2014.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: So, Greg, the last quarter of the year indicated some positive strength to that, but I think we're
going to sort of see that play out before we make any changes.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: I guess what I'm asking is as we think about the guidance ranges for 2015 and 2016, I'm not
asking you to give specific drivers across all the factors in the business, but would it be fair to say you're assuming
continued reductions in residential demand through time due to federal and state energy efficiency standards or do you
think that your base case for economic growth eats into that and you could get back to positive net residential growth?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Our load growth assumptions through 2016 are very, very conservative. So I mean we are
not forecasting, to hit our numbers, the classic 1% to 2% load growth that we've seen earlier in the century, we are
anticipating that negative 0.5% to positive 0.5% load across the timeframe.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: So it's relatively flat, it's less than 0.5%.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Great. Thanks. Second question is on what you are seeing – I know you have a de minimis
footprint relative to a lot of the other companies when it comes to competitive generation in retail, but it's still

<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Greg, we really haven't seen much of that yet. Obviously, there's going to have to be a little
history that plays out here with the weather, but also it's pretty clear that capacity ramps are included in energy prices.
So the market reforms that are occurring plus the experiences people are having relative to this extreme weather, there
may be opportunities for additional hedging to occur, and also for customers to finally see that we need to sort of lock
things up for the long term. So it may be helpful, but at this point, it's too early to tell.

Next question from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: Hey, good morning, guys.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Hey, Dan.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: Do you think – just kind of now that the transition for a competitive generation in Ohio is kind
of on its way, can you just share your updated thoughts on the future of competitive generation in the AEP business
mix, and maybe to what Greg was asking, are you starting to see or are you able to engage in conversations about some
long-term supply agreements to help put some more visibility in that business?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes, Dan, I think we stand by originally what we said relative to this business that it will
hinge upon our ability to see this additional hedging occur, that we confirm out the supply, make it look
quasi-regulated. At this point because capacity markets have been depressed and now recent experience aside, it's
difficult to tell how successful we will be in our ability to hedge that up because – but we're not standing on our laurels
with that. We're aggressively looking at the cost structure of the business. We're also reforming the way we operate at
our plants because they know full well their survival is at risk there.
And so, we're going to do everything we can do to position this fleet to where it's positive and also address the market
reforms that are occurring at FERC now. And then hopefully with the events that have transpired recently with the
weather, it could help us in terms of getting additional hedges in place. But that business, our retail operation together
now with that generation fleet, there is some opportunities there. So we're working on all fronts to ensure that we're
able to position this business as best we can. And at the end of the day, it needs to look quasi-regulated to us.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: I guess, Nick, from a market reform perspective, given the time horizon into the next RPM
results actually affecting your earnings contribution, are there changes going to happen in a reasonable time period that
will give you guys comfort to wait it out or are you going to need the customer to come in and buy in rather than
having policy reform to it?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes, that remains to be seen. I think there are two or three of the changes, market changes
that PJM has filed at FERC. We expect another to get filed and then with is trying a review of the curve itself. There
are some opportunities there if it's done in a positive fashion. But we're going to have to see the results actually of what
FERC approves. And it's important for us to see that FERC understands the issues that are in play here and that they
obviously make wise decisions on what that market reform should be. And certainly this first round of the two or three
filings that have been made about PJM will be instructive in terms of what FERC's mood is relative to market reform.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: I guess one last question, Nick, just on Greg asked about residential load, but commercial is also
looking pretty flat for 2014 versus 2013 with sustained GDP growth and that sort of thing. Is there a potential that that
number will start to spruce up, or are you just not seeing the growth in construction or commercial space to be
confident if that's coming back?

<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: No, I think the chance that – I think one quarter a trend doesn't make. So we've got to look
at the numbers for this quarter that's occurring now and we'll continue to adjust accordingly. And not just only adjust
our forecast accordingly, but adjust our cost structure accordingly as well. And our employees are well tuned into that
process at this point. So this is very much about an optimization business now.

Our next question is from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Good morning. Can you hear me?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Hello, Paul. How are you?
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Fine. Thank you. Congratulations on a solid quarter and year.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Thank you.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: A couple questions. At EEI, you indicated that your forecast didn't have any projects in the
transmission side that weren't pretty ironclad. What kind of upside is here from what you've done since then?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes, so as you recall during EEI, we had the presentation of the real projects that are in the
plan right now, and then we had this incremental bandwidth above that graph that showed the incremental real projects
that are also in hand that we're planning capital for. As you'll recall, we – for 2013, I think we moved $120 million of
capital over to transmission as a part of our regular ongoing process primarily from generation, and that's been positive
for us.
We'll continue to do that to achieve the capital associated with those particular projects, that's still well in hand, moving
forward very well. And in fact now, we're in the process of defining a ridge even above that. But that's going to be –
that's going to have to play itself out in terms of our ability to come up with real projects. We also – we aren't standing
aside on the sidelines with Transource and other activities. We continue to pursue projects outside of our footprint as
evidenced by the – I know you probably saw that we were one of the five bidders for a Canadian project, McMurray
500 kV project. So, all that's going on on all cylinders and we are very happy with the progress there and we'll continue
to identify those real projects that can be done.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Great, thank you.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: And then just you indicated you're not changing your forecast for gas or power pricing, but I
assume it's safe to think that so far in the year, it's been a nice tailwind. In other words, you're not having to go buy
power in the east side markets to fulfill some obligations?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yes, that's right.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes. So, most of what we have for off-system sales, particularly for the generation resources
side of the business is hedged with its contract to Ohio for the year. So although our units are performing well, demand
is strong, I wouldn't want to get – have irrational exuberance over the fact that it's been cold and prices have been high
at this point.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: But you aren't that long, so you are participating?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: AGR is and we are participating, but some of our operating companies are having to buy to
meet their needs. And we've offered capacity to some of those companies to help fill that need and some have taken it

and some haven't and we're hoping to get positive resolution of that, but not all of our operating companies are long
through this event, but AGR is.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: And then lastly, just what yours early read on what's going to happen in the next capacity
auction or is there just too many things still up in the air here to predict that?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Well, I think if the market reforms that FERC has in front of it now are approved, that could
be helpful, whether it's enough remains to be seen. And that's something, I think, that all the generators are looking at in
terms of how much surety are we going to get around the continued investment in generation for the long-term within
PJM. But that remains to be seen. I think some have said a slight uptick, some have said more than that, but that
remains to be same.

And next we go to Kit Konolige with BGC. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Hello, Kit. How are you?
<Q - Kit Konolige>: I am good, thank you. A good number of my questions have been answered already. I was just
wondering if you could give us a little more color on, Nick, your equalizer slide, as you always call it and just go
through again which is improving and which is deteriorating? And also, could you provide a little detail on the
transmission spend and why it's – why there is a lag there and can that be caught up or is that just going to – the lag
going to stabilize, and we'll start to see earnings grow with investment?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes, sure. So I'll go through it. In terms of the Ohio Power, the 11.3%, that'll probably
continue to come down slightly, because customer switching continues and as far as the Ohio situation. APCo should
improve. There is a West Virginia base case that needs to be filed during the year. And then, there is also the Virginia
bi-annual case. As far as Kentucky power is concerned, that's in the middle of the settlement that occurred relative to
the Mitchell transfer. Right now there is a rider in place. But later in the year, a base rate case will be filed that includes
Mitchell being moved over. And then also as part of that settlement, also some sales revenues come back to the
company 100%. So that's helpful during the interim process. So we expect that to come up.
I&M continues to improve when you get the full value of all the rate activity that they've been involved with. I think
the last report had 9.1% or something like that. It's up to 9.3%, which is positive and it will continue to improve. That's
where we have the legislation for the nuclear lifecycle management projects, the environmental projects. So we have a
really, really good recovery mechanism there.
And then PSO is in the midst of a rate case. They just filed it I think a week ago, a little over a week ago, a $45 million
rate case asking for a 10.5% ROE, had some smart grid activity involved with that. So we expect a positive result there.
And then as far as SWEPCO is concerned, the only lagging part of SWEPCO we have is the portion of Turk that wasn't
included in Arkansas retail rates and that's being sold on the wholesale market. But there are some increases there
related to transmission related costs, filings that need to be made in the jurisdictions. And then there is some Dolet Hills
expense that needs to be filed in Arkansas. So they're working on that as well, so we expect that to improve. And it's
moved – originally I think it was at 7%. it's up to 7.4%, so it's on its way back up.
And then AEP Texas, it stands pretty good in terms of load growth as really helping out there. And that number also
includes the amortization of the stranded costs, so it looks high but it includes that. And then as far as the Transco, ETT
is an area where a TCOS filing has been made and it still lags. So it will lag until the TCOS filing is made, which that's

a pretty standard filing that actually we've already made that, but it's pretty standard filing. It works much like a fuel
cost recovery mechanism, but we expect that to continue to improve.
And then, we've obviously as we addressed moving capital over to transmission, remember the capital is moving to
transmission and we're spending it at a pretty accelerated rate there. So the project spend is getting out a little bit ahead
of the recovery mechanisms, even though the recovery mechanisms are good. So it's a good place to be as long as we're
meeting our earnings objectives and are able to move our capital around, that's a good place to be. And then we have a
little bit of developmental expense there related to Transource that still needs to be reflected through with a
construction going on within Transource. So we expect that to continue to improve as well.
So really, probably the only one that could move down is Ohio Power because of everything associated with the
transition to Ohio, but the other jurisdictions are on their way up and doing well.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: And just one other to be clear. Is essentially all of the transmission spend adjudicated by FERC
and then passed through the operating companies, or is there state level transmission rate case activity?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes, there is some transmission in the operating companies, but by and large most of it is
Transco related, that's FERC regulated. And then of course, Texas is PUCT regulated. So it's pretty straightforward.
We've got the projects, we know what the projects are, they are real projects and they're just plowing through the
process with some favorable recovery mechanisms. So we're particularly happy with where the transmission business is
going.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: And final question, do you have any middle term, three-year view on the transmission earnings
contribution and what that's going to mean for where you are in that cone of earnings guidance out for three years?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yes, so the high case by 2015 is $0.39 a share, which was I guess the original modeling we
had had $0.36 a share, so an additional $0.03 a share. And then by 2016, we're looking at $0.43 a share and it could be
upwards to $0.51 a share. And that's based upon those real projects, as I said before. Now, if we have incremental
projects above that, then there could be additional opportunities there, particularly if some of these projects that we
have in PJM that have been proposed or the Canadian projects or anything else, that will also contribute beyond what
we did show in the graph back at EEI. But that EEI graph is pretty solid. As a matter of fact, it is solid. I shouldn't say it
is pretty solid; it is solid. The issue for us is making sure we replow the capital back in to get that top side of
transmission and then also identify anything beyond that.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: And so just to be clear, if you were to hit the top side of transmission in 2015, the $0.39, would
that mean you come in at the top side of that consolidated EPS range?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: We continue to hold on to our 4% to 6% based upon that original guidance in 2013 we gave
that had a $3.15 midpoint. It's a broad bandwidth and certainly there are a lot of things that could happen and ins and
outs in the process, so it's difficult to tell at this point, but we'll certainly let you know as it gets closer.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: That was good. Thank you.

Our next question is from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Good morning.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Hi, Stephen.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Hi. I wanted to talk a little bit more about transmission. Nick, you had laid out on one of the
earlier slides about a 9.5% Transco earned ROE for the year, but there are number of near-term impacts to that. I
wonder if you could just flesh that out a little bit more and then talk about going forward, and then I'll shift to a bigger
picture question.

<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: So as far as transmission is concerned, the TCOS filing is already made. So I think they
have six months to come up with a solution there, I think. Actually we've been very successful with our TCOS filings.
So I wouldn't suspect we would have any issues there. And then really the return, the ROE of 9.5% doesn't reflect
authorized return at all. We're just getting out ahead and we're intentionally getting out ahead to make sure that we
plow as much capital as we can into transmission.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Stephen, you also remember that our authorized ROE in PJM is 11.49% and in SPP it's
11.2%. And with the formula rates that we have for those transcos, they get updated on an annual basis. So the longest
lag we have is 365 days, and the average is 180 days. But we're piling so much money into that business right now that
there is some lag, and that's being reflected in the 9.5% combined ROE.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Great, that's helpful.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: So again, when you look at it, we're not too concerned about the numbers. I mean actually
we're not very concerned at all at this point of 9.5%, because the authorizer is there, the recovery mechanism is there,
the real projects are there, so we just keep plowing away. And I think we are benefiting from the years that we've
started this transmission business, and we're reaching the critical mass in our own type of investments. And we feel
very good about what we're spending, how we're spending it, and certainly the recovery mechanisms are in place. So
you'll see – I mean, I guess since last year, we've been saying we're going to plow as much as capital as we can in the
transmission. And when you get out ahead of the recovery mechanisms in transmission, you're doing a lot but we're
happy with the progress.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Well, Nick, you last comment goes to my broader sort of question when I think about
execution risks for transmission. At EEI, you laid out the categories of projects and many of those looked, honestly to
me, as relatively low-risk projects, but at a high level, can you talk about execution risk to get to that higher case. What
are the key things on your mind when you think about that?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: I think there is minimal execution risk. These are actual projects that are on the same vein.
We are not gold plating anything. We are focused on refurbishing the grid and enhancing the grid to respond to
retirements, generation retirements, RTO-related projects. All those kinds of things that are in that plan and there is
minimal execution risk as long as we perform well, stay on budget, stay with the projects that we've got and ensure that
we've got the right message in terms of optimization and the activities we do in transmission are needed and that's
something we – what you're seeing in that list is really needed projects for reliability, not economic projects. Those are
additive, if they ever occur. So, and the other positive benefit is that once again the diversity of all of our states is a
positive, because we're investing not only in our states but the adjacent states and we've added Kansas and Missouri
through Transource. So we have some distinct opportunities in all those jurisdictions and the adjacent areas to really
have some tremendous benefits here and really ultimately tremendous benefits for our customers and as well the
optimization of the grid itself.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: That's great. Thank you very much.

Page 13 of 18
going on there and a long-term outlook?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes, I think you're right. I think we're seeing higher energy prices earlier than what we
thought. We really thought that it really take-off when the units that we're running with retirement. We're retiring 7,150
megawatts of coal-fired generation and 89% of that is running now. And if you start to see, which we're seeing an
economy start to improve and on the heels you're trying to retire that generation, certainly we expected energy prices to
continue to improve but this shows to me, it shows where the real world and the play world collides and it reflects
through in the energy prices. And if the capacity market is not well thought out in terms of enabling investors to invest
in advance relative to construction and everything else associated with the grid itself, then you wind up having this kind
of thing happen?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Hey, Paul, we've been paying in our market area for gas in the PJM part of our footprint
around $6 an MMBtu for gas. You're seeing PJM prices that are a $1,000 a megawatt-hour, during emergencies going
up to $1,800 a megawatt-hour. Do you think that people are being paid those prices are being paid for energy? They're
not. PJM is basically paying people for the value of their capacity to keep the lights on. It's not energy that they're being
paid for, it's capacity. We need to start getting some of those capacity rents back in the capacity auction because PJM is
showing the real value of having that capacity when they want to pay someone $1,800 when the price of gas is $6 an
MMBtu.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: I think if I remember back in 1984, I was in system operations and the same thing happened
where you had a very cold winter, taps get frozen, instrumentation gets frozen, natural gas isn't available and it winds
up being energy prices goes out the roof and then everyone of your coal units and every other resources you have is
brought on to run. And you also have with cold weather obviously coal piles can get frozen, but we haven't run into too
much of that. We've been successful in getting through this process.
But I think it shows the value of a balanced portfolio and when that portfolio was no longer balanced, you're going to
have additional risk that is placed upon the grid that we really do need to think about. And you brought up a great
question that I guess we can talk about all day, but it's clearly a message that I think everyone needs to really focus on
the future of the grid and what it actually means to service to our customers.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. I don't want to take a full day on it because I think you are right, we probably could, it's
interesting topic. Just back on transmission for a second, I mean you mention another stuff that's economic. Do we –
should we expect really no impact on rerating of the lines, any improvement on the actual transmission lines in terms
deliverability across regions or LDA as result?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: No, no, we're improving the deliverability. We are expanding the ratings of launch, we're
putting in additional transformers, we're putting additional substations. A substation – I mean we're building a
substation that nearly cost $250 million. So these aren't small investments that are being made, but they are investments
to reinforce and increase the capabilities of the grid itself and then as well with the generation retirements, there is lot
of planning around additional transmission resources to support those retirements as well.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Right. But I mean, should we think it perhaps there being an improvement in terms of
transmission between LDAs at all or I mean in terms of the actual change in the, I guess, the ability of power to go
places where – more power to go into certain areas?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes, you'll see it from a reliability perspective. From an economic perspective, it just takes
longer to do because I mean if you cross multi-states, then you get involved with cost allocation and the issues between
RTOs and that could be sort of a limiting factor until all of this gets fully rationalized but ultimately with the
retirements, with the changes in the way the system is being used, it is clear that transmission investment will be a
continued positive at least through the next decade.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And then just finally on the right of first refusal in Order 1000, is there any risk that third
parties might compete for this transmission CapEx?

<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes, a lot of the transmission that we're doing is our transmission project. So when you get
into the competitive projects, that's where Order 1000 comes into play and we think we're well positioned to compete in
that environment because we've been doing it for a while. And so not only do we have our own projects that are
providing the pipeline for that critical mass, but we also have those other projects that we're competitively bidding that
now we're seeing success in.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Hey, Paul, what you see in our forecast if our transmission spend and earnings is not subject
to ROFR. Those are projects that we control, that we have the ability to invest in and that are not going to be taken
from us by someone else competing for them.

Our next question is from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Hey. Just I think Brian mentioned in his remarks that prices are a lot higher near term than
what was in your plan, but that you'll be kind of over this multi-year period actively managing outages and expenses to
kind of stay within that range. Roughly, could you just maybe elaborate, I read that as a kind of if you're having a really
good period, you'll use that to invest more to benefit kind of the future periods, is that...
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes, you are right.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yes, Steve, so obviously as we're working our way into 2015, 2016, 2017 and you and others
have identified some of the shortfall that we have associated with the transition in Ohio and then the RPM pricing that
we're facing, we're going to be doing things like moving outages around during that time period, maybe pulling some
forward if we find ourselves a bit hot on earnings in an earlier period, maybe pushing them out into the 2017, 2018
timeframe. And we're really going to be managing our way through this to a very high degree as we work our way
through to make sure we stay in that cone that we've identified.
So if we come in – if we see things particularly hot, whether it's weather or pricing in 2014, we might pull some
outages or expenses out of 2015, 2016 into 2014 to help us manage our way through that process. So I think – your
description of it makes me think that you understand very well what we're doing.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: And that's a process that we've put in place here that I think is working just extremely well.
It not only gets capital to transmission, but it also enables us to move projects from one year to another end of the year
and that's really a positive process for us that we've put in place. It's worked very well. We continue to look at it. We
look at numbers on a pretty regular basis to ensure that we're managing the year in a proper fashion. We'll continue to
do that because as you all have pointed out, this 2014, 2015, 2016 years are critical for us, particularly 2016 because of
the capacity markets, but we're managing to it. And so far, we're doing very well.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay. And just in 2014, what is your specific savings in pension and OPEBs. I know that's
within your O&M budget, but just that specific line, what are the savings versus 2013?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Let me give you some detail on that, 2013 and we'll talk about two different things, Steve.
We'll talk about the pension cost and then the pension expense, okay. So the cost for 2013 was $114 million and the
expense ended up coming in being about $64 million, okay, the O&M expense. And then, we're forecasting for 2014
the cost to be about $84 million, and we're anticipating that the expense will be about $52 million. So the difference
year-on-year, the $64 million to the $31 million is about $33 million.

And we'll go to Brian Chin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Good morning, Brian.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Just given the recent weather and a little bit of how the current situation is unfolding, can you
give some color on coal days of inventory on hand, and does this prompt you to think that there might be some changes
to how you head into the contracting season for coal later this year?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Typically we pull down inventories during the winter months, and we've been on the order
of 30 days to 35 days on average for just about the whole year. I think it was at the top, it was around 40 days, and it's
down to 30 days, 35 days, and we're fine with that. And we'll be very sensitive about how much additional coal
procurement we do as a result. We have a pretty flexible system and lot of our contracts are pretty flexible. So we feel
pretty good about where we're at now. I don't think – we don't have any changing conditions or requirements that we're
placing on our coal buying efforts because of the weather. We're just performing as we thought we would.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: We've got more coal than the country has cold right now. We're good to go.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Got you, thank you very much.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes.

And our next question is from Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please, go ahead.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Hey, good morning. I have a question on Nick's favorite slide, the equalizer slide. And
just two part, where do you think the ROEs could go or what do you think is a normalized level of ROE? And what
type of sensitivity could you give us, say, for every 50 basis point change in this regulated operational ROE, we could
see a $0.10 improvement in earnings or something?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes, so I think when you look at the equalizer chart, I like for it to be with a ten handle on it.
And certainly, we said long term we're looking around 10.2% – 10.3%, in that range. And you're seeing a quarterly
perturbation of a lot of activity that's coming into play here. So as long as it stays in that range, we're in good shape.
And I don't know, Brian, do you have anything you want to add?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: I don't. Anthony, we could get you some type of sensitivity for across the system what a 50
basis point change in overall ROE would be. We can get that for you.
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Great, thank you.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes.

<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Good morning, Jonathan.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Quickly on rates for 2014, you had at EEI $197 million penciled in, now it's $175 million.
Is that change in things that came in lower or lower assumption on the things you haven't yet got?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: 2013 came in a little bit higher, so the difference is a little bit lower.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: So it's basically the 2013 starting point?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yes.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Great, and then secondly, just coming back to this demand question and in the context of
some of your comments about managing within the cone, when you did take down the residential forecast for this year
by I think 80 basis points and commercial by 90 basis points, in less than three months. So are you genuinely seeing
that much more concern than you were seeing in November, or is this a little conservatism to offset other stuff?
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Yes, so you asked us two different questions with the same answer. The answer for your
prior question is the same as this one; 2013 came in a little bit higher.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay, all right. Thanks, Brian.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Thanks, Jon.

We'll go to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Yes, two questions unrelated. First on the transmission side, we've seen in the MISO and in
New England dockets where interveners are seeking lower transmission based ROEs. If the same thing happens in
some of – whether it's the Southwest power pool, whether it's in PJM, what do you think the tipping point is where it
will change your incentive or your desire to be a sizable investor in transmission in the U.S.?
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: I think as long as transmission is at a premium or equal to the state rates, we're in good
shape. I think clearly, there is an incentive being placed on building transmission. We're happy with that. And really
once again, the FERC needs to send some messages here that from a policy perspective, if we want to continue building
transmission in this country. And as long as that premium is at or above the state rates, then we're in good shape.
<A - Brian X. Tierney>: FERC was clearly, Michael, looking to attract capital into this space, and what they've done
with their ROEs has done exactly what FERC wanted to happen. So as Nick was saying, as long as they continue to
send a signal that they want increased investment in this area, we'll respond to that signal.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: I think it continues to be part and parcel of the overall grid expansion that's going on and the
resilience of the grid and there is going to continue to be spend regardless. The question is do you really want to satisfy
that precursor of transmission being built out to respond to the generation, retirements, and so forth to optimize the
grid, so that you can do that as a prerequisite and then focus on the rest of the underlying system. That's what's key. I
think you've got to get through this transitional process we're at in this industry. So transmission needs to be
incentivized in that regard because that will provide the greatest benefit in terms of resiliency of the grid, but also in
terms of the optimization of the resources that are attached to the grid.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. And just looking at your non-transmission investments, so the jurisdictions where
you have distribution and/or generation rate base, where do you see the greatest year-over-year changes in capital
spending? Where do you see a slowing of capital spending?

<A - Brian X. Tierney>: Incrementally more, Michael, in the OPCo T investments across our system is where we're
seeing significantly more investment. We're also seeing increased investment in our Cook Nuclear Power Plant and
associated with some of the environmental investments that we're having to make to be responsive to MATS by 2015.
So those are the general areas where we're seeing incremental investment.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes, I think we're at $3.5 billion to $4 billion on the environmental spend now over the
period. And then when you look at the other capital that we're spending, it's block-and-tackle spending that typically is
recovered from a regulated standpoint. So we're in a position where we're not having to build large central station
generation, but we are able to focus on transmission and distribution investments that are clearly beneficial to
customers and customers actually see, and that's a positive.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it, guys. Thank you, much appreciated.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Okay.

Now, we go to Hugh Wynne with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: Hi.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Good morning, Hugh.
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: Good morning. My question is on page 11. It appears there that probably half or
more of your expected pre-tax earnings improvement by 2016 will be driven by generation and perhaps a quarter or
less by distribution. When I think of the generation segment, that's obviously one that transitioning to competition in an
environment of $60 per megawatt-day capacity prices. Distribution, on the other hand, is probably, I would imagine,
half of your rate base, half of your O&M, a lot of that at utilities that are under-earning. I'm wondering if you can give
some color on the skew of these earnings improvements towards generation and the relatively small contribution from
distribution.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: I think it's just a matter that generation typically has the big ticket items that can be adjusted.
And when you look at consumables for a scrubber, the way all the parasitic load operates within the plant, certainly the
way that you contract for the activities associated with it, particularly in terms of use of contractors versus use of
employees, all those types of things are substantial within the generation framework. And there again, generation
functions, each plant functions as its own profit center. And so doing that, it can focus more readily on the benefits
associated with optimization of how they operate. From a distribution standpoint, it really is a matter of outage
scheduling, management with the customers, the processes that are in place that goes back through the organization.
So at least in our view, when you reach from the customer side of things, you want the distribution side to be very
robust in terms of the way it operates to provide the customer experience that we're asking for. From the generation
side, that's all done as a back-office function, and it contributes heavily to the benefits from an O&M perspective but
also from a capital perspective. And that's our expectation as we get through this. Nuclear, that process hasn't been
through Lean activities. They started the Lean activities. Obviously, we're very careful because nuclear is different, but
it is a heavy capital and O&M spend and there are opportunities for optimization there as well. So I think we've got the
right balance when you look at generation. And then when you look at transmission and distribution together, we are on
par.
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: Great, thank you very much.
<A - Nicholas K. Akins>: Yes.
