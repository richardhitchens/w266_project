Simon Ayat, Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer
Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Fourth quarter earnings
per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits was $1.08. This is flat sequentially, and $0.02
lower when compared to the same quarter last year. As a reminder, all the prior year amounts have been restated as the
distribution segment has been reclassified to discontinued operations, following the sales of Wilson and CE Franklin in
the second and third quarters of this year.
During the quarter, we recorded $0.04 of integration charges and $0.02 of charges relating to workforce reductions in
connection with an initiative to rationalize global overhead costs. With Smith integration charges, were a little larger
than our historical run rate due to the fact that we incurred the number of agency terminations and facility exit costs
during the quarter. Going forward, we do not intend to highlight these integration costs separately as they are not
anticipated to be significant.
Fourth quarter revenue of $11.2 billion increased 5.3% sequentially. Of this $567 million sequential increase,
approximately half of this growth came from the year-end surge in product, software and WesternGeco multiclient
sales that we typically experience in Q4.
Oilfield services pre-tax income of $2.2 billion increased 1% sequentially. Pre-tax operating margins were down 83
basis points, as the positive effects of year-end product sales were not enough to overcome the impact of the higher
than usual seasonal slowdowns in activity and contractual delays experienced during the quarter.
Sequential revenue and pre-tax margin highlights by Product Group were as follows. Fourth quarter Reservoir
Characterization Group revenue of $3.2 billion increased 8.2% sequentially and margins improved 31 basis points to
29.1%. These increases were largely driven by the traditionally strong end-of-year software and multiclient sales, offset
in part by the impact of lower WesternGeco marine vessel utilization. It is also worth mentioning that Testing Services,
Wireline and PetroTechnical Services all experienced sequential margin growth as a result of more favorable revenue
mix.
Drilling Group fourth quarter revenue of $4.1 billion increased 2.2%, while margin declined by 128 basis points to
16.8%. The revenue increase was largely attributable to robust Drilling & Measurement activity in the Middle East and
Asia area, and the strong performance from M-I SWACO in the Europe/CIS/Africa area.
The margin decline was primarily due to contractual delays in IPM and an overall less favorable revenue mix. Fourth
quarter Production Group revenue of $3.9 billion increased 6.8% sequentially as a result of strong Completions and
Artificial Lift product sales across all areas, combined with the new Framo subsea projects.
Pretax margin was essentially flat at 15%, as the impact of the strong Completions and Artificial Lift and Framo
performances were largely offset by continued pricing pressure in US land as a result of excess hydraulic horsepower
capacity in the market. From a geographical perspective, North America margin improved by 65 basis points to 19.2%,
while international margin declined 104 basis points to 20.5%.
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate excluding charges and credits was 23.8% in the fourth
quarter compared to 23.6% in the previous quarter. Net debt at the end of the quarter was $5.1 billion, representing a
$1.1 billion improvement as compared to the end of third quarter. Significant liquidity events during the quarter
included $1.5 billion of CapEx, and an improvement in working capital of approximately $850 million.
Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a 13.6% increase in our annual dividend to $1.25 per share. This follows
last year's 10% increase and the 19% increase in 2011, and reflects our commitment to generate and return excess cash
to our shareholders.
During the full year 2012, we repurchased 14.1 million shares at an average price of $68.99 for a total of $972 million.
We did not repurchase any stock during the fourth quarter as our buyback activity for the first nine months of the year
more than offset the dilution caused by our stock-based compensation programs during all of 2012.

CapEx is expected to be approximately $3.9 billion in 2013 as compared to the $4.7 billion we spent in 2012, which
included an acceleration of part of the first quarter of 2013 CapEx.
And now, I turn the conference over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Simon. Our fourth quarter results showed continued growth in key markets, in addition to the typical year
end products, software and multiclient sales. However, while revenue grew sequentially by 5% to set a new record for
the Company, pretax operating margins slipped by 83 basis points, and I will elaborate on this as I review the
operational results by region.
Looking at the international markets, revenue grew by 6% sequentially, while margins were down 104 basis points
from the three-year high of last quarter. Overall, service activity and product sales were strong during the quarter.
However, results were impacted by the previously stated seasonal slowdown and contractual delays, and also
mobilization costs for several new projects.
International service capacity remains tight in our seismic, drilling and measurements, wireline and well testing product
lines. While pricing in terms of revenue per rig continued its slow but steady progression during the fourth quarter
driven by strong execution, new technology sales and proactive bidding on small to medium-sized contacts.
In Latin America, revenue was up 11% sequentially and margins up 30 basis points driven by strong activity
throughout the region. In Mexico, rig activity grew both offshore and on land with additional coiled tubing and
stimulation work focused on unconventionals as well as a full deepwater well testing program. Activity in our IPM
projects remained robust and the ramp-up in our Carrizo and Panuco SPM projects continued according to plan.
In Brazil, we saw strong sequential growth driven by our seismic and well testing product lines while overall offshore
activity continue to shift from deepwater exploration in the Santos Basin towards development and production
enhancement work in the Campos Basin.
In Argentina, activity also picked up during the quarter driven by drilling and stimulation activity in the Neuquen basin,
and from the startup of a new IPM project in the Vaca Muerta shale.
In Venezuela, we have, in recent years, actively managed our activity levels relative to our receivables balance. During
the fourth quarter, we saw a significant slowdown in the rate of payments and we are currently working closely with
our customer to resolve the situation.
In the Middle East & Asia, revenue grew by 10% sequentially, while margins were down 91 basis points, driven by
activity mix and startup costs for several IPM projects in the region. During the quarter, we saw the strongest growth in
the Middle East, where activity on both land and offshore, in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and United Arab Emirates led to
record revenue levels in these countries.
In Iraq revenue grew over 60% sequentially also reaching an all-time high, as we started off the remaining rigs leading
to our recent IPM contract wins. Operational execution continues to be strong on our well construction project in Iraq,
however, delays in obtaining the needed regulatory approvals impacted startup timing for several projects and
consequently profitability for the quarter.
China again posted strong results, with a seasonal slowdown on land, being more than offset by activity growth
offshore in Bohai Bay and the South China Sea. The focus on unconventionals in China remains very strong and based
on the strategic moves we made in 2012, we are well positioned to capitalize on this growth opportunity going forward.
And in Australia, we continue to grow in the fourth quarter, as rig activity ramped up further in our IPM project in the
Queensland coal-bed methane and also due to strong offshore drilling activity in the North West.

In Europe, CIS, and Africa revenue was down 1% sequentially and margins were down 203 basis points. In the North
Sea, we saw the start of the seasonal slowdown, in particular, for seismic activity, which had a significant impact on the
sequential results. However, we maintain a positive outlook on the North Sea for 2013, driven by both exploration and
development activity in Norway and the UK.
In North Africa, further contractual delays also had an impact on fourth quarter results. While these delays continued
into January, we expect the situation to be resolved during the first quarter. Sub-Sahara Africa had a good quarter on
offshore activity in both West and East Africa.
Looking at 2013, the outlook for the region remained strong driven by East Africa exploration, Angola presalt activity
and Gulf of Guinea exploration and development work.
Russia and Central Asia saw flat sequential activity driven by the start of the seasonal winter slowdown both on land
and offshore. However, we see solid growth in the coming year both in Western Siberia, the Caspian region and in
Sakhalin and the first arctic project is also expected to start up in the second quarter.
In North America, sequential revenue was up 4% and margins were up 65 basis points driven by very strong
performance in the Gulf of Mexico. In North America land our results were again negatively impacted by lower than
expected activity in Canada and by 8% sequential drop in the US land rig count.
In our hydraulic fracturing business, the lower pricing levels continued to penetrate our contract base, and further
impacted margins in the fourth quarter. In addition, with the drop in liquids activity, we also saw clear signs of pricing
weakness in our drilling, coiled tubing and cased-hole wireline product lines during the quarter.
Still the continued weakening of North America land margins was more than offset by strong activity and excellent
performance in the Gulf of Mexico, while deepwater drilling activity reached pre-Macondo levels as expected.
In WesternGeco, we continue to operate one dual coil fleet in the Central Gulf while multiclient sales saw the normal
year-end increase driven by the Central Gulf lease sale scheduled for March of this year. Overall, our strong operational
and market share position in the Gulf of Mexico is becoming increasingly accretive to our North American margins.
Let me now turn to some of the technology highlights for the quarter. In the Reservoir Characterization Group,
WesternGeco completed the first IsoMetrix season which included three commercial projects. IsoMetrix results were
presented at the SEG Annual Conference in November of 2012 and the technology continues to attract a great deal of
attention as exploration of difficult and complex reservoir prospects continues. The first explorer class vessel upgrade
to IsoMetrix to WesternGeco Vespucci is currently underway and two IsoMetrix vessels will be available in 2013.
In December 2011, we announced the purchase of the US Company ThruBit which offers a pump-down openhole
logging suite that enables wiper trip logging of horizontal wells. In 2012, ThruBit saw a rapidly growing client base
and a 93% increase in revenue. Recently, the technology has been successfully applied in the Bakken to optimize the
stimulation design in the horizontal sections helping to improve productivity and to reduce costs.
In the Drilling Group, our Drilling & Measurements product line show increased uptake of the NeoScope sourceless
formation evaluation service. This technology offers a comprehensive suite of 12 formation evaluation measurements
while eliminating the need for the traditional source and thereby reducing operational risk. The off take has been
widespread covering North American shale plays, Japanese methane hydrates, conventional reservoirs in the Middle
and Far East and remote deepwater exploration work, offshore South America.
In the Production Group, Well Services introduced the SPARK frac fluid delivery platform in 2012, offering our
vertically integrated customers access to Schlumberger's engineered fluid systems such as HiWAY, while utilizing their
own personnel and hydraulic horsepower.
The off take of the new offering progressed well during 2012 with over 1,100 stages sold to a growing customer base in
both the US and China, and we expect continued growth for this offering in 2013.

Also in the quarter, we announced a creation of OneSubsea, a joint venture with Cameron to manufacture and develop
products, systems and services for the subsea oil and gas market. This market represents a unique opportunity for
growth, as the new joint venture seeks to create a step change in the reservoir recovery through integration and
optimization of the entire production system over the life of the field.
The integration of the production system will be accomplished by combining superior reservoir knowledge and well
bore capabilities with industry-leading subsea technologies all together delivering enhanced productivity, reliability,
and integrity. We anticipate closing the transaction during the first quarter of this year.
Let's then turn to the macro environment, where there continues to be uncertainty. However, GDP growth outlook for
2013 remains in line with the previous quarter at the back of positive data points from China and the US and a more or
less unchanged situation in the euro-zone.
Looking at the global oil market, 2013 demand is expected to grow at similar levels to 2012, excluding any major
macroeconomic changes. The supply side will see further growth in North America, while the rest of non-OPEC
production will likely continue to face challenges, leading to a fairly similar coal and OPEC production in 2013.
Based on this we do not see any major change in the global spare capacity in the coming year and we expect brent
prices to remain in a broadly similar price band as seen in 2012.
In the international gas market, LNG prices in Asia are expected to continue to benefit from high demand in Japan and
China, while in Europe the impact of lower demand is expected to be offset by decline in domestic production leaving
the market balance relatively unchanged.
Looking at our industry, there have been no material changes to overall customer activity plans or sentiments during
the quarter and we expect international E&P spend to grow around 10% in the coming year. Based on a favorable
activity mix and continued focus on execution, we expect to grow our international operating income in excess of this
number in 2013.
In North America, we see continued market uncertainty going forward. US land liquids activity is expected to recover
somewhat in the first half of the year, but for the full year we see US land rig count slightly down versus 2012.
US natural gas production remained strong and at this stage, we do not see a significant recovery in dry gas related
drilling activity in the coming year. Based on this, the industry will still be faced with oversupply of hydraulic
horsepower. In addition, the lower rig activity in the fourth quarter has already created pricing pressure in many of the
non-pressure pumping product lines in US land, which will create further pressure on North America land margins
going forward.
So in summary, we expect the overall market trends of 2012 to carry forward into 2013. With solid growth in
international spending and strong activity in the US Gulf of Mexico with the offsetting factor being continued
challenges in North America land. In this environment, our well-balanced business portfolio, wide geographical
footprint and strong operational execution capabilities position us well to capitalize on these trends and to continue to
show good growth in overall earnings per share.
Thank you very much. I will now hand the call over to Malcolm for the Q&A session.

Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And we'll go to the line of James West with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.
James West, Analyst
Hey good morning, Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
Good morning.
James West, Analyst
So, clearly another good move higher this quarter for international volumes, but a little margin slippage as you
highlighted. It seems to me the contract delays, the startup costs, this is all pretty transitory. Is that accurate? And if so
-- take out the seasonal factors I guess for a second, when do those type of sort of costs and delays -- when do those
abate or have they already abated at this point?
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
Well, I agree with you. The impact we saw in profitability in Q4 is down to mix, some of these transitory delays and
the seasonal slowdown as you're referring to. So, most of these issues are more or less behind us in terms of what was
unusual for Q4. We will continue to see the normal seasonal slowdown in the North Sea, Russia, and China land in Q1.
And the only other lingering issue we have is the contractual situation in North Africa, but overall the issues that were
exceptional in Q4 are more or less behind us.
James West, Analyst
Okay, good. Good to hear. And then, we obviously agree with your international E&P spending outlook for this year.
What do you see as the biggest growth areas for Schlumberger this year, and are there any markets that you think could
be particularly challenging as well, excluding North America land?
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
Well, if I look at international next year, we will see -- the more significant growth in ECA and MEA, we will also see
growth in Latin America, but the overall activity levels in Brazil is more or less flat year-over-year. So that will have an
impact on Latin America growth. But if I look at ECA, we see significant growth overall in sub-Saharan Africa, where
we have a very strong position. And we also see quite significant growth in Russia. So I would say ECA the main
growth locomotives next year will be Sub-Sahara Africa and overall Russia, both land and offshore.
And then in MEA I will say overall the Middle East, Saudi Arabia, Iraq but also Kuwait, UAE, Oman will all be very
strong for us. And in Asia, it's predominantly China and Australia which is going to be driving growth.
James West, Analyst

Thank you. We'll go to the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
Kurt Hallead, Analyst
Hey good morning, Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
Good morning.
Kurt Hallead, Analyst
Just wanted to maybe hit you up on the North American front. And I know that there is still quite a bit of uncertainty on
the US land, but I think the indications are that there is going to be a pickup in some time here in the first quarter. So,
with the pickup in activity on the horizon, wouldn't it be safe to assume that margins would pretty much hit their low
points in aggregate for North America land in the first quarter? And if not, can you just kind of walk us through how
you see things evolving?
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
I am not ready to predict exactly why North America land margins are going to trough. There is one new element of
uncertainty this quarter, which is further pricing pressure outside of hydraulic fracturing, right. But if you look at our
view on 2013 for North America, we do expect the US land rig count to be up between about 100 rigs and 150 rigs in
Q1, and this is based on the feedback from our customers. So that's in line with what you are indicating. Now, in terms
of activity for the full year, we still see US land rig count slightly down versus 2012, while the well count will be
slightly up.
Now if you look at Canada, the rig count is already over 500 so far in January, but we still see the full year also being
down in 2012 versus sorry, down versus 2012. Now then the other major uncertainty in North America land is pricing.
So it seems clear that we will continue to face oversupply of horsepower given the rig count outlook. So, we don't
really see any significant recovery in hydraulic fracturing pricing in the coming year. And then you have the other
uncertainty where we saw about a 5% pricing drop on average in the other product lines on land in Q4.
And this is going to have an impact going forward, but I would say at this stage the further evolution is not clear, and I
think it's going to be a function of how quickly the rig count climbs back up going forward, right. So, I would say that
in North America land there will continue to be margin challenges at least in the coming two quarters as far as I've
seen.
Kurt Hallead, Analyst
As a follow up, thanks for that. And as a follow-up, obviously, the Gulf of Mexico is kind of, positive dynamic. Can
you give us some indications of what you might expect for maybe revenue growth in the Gulf of Mexico year-on-year,

and is that all going to be driven by the Oilfield Services product line or is there going to be some combination of
seismic and services?
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
Well, we expect both the drilling related activities as well as seismic to be strong in the Gulf of Mexico for this year. If
you look at the rig activity, we don't see any major rig additions in H1 after we had a surge of, I think, seven additional
rigs in Q4. But, I mean, overall rig activity year-over-year will be up more than 20% without Q4 addition. In terms of
seismic, we are continuing to run one seismic fleet in the Central Gulf. You'll see what happens in terms of late sales
leading up to the new sales now in March. But I'm also continuing to be positive on seismic and in the Gulf of Mexico.
Kurt Hallead, Analyst
Okay, great. Thanks, Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Ole Slorer with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ole Slorer, Analyst
Yeah, thanks a lot. Paal, I wonder whether you could just elaborate a little bit more here on OneSubsea. You talked
about the importance of enhanced recovery subsea a little while ago. You closed the deal. Could you, now that you
have some time to reflect on it, could you help us understand a little bit more how having access to OneSubsea will
change the core business at Schlumberger or enhance it?
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
Well, I think, first of all, the creation of OneSubsea will allow us to make a much more significant entry into the overall
subsea business. We had some very good, I would say, niche technologies and Framo has seen tremendous growth in
recent years, but it was evident that we needed to combine that with a much broader offering, and I think, Cameron is
going to be an excellent partner for us with that in mind. So, I think it's a bit early to say exactly what the impact in the
rest of the business is going to be.
If you look at the rest of our business, a lot of that will be focused around the life of field part of subsea around well
intervention, which is not something that we're immediately going to focus on in OneSubsea. But the fact that we are
much, I would say, deeper in sanctioning the business through this JV will allow us to move a lot closer to the customer
side that focuses on these type of developments. So overall, I see it as a strong positive growth.
Ole Slorer, Analyst
So, is it enhanced recovery at the tail end of the field that you think is the opportunity for Schlumberger through having
access to, I'm talking about impact on Schlumberger's core business, not what's put into OneSubsea, or is it getting

involved early stage in helping how to design wellbores and based on the knowledge that you have from the reservoir
side and how that could impact the design of the field development? I'm still not sure if I understand exactly how it's
going to enhance Schlumberger's business the most.
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
Now, it's a good question. It's actually both. So, through the OneSubsea JV, we'll, obviously, be much more involved
with the customer discussions around how to develop these fields, and that has to do with our reservoir characterization
capabilities. And it also has to do with our, I would say, wellbore capabilities around ESPs and intelligent completions.
So, I think both that reservoir understanding as well as the wellbore capabilities that we have will be integral to how
these developments would be done in the future. And then you add a much more intelligent wellbore to a more
sophisticated production plans on the sea floor including both boosting and compression and potentially separation, that
is how the overall development in my mind are going to be done in the future.
So, we will have that early involvement, where through the JV we will potentially take on people with reservoir
background and well background into the project teams. And then beyond that you have intervention and, I would say,
later field activities that we will continue to be involved with as the life of the field progresses.
Ole Slorer, Analyst
Okay. So, it sounds as if you are trying to lift Schlumberger's position versus the oil company to a higher level at an
earlier stage in how fields are developed. That will be correct?
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
That's correct.
Ole Slorer, Analyst
Second question will be on IsoMetrix. Could you give us any kind of feedback from these initial studies had or not how
they have helped your clients to solve more complex issues? Are there any examples of that now?
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
Well, it's still early days, right. We have done three commercial surveys in this season. I think it will take little bit of
time to process the data, but the early indication from what we have seen from the data together with our customers is
very positive, right. And the ability to, I would say, image the reservoir much more accurately will benefit, in
particular, the prospects that are more difficult to image.
Ole Slorer, Analyst
Okay, well, finally, Simon, I'd just like to congratulate you on helping rein in the CapEx here and drive free cash flow.
And if you can also convince your guys to do some more buybacks, then I think that will be very good for the share
price.

Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
Good morning.
Michael LaMotte, Analyst
First question, Paal, Simon, I don't know which of you want to address this one. But I do want to follow-up on Ole's
comment on the lower CapEx. And in particular as it relates to asset turns and the efficiency initiatives that are
currently underway. There are two aspects in particular that I'd like to ask you to address, one is the reliability of the
tools, and two is just overall utilization, both seemed to be going up quite a bit with revenue growth forecasts up and
CapEx down. Could you speak to those?
Simon Ayat, Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Michael. Well, let me take just overall CapEx. So as we said we will spend $3.9 billion in 2013 as compared to
what we spent 4.7. It is the shift of activity, obviously, that impacted our decision to lower CapEx. And we in 2012 had
accelerated a bit in the Q4 what we were going to spend in 2013. But you are absolutely right, the efficiency plans and
programs that we have will improve the tool turns and asset turns that we experienced in the past. It is an early stage in
2003 to see a significant impact from this, but it is a plan that is going to take several quarters, if not years, to get to an
optimum situation, but it is reflected in 2013.
The major part in 2013 is really more of an activity shift, acceleration in 2012, and to lesser extent the performance that
you referred to, but the performance eventually will be a major factor in determining the CapEx spent in Schlumberger
and between the different segments. Is this good enough?

Michael LaMotte, Analyst
Yeah, it's very good. Thank you. And maybe, Paal, for the follow-up, I'm curious if internationally there are any signs
of an emerging interest in tight oil or unconventional applications to conventional reserves or even shale oil. Is what's
happened in the Bakken and Eagle Ford starting to go global yet?
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
Well, I think there is a general high interest of unconventionals all around the world. You find it in many countries.
Where we stand today, it's still in early stages in most places, where there is all about data gathering, I would say,
exploration in terms of, can these resources be developed in economic and viable way. If I look at the two countries
which are probably furthest down the road on doing something that is more material, it is China and Argentina. And
China is predominantly focused on shale gas at this stage, while I think there is more of a balance in Argentina between
liquids and gas. So, those are the two countries, which I think we'll see the most activity increase in the near-term.
Michael LaMotte, Analyst
So, from a field standpoint, it's still very much a gas focus, but is it fair to say that oil is perhaps sort of emerging from
a science standpoint at this point or it's still too early?
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
I think it's still too early to say how predominant that's going to be. I think the interest is there for the shale. There is a
lot more data gathering and testing that needs to be done to see what's the balance between gas and liquids.
Michael LaMotte, Analyst

While the subsea tree market continues to grow, investors have been disappointed by a drop in Cameron's market share.
Now you had a chance to look under the hood at their business, what do you think are the prospects for share gain in
trees by OneSubsea and what can Schlumberger do to help push for a greater share of awards?
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
Well, I don't want to make any specific comments about Cameron market shares or trees. I think we've had a very good
dialog and discussion with Cameron in terms of their view of the market versus our view of the market. We have very
coinciding views that it is very important to try to do something differently and focus a lot more on production
optimization and recovery optimization. The tree will be a key part of that, but there is also a lot of other aspects around
the subsea production plant, as well as I also referred to earlier in terms of the wellbore technologies and reservoir
understanding. So, when it comes to the situation around Cameron tree market share, I think you need to talk to
Cameron about that.
Scott Gruber, Analyst
Got it. And, Simon, can you provide a split of growth or decline in the CapEx in '13 between North America and
international?
Simon Ayat, Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer
We're not going to go into all of these details, but majority of the spend in 2013 will be related to international.
Scott Gruber, Analyst
So, will international be up a little bit in '13 then?
Simon Ayat, Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer
Yes, on an average, yes, it is up compared to 2012 and the reduction will be in North America.

Bill Herbert, Analyst
Thanks, good morning. Paal with regard to your outlook. You mentioned that your expectation was for international
E&P capital spending to be up 10% and your growth in international operating income to outpace the 10% growth in
overall E&P capital spending. Could you talk a little bit about your expectations for international revenue growth? I
would expect that you would also expect that to be up, outpace the overall growth in E&P capital spending as well. Is
that correct or not?
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
I think that's fair to say. I'm not going to go into the details of exactly what numbers we are targeting, but I think it's fair
to say that both revenue and operating income, we are aiming to grow that faster than that spend or rig count increase,
right. And just for reference, if you look at our 2012 numbers, we grew revenue 16% internationally and operating
income by 31% at the back end of 8% growth in rig count. So, I'm not saying that we're going to repeat those numbers,
but I think there is potential and we have capabilities of doing what I'm just saying.
Bill Herbert, Analyst
Is there any reason to believe that your international incremental margins are going to be markedly different from the
close to 35% number that you generated in 2012?
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
I don't think there is anything that is dramatically different in the international market 2013 versus 2012, whether we
can do the exact same incremental margins, we will obviously continue to focus on doing that. But I'm not commenting
anything at this stage.
Bill Herbert, Analyst
Okay. And then last one from me. Can we talk a little bit about Saudi outlook. Coming out of the third quarter call, you
mentioned that activity in 2013 for Saudi was going to be strong, largely based upon the pretty considerable increase in
activity over 2012 and persisting over the course of 2013, but you did not expect, if memory serves, for activity in
Saudi Arabia to grow considerably in '13 versus exit 2012. Is that the same position that you have today?
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
No, I think based on our discussions with Saudi Aramco over the past quarter, we have changed it slightly based on the
feedback. So, as you said, we ended the year at about 134 rigs, which was pretty much in line with the plan that Saudi
Aramco laid out earlier in 2012. We saw very strong Manifa activity, rig lift activity in the Q4 and also, they're starting
up a deepwater rig in the Red Sea in addition to the shallow-water exploration that they have there. Now, in terms of
the outlook, we are expecting around 160 rigs, up from 134. So, 160 rigs by year-end 2013. And that's the latest
feedback we have from Saudi Aramco.
Bill Herbert, Analyst
So, the 160 versus 134 is actually considerably better than what you saw coming out of the third quarter call, correct?

Angie Sedita, Analyst
Thanks, good morning.
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
Good morning.
Angie Sedita, Analyst
Paal, I believe you said China is one of your fastest growing geo-markets in 2013. And it is already a fairly good sized
market for you. Can you talk about some of the opportunities there. And can you also discuss the traction you've seen
with the Anton Oil joint venture?
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I can. So, if you look at the market trends in China, for a long time, we had a very strong position offshore in
Bohai Bay, but on land, our market access has been more limited mainly due to the Chinese operators predominantly
using their own Chinese service companies to do their work. Now, with the old conventional activity and the many new
players entering there, this really opens up the land market. And at the same time we are also seeing higher demand for
new technology and also the IPM business model from our traditional Chinese customers as they embark with more
complex land project. So, at the back end of these trends we've done a number of strategic moves in 2012 as you know.
The 20% stake in Anton Oil is one. The other thing we did with Anton Oil was that we formed a JV with them focusing
our IPM projects and more caution on China land. So, it is still early days for that JV, but we are actively pursuing
work and it gives us another, I would say entrance into the China land market.
Angie Sedita, Analyst
Right, okay. Very helpful. And then on North America you mentioned the 5% drop in pricing in your non-pressure
pumping product lines in Q4. Are you still seeing any swelling and softness in Q1 or is it status quo?

Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
Well, I don't really have a lot of information yet on Q1. So, that's why I am saying it's still uncertain. We saw that drop
in pricing in Q4 which was partly linked to the softness in rig activity. So, it's unclear yet whether that is going to
continue down in Q1 or whether the rig off take, which we are hoping to see will stabilize it.
Angie Sedita, Analyst
Okay. And then as a follow-on on pressure pumping. Given the softness in pricing what will it take for you to consider
unstacking equipment. Would you need to see long-term contracts or would need to see better pricing?
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
While we operate on the product of pricing and utilization. So, if we can, if that product is over our target or hurdle, we
will reactivate fleets. We're not planning to do any of that at this stage, but we're obviously continuing to follow the
situation closely. In Q4, we kept the crew count flat versus Q3. So, we didn't lay down any more crews in Q4.
Angie Sedita, Analyst
Okay, thanks. Thanks, Paal. I'll turn it over.
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
Thank you.

Thank you. Next question is from Bill Sanchez with Howard Weil. Please go ahead.
William Sanchez, Analyst
Thanks, good morning. Paal, I was just curious if you could talk a little bit about, you mentioned now in the press
release and your prepared comments regarding, you're starting to at least be proactive on bidding on the small to
medium-sized contracts in terms of international pricing push here. I am just curious what kind of success rate are you
having so far in making that push and what's really driving that in terms of you're feeling now is the time to do that?
Is it because we've pretty much booked, if you will, or have seen the rearview mirror the big, larger tenders that were a
source of price competition last year, those are behind, this has now given you a better fairway to go ahead and push
more aggressively on these smaller medium-sized contracts.
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I think that's fair. As we talked about throughout the conference calls in the past year, we have been pushing or
testing pricing on these smaller to medium term in the contracts basically throughout 2012. And I would say our
success rate has been reasonably good. You win some and you lose some whenever you try to push pricing up, but I
would said that overall we're pleased with the contract wins we have for those type of contracts and that type of pricing
strategy.

So, you're right to say that, on the large contracts, which is multiservice line and also multi-year and multi-rig, it is still
quite competitive, but most of those contracts which still represents a relatively small part of our overall contract
volume, most of those contracts are already bid, not all of them are awarded but most of them are bid based on where
we stand in the cycle.
William Sanchez, Analyst
Okay, fair enough. And I guess, just one follow-up. I guess, fair to say Paal, given your comments around the operating
income growth you see internationally, I guess, it's fair to think that your earnings growth 2013 versus 2012, you're still
expecting that to be double-digit growth this year. Is that fair?
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I would say, we're overall still aiming for double-digit growth in earnings per share in 2013. So, this is assuming
no major setbacks in the global economy. And also no further significant setbacks in North America. So, I already
highlighted the key growth drivers in international being ECA and MEA, while the offsetting factors tend to be what's
happening in North America land, but yes, overall we're still aiming for double-digit growth in earnings per share in
2013.
William Sanchez, Analyst
If I could slip one more and I guess everybody is trying to do the math in terms of just looking to North America
performance and clearly the Gulf of Mexico contribution, is it fair to say maybe, Simon, it's a question for you, a
quarter of North America revenue this quarter is coming from the Gulf of Mexico? Is it that high?
Simon Ayat, Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer
It's correct, that the Gulf of Mexico increased compensated for a drop in land, yes.
William Sanchez, Analyst
Right, but in terms of just a percentage of your revenue contribution, North America from the Gulf, it's about 25% this
past quarter.
Simon Ayat, Executive VP and Chief Financial Officer
It is a bit lower.
William Sanchez, Analyst
Little bit lower. Okay, thank you, all for the time.

Thank you. We'll go to David Anderson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
David Anderson, Analyst
Thanks. Paal, you had mentioned the increase in Saudi rig count this year. Can you characterize about where that
growth is coming from? Is that primarily natural gas related?
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
Well, I don't have the details of it. There is some, obviously there's some natural gas in it, but it's obviously still oil as
well. So I don't have the breakdown for you. I have the breakdown in terms of drilling and workover. The 160 is about
117, 118 on drilling and the balance of 42 being workover.
David Anderson, Analyst
Okay. And can you discuss kind of some of your unconventional workover there. Is that starting to become a bigger
part of your business over there? Are you still into some kind of Reservoir Characterization stage or are you starting to
kind of go at these wells and starting to look at doing some horizontal wells this year, or you're expecting to?
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
Yeah. I'll leave most of the commentary to how Saudi Aramco wants to communicate around their unconventionals to
them, but we are involved with a project which is still largely in the exploration type of phase, right. So, still it's limited
in terms of oil activity what we are involved with.
David Anderson, Analyst
Okay. If I could just -- completely unrelated follow up. On your North America market you talked about your SPARK
initiatives somewhat contributing this quarter. Can you just kind of give us a sense as to basically how many kind of
pressure pumping fleets that would represent? In order words how many fleets are you not using and using applying
SPARK. And also who are the ideal customers for these initiatives?
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, so if you look at number of 1,100 stages it's obviously a very big number at this stage. And that number is also
split between China and the US. So, it is not a significant part of our overall capacity or revenue that is coming through
this model. But we see it as an interesting model as we continue to develop these engineered fluid system or frac fluid
systems. So, overall today it is not significant, but it's a new business model that we believe could grow to be more
significant over time. And the type of customers that we deal, this is typically either smaller independent players who
want access to higher technology fracturing systems or vertically integrated customers that we do this for.
David Anderson, Analyst
Okay. I guess my last question kind of related to that. There seems to be quite a bit of shift in operating behavior in
North America over last six months. What would you attribute that to, we hear a lot, talk about budgets being used up

and whatnot, but is this something just about field economics and a reference to lower service costs, and if so where do
you think they are in terms of their goals of cost? Are they satisfied where service costs are now? You just mentioned
pricing of some of these other products have come down that sort of implies to me they are not really satisfied. How do
you think about in terms of their economics right now?
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
Well, I would say, all the customers in North America that I'm talking to are still looking for us to help them drive more
cost out of the system whether that is efficiency or new technology. Exactly what transpired in H2 or in particular in Q4
in terms of the lower activity, it could be a combination of lower commodity prices in terms of the subset reference
prices below the WTI. I also think that the number of these customers have been operating north of 100% cash flow,
and they felt it was prudent to scale back. And also you had quite a significant impact of the holiday season in Q4. So, I
think, all of these elements were contributing towards the drop in activity. So, I don't think there has been a really
material change to the economics. But I think the proof of that is going to be what happens now in Q1, whether they're
going to be ramping back up again.
David Anderson, Analyst
Right. Okay. Thank you, Paal.

Operator
Thank you. We'll go to line of Jim Crandell with Dahlman Rose. Please go ahead.
James Crandell, Analyst
Thank you. Paal, how do you see seismic vessel supply demand and pricing shaping up for the spring summer season?
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
Well, if you look at our overall market outlook for seismic remains positive. The capacity in the market still remains
tight. If you look at our bookings for Q1, we're more or less fully booked and Q2 is filling up relatively fast. So, most
of the bids that we have won, for Q1 and Q2 are more or less at the pricing that we did at in Q3 and Q4, which is about
10% up from that reference price of 2011. So, there hasn't been a further increase in pricing as of yet, but we still see
the opportunity now to test pricing further for what remains to be booked for Q2 and also for H2. So, we remain
positive in terms of our outlook for the market. I am not really concerned about overcapacity in the market at this stage.
James Crandell, Analyst
Okay. And my follow-up question, Paal, is for the formation evaluation business in deepwater. I think your competitors
were targeting a big push in that area given that this is the most exciting growth area in the global oil service market, do
you feel now that we're sort of well into this upturn in deepwater with still a big part of it still ahead that you've
maintained your market share globally in terms of doing (inaudible) work on ultra-deepwater wells?

Yeah. I'm very comfortable with both our technology portfolio. How we continue to execute in these type of projects
and overall the rate that we are winning the work at right. So, I don't think there's been any negatives around this. And
in fact, I think it continues to perform very strongly both in terms of market share, revenue growth, and profitability.
So, I'm pleased with the progress that we're showing on the formation evaluation side on deepwater.
James Crandell, Analyst
And is this an area Paal, that could show above average price increases too?
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
Well, pricing is already quite strong in these type of environments, linked to the high rig rates and also linked to the
high, I would say, high importance our customers are putting in operational integrity and reliability. So it could be, that
we could see more, more pricing power there, but I would say pricing there is already quite strong.

Follow-up question on the Gulf of Mexico, you highlighted the strong growth in North America offshore. I was

but you include Canada and Alaska in there. Was all that or stuff between seismic and the Gulf of Mexico? Or was
there any big contribution from like Eastern Canada or Alaska in that offshore revenue increase?

Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
Well, they are included in, when we talk about offshore in North America. But both Alaska and Eastern Canada are
relatively small compared to the size of our Gulf of Mexico business. I would say the predominant driver of the
sequential increase in revenue is the Gulf of Mexico.
Judson Bailey, Analyst
Okay. And then another question on Mexico. As international markets go, it looks like it's going to be one of the more
positive ones for 2013. Could you give a little color or insight as to how you see that market developing over the next
couple of years between some of the onshore activity and then, and now they're getting more active offshore as well
and what product lines?
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
Yeah, I mean overall we are seeing pretty solid growth in activity in 2013 for Mexico, both land and offshore. There is
deepwater activity going on, there is conventional shallow water activity and then you have a range of types of activity
on land all the way from the unconventionals in the North. You have normal third-party work and we have the IPM and
SPM type of contract. For 2013, in addition to the growth in activity, what we're also seeing is, we are facing
significant tendering activity in the next couple of quarters. And what we're also seeing now is that several smaller
players from US land is starting to show up in Mexico which could make the whole tendering environment even more
competitive. So we'll see how that plays out, but that's one aspect that we are looking at.
Another key for Mexico is also that Pemex continues its overall transition towards these production incentive type of
contracts. And we really like this model and we compete quite well in those type of bids. And the latest we've heard
from Pemex is that the, Chicontepec SPM bids on is expected to be around mid-year of 2013. So we'll obviously be
preparing for that.
Judson Bailey, Analyst
Okay. Thank you for that. And if I could just have one more quick follow-up. Paal, I just wanted to make sure I heard
you correctly. In your comments earlier, did you say you anticipated about 100 to 150-rig increase in the US rig count
in the first half of the year?
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
Based on the customer feedback that we've had, we are saying up between 100 and 150 rigs in Q1, that's what we heard
from our customers.
Judson Bailey, Analyst
Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
Thank you.

Thank you. Next question is from Brad Handler with Jefferies & Company, Inc. Please go ahead.
Brad Handler, Analyst
Thanks, guys. I'm going to stick with the US as well please. You spoke about, I think raising your stage count in the
fourth quarter of '12 for hydraulic fracturing. I wanted to confirm that please. And then I suspect you think that the
stage that, that was a nice move in market share for you. I would imagine you think that with activity being down, the
way it was on the rig side that stage count was probably down for the industry. So, can you confirm that and maybe
quantify for us and then we can talk about how we got there?
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
No, I didn't mention anything about stage counts for Q4. I would just say that, we haven't yet thought anything around
that. I would say that overall in hydraulic fracturing, we have had a good, I would say, couple of quarters in terms of
securing work. So, I wouldn't be surprised that our market share could be up somewhat. But in terms of stage front
sequentially, I haven't mentioned anything about that.
Brad Handler, Analyst
All right. Maybe I misread it or misheard, no problem. I guess then, maybe just an unrelated follow-up. I suppose just
more broadly on IPM maybe asking globally, how might you expect that revenue to compare in '13 to '12?
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
Well, I think, IPM is one of our faster growing product lines. We see a range or type of projects that IPM is getting
involved with, all the way from just straight integrated service or project management for say deepwater drilling
offshore, where we simply coordinate the interface without taking any project management risk to the project. But
when we have a wide range of services on these remote rigs for instance, that coordination role is one thing that IPM
takes on. The other part is the traditional turnkey well construction, which continues to also grow in time for us, right.
So, we are very active with IPM and it's doing very well for us.
Brad Handler, Analyst
Got it. And that's fine. All right thanks, guys. I'll turn it back.
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
Thank you.

Hi, good morning.
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
Good morning.
Jeff Tillery, Analyst
After the Q3 results, the commentary you guys had around kind of security and political turmoil concerns in North
Africa and Mid-East were kind of relatively muted in terms of your concerns overall for the region. Can you just talk
about how that's changed in the last three months, if any?
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
Obviously, with the events of the last peak here, we are really looking at the whole situation there. It is, you know, if
you talk about Algeria and Libya, we are already operating there with quite stringent security measures in place. With
what has happened in the last week, we are really looking at that. We are very prudent in how we go about doing
business in any part of the world to make sure that we can offer up the required security for the people that we put into
workforce there. So, it's too early to say exactly what the impact of this is going to be, but I would just say that in these
regions with higher risks we already have very stringent security measures in place.
Jeff Tillery, Analyst
Okay, that's helpful. And then just last question, an unrelated follow-up. You mentioned around Venezuelan
receivables and the payment there slowing. Has that changed your appetite for taking on revenue at this point or it is
just something that you are throwing out there as an item to be aware of?
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
It is an item to be aware of. We have a long-standing relationship with Petrovesa. There are some challenges that they
are facing in the country at this stage. We are committed to Venezuela for the long-term, they have a massive resource
base. And we want to be there for the long-term. So, we are currently just working very closely with them to currently
resolve the situation.
Jeff Tillery, Analyst
Okay, thank you very much.
Paal Kibsgaard, Chief Executive Officer
Thank you.
