MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. This call is
being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please
stand by.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief
Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.
Marianne Lake
Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is
available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements at the back of the
presentation.
So if we start on page 1, the firm generated net income of $5.3 billion for the fourth quarter or $1.30 a share, with a
return on tangible common equity of 14% on revenues of $24 billion, down 1% year-on-year and up 1%
quarter-on-quarter.

As you see, we had several significant items in the quarter, which I will review as we go through the presentation in
more detail. But they include: a $1.3 billion gain on the sale of Visa shares and a $0.5 billion gain on the sale of One
Chase Manhattan Plaza, both in the Corporate segment; as well as a $0.8 billion pre-tax or a $1.1 billion after-tax
impact of legal expense in the quarter, partially booked in mortgage with the remainder booked in corporate,
principally the Madoff settlement recently announced; a $1.3 billion benefit from reduced loan loss reserves in
consumer businesses. And then in addition, CIB's results for the quarter include a $2 billion loss for DVA and FVA, or
funding valuation adjustment, which I'll also come back to in more detail.
The total impact of these items is a negative $0.10 of EPS. So not to diminish their importance but to illustrate the
strength of the core performance of the underlying businesses, if you do adjust our results for these items, we would
have earned $5.7 billion of net income, $1.40 a share, and a return on tangible common equity of 15%.
So talking about the full year, skipping over page 2 and straight to page 3, reported net income of nearly $18 billion, or
$4.35 a share, on revenue of approximately $100 billion; and a return on tangible common equity reported of 11%.
Again, if you adjusted for all reported significant items in the year, we would have earned net income of over $23
billion, $5.70 a share, and a return on tangible common equity of 15%; again, strong underlying performance for the
full year.
Of note, let me talk for a minute about adjusted expenses. You can see on the page that our adjusted expenses – that's
excluding corporate litigation and foreclosure related matters – are a flat $60 billion. This is in line, albeit at the high
end, of our guidance of $59.5 billion to $60 billion for the year. But included in this number is a total of close to $1
billion of other non-corporate legal expense, which if we had adjusted would have left a more core number at just over
$59 billion, despite the incremental investment in controls of $1 billion we made in the year.
So briefly recapping on 2013, clearly a year marked by regulatory development and significant legal settlements;
however, more importantly, also a year in which our businesses together and individually performed strongly. We
succeeded in further progressing our customer satisfaction agenda and gaining market share across businesses.
2013 saw very strong credit performance across businesses, including significant improvements in mortgage. And
finally, we ended the year with strong capital, liquidity and margins.
So let's talk about capital on page 4. So I'm not going to talk much about Basel I except to say that you can see we
progressed our ratio in the quarter to 10.7% Basel I Tier 1 common. But importantly, if you look at the middle section,
you see that our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio is 9.5%, meeting our year-end target.
Just a few words on the components underlying this ratio, three things; first, we generated approximately $5 billion of
net capital in the quarter. Second, we also saw significant RWA benefits of model and parameter updates, including
HPI and lower spreads, as well as portfolio runoff.
And third, these positives together, worth over 60 basis points of improvement, were reduced by about 50 basis points
due to higher levels of operational risk capital. The significant increase in operational risk capital this quarter is largely
driven by the inclusion of the large legal expense from the prior quarter. And we will spend some more time on capital
at Investor Day. But despite headwinds, we still anticipate reaching 10%-plus or minus Basel III Tier 1 common by the
end of this year.
So a quick update on leverage; both the firm-wide and the bank supplementary leverage ratio under U.S. rules
increased to 4.7%. And I'll come back on the next page to talk about the final Basel SLR framework that was issued
this weekend.
During the quarter, the holding company converted certain intercompany debt at the bank into capital, improving the
bank's relative ratio. We remain compliant with LCR at the firm level this quarter, including the impact of the proposed
new rules. And we continue to have about 19% available resources relative to risk-weighted assets at the end of the
year.
So before we move on, as you know, the Volcker Rule was finalized in the quarter; and having had the opportunity to
consider the rule, some thoughts. So the certainty provided by having a final rule and the implementation date of July

2015 were welcome. It is a tough rule and the regulators have laid out stringent standards for compliance policies,
procedures, controls, and testing, which will bring operational challenges to implement. However, we believe that the
firm will be materially compliant across our businesses with the rule. We have work to do to get there, but we don't
expect any material impact to our results.
So let's take a closer look at the impact of the final SLR framework from this weekend on page five. As you saw, the
Basel committee released the framework this weekend, which has gone a long way towards closing the gap relative to
the U.S. NPR. And the changes they made are responsive to industry feedback and seem sensitive to potential market
impacts.
Our initial analysis estimates that the impact will worsen both the holding company and bank ratios by only
approximately 10 basis points relative to U.S. proposed rules, so that would be 4.6% for each of the holding company
and the bank.
This impact is primarily driven by a positive, related to improved assumptions on unfunded commitments being
slightly more than offset by the inclusion of written credit protection provisions, previously not in the U.S. rules.
However, between the likely implementation in the future of NIMM [Non-Internal Models Method] for derivatives'
Potential Future Exposure and the ability over time for us to improve netting for cash collateral, there should be
significant improvement opportunities for our ratios, in tens of bases points.
So overall, our leverage action plans don't change materially. We'll be thoughtful and measured about implementation
in 2014 and beyond. And our perspective on specific products and businesses is not just driven by capital implications
but also by the importance to the broader franchise and client relationships.
We do expect to reach 5% plus or minus at the holding company by the end of this year and to be compliant at the bank
shortly thereafter. So the next step is for the U.S. regulators to determine when and if they'll adopt this new
denominator, although we feel it's reasonably likely that they will.
In addition, over the weekend there was a consultation paper issued on NSFR. The proposal more closely aligns NSFR
to the current evolved LCR framework in terms of definitions and assumptions, which we see as a positive step. And
based upon the proposal, we estimate that the firm is compliant today with NSFR.
So turning to business performance, let's start with Consumer & Community Banking on page 6. The combined
consumer businesses generated $2.4 billion of net income for the quarter on $11.3 billion of revenue, with a return on
equity of 20%.
A couple of comments on drivers; we continue to make strong progress, as I said, on our customer satisfaction agenda,
being recognized by the American Consumer Satisfaction Index – ACSI- for the second year running as number one
among larger banks; as well as number one in small business in three of four regions in the U.S. and number one
among large banks for mortgage originations, both by J.D. Power.
On our retail branch network, we've completed building out our key expansion markets, including California and
Florida, and have reached leadership positions in each of our key markets. So, we feel good about our footprint at or
around this level of 5,600 branches plus or minus, and our focus from here is on optimization, including branch size
and usage, and leveraging digital capabilities.
Lastly, our other key business drivers continue to grow strongly, reflecting increased consumer engagement, evidenced
by growth in deposits, investments, sales, and processing volumes. And our expenses which are down nearly $700
million from last year, primarily due to lower Mortgage Banking expenses. And across CCB, we've reduced head count
by 16,500 year-over-year.
Turning to page 7, Consumer & Community Banking generated net income of $780 million and an ROE of 28%, on net
revenue of $4.4 billion, up 4% [year-over-year] and flat to prior quarter. Net interest income is up 3% year-on-year,
driven by the continued strong growth in deposits, partially offset by spread compression. And it's our investment in
customer satisfaction, new builds, and CPC that's driving the deposit growth, and also the highest account retention rate

in a decade.
On the non-interest revenue side, we continue to see strong growth in both debit and investment revenue, with close to
$190 billion of client investment assets, up 19% or $30 billion year-over-year, about half related to market performance
and half due to net new money gains.
Expenses are up 3% year-on-year, reflecting costs relating to the strengthening of the control environment, but have
flattened sequentially as we improve efficiency in our same-store branches, with starting down by over 6,000
year-over-year.
Business Banking loan balances are flat quarter-on-quarter and up 1% year-on-year and production levels in the
pipeline remain stable. However, the environment has been challenging throughout the year due to competitive
pressures, and we've maintained a high level of credit discipline. So, we're cautiously optimistic that we'll see small
businesses start to spend some of their cash reserves in 2014, but growth may be back-ended.
Turning to page 8, Mortgage Banking; overall, Mortgage Banking net income was $562 million, with an ROE of 11%.
There are a couple of non-recurring items this quarter, which I'll explain as we go through the results. But if you look at
the top of the page, you see production ex-repurchases with a reported pre-tax loss of $500 million. But if you look at
the table on the top right, we've adjusted for the one-time items. And you can see a loss of $91 million, slightly
negative, as expected and as we guided to.
Revenues in the quarter were down 15% on lower application volumes, down 23% [quarter-over-quarter]. And from a
mix perspective, nearly 60% of loans were purchased loans this quarter, up from a little over 20% at the same time last
year.
Production expense includes approximately $400 million of non-MBS related legal expense. This is part of the
significant item on the front page. Again, adjusting for this, we're seeing the benefits of actions we've taken to reduce
expenses, with adjusted expenses coming down around $80 million quarter-over-quarter.
Dealing with repurchases, as you know, during the quarter we reached a settlement with the GSEs on agency
repurchase exposure. After allowing for the settlement amount, we are releasing a net $130 million of repurchase
reserves this quarter, with $90 million being added to compensatory fee reserves, as the settlement did not cover these
potential fees.
And before moving on to servicing, just looking out to the first quarter of 2014, the overall mortgage market is
estimated to be roughly flat versus the fourth quarter. And although we do expect to see some continuation in expense
improvement, revenues will continue to be challenged. And we're guiding for the first quarter, similar to the last two
quarters, to be slightly negative in pre-tax productions.
Moving to servicing, pre-tax income about breakeven in the quarter. Servicing expenses of $663 million includes that
$90 million of compensatory fee expense that I just mentioned, which related to loans previously contemplated in the
repurchase reserve. Adjusting for this item, our core expenses would have been slightly better than our previous
guidance of $600 million for the quarter.
Finally, on Real Estate portfolio, pre-tax income of $1.2 billion, including charge-offs of $167 million and a total
reserve release of $950 million. The non-credit impaired reserve release for the quarter was $200 million, reflecting
continued improvements in the portfolio, but at a lower rate. But also, we released $750 million of reserves in the
purchase credit impaired portfolio, given recent significant improvements in HPI forecasts of approximately 5% for our
portfolio through 2015.
Turning to page 9, card, merchant services & auto, net income of $1 billion, up 23% year-on-year, with an ROE of 26%
or 22% excluding reserve releases, reflecting underlying excellent performance in the business.
Consumer spending has been increasing, and we're seeing strong growth in interchange revenue, reflecting growth in
sales volume as well as seasonality in the fourth quarter.

Year-over-year growth in both sales and merchant processing volumes was consistently strong at 11% and 14%
respectively, with average outstandings flat year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, yields remaining healthy but lower
than a year ago.
We do continue to see runoff of high-rate and low FICO balances, with a move towards more engaged customers or
transactors, which is a positive trend for spend and for credit performance but a negative for yield, and we expect
spread compression to continue into 2014.
Next, this drove revenues of $4.7 billion, down 3% year-over-year and up 1% quarter-on-quarter on seasonality, with a
revenue rate of 12.34% for the quarter. Consistent with these portfolio trends, the net charge-off rate has stayed at
historical lows at 2.85%. And we released $300 million of loan loss reserves this quarter, given improved delinquencies
and portfolio seasoning.
Expenses are up 3% year-on-year, about 16% quarter-on-quarter, primarily driven by increased marketing investment
spend and costs associated with payments to customers required by a consent order.
A few words on auto, originations up 16% year-on-year, driving loan balances up 5% year-on-year and outpacing new
car sales growth of 5%.
And before we move on, as you know, there were two data security breaches affecting our customers over the last
several weeks. We took quick action to protect our customers, and we continue to monitor both situations. The
financial impact for the quarter is not significant.
Moving on to slide 10 and the Corporate & Investment Bank, the CIB results this quarter include a $1.5 billion loss as a
result of implementing the FVA, or funding valuation framework, as well as a $0.5 billion DVA loss.
On this page, we'll focus on the numbers excluding FVA and DVA in the table on the top right, and then I'll come back
to FVA on the next page.
So, we had net income of $2.1 billion on revenues of $8 billion and an ROE of 15%. And we maintained our number
one ranking in both global IB fees and markets revenue, gaining share year-over-year of over 100 basis points in each.
In Banking, total revenue of $3 billion, with IB fees slightly ahead of our guidance; IB fees of $1.7 billion for the
quarter, up 11% quarter-on-quarter and down 3% year-on-year, driven by lower debt underwriting compared with the
record prior-year quarter, partially offset by strength in equity underwriting.
Treasury Services revenues of $1 billion, down 7% year-on-year, driven primarily by decision to reposition our trade
loan portfolio.
Moving on to Markets & Investor Services, our markets revenue of $4.1 billion was flat year-on-year, also slightly
ahead of the guidance we provided in the fourth quarter. Fixed income markets revenues of $3.2 billion, flat
year-on-year, with continued solid client flows. And equity markets of $873 million, down quarter-on-quarter off of a
very strong equity derivatives result last quarter as well as seasonality. Security Services revenue of $1 billion, up 3%
year-on-year, primarily driven by higher custody and fund services revenue, on record Assets under Custody of $20.5
trillion and also on high deposits.
Just to comment on credit, we continue to see a favorable credit environment with stable credit quality trends, and our
provisions continue to benefit from repayments and recoveries. Expenses of $4.9 billion, down 2% both year-over-year
and quarter-over-quarter, driven by lower compensation. The comp-to-revenue ratio, excluding FVA and DVA was
27% for the quarter, in line with the same quarter last year, and 30% for the full-year, which is in line with our
guidance, albeit at the lower end, on higher capital year-over-year.
Loan balances are down 7% year-on-year, flat quarter-on-quarter, again, primarily driven by trade loan balances, which
could trend down or continue to trend down as we optimize the portfolio. And at the bottom of the driver section, VaR
remains low at $42 million for the quarter.

So, turning to page 11 and coming back to the FVA adjustment, we're recording a $1.5 billion loss as a result of
implementing a funding valuation or an FVA framework for our OTC derivatives and structured notes this quarter,
reflecting an industry migration towards incorporating the lifetime cost or benefit of unsecured funding into valuations.
Just a couple of minutes on the background and dealing with- "Why now?", to-date, there has been no broad consensus
that funding should be explicitly incorporated into valuation estimates. However, we believe that market practice for
pricing and valuing derivatives has noticeably evolved during 2013, as we've been actively and continuously evaluating
the market.
We've now accumulated compelling evidence both from transactions as well as industry pricing services that dealers
are pricing funding into uncollateralized derivatives with a degree of consistency. This supports incorporating an FVA
framework this quarter.
In very simple terms, you can think of FVA, which represents a funding spread over LIBOR, as having the effect of
present-valuing market funding costs into the value of derivative receivables today. These funding costs otherwise
would have affected net income over the life of derivatives.
Although the FVA framework applies to both assets and liabilities, the adjustment in the quarter is largely related to
uncollateralized derivative receivables for two reasons. First, the funding value of collateral is already incorporated in
the valuation of collateralized derivatives. And second, credit spreads, which are a significant component of funding
spreads, are already recorded on liabilities through DVA.
So, when thinking about the size of the adjustment, you have to consider the size, the tenure, composition of the
relevant portfolio, as well as the appropriate spread. So to give you some context, if you start with derivative
receivables net of cash and securities collateral of approximately $50 billion, apply an average duration of
approximately five years, and a spread of approximately 50 basis points, that accounts for about $1 billion plus or
minus of the adjustment.
Additionally, although there is a material overlap between DVA and FVA, the remaining difference contributes to the
adjustment. So the loss in the quarter represents a transition adjustment to this new framework and can be thought of as
a one-time event as we incorporate the concept into the portfolio value.
Going forward, FVA will be incorporated into day-one valuation of derivatives, and implementing FVA should have
the effect of significantly reducing our sensitivity to funding spreads going forward. We'll continue to refine FVA as
the framework matures within the industry.
So moving on to page 12, the Commercial Bank saw a net income of nearly $700 million this quarter on revenue of
$1.8 billion, with an ROE of 20%. Revenues were up 6% year-on-year and 7% quarter-on-quarter, net interest income
increasing by 5% year-over-year, reflecting a one-time gain of approximately $100 million related to a lending-related
workout.
Pricing spreads have continued to tighten across the board. Non-interest revenues were 8% up year-on-year, driven by
record growth IB fees of over $500 million for the quarter.
Our credit book continues to show very strong performance with net charge-off rates of only 7 basis points, as we
continue to focus on quality names and are comfortable passing on deals that don't meet our standards. Expenses were
up 9% year-on-year, continuing to reflect higher product and head count related expenses, primarily in controls.
Loan balances were up 7% year-on-year and 1% quarter-on-quarter. Our commercial real estate businesses continue to
outperform the industry, up 15% year-on-year, 16 consecutive months of growth. But in C&I, overall loan growth
remains flat, performing slightly below the industry as client demand continues to be low, competition high, and we
remain focused on credit discipline over growth.
While sentiment remains fragile, there are pockets of activity, and we are cautiously optimistic that borrowing demand
may improve as confidence in the recovery spreads. But again, that may be back-ended in the year as clients are very
liquid. Finally, deposits are up 3% year-on-year and 4% quarter-on-quarter on seasonality.

Page 13 and asset management, continued strong investment performance and long-term inflows drove a fourth
consecutive year of record revenue. The quarter saw a net income of $568 million, up 18% year-on-year, with an ROE
of 25%.
Record revenues of $3.2 billion, up 15% year-on-year, are driven by three main factors: strong fund performance as
well as long-term flows in every single asset class and from every region; overall benefiting from higher markets; and
finally, a mark-to-market gain from a seed capital investment. This is the 19th consecutive quarter of long-term inflows
with $16 billion for the quarter, bringing the full year to a total of $90 billion, driving record assets under management
of $1.6 trillion, up 12%.
We saw particular strength in multi-asset and equities and achieved number one ranking in 2013 for net flows in active
long-term mutual funds. Expenses increased in line with performance of the business. And finally in banking, we
continued to see growth across the board, with record loan balances over $95 billion, up 19% year-on-year.
Page 14, total net income of nearly $800 million for corporate and private equity for the quarter. In private equity, a
relatively quiet quarter, with aggregate results more modest than in prior quarters.
Treasury/CIO showed a net loss of $78 million, driven by negative NII of nearly $100 million, but that compares to a
run rate of negative NII of approximately $500 million in each of the first two quarters. This improvement reflects the
benefit of higher investment security deals, up 50 basis points.
The investment security portfolio has also been a significant contributor to firm-wide NIM stability. And in the second
half of the year, we deployed $66 billion gross in new investments, principally mortgages and munis.
Our ending balance of securities that classified as held-to-maturity grew to $24 billion and will continue to grow this
quarter. And you should expect CIO/Treasury NII to reach breakeven in the second half of 2014, all other things equal.
And before I continue, just let me talk for a second about NIM and NII, details of which are in the appendix. Firm-wide
NIM, core NIM, and NII were all up slightly quarter-over-quarter given market rates. And we expect both NIM and NII
to be relatively stable in the near term, with the higher security deals I talked about being largely offset by loan spread
compression.
So, finally on this page, other corporate sees a net income of $852 million, and there's a call-out on the page. First, a net
gain, all of these are after-tax; first a net gain of $800 million on the sale of Visa shares. We were and we remain a
large Visa shareholder. However, in the quarter we saw the opportunity to risk manage approximately one-third of our
Visa price risk exposure. But we clearly retain the ongoing litigation risks, both the ultimate amount and timing of
settlements.
Secondly, a net real estate gain of over $300 million on the sale of One Chase Manhattan Plaza; and these two gains are
being offset by nearly $800 million in legal expense, substantially all Madoff related. In addition, a few positive tax
items in the quarter, largely the release of prior reserves.
So page 15 and our outlook to wrap up, we've actually covered all of the items on this page. So wrapping up, just to say
that our four leading franchises are all performing very strongly, and we remain focused on serving our clients. We're
committed to accomplishing our control agenda and adjusting successfully to the new global financial architecture. And
we look forward to diving deeper into all of these themes at Investor Day, which is coming up in a few weeks' time.
With that, thank you. And operator, you could open up the line to Q&A.

<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Just wanted to talk about the leverage ratio for a moment. You talked about a 10 basis point
increase from the latest on Basel if they do the add-ons. And I guess the big part that's hardest for us to see is really the
impact of the CDS non-netting of mismatched maturities on protection bought versus protection sold. Can you give us
a sense of what your numbers look like on that basis so we can try and reconcile to your 10 basis points?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, a quick thing just to clarify. The 10 basis points is actually lower, not higher, so it's a beat
up, not an add, for the new Basel proposals relative to the U.S. rules. So remember, as we've previously been disclosing
our ratios, we used the U.S. proposed rules that referenced a prior Basel denominator, so it's a 10 basis point worsening.
And you're right that we had two major things contributing to that. We had a positive, associated with better
assumptions on draws on unfunded commitments, slightly more than offset by a negative on the written credit
protection. We're still working through the prior details, but our best estimate is that it's in the mid-20s in basis points,
25 basis points plus or minus.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. And can you just give us a sense for what the maturity profile looks like on your CDS
protection purchased versus sold? Is there much of a maturity mismatch there, or is there really not much?
<A - Marianne Lake>: If you start with our gross growth CDS protection written, it's about $3.4 trillion. By the time
you net down some maturities, it gets down to a couple of hundred billion dollars, but that's still impactful.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Another thing to think about, it will be manageable, because really this is a static analysis before
we start running the business slightly differently due to it.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Right.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it.
<A - Marianne Lake>: We saw the proposals as having been thoughtful. And we don't necessarily have to agree with
the finer points of all of them, but it doesn't materially change our position or our thought going forward. And as Jamie
said, all of our businesses will now socialize and optimize against what we understand to be the final rules when the
U.S. regulators adopt them.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. That's helpful, thanks. On the $60 billion of core expense that you pointed out, on
balance having been pretty flat with last year despite the increases in control environment costs, can you give us a sense
of how you currently see that evolving in 2014?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah. So, Guy, we're obviously going to do a bit more of a detailed deep dive on expenses
over time at Investor Day. So for now, what we have said is that you should expect our adjusted expenses for 2014 to
remain at or below that level of $60 billion. We also said that in 2014, the continuation of our control agenda is adding
an incremental $1 billion over 2013. So by remaining flat, we're effectively self-funding that $1 billion. That's down.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. And how do you get comfortable that by doing that, you're not going to eat into
revenue growth by – pardon the use of the word, but by starving other expenses?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: We're not starving any expenses. We're just managing in a disciplined way, the way we've
always done it. And if you look at the underlying numbers, there's a lot of growth in the underlying numbers. But it's
clearly true that some of the derisking and selling, spin off OEP [One Equity Partners] and physical commodities will
affect revenues a little bit, but obviously profit, less.
<A - Marianne Lake>: And, Guy, we've always been investing in the businesses and been willing to invest where the
business takes and the returns justify that. But we are also finding efficiencies in a combination of the businesses, both
consumer and the wholesale businesses, efficiency in the same-store branches we talked about. CIB continues on its
journey on the back office and front office integration. And obviously, mortgage expenses will continue to trend down

both in line with increased credit trends but also as we proactively manage the portfolio. So there's a lot of moving
parts, but it's not at the expense of our willingness to invest in the businesses for returns.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: And just if I can follow up on the mortgage expense comment that you made, more just
along the lines of the expenses against the origination franchise. It sounded to me like you may be extending your view
of what the timeframe is to get that to steady state beyond the first quarter. Is that right, or am I misreading that?
<A - Marianne Lake>: It's not just about expenses. You have to think about the whole equation. If you look at the
mortgage market, we'll see some improvement in the first quarter 2014 and we'll also continue to work on expense
efficiency in the business. But if you look at a market which is currently being estimated at about $1.3 trillion, down
from $1.9 trillion, and honestly, a couple of weeks ago it was $1.1 trillion, so it's a very small market, one we haven't
seen the likes of since the year 2000. In a market like that, it's very challenging to deliver through the cycle returns. So
we went through over the last few years, years with very strong revenues and margins, and we are in a challenging
environment as we look into 2014, but we're working on it.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Fair enough, and the last one for me. Just, you mentioned the impact of operating risk due to
the very high level of litigation costs this year. How should we think about that and how are you thinking about that
with respect to CCAR?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Okay, so the way to think about it in the short term relative to say the submission that we just
did or in the near future is that obviously a realized loss experience that is higher than we have previously seen informs
your view and judgment as to what you could reasonably expect to happen in a future stress period. So it is fair to say
that that would drive our expectations such losses or operational losses to be slightly higher.
Having said that, it's not as if our previous submissions didn't contemplate there to be significant stresses in operating
losses. So I would characterize it as incremental and certainly not from a low base.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, great, thanks very much for answering my questions.
<A - Marianne Lake>: And also, Guy, sorry. Just remember that every quarter we move forward, we generate capital,
improve our ratios, so there's lots of moving parts to the ultimate outcome.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it, thanks.

Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Good morning, Betsy.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Marianne, I just wanted to follow up on a couple of things. One was on NIM outlook. You
did indicate that in the second half of 2014 you were expecting that the CIO and Treasury income would turn positive,
if I read it correctly. And I would think that's a function of your security yield improving. Can you just give us a sense
of what the net new investment yield is for the security investments that you're making in that book right now relative
to what it's at, the balances are at?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I think the way you should look at it is something like $40 billion gets reinvested a year. The
basic assumption you should make is there's an average duration of three or four years, so think of five-year bonds or
something like that. And just use the implied yield curve.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Obviously, what we needed to decide was munis or MBS or something like that. But I need to
point out, it's just completely dependent upon decisions we make, so we can change that at will if we want to extend or

reduce the duration of equity of the company.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Right. And so given your comments that you're expected to reach breakeven by the second
half of 2014, that's a reflection of higher interest rates or a change in the way you're investing the funds?
<A - Marianne Lake>: It's both.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: It's a little bit of both. It's mostly just the change in the yield curve.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, we'll have slower mortgage fee payments. We're able to reinvest at higher yields, we're
reinvesting in high-quality assets, munis with high spreads, so it's both.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then your other point was you're going to be taking that better return on that
portfolio and using it to be as competitive as you want to be on the loan portfolio, and so expectation is that loan
spreads continue to pull down over the next couple of quarters at least. Can you just give us a sense as to how willing
you are to be competitive on price on loan spreads? Should we be expecting that overall NIM compression is what
you're looking for here in the event that you get the quality of loan growth you want?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Well, you've got to separate the loans. On the commercial side, we'll obviously be competitive,
and we're not assuming anything heroic in terms of rates spread getting worse or better, but they're low. You could
argue down the road it might actually go up a little bit as capital requirements and liquidity requirements go way up,
but we will be competitive. We assume we've got to be competitive in loan spreads.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And on the consumer side, card balances have been rewritten post-crisis to be
variable. Are you anticipating that you're going to be in a rising rate environment, in the belly of the curve raising rates
on the card portfolio?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Think of the card businesses. We try to run it fully match-funded, so the spreads are about the
same. And just remember, something like 65% is at an interest rate; something like 40% is transactor almost locked-in
rates, which we also match-fund.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then separate topic just on the security breach that you discussed and you
indicated that the card replacements that you've done so far has been de minimis in terms of expense. But could you
just speak a little bit bigger picture to how you're thinking about fraud in the card space as well as in the debit space?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: We have replaced 2 million debit cards or will have I think by the end of this week.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Credit and debit both.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Credit and debit, to protect our customers, et cetera. So look, unfortunately, this cyber security
stuff we've now pointed out for a year is a big deal. It's not going to go away. All of us have a common interest in being
protected, so this might be a chance for retailers and banks to for once work together as opposed to sue each other like
we've been doing the last decade. But it's in all of our interest to do it.
And I think all people involved in this know that those third parties, whether it's machines, regional machines, your
mainframes, you really have to put an extreme effort into protect yourself. So this story is not over, unfortunately.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Right. And there's been this debate between tokenization versus chip and pin, and I'm just
wondering do you guys have an angle as to which way you would prefer to see it go?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yeah. Honestly, I think you're going to see both. I think you'll see chip and pin in old cards, and
then a lot of online type of transactions in tokenization. They both have very, very good technologies to protect
consumers and companies from fraud.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then just last question, on the Visa, did I hear you correctly, Marianne that you
basically realized a-third of the economic value in the Visa shares that you have, is that correct?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, that's correct.

hedging?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Correct.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: There's an unrealized gain of approximately like $3 billion today. It's on our books at zero. This
goes back to when Visa was spun off many, many years ago.

Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr of ISI.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hello.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Hi, Glenn.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Hi, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hello. First question on FIC in the IB. It was pretty stable this quarter. As a matter of fact, if
you look for the year it was about in line with last year, which I think once everybody's done reporting will be a pretty
good victory. So, I guess the question is there's a bunch of structural headwinds blowing on the business and as you do
your budgeting it's probably done already. Can the industry grow with the headwinds on it? In other words, the offset
would be better activity levels, steeper curves, things like that, but there's a bunch of structural headwinds, I'm just
curious how you think of that at the high level?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I guess there are some structural headwinds. You've seen a lot of adjustment in the marketplace.
People reduced the size of their inventory. What you don't know going forward is what's going to happen to spreads.
But I look at it a little bit like there's a secular and a cyclical. There will be headwinds from regulations, et cetera. But
over time, assets that people need to manage and buy and sell is going to go up over time, not go down. So what
happens in 2014 is hard to say. Our business is fairly diversified between rates, credit, emerging markets, FX,
commodities, et cetera.
<A - Marianne Lake>: It's definitely helping our stability.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Which is definitely helping our stability.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: I see that in the numbers. Maybe on a related note, I got a sense with the renewed focus on
SLR that there's a renewed attention to compression trades. I'm just curious if that's ongoing and it could be material in
2014, as this goes on I know there's a lot of work involved, but the reward is pretty good too.
<A - Marianne Lake>: I would say, Glenn, it's ongoing and it will be beneficial. I think material might be a stretch at
this point and it is a lot of work, as you say. So, the whole industry is working on that and us too. We expect to be
beneficial but not a game-changer.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: The SLR at 5%, we do not think is going to be an issue for us. We've barely begun to manage it.
There are a lot of things you can do in how you change your business. The bank issue is a little bit different, but think
of that as more structural. What we did in the bank over the last 20 years and we're not going to do in the bank going
forward, that will take a little bit longer, but not because – the reason is it's just to take longer to change our business
model to accommodate it.

<A - Marianne Lake>: I also think if you look at the other things I mentioned in terms of opportunities, putting NIM
to one side, our estimate of the new Basel rules that we had, we've given you a 10 basis point movement backwards has
a conservative estimate of what we could ultimately achieve over time in terms of the ability to net cash collateral for
derivatives just given certain of the conditions. But again, over time that will also be manageable like compression
trades and like many of those other things. So, we haven't changed our view; we can manage against these targets by
doing it thoughtfully and methodically and not having to race through it.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay, last one for me. You've noted your 9.5% Basel III Tier 1 common, the 10% year-end
target seems completely achievable given your earnings. I'm just curious how you think about balancing the absolute
versus the relative, meaning you can get there on an absolute basis no problem. On a relative basis, some other large
financial institutions have a little bit more. I'm just curious if that matters as you think about the capital planning
process, or is it when you have enough it's enough?
<A - Marianne Lake>: We said already that we would be willing to run between 10% and 10.5%, so we're on a
journey here. We think we can get to 10% plus or minus by the end of the year. It could be plus and it could be minus.
But we think that at this point based on what we know that running at that level of buffer or margin should be enough.
Obviously, we'll be more informed as we go through CCAR processes, but that's our point of view at this point.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi. One more quick follow-up on the net interest margin outlook, Marianne. The NIM
expected to be flattish, but I wasn't clear if in the current rate environment you expect it to continue to add investments
as you have been doing, and would you expect the net interest income dollars to grow from here as they did slightly
this quarter?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, so we have been adding – I talked about the second half of the year growth adding $66
billion. We've never talked about the second quarter; we added quite a lot in the second quarter. And yes, we have
plans to continue to do that in 2014. And yes, we expect our NII dollars to be relatively stable, possibly slightly up over
the course of the first half of the year, but relatively stable.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: But not adding lot of investments. If you look at the balance sheet today, we have almost $350
billion at central banks, most of it Fed, another $350 billion of very high-quality investment securities. And those two
things combined equal our loans of $700 billion. So the company is very, very liquid. We don't really need to invest
more. It depends how much we grow deposits.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: What about just taking advantage of the 10 year yields moving up and your overall
sensitivity to higher rates?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Well, I already said what we're going to do is – what you should assume now is there's implied
yield curves and constant reinvestment. But if you had rates move up 100 basis points all at once, we'd probably be
much more aggressive in doing something like that.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then in terms of the litigation reserves, you resolved a number of large
issues in the fourth quarter, so two questions here. Can you help us think about how the litigation provision expense
might trend in 2014, should we expect it to be lower than the $800 million? And then second, can you tell us if your
range of possible loss has come down from the $6.8 billion that it stood at in October since you resolved a few big
items?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So, obviously, you're going to understand that it's a necessary caveat that we can't predict for
you the pattern and the amount of legal expenses in any one quarter or over several quarters. However, it would be fair
to say that we would certainly hope that for the full year, the full-year cost is in the fourth quarter annualized, but we

can't be certain of that. With respect to a reasonably possible loss range, it did come down from $5.7 billion at the end
of the third quarter to $5 billion at the end of the fourth quarter given their legal expenses we booked.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Thanks. And then last thing is, you mentioned a little bit, but can you just give
us kind of the philosophy with which you approach this year's CCAR and how you're thinking about balancing your
capital achievement goals on the ratios that you talked about with the goal of returning some capital to shareholders?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, so if you think about – and you can do it. We've done a bunch of math and you can do it
based on analysts' estimates. But if you think about we want to get to 10% plus or minus by the end of next year, all
other things being equal, that is a priority but it is not the only priority.
And so as we think about our capital plan, we've consistently said – obviously, it's a board decision ultimately and
they'll contemplate them in the natural course. But we would like to have the flexibility to be able to potentially
increase dividends and also have flexibility to be able to do reasonable repurchases. It wouldn't be unreasonable for you
to think about how we thought about this year as being relatively consistent with last.

Our next question comes from Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Good morning. Just a question on the announcement of the potential for selling the prepaid
card business. I'm just curious as to what drove that given that it doesn't appear that it was a scale related decision,
given the size of that business relative to peers, but if you could just provide a little more color as to what you're seeing
in that business and what caused you to potentially sell that business?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: So, every year we try to have a disciplined approach about what we stay in and what we don't.
And I think we probably were more disciplined this year about the things we don't need both from derisking, capital,
management focus, controls, et cetera. If you look at the prepaid card business, we're not dealing directly with
customers; it's secondary. It's a complex business, and we're just better off letting someone else do it. It won't affect the
four main franchises that Marianne spoke about that are doing so well. It's was just a product reach to do it, so we're not
going to do it anymore. I think there's a lot of risk associated with it.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Right. Okay. And then just moving on to your comments about being potentially cautiously
optimistic about back-end growth for loans, I presume that that's mostly focused on commercial lending. Is it still your
view that the canary in the coal mine foreseeing that might be slower deposit growth or in fact negative deposit growth
before you start to see loan growth?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: So we didn't use the word cautiously optimistic. We're using the word optimistic, because we are
actually optimistic. And when you have the U.S. economy starting to grow, you will see loan growth and volume
growth across all these businesses. We are actually optimistic about the U.S. economy in particular. We spend a lot of
time analyzing what rising rates, growth, change of QE3 taper will do to deposits, so it might actually have a
diminishing effect on the growth of deposits. But we're happy because we're still growing share. I'm not sure you're
going to see deposits going negative before you see loan growth. I think you're trying to fine-tune it too closely there.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Fair enough. And then just finally in terms of your outlook for card balances, it looks like just
trying to take some of the fourth-quarter seasonality out of that business that they have sort of bottomed in terms of the
overall balances. Are you equally optimistic for those balances to begin to grow in 2014 or are you still looking at sort
of flattish balances through most of 2014?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes. We remember that in our card business, we have both dynamics of core growth as well as
still some continued runoff. We did reach the inflection point during the second half of 2013 where that runoff was no
longer exceeding growth, and so we're set to grow but very modestly in 2014.

<A - Jamie Dimon>: But more importantly, 93% of the business is rewards. We've had 10% growth in spend. We've
had 14% growth in merchant processing. So, we are very happy with the card business. It's performed exceptionally
well, excellent credit trends. So outstanding growth is less important, but obviously we'd like to see some of that too.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: And then just finally for me, are you seeing given some of the security breaches not only in
your cards but across a couple of other issuers, have you seen any reduction in consumer spending potentially related to
that via cards moving to other forms of purchases or is that?

Our next question comes from Andrew Marquardt of Evercore Partners.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Good morning, guys. Regarding expenses, can you remind us where we stand on the head
count reductions through I guess 2013 and then where you stand in terms of on track for 2014?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, so just to remind you what we said back in February last year, in the consumer businesses
we talked about over the two years, so 2013 and 2014, mortgage seeing head count reductions of 13,000 to 15,000, and
the consumer business, predominantly in the branches, of 4,000.
By the end of 2013, we had seen 16,500 in total. So in the Consumer Bank, we're actually not only accelerated, but
outperforming our expectations in terms of our ability to run those branches efficiently but still maintain very strong
customer satisfaction and retention rates.
And then in the mortgage space, we have seen total head count down 11% year-over-year against that 13,000 to 15,000
two-year target. So obviously, we continue to work on the strategy and the size and our approach to mortgage markets.
But obviously, relative to those numbers, there's still a little way to go.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Okay, and then...
<A - Marianne Lake>: And remember, that that was both production and servicing. What you saw given the rate
environment in the middle of 2000 and the second half of 2013 is that some of the production related head count
reductions were accelerated. We still have meaningful improvement expected in terms of delinquencies and
foreclosures and modifications. That will continue to drive cost and head count down in 2014.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Got it. Thank you. And then in terms of the retail branch banking discussion that you had
mentioned that you're kind of comfortable with the 5,600 branches level that you're at now, and you're focused on
optimization going forward, does that imply that you could see additional head count reductions or shrinkage of the
branch network or square footage as we've seen from others? How should we think about that?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So, I would think about – talking about the number of branches, I would think about the fact
that, like all good retail distribution houses will continue to do consolidations and relocations as it makes sense for us to
do that in our footprint.
And we'll continue to respond to customer preferences, which will mean that over the course of the next decade, we'll
be looking at obviously the size and needs of branches as branches come up for renovation and re-release and things

like that. So we're not expecting a material change in the number as a macro matter, so 5,600 plus or minus. And it is
going to be based on customer preferences.
As it relates to head count reductions, we're already aggressively looking at the efficiency in our same-store branches
and have been very successful. So we are looking at staffing models, physical capabilities, automation. We're on that
journey and we continue to be on it, but I don't see that there's going to be a step change relative to our previous
expectations. We've already exceeded them. There might be some more, but it's not a step change.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Got it. thank you. Then lastly just on credit quality. It feels like obviously still meaningful
reserve releases, still largely in consumer. But is there much left to go in terms of cards or commercial, is that kind of
inflecting, if you will in terms of the degree of credit leverage that may still be there in terms of reserve release? How
should we think about that?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So think about – let's start with Commercial and say it's plus or minus zero at this point. So I
think it's going to be so strong for long, but that is not going to be a reserve story for a little while. In the Card business,
we have been talking about having potentially reached bottom for a period of time. We haven't yet or it doesn't seem
we have. So as we look into 2014, if things do continue to strengthen, it's possible there will be some more releases but
not at the level that we saw in 2013. So during the first couple of quarters, and usually the first quarters are instructive
on that point. Usually, that's when you see a material improvement, if there's going to be one, in terms of low rates.
And then on the mortgage space, two things; we have $2.6 billion of NCI reserves left. We've talked before about the
fact that we think our more steady run rate number will be between $1 billion and $1.5 billion. So, there's another $1
billion to $1.5 billion to come in that space over the course of the next year or so potentially, obviously, environment
allowing. And then on the NCI – I'm sorry, on the Purchased Credit Impaired portfolio, we have $4.2 billion left after
the two releases we just took. But remember, that is a life-of-loan portfolio, so something we'd have to change now in
the environment, improve for us to expect to take more releases. It's possible. But nothing, we don't expect to be taking
releases up to that $4.2 billion.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Mike Mayo of CLSA.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Good morning.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Morning.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Morning.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Last quarter you had some tax benefits. Did you have tax benefits this quarter and can you
quantify those?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, we did have some tax benefits this quarter. We had about $300 million after tax related to
a number of items, state and local tax, some reserve releases, not one particular thing.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And what was the loan utilization rate for wholesale or commercial loans?
<A - Marianne Lake>: It was just a little over 30%, so low 30%, basically is.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: So no...
<A - Marianne Lake>: No change.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. And you said the number of branches shouldn't change a whole lot. If I recall from
Investor Day, you had planned on opening a lot of new branches. I thought it was going to be a net increase. So is this a
change in your expectations?

<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yes.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, so we said I think at Investor Day plus 100 plus or minus in a year. When Gordon spoke
earlier in 2013, we've revisited based upon our assessment of costs and preferences and activity, and I think we've got
to the footprint where we are happy at 5,600 plus or minus.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: If you look at that BAAB presentation, Gordon goes substantially through branches, branch size,
technology, headcounts, and why.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, if you look at BAAB and then also obviously at Investor Day we'll go through it some
more.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. And then the more general question is, per your outlook, you said that NII should be flat,
mortgage a little bit lower, and expenses only about flat or maybe lower from that $60 billion after you eat that extra $1
billion. So it makes a difference how optimistic you are. If you're not optimistic, you might want to cut expenses more.
And if you are optimistic, maybe you assume that fees are going to grow a lot more because I know you want to have
positive operating leverage. So how do you see revenues growing faster than expenses? Is it the fees picking up? Is it
expenses going lower, or how do you get there?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So, it's a bit of both; just one thing on mortgage, just a tiny clarification. We expect mortgage
production to be broadly the same as we've seen in the second half, but we would expect to continue to see
improvements in expense base in the servicing business. But having said all of that, it's a combination of relatively
stable, but potentially slightly higher NII. Yes, strength in fees on the basis of the strong driver growth that we talked
about. And then there are $60 billion or less of expenses. So we're working through all of the efficiency opportunities
across the businesses, including in the retail space, to be able to deliver positive operating leverage.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And, Mike, I think the way you get there too is each of our businesses is always trying to drive
efficiency while investing. That doesn't change in any particular year. That's a nonstop thing. And you see those
efficiencies because every business has pretty good margins after investing. Sometimes the revenue growth itself is
even episodic or the timing isn't exactly the same in you invest. But you see the drivers, which is deposits, investable
assets, asset management, number of corporate clients, market shares, they're all pretty positive. So we're not going to...
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Can you just give us a general sense of your outlook for CIB? In the past, you've given us a
little bit more detailed future expectations. How do you think 2014 is going to be for capital markets? What's your
backlog like right now? And why do you lower VaR if you're more optimistic?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: So VaR itself is a calculation it's based upon a whole bunch of different things. We don't
deliberately lower VaR. That's usually...
<A - Marianne Lake>: Let me do VaR and then you take. With VaR, Mike, it really is just a feature of two things. If
you look at our look-back period for VaR, across asset classes we're at very low levels of volatility just across all the
asset classes, and that's what's really driving it. If volatility picks up, that will pick up, we're not driving that down, and
it's also derisking in SCP. That is a little bit proactive but it's obviously mostly done now. And then on CIB...
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Actually, we did a number. If you looked at VaR like it was 18 months ago, VaR itself would be
like $60 million or $70 million...
<A - Marianne Lake>: That's right.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: ...just all on its own, so without changing your position, et cetera. So, Mike, the hardest business
to get a handle on is CIB in the medium to the short run. But what we see is investors still have to buy and sell
securities. Corporations have ECM and DCM and you could predict the roll off, et cetera. The backlogs are pretty
good. You saw a tremendous amount of IPOs in 2013. You saw a lot of debt financings. You've already seen a bunch
of M&A early this year.

So we don't budget or plan that you're going to have an unbelievable year in CIB. But if you ask me, the long-term
prospects are good. It's probably the business has to go through the most adjustments to the new regulatory
environment, but the long-term prospects are pretty good. Our margins are good. Our returns are good. You see our
comp levels of 30% down, from 38% a couple of years ago, really reflecting higher capital, et cetera. But at that comp
level, we can pay our people well throughout the franchise all around the world, serve our clients, and still get decent
returns.
So we feel very good about the business, and one of these days, it's going to boom. And you can guess just like I can
guess when that might happen, but it will happen one day.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then lastly, as it relates to Volcker, you said it should not hurt the results materially going
ahead. In the past, you said it might hurt $1 billion. That was a few years ago. And then another time you said it might
even help. I know that was different management at the head then, but now you don't think it should impact things too
much.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Well, Volcker, all things being equal, we would say, "not much." I think when we referred to the
$1 billion or $2 billion, we were talking about regulations in general, including derivatives, [ph] SEFs (64:39),
clearinghouses, and Volcker. And that number we still have in the back of our mind, but it's hard to tell what the effect
of all those things are. The $1 billion or $2 billion I would say was probably in the conservative category.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And how much of that would be reflected already?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: That's the one that's hard to tell. I would guess...
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah, it's very difficult to back-track because those things are all interrelated so it's not entirely
possible to disentangle everything. But obviously, we've gone through some changes in 2013. Some of that will be
reflected but this is a number that we would expect to be reflected to the degree that it is at all over the course of the
next two years.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Remember, some of those things reduce capital requirements. Some people are making dramatic
changes in their business models which may free up market share for those of us that have additional market share, so it
all remains to be seen.
<A - Marianne Lake>: And that was also a static analysis.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: That was also a static analysis. Certain things may reprice a little bit because of the capital
liquidity requirements around them, so it all remains to be seen.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right, thank you.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Thanks, Mike.

Our next question comes from Erika Najarian of Bank of America.
<Q - Erika Penala Najarian>: Good morning. Just have two quick follow-up questions. The first is on the
expectations for the expense base and CCB. If you take out that $400 million in legal expenses, you're looking at a run
rate of $6.9 billion. If you think about what the tailwinds could be for expenses for this year, is it fair to assume that
that $6.9 billion quarterly run rate can improve throughout the year this year?
<A - Marianne Lake>: I would just reiterate what we've previously said, which is if you look at Servicing and in
particular the 4Q run rate, which is call it $600 million, in line with our expectations, that's going to continue to trend
down towards $500 million by the end of the year in 2014.

And then on the production side, while we obviously are going to see our expenses to a degree variable with the size of
the market, we're continuing to also work on opportunities to make the fixed cost base more efficient. So hopefully,
we'll be able deliver some of that in 2014 too. And we'll do a more precise job of putting a bow around that for you at
Investor Day.
<Q - Erika Penala Najarian>: Okay. And the just quick other follow-up is a follow-up to Guy's question on
operational risk capital. You mentioned that there was a 50 basis points haircut due to litigation. Assuming that you're
not going to have a similar outsized litigation expense going forward, is that 50 basis points something that you can
eventually recoup, and how long would that take?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So that's an excellent question. I would say assuming we have no significant losses going
forward, then we feel like we should be close to our high point. Albeit, there may be a little bit more in the first half of
2014.
Just two comments on operational risk; the first is, unlike market and credit risk, although all of the parameters and the
confidence levels are effectively the same, it doesn't naturally recalibrate itself to changes in the business environment
or to your business mix or model if you structurally reduce risk. It's very backward looking, and in that sense it differs
because it doesn't recalibrate.
And so as a result, if you just let the models continue to predict based on historical losses going forward, you would
need to be carrying that elevated level of operational risk capital forward for a reasonably long time. It's a one in a
1,000-year horizon. So when you think about it in terms of five to ten years, not one to two years.
And so for that reason, we are very interested and working very hard with the industry to try and figure out how to
better model changes in the business environment and to both model and defend structural and permanent risk changes
in our businesses in order to be able to recoup some of that more quickly. But at this point, I would characterize that as
work that has not yet been done that is in progress, and so for the foreseeable future it will be elevated.
<Q - Erika Penala Najarian>: Okay, thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Good morning.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Morning, Matt.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: If we just add up some of the odds and ends of the businesses that you're getting out of, for
the niche products and the impact of Volcker, is it still a relatively modest amount in aggregate? I think last quarter you
had said maybe a few hundred million of revenue give up from the businesses that you are tweaking. I just wanted to
know if that still holds, and if we overlay Volcker what the all-in number might be?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Okay, so put Volcker one side for a second. We didn't update obviously the list. We're going to
do that at Investor Day we thought about that for you. It's probably more important to think less about revenue but
more about the impact on the bottom line given that some of these businesses may not have been returning hurdle or
may have been in an investment phase and actually not have been breaking even.
So I think it's fair to say that if you consider the impact on the bottom line more so than revenues that it's relatively
modest, and we'll do work to update you on that. But remember, it also is going to do two things: release capital, which
will be a positive; and also improve the quality of the businesses and the control environment and the complexity,
which would all be positive too.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. And then just separately, as we think about potential legal uncertainties or risks
going forward, are there a couple that you flag out there that are the ones that we should be watching most closely for

the industry for you guys, whether it's LIBOR or FX? Or feels like you've obviously settled a lot on the mortgage side,
a couple of the big ones that were specific to you. What should we be watching to make sure that we have a sense of
what's going on?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: It's the ones you all mentioned. We put them in our 10-K.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, it's the ones you mentioned. And as you look at our disclosures in the 10-Q every quarter,
the items that we think raise themselves to levels of public disclosure are in that document. So you look to last quarter
and next quarter and you'll see, but we shouldn't comment specifically.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: And nothing meaningfully new coming out in the 10-K versus the third quarter Q?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I don't think so.
<A - Marianne Lake>: No, not at this point, but obviously the K is a few weeks away.

Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Great, thanks. On that question about the operational risk capital, isn't it double or
triple-counting against you when you've got an $8 billion reserve which actually reduces your capital? And is it fair to
say you don't get credit for that $8 billion in your capital base when you think about that operational risk capital?
<A - Marianne Lake>: If you think about the basis for our capital and put aside whether you like the way it works in a
modeled environment, your reserves are for your expected losses and your capital is for your unexpected losses. So in
theory, you shouldn't get explicit credit for them.
I think the bigger point for us is if you look at the sorts of things that are driving our capital levels to be as elevated as
they are, they are things, for example, like the PLMBS issues and also certain of the very large mortgage, DOJ, and
national mortgage settlement and ISR compensation fee issues.
It's our belief that this firm is not exposed today or will not be exposed going forward to those levels of risk at
anywhere near that scale going forward. But as I said, we have no ability at this point to scale those back, and that's
what we're very focused on. So, it's less really about whether we're getting credit for our reserves and a little bit more
about how we try in the industry to evolve the framework in partnership with the regulators and defend over time that
there are structural risk reductions that mean those risks are no longer present in that scale.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Got it. So in the short run the fact that you've settled them actually increases the
operational risk, but you hope that over the longer term it will decrease it?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, sir.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: You had made a brief comment about the equities results about the comparable periods
being higher. Were there any other reasons that equity trading results were kind of down as much as they were?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Not specifically. We did fairly well in cash but our cash platform is not as mature as some
others. So I think we would characterize the performance as good but coming off, as I said, a very strong quarter for
equity derivatives in the third quarter.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Got it. And then any other areas, I mean, Gordon Smith has presented a few times and
talked about kind of derisking some of his businesses. Any other areas that we should be looking at for sales?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So, just a comment, on page 15, I think last quarter we showed you a bunch of things that we
were working on. We didn't replace the page because it's not meaningfully changed. That's not to say that at the margin,

may be things at the margin that we will explore over time, there's nothing structurally big that you should be aware of.

Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Thank you. Good morning. You mentioned that your utilization rate in the commercial
areas in the low 30% range presently, and you also pointed out that you're optimistic about the U.S. economy for this
year being stronger, and then the positive impact it will have on loan demand. What do you think the utilization rate
could get to by year-end?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: That's a hard question. So middle market – I'm going to do just middle market because that's the
one that's at a 30% too. Years ago, it used to average more like 45%. It looks like to us that what you have is they have
a lot more deposits and a lot less utilization. And so, obviously, they're going to use some of their own money before
they borrow against a revolver or something like that, and one day you would expect it to go up. We're not guessing
what's going to happen in 2014. But I would say we'll be sitting here one day when we've got a very strong economy, it
will be ten points higher.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Good. And then on the commercial real estate, as you pointed out you're having real good
success in this area. What geographic regions of the country are you seeing the best success? And then second, what
product types are you finding are working the best in growing that book?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Well, multi-family is a big portion of that, and you see that in a lot of – I would say the major
cities is pretty much where you'd say, it's hard to answer specifically. I think both the multi-family and other real estate
loans, it's really the big cities.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: You also mentioned that you have about $350 billion on deposit at the Fed. If the Fed
decides to eliminate the interest they pay on those deposits to all the banks, will that change your strategy of keeping
that amount up at the Fed?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Sure. Change either that or how you reimburse clients for deposits. And obviously, it will go into
how you price and run your business. We're not expecting that to happen, but obviously we'd do that. And you have
other alternatives, so you might invest some of that money elsewhere.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah. And it's also important to point out that a large portion of that $350 billion are deposits
or cash that we would consider to be client non-operational deposits. And as a result, we don't give ourselves any
liquidity value for those. So that's why we're putting them overnight in the Fed.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Okay. I may have missed this, but in the card, merchant services and auto business, the
non-interest expenses for the fourth quarter jumped up to $2.2 billion from the prior quarters' $1.9 billion. They have
been flat for the prior three quarters. Any particular reason why there was a jump like that?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Mostly marketing.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah, it's predominantly marketing. And with respect to marketing, it can be lumpy
quarter-to-quarter. So, it's not an unexpected number for us; it's just higher in the fourth quarter than it was in the third.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: But we feel we've been doing a good job at card acquisition, of high-quality cards you see. I
forgot the number but it's up quite a bit, so we have some good active programs out there.

<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: It looked like in the quarter that you guys bought back about $300 million worth of your
stock in this quarter, and year-to-date or since the last CCAR, it's just over $2.2 billion. If I recall you have an approval
for $6 billion. Is it fair to assume that you'll use the next quarter to fill out the rest of the $6 billion or is that too
optimistic?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Way optimistic.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yeah, I think that would be optimistic. Obviously, we'll determine the first quarter as we go
through it. We'll cover employees issuance, but that's certainly our expectation and then maybe some more, but I don't
think you should expect us to catch up completely.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: And then finally – yeah.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Remember, we want to meet our own objective, the 9.5% or 10%. And obviously, the litigation
costs hurt our ability to do that, so we've actually caught up on that. Also, the stock price is a lot higher than it was
when we've talked about trying to aggressively buy back some stock. So we always look at that as an important thing.
We don't just buy back stock regardless of price. Not that we think it's a bad price, but when it was at $33 a share or
whatever, that was an extraordinarily compelling price.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: You also gave us a little bit of guidance of what we should expect for this year's CCAR,
maybe similar to what you did last year. Should we look at what you're approved for or what you actually executed in
the repurchase as a better guide number since they are quite a bit different?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: The board will decide when the time comes, and they look at all the priorities, et cetera.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Let me just say, I would just reiterate what I said before, which is getting to our target ratios is
a priority. It's not the only one. We'll have to see how things play out in 2014. But if you do the math, then you can take
your own estimates of what you think we'll earn next year. We should be able to also have the opportunity to take it to
buy more than just employee dilution. So, you're just going to have to – we want that flexibility, that's what we are
permitted for and we'll obviously manage through each quarter as we see it.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And it may depend on what we sell, how much we can mitigate what the new final rules are and
stuff, so there's a lot of moving parts.

<Q - Derek A. De Vries>: Thanks. Good morning. I just have a few housekeeping questions left. I think you
mentioned a mark-to-market gain in Asset Management revenues, wondering if you can just quantify that so we can
strip it out for our forecast?
<A - Marianne Lake>: It's just a little less than $100 million.
<Q - Derek A. De Vries>: Perfect. And then on the Investment Bank, on the comp to income ratio, it's clearly at the
right end of your guidance. I'm just wondering has there been any change in the deferred versus expense this year? And
then I guess related, do we enter 2014 with a similar amount of awarded not yet expensed?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yes. So, there's no change on that part.
<Q - Derek A. De Vries>: Perfect.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: There's no real change in how we're doing other things.

Our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks very much. I just wanted to follow-up on the loan growth expectations. If we adjust
for the typical seasonality associated with the credit card loans, which obviously is high in the fourth quarter, it looks
like your core growth rate in loans was something like 60 basis points or 70 basis points sequentially, which would
obviously translate into roughly a 2.5% annual growth rate.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Are you talking about total loans here?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Are you talking about total and core, or are you talking about reported and...
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Card.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Yeah, I'm talking about reported, correct.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Okay.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Yeah. So it just seems that the 2.5% seems like a fairly robust figure, so I just want to get
your view about what the run rate of core loan growth might be?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Okay. So, I'm going to try and answer the question, and tell me if I don't, I'm sorry. But if you
look at our actual total loans for the whole firm year-over-year, our growth reported was 0.6%, so call it just shy of 1%.
But underlying that core loan growth was about 4%. So, I think that as we look forward, we expect core growth to
continue at or stronger than those levels. And we've reached, as we say in card, the point where, seasonality aside, that
inflection point where we should expect net modest growth.
So, as I said, we're going to have to all wait and see how client demand plays out in small business and middle market
space. But we are hoping that at the second half of 2014 when the confidence in the economic recovery, we have
confidence that when others join us that they will actually start to borrow and spend.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Okay. So it sounds like continuing along this trajectory with potential strength in the back
half of next year?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, that's our hope.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: So, I'm just trying to reconcile that back to the NII dollar expectations which seem fairly
flat. But if the loan growth continues fairly strong and the expectation is to continue to deploy capital into securities
opportunistically, and the CIO portfolio is approaching breakeven, why is the expectation not for a stronger net interest
income dollar growth?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Because, we talked earlier about the fact that we've been seeing and we expect to continue to
see some spread compression in loans. But at this point in the near term, we didn't talk about the whole year of 2014.
But in the near term, we're expecting the improvement that we would see as result of higher yields on investment
securities et cetera to be offset by – or largely offset by the compression in loan spreads.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Okay. Thanks very much.

Our next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Hi, thanks. Just two final follow-ups. Just on the commitment side, as you talked about adjusting
the trade book and as we see the commitments continue to come down, how aggressively are you focusing on the
commitment side from here, in terms of balancing the long-term growth potential versus the risk weightings and capital
build?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: The way to look at that is that what drives the company is serving clients. And so, we don't
target, just when we get rid of commitments or something like that. But obviously, we've asked all the people and
businesses to start to optimize a little bit commitments, balance sheet, LCR, SLR, Basel III. And so you'll probably see
a little bit of a squeeze in commitments as they do that, but not at the expense of trying to do a good job for clients.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Sure. Okay. Great. And then one follow-up on just the run-off...
<A - Jamie Dimon>: The other thing I should point out is some of those commitments are much more capital or
liquidity hogs than others. So, that's where you could see a little bit more of the squeeze.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: And then one follow-up on the fixed income side, within that comments earlier about the run-off
businesses. Is there a way you can update how we should think about the potential sale of physical commodities, and
what proportion it is of the $15.5 billion of FIC revenues this year. And to Marianne, to your point about how that is in
a relative profitable sense?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So, I think if you look back in – let's talk about this year and let's talk about last year. If you
look at 2013 reported, you would have seen that our commodities revenues accounted for in the low teens of our
markets revenues, but that's on an accounting basis. When you think about – so that's just a revenue pure only. If you
think about the economic revenue because obviously there's an accounting growth uptick there, it's a much smaller
number than that, so call it mid-single digits, mid-6%, 7%. But then it was a business that was in a combination of
being built out, so it wasn't fully mature. And also, we're selling parts of the business that are highly capital intensive to
us. So think about the impact on the bottom line as being considerably more modest and with some capital benefits.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Okay. Thanks very much.

Our next question comes from Paul Miller of FBR.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Yeah, thank you very much. Most of my questions been answered, but I wanted to talk a little bit
about your mortgage origination platform. It looks like you dropped from about $40 billion to $23 billion, and your
overall market dropped like 25%, that's like a 40% drop which drops probably your market share below 8%. Can you
add some color to that? Is that just mainly a function of the refis going away? Should we see an increase in market
share down the road?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So a couple of things. First of all, if you just take the second half versus the first half we said
that we thought that the overall market would be down 30% to 40%. It was down about 33%, so it was in line with our
expectations, and our performance was in line with that too. So, you've got to remember that revenue versus closed
loan volume and how that gets recognized, there are some timing differences.
With respect to market share, if you look backwards into 2013, the overall size of the market was revised up, which
means that our market share was, all other things being equal, just relatively revised down. Doesn't change anything.
But going forward, our market share will be a factor of obviously the size of the market but also our pricing discipline
to make sure we're going to get an appropriate risk-adjusted return. So, we would gain share, but only if we can do it
getting paid for the risk and the cost of servicing.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And the whole reduction was refi.

<A - Marianne Lake>: And the whole reduction was refi. I should say that, yes.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And now that we've got – I know you don't want to make any really comments about political
figures. But now that we've got that Mel Watt coming to town, that's probably going to be more focused in extending
the credit box that we've seen over the last couple of years, where most companies don't want to really get away from
high FICO, high credit quality product. Do you think that Watt can be successful in opening the credit curve, and what
types of things would you want to hear where you would start extending the credit box?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: So, I would say that people in the business have slowly been extending the credit box as you look
at – I'm talking about over the last 18 months if you look at LTVs, if you go to different cities. I'm not sure you're going
to see a dramatic expansion of the credit box because all the rep and warranty, all the litigation and stuff like that for
anything that's not qualified mortgages.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, and the qualified mortgages, credit is available. GSE is 90% LTV, on the Ginnie Mae
side close to 100% LTV, so there's credit availability. You just have to have the ability to pay.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And FHA will set its own policy. But even there, I think it would be probably much tighter
underwriting than the FHA guidelines because of how much FHA has cost people.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Okay. Hey, guys, thank you very much.

Our next question comes from Christopher Wheeler of Mediobanca.
<Q - Christopher J. Wheeler>: Yes, good morning. I have a couple of questions. The first one, really I suppose goes
back to Sunday and the news that came out of VaR. Over the last 16 quarters we've been talking about regulation and
you've often been quite aggressive in talking about the impact of some of that regulation. But it seemed like we've
reached the tipping point on Sunday, whereby we step back to most rules that was suggested in June, and came out with
something that was sensible, but actually also was going to support the growth of your business, and indeed the growth
of the economy. Do you think we're actually at a stage now where we can actually feel that we've gotten over the worst
of the regulation, and we can actually get on with running our and your businesses?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I think we know for the most part the contours of the regulation at this point, but some of the fine
tuning still needs to be done. So, I think you're going to see a lot of banks globally adjusting to the new financial
architecture. And the effect of that will be different in different parts of the world. It's slightly different for certain
products, but it will probably be okay in total.
<A - Marianne Lake>: It's nice to have the rules.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: It's nice to have the rules and live with them. And now we've got to push them down and
understand them in a little bit more detail.
<A - Marianne Lake>: There's still a few things we're waiting for, long-term debt requirements, something to look out
for in the first quarter. But having more clarity is definitely helpful.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: We're seeing some people make bigger strategic changes. Some are making just small tactical
changes. And then we're going to report a lot more on what we think the effect of all this is at Investor Day.
<Q - Christopher J. Wheeler>: Okay. And the second question really relates down to the mix of your Investment
Banking revenues. Clearly, what we've seen is obviously the downward pressure on fixed income for some time now
for a whole bunch of reasons, some of which you've touched on.
But I suppose what a lot of people are talking about is that fixed income will no longer quite be the dominant part of the
revenue pull for big investment banks as it was. But in your case and one or two other big players, it's obviously a very
important business. It is your view, and perhaps don't just talk about yourselves, but the very big players, the very

successful players in fixed income will actually probably be seeking to take share of what is going to be a smaller pot
going forward.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Again, I look at it little bit differently. I look at the pot will change and adjust in the new world,
but from there it'll probably grow, because if you look at underlying numbers, the amount of investable assets around
the world is going to double over ten years. The amount of needs of corporations; i.e. our clients and sovereigns and
super-nationals, and ECM/DCM and advisory will double over ten years.
So, there will be a strong underlying business. Spreads, products, those things have always changed. Spreads have been
coming down my whole life, and yet we have a healthy business. So, we expect that fixed income after some
adjustment will be a good business. We think a lot of these trends are cyclical, not secular, and that's how we're
positioned for it.
<A - Marianne Lake>: And we have gained share.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Yeah. And we have gained share.
<Q - Christopher J. Wheeler>: I wish you luck. Thank you very much.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: It is possible if people leave and there are certain things we price, so it'll go back to, all
businesses have to have a normal return on capital to the average player, otherwise they wouldn't exist. So, we do think
you'll see some of that. There will be pieces that go to non-banks, which is fine.
<Q - Christopher J. Wheeler>: Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

Our next question comes from Steven Chubak of Nomura.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Morning.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: I had a couple of questions regarding the Basel SLR. Specifically, Marianne, I wanted to
clarify a comment you had made earlier, where it sounded as though you expect the U.S. regulators to adopt the revised
Basel framework from over the weekend as a final SLR calculation approach. And I didn't know if that guidance was in
the context of the higher 5% SLR requirement, which is being imposed on the U.S. G-SIBs.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Look, I think the reality is, I don't know any more than you do. I just think that given the
changes that were made, it seems to be positive and constructive. There's reason to believe that the U.S. regulators
would want to leverage that. I could be wrong. And I'm not aware of – obviously, we did comment letters on the U.S.
NPR, but I'm not aware of any specifics on the quotients.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: So, just to add, if you listen to what the regulators said, not this time but going back, they
intended to make Basel and U.S. rules common, about the rules. They did not say they intended to have the same
percent. We're just assuming that 5% is going to stay.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Correct.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And we think there'll be a couple of other adjustments going forward too.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay, no, that's helpful. And then just looking at both the risk-based and leverage-based
ratios, it sounds as though for the SLR, there are a lot of mitigation opportunities at your disposal. On a pro forma
basis, which ratio do you anticipate will represent the binding constrain on capital return going forward?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So if you look at the total firm consolidated, then they actually co-exist quite nicely if you
think about our target for Basel III Tier 1 common of 10% or 10.5% and a leverage target of 5% or 5.5%. So I think the

leverage ratio feels like as a consolidated matter, it's a simple back-stop, exactly as it's supposed to be, a binding
constraint. The devil is in the details. As you push that down, as I said, to the individual business and products and then
obviously consider it in the context of the whole client relationship.
I think as we look forward, CCAR is something to just be thoughtful about because it's a stress scenario. It's evolving in
terms of the maturity of it as well as a move over time towards being on a Basel III advanced approach. So if I had to
guess, I would say CCAR could be.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay. Thank you. And then transitioning to a risk-based ratio that's maybe I guess not
spoken about as often, the Tier 1 capital ratio, that ultimately could compel increased preferred issuance. We did see
capital market within the first six months of the year, and I didn't know how we should be thinking about the level of
preferred issuance you're targeting going forward. Is it consisting with the 150 basis points noted within the Fed's
proposal, or should we be thinking about that differently, i.e. some of the mandated buffer will be met with incremental
equity?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So I would say that our Tier 1 capital needs to be at 11%-plus. We said we're going to run it at
10% to 10.5%, Basel III Tier 1 common. I would suggest that the gap will be pressed and maybe more pressed than
that.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Thank you. That's helpful and that's it for me.
