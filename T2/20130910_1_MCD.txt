Today's conference call is being webcast live and recorded for replay via the phone, webcast and podcast. And Before I
turn it over to Don, I want to remind everyone that the forward-looking statements in our earnings release and 8-K
filings also apply to our comments. Both documents are available at our website at www.investor.mcdonalds.com, as
are any reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures mentioned on today's call with their corresponding GAAP
measures.
Now, I'd like to turn it over to Don. Don?
Donald Thompson, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Everyday McDonald's is a destination for 69 million customers
worldwide and our number one priority is to satisfy their needs by serving great testing high quality food in
contemporary restaurants. Now, that focus on our customers is particularly critical in this uncertain environment, where
ongoing volatility continues to dampen consumer sentiment and spending. More specifically, growth in the informal
eating out industry has been relatively flat to declining around the world and we expect that to continue.
And while 2012 was a challenging year for a number of reasons, both within and outside of our control, we remained
focused on stabilizing and growing market share in the near term while continuing to lay the foundation for sustainable
and profitable long-term growth. For the full year, we continued to grow market share in Europe, APMEA and the U.S.
amid a more competitive global environment and a slight decline in our fourth quarter comparable traffic.
Now, as I share our results for the quarter and the full year, I also want to provide a perspective on how we've adapted
our plans as we strive to become our customers' favorite place and way to eat and drink.
System-wide sales grew to 5% in constant currencies in 2012 with total comparable sales up 3.1% for the year.
Comparable sales for the quarter and the month of December were essentially flat. As we begin 2013, we face
persistent top and bottom line pressures and significant prior year results. As a result, we expect January sales to be
negative.
In constant currencies, operating income grew 4% for both the quarter and the year, while earnings per share increased
5% for both periods. Even though our 2012 performance was softer than recent years, we've adapted our plans to be
more aggressive and continue to build on the gains that we have made.
This will ensure that we drive long-term value for our system and our shareholders despite the pressures of the
short-term environment. We have a resilient business model and aligned system and experience in every type of
operating environment around the world. Our long-term average annual financial targets in constant currencies remain
intact and are appropriate for a company of our size and maturity. They keep us focused on making the best decisions
for the long-term benefit of our shareholders.
This past year, we met our long-term system-wide sales growth target of 3% to 5%. Full year operating income growth
came in below our target of 6% to 7%. Our performance was impacted by heightened global operating challenges along
with planned G&A investments that pressured the bottom line. And while our one year return on incrementally invested
capital is not yet final, we expect it to be in the mid-to-high teens.
As we begin 2013, we are placing an even greater emphasis on those drivers that excite consumers and generate the
greatest growth for our business. We still have plenty of room to grow within the framework of our plan to win and our
three global growth priorities to optimize our menu, modernize the customer experience and broaden accessibility to
brand McDonald's around the world.
For example, our menu strategy provides exceptional value at every price tier by offering an affordable entry point and
leveraging mid-tier and premium products to encourage trade up and a higher average check.
We've also intensified our focus on the fundamentals in areas that are hallmarks of our brand, including operations,
service, leadership marketing and merchandising. And we're placing an even greater emphasis on scaling successes
even more quickly around the globe.

The answers are definitely in our system and are driving our plans in every area of the world, from compelling menu
offerings like McWraps to winning value in convenience initiatives to our beverage business, extended hours and new
restaurant developments in both established and emerging markets.
So, I'll start with the U.S where comparable sales increased 0.3% for the quarter and 3.3% for the year. For the same
period, operating income was relatively flat and up 2%, respectively. Because we experienced softer performance in the
second half of the year, we adjusted our plans to re-energize our menu and value offerings. We focused on entrees with
the introduction of new premium Cheddar Bacon Onion sandwich in late October and the return of the popular McRib
sandwich in December.
We also leverage the news of our new NFL and Pro Bowl partnerships to remind customers about a classic favorite,
that's our juicy and tender all white meat Chicken McNuggets by featuring the 20 piece McNuggets for $4.99 and we
brought excitement and variety to the Dollar Menu adding the new Grilled Onion Cheddar Burger at the end of
December. Now, our menu pipeline is more balanced in 2013.
We'll be introducing Fish McBites soon and later in the year. We'll debut new beef sandwiches, chicken entrees,
breakfast and beverage offers that are demonstrating strong customer appeal in the test markets. We also refocused our
advertising to enhance support for value in the fourth quarter and we'll continue these efforts into 2013.
The marketing calendar will balance large scale food events, compelling value, ongoing entree news, and strong local
activities. In addition to the menu and marketing efforts to play a big role in our 2013 plans, we're staying focused on
meaningful service enhancements that improve customer satisfaction and our service levels. We're also expanding our
peak hour performance to capture even more visits and broaden our accessibility.
Now, let's turn over to Europe, where comparable sales were down 60 basis points for the quarter and up 2.4% for the
year. In constant currencies, operating income grew 7% for the quarter and 6% for the year.
Europe was a solid contributor to bottom line results even with the effects of the debt crisis and austerity measures
impacting consumers. While low consumer confidence continues to negatively affect retails and the IEO visits, we
outperformed the market and grew market share by 10 basis points to 9.2% year-to-date November. Our performance
can be attributed to three drivers; enhanced value messaging, trading customers up to premium products that they know
and love and new product news.
Our base value initiatives are essential to maintaining and attracting new customers. That's why many markets have
reintroduced value, either with new news or by evolving existing value platforms to be even more appealing. In France
for example, we are advertising the new Casse-Croute sandwich and drink combo for EUR4.50 nationally. And in
Germany, we've enhanced our McDeal value bundle to include two new entree choices.
Meanwhile, the U.K. continues to be a bright spot in the region and this is a great example of how we are executing
premium offers that resonate with our customers. Its strong run of premium food promotions included the Bacon
Chicken Onion Food Event which began in the fourth quarter and will be featured in France this year.
Across Europe, we also continue to build the capacity of our existing restaurants through extended hours and by
leveraging technology, such as the new power system, self-order kiosk and handheld order takers. Europe is a region
that is ripe with opportunity and we are well-positioned to capitalize on this region's long-term potential.
Now let's shift over to Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa where comparable sales were down 1.7% for the quarter
and up 1.4% for the full year. IEO visits have declined across most markets and we've seen a slowdown in eating out
behaviors overall across APMEA.
In constant currencies, operating income declined 1% in the fourth quarter but grew 3% for the year. Now like the rest
of the world, APMEA experienced a challenging year of economic pressures. Consumer confidence remains low, partly
due to Japan's uneven recovery and China's slower economic growth. As markets review their menu offerings for the
final months of the year and into 2013, they focused on leveraging seasonality, local relevance and favorite limited time
offers to both mitigate the softness and balance their value in premium platform.

In Australia, the start of the summer campaign featuring new smoothie flavors and compelling limited time offers
including lamb sandwiches and wraps drove sales and traffic. And to further reinforce this value messaging, Australia
is re-launching its Loose Change menu this month with a new national program designed to drive guess counts and
average check.
Now while Japan's results were the primary factor in APMEA's negative comps for the quarter, the JPY100, JPY250
and JPY500 value offering drove guess count increases and market share gains within a contacting IEO marketplace.
As we begin 2013, Japan, is focused on building average check in two ways; through trade-up opportunities with
promotional products and through its focus on breakfast.
In China, comparable sales decreased 0.9% for the quarter and increased 3.2% for the full year. While the recent
chicken supply industry issue minimally impacted our fourth quarter results, the heightened consumer sensitivity
around this matter is negatively impacting our sales into 2013. We are committed to ensuring the highest food safety
and quality standards are met around the world.
We remain focused on growing check in the market by building on China's value position through a blend of menu
news and convenience initiatives. In addition, a new web ordering system that enhances the customer experience
lowers the cost of operations and drives new demand is being scaled across China. Already in more than 500 hubs, this
system is helping broaden accessibility across China through delivery. We also opened 256 restaurants in China last
year, making significant progress toward our goal of 2,000 restaurants in China by the end of 2013.
Around the world, we have a strong foundation on which we continue to grow. Our business, our brand, and our
financials remain strong and we will keep building upon them. As our business grows and continues to generate
significant levels of cash, our first priority is to reinvest in opportunities to grow the business for the future.
Our second use of cash is our dividend. Last September, the Board announced a 10% increase in our quarterly cash
dividend to $0.77 per share in the fourth quarter. Our third and final use of cash is share repurchases. In 2012, we
returned a total of $5.5 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.
As we begin the new year, I'd like to reiterate my confidence in McDonald's. Our system alignment is strong. We are
determined to leverage our strengths to attract more customers, to gain even more market share and fortify our financial
strength. Our plan to win is strong and we continue to aggressively pursue the growth opportunities within our three
global priorities to optimize the menu, modernize the customer experience and broaden accessibility to Brand
McDonald's.
We've made the tactical adjustments that are necessary to navigate through the current environment, while continuing
to deliver value for the benefit of our system and our shareholders over the long-term.
Thanks. With that, I'll turn it over to Pete.
Peter Bensen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks Don, and hello everyone. The McDonald's system remains focused on executing the proven strategies behind
the three global priorities of our plan to win. In both fourth quarter 2012 and for the full year, this translated into
growth in revenues and earnings per share despite challenging market conditions.
We continue to manage our business for the long term and are confident in our business model and hard earned
competitive advantages. McDonald's has a long history of profitable growth in a variety of economic and competitive
cycles. In the near-term, we do not expect significant changes in the macroeconomic or competitive environment, so we
remain focused on those things within our control. This includes a 2013 plan designed to maintain and grow market
share along with investments that solidify our foundation to drive future growth and returns.
In 2012, combined operating margin declined 40 basis points to 31.2% and continues to compare favorably to other
large global consumer companies. Restaurant margin was the main driver of our combined operating margin with about

80% of our restaurants franchised, the largest component of our overall profitability continues to be franchised margins.
In constant currencies, consolidated franchise margin increased 3% to $1.9 billion for the quarter and 6% to $7.4 billion
for the full year, with every area of the world contributing.
The consolidated franchise margin percent declined 20 basis points for the quarter and was flat for the year at 83%, and
sales performance was offset primarily by higher occupancy costs, including depreciation. Consolidated
Company-operated margins, representing about 30% of total restaurant margin dollars, declined 90 basis points to
17.8% for the year -- or for the quarter and fell 70 basis points to 18.2% for the year. Sales performance was offset
primarily by higher labor and commodity costs in both periods.
Moving on to segment performance; in the U.S., we led steep comparable sales increases in fourth quarter and faced
higher cost across most expense categories resulting in a 150 basis point decline in Company-operated margins to
19.5%. For the full year, margins declined 110 basis points to 19.5%, as 4% higher commodity costs as well as
increased labor and occupancy expenses more than offset sales gains.
Price increases are used to mitigate inflationary pressures. It is critical to maintain our value proposition by keeping
price increase at or below key inflation indices. At year end, our U.S. price increase was about 2%, which is slightly
less than the food away from home increase for the year of 2.5%.
A conscious decision was made not to replace 75 basis points of pricing that rolled off in November in light of the
slight decline projected in 2013 IEO traffic. And with projected 2013 food away from home inflation of 2.5% to 3.5%,
we want to maintain pricing flexibility as we balance future price increases with our desire to continue to grow traffic
and market share.
We expect U.S. commodity cost to increase 1.5% to 2.5% in 2013. In addition, labor and depreciation are expected to
continue to pressure margins.
Turning to Europe, for both fourth quarter and full year 2012, sales performance was offset primarily by higher labor
and commodities. Company-operated margins declined 10 basis points for the quarter and 20 basis points for the year
to 19.1%. Commodity increases of 2% in the fourth quarter and 3% for the full year, negatively impacted margins.
Europe's margins once again benefited from solid performance in Russian and the U.K. which together represent nearly
45% of Company-operated margin dollars in Europe. Europe's full year comparable sales gain was driven entirely by
pricing and product mix. At year-end, Europe's price increase excluding Russia was about 2.5%. On the expense side,
we expect commodities to increase 3% to 4% in 2013, along with continued pressure from higher labor expenses.
Despite these near-term challenges, including an IEO market projected to be relatively flat to declining in 2013, our
business in Europe remains solid, as does our fundamental operating model. We remain focused on reigniting traffic
growth through a balanced approach of enhanced value offerings and compelling premium products. Menu innovation,
including premium products remains an area of focus.
With nearly all of our interiors and over half of exteriors reimaged, premium products often merchandised around
promotional food events have proven to be appealing to European consumers.
In Asia, Pacific, Middle East and Africa, several key markets, including Japan, Australia and China, enhanced their
value platforms in 2012. This resonated with consumers as we served over 1.2 million more customers per day versus
the prior year. Looking to 2013, we will strive to build on our traffic gains while encouraging trade-up and add-on
purchases to boost average check and overall comparable sales.
In addition to compelling value, many of our markets offer key conveniences, including delivery and drive-thru.
Convenience also means being available to customers when they need us. Nearly two-thirds of our restaurants in
APMEA offer some form of extended hours and over half are open 24 hours.
Relative to profitability, APMEA's Company-operated margins declined 190 basis points for the quarter to 14.4%, as
negative comparable sales along with higher labor and occupancy costs pressured margins. For the year,
Company-operated margins declined 140 basis points to 15.9%. The acceleration of new store openings in China

continued to negatively impact APMEA's margins in both periods.
The final component of combined operating margin is G&A. In constant currency, G&A increased 4% for the year, less
than previously forecasted due in part to lower incentive-based compensation and lower than planned spending on IT
acceleration. The overall increase for the year was primarily driven by about $90 million of spending on our Olympic
sponsorship, technology enhancements and the biennial Worldwide Owner, Operator Convention. As a percent of sales
and revenue, G&A was flat versus the prior year. As we look to 2013, we expect G&A to increase about 2% to 3% in
constant currencies.
I want to briefly comment on the increase in other operating income. As part of our overall refranchising efforts in
Europe, Canada and China, we've recognized higher gains from sales of restaurants in both fourth quarter and the full
year. We continue to seek strong committed local franchisees, using both conventional and developmental licensee
structures.
McDonald's continues to generate significant cash from operations. Our first use of that cash is to reinvest in our
business to continue growing and generating strong returns. This is accomplished through a balanced measured
approach of adding new restaurants and growing sales at existing locations.
In 2012, we further modernized our brand through opening 1,439 new restaurants and reimaging about 2,400 others.
Full year 2012 capital expenditures are not yet final, but we expect them to total between $3 billion and $3.1 billion.
This increase from our $2.9 billion estimate is a result of several factors, including an increased number and scope of
some of U.S. reimaging project, timing of projects and cash payments and overall increase in the number of new
openings in all areas the world.
In 2013, we expect to invest about $3.2 billion, over half of which will be used to open 1,500 to 1,600 new restaurants.
The breakdown for openings in our largest geographic segments is as follows; 220 openings in the U.S., 290 in Europe
and 850 in APMEA including about 300 new restaurants in China. The remainder of our CapEx will be invested in our
existing locations including reimaging more than 1,600 restaurants globally.
Lastly, let me touch on foreign currency translation which negatively impacted fourth quarter results by $0.01 and full
year EPS by $0.17. At current exchange rates, we expect first quarter 2013 EPS to be minimally impacted between zero
and negative $0.01 and expect full year positive impact of $0.04 to $0.05. As always, please take this as directional
only because I know rates will change as we move throughout the year.
As we begin 2013, we are mindful of the challenging comparisons we have in the first quarter as well as the ongoing
pressures on both our top and bottom lines. I'm confident in the adjustments we have made to fortify our near-term
performance while remaining focused on the larger opportunities over the longer term. McDonald's has earned
significant long-term competitive advantages in size and scale.
We are uniquely well-positioned to capitalize on future growth opportunities within the $1 trillion global informal
eating out industry, where our market share today is less than 9%. McDonald's has a strong history of creating
significant value for shareholders over time and we remain committed to continuing to do so in the years to come.
Thank you. Now, I'll turn it over to Kathy to begin our Q&A.
Questions And Answers
Kathy Martin, Vice President of Investor Relations
Great. Thanks Pete. We're going to now open the call for analysts and investor questions. (Operator Instruction) We're
going to try to give as many people as possible the chance to ask questions, so if you can limit yourself to one, we'd
appreciate that. And then we'll come back to you with follow-up as time allows. So, we will start with Brian Bittner

Brian Bittner, Analyst
Great. Thank you very much. I have a question about just your guidance for 2013 for the 6% to 7% operating income
growth. It clearly assumes that your sales do recover nicely, but what it also assumes I guess is that you can better
leverage this sales growth than you have recently and really increase some margins here.
It seems as though that could be somewhat of a challenge, there are still margin headwinds and even on kind of low
single-digit same-store sales growth, it could be tough for the franchising company margins to really improve. So if you
could just give us a little more color on the confidence in that 6% to 7% operating income growth given what seems to
be some margin headwinds, how are you going to be able to better leverage sales growth if it does recover?
Donald Thompson, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi Brian, thank you so much for the question. I'll comment on this first one and Pete may have something to add. What
I would tell you Brian is we absolutely believe that our 6% to 7% operating income guidance is the right target for our
growth over the long-term. As we've said throughout 2012, we firmly believe that what we have to do is appeal to more
customers. We've got to appeal relative to top line growth. We've got to have a variety, a stronger variety and a stronger
pipeline that's executed in the various markets. We believe we definitely have that going into 2013 and feel better about
the robustness, if you will, of that food pipeline.
We know also that these are, 2013 is still going to be a tough economic environment around the world. We know this in
Europe; we know it in APMEA. In the U.S., we are seeing some signs of may be a slight recovery.
However, having said that, we also know that we have commodity pressures and some labor pressures. So, by no
means do we intend to state that 2013 is going to be an easy year. However, we believe our target, 6% to 7%, are the
appropriate targets. We believe our plan to continue to focus on food and the menu, to modernize the customer
experience, to continue our reimages, to continue to grow relative to the opportunities in new markets around the
world. We believe those things will help us to be effective in continuing to build the business.
Kathy Martin, Vice President of Investor Relations
And our next question is from Keith Siegner, Credit Suisse.
Keith Siegner, Analyst
Thanks. The question I want to ask you is about, December by all means on a two year trade-day adjusted basis was a
very strong month, one of the best of the year despite Japan's weakness. When looking at the January guidance were
slight negative, while still very strongly as a slight slowdown, and I know you don't usually like to get into regional
breakdowns, but even at a qualitative basis, if there is anything you could offer, is this, you know is some of that
coming from the U.S., is the payroll tax maybe playing some role in this. Any regional kind of qualitative data you
could give us on January would be very helpful.
Donald Thompson, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hey Keith. As you know, Keith based upon last year we had a very strong first quarter. In that first quarter we were --
we experience sales that were up 7.3%. We had success across markets. The U.S. was particularly strong. Clearly,
Europe was very strong, but as we move into 2013, we also know that we're comping against those success factors.
We really talk about things like weather and the fact that where Chinese New Year shift around, so as long as we
continue to talk about the entire first quarter, we know we will see some shifts from a January into a February relative

to Chinese New Year, but it won't affect the overall quarter.
So we believe that as we move into, as we talk about our first quarter sales, the first quarter sales will mute out many of
the things that were -- they shifted around during last year. Having said that, it was -- as I mentioned it was a 7.5% or
7.3% comp in the first quarter of last year, and so we know we're going up against that is going to be fairly tough.
In the first quarter of the year, we do see as shift from the Chinese New Year perspective out of January into February.
So, we know that that's going to be a part of that. We believe the plans that we've seen are solid plans, but nonetheless,
we still face some economic challenges around the world.
Kathy Martin, Vice President of Investor Relations
Next question is from David Palmer from UBS.
David Palmer, Analyst
Hey guys. If I can throw in a little one on China, is the consumer reaction there is that chicken supply issue diminishing
or is it still as bad as it has been? My major question though is on reimaging. When you factor in the reimaging, the
new build for relocation and reimages, what percent of the system is now done and where do you think that percentage
will be in a year, what lifts are you seeing and do you think that that outperformance continues into year two after
reimage such that we might see a cumulative increasing benefit? Thanks.
Donald Thompson, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks David. Why don't we have Tim Fenton give a perspective relative to the chicken supply issues and then I'll ask
Pete to talk a little bit about reimaging.
Tim Fenton, Chief Operating Officer
Hi David, first of all, safety of our food is always top of mind for our customers and it's one of our priorities. We have
strong procedures in place in McDonald's China for testing all of our products. We test all batches of all of our raw
products that come through our doors. So very little impact in December as a whole, maybe seeing a little bit more, but
it's really an industry-wide situation or broad-based. country-wide chicken industry issue that we're experiencing in
China right now.
Donald Thompson, President and Chief Executive Officer
And David, as far as reimaging, in the U.S. we closed the year at about 35% complete on both interiors and exteriors.
Europe was a little over 90% done on the interiors. As you know they started sooner and over 50% on the exteriors and
APMEA is about 60% done on the interiors and close to 50% on the exteriors.
You saw in our guidance that we're actually reducing the number of reimages in 2013 relative to 2012. Part of that is
because of the substantial progress we've made in a lot of these countries, including Canada, which we typically don't
break out separately, as well as a conscious decision in certain markets, China being one to redirect some of the capital
toward new store openings.
As far as the sales performance, it continues to be strong and within our expectations, and as we get more and more
history, especially in the U.S., it's the data I'm most familiar with, we're actually seeing that second year incremental
comp sales stronger than the first. So that benefit continues to grow. I think as the trade area and customers get used to
the new environment and the more moderate and relevant surrounding, in addition to some of the more investments we

do to improve the efficiency, like dual drive-through, sales just continue to build over time. So, it's going to continue to
be a part of our strategy and we are really happy with the results.
Kathy Martin, Vice President of Investor Relations
Next question is from Michael Kelter, Goldman Sachs.
Michael Kelter, Analyst
So, U.S. restaurant margins have declined for two consecutive years now and the pace of declines has accelerated to
about 100 basis points or more each of the last two quarters.
So, my question is, is the recent increased focus on value exacerbating the issue at all? And separately, are there any
initiatives that you are looking to put in place for 2013 to help stop the slide?
Donald Thompson, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hey Michael, just a couple of things relative to the value piece, because we get asked this question quite often. The first
thing I'd say is that, in the U.S., keep in mind we always had the Dollar Menu. What we did towards the fourth quarter
of last -- in the fourth quarter of last year, was really go back to advertising the Dollar Menu more, because we had
shifted our media away over to the Extra Value Menu.
So, we took it away from Extra Value, put it back over to Dollar Menu. If you look at it from a percent of sales
perspective, the Dollar Menu is still in the 10% to 15% range. Typically, we say 13% to 15%, it's still in that range. So,
it has not gone up by some substantial amount, as a result of us going ahead in advertising the Dollar Menu more so in
our media.
I will also say that the way that we're advertising Dollar Menu now is more consistent with how we had done it in the
past and we got away from that in the second and the third quarters of 2012. So, that really is the difference relative to
the Dollar Menu piece.
Peter Bensen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
And one of the things we're doing Michael to -- you asked about enhancing it. One of the thing we're doing in late
December, we added the Grilled Onion Cheddar Burger which was another reason to visit the Dollar Menu adding
some excitement and some new news, as well as putting a product on there that actually is better from the food cost
perspective.
Kathy Martin, Vice President of Investor Relations
Our next question is from Mitch Speiser, Buckingham Research.
Mitch Speiser, Analyst
Great, thanks very much, and you answered a lot of my questions in the prepared comments. Just on the cash flow
which there isn't a lot of data in the press release, the share buyback was a bit lower in the fourth quarter. Your
dividend payments I think are now exceeding share repurchase. As we look at 2013, and given the increased CapEx
budget, should we expect any change in trend in share repurchase activity?

Donald Thompson, President and Chief Executive Officer
Mitch, regarding the quarter, typically the fourth quarter is our lowest share repurchase as we tend to have our dividend
increase in the quarter and we spend a significant portion of our CapEx in the fourth quarter. So you typically see our
share repurchase less. As you point out, as the dividend continues to increase, that continues to be a greater portion of
our free cash flow, but we remain committed to our strategy of returning all free cash flow to shareholders over time.
Kathy Martin, Vice President of Investor Relations
Our next question is from David Tarantino from Baird.
David Tarantino, Analyst
Hi, good morning. I wanted to come back to the 6% to 7% long-term operating income guidance. My question centers
around 2013. You're coming off a year in 2012 where you didn't hit that guidance for the first time in recent memory.
So, I wanted to ask what your thoughts are on your ability to hit that in 2013 and specifically, maybe you could talk
about the degree of difficulty this year relative to the degree of difficulty last year? Thanks.
Donald Thompson, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks David. Let me just reiterate something that I mentioned in the formal comments and that was in 2012, we did
meet our long-term system-wide sales growth target of 3% to 5% in constant currencies. So, from a top line perspective
we did have growth that was in line with what our expectations were.
Also keep in mind, in 2012 that we had some additional G&A investments that we've made, incremental G&A
investments that we made around several things. One was the Olympics. Another was an incremental investment in
technology. We wanted to really establish the new part technology system which would help us operationally around
the world in a stronger fashion.
And then clearly, we also had our Owner, Operators Convention. We had several things that came into play. So, I want
to make sure that we also put that in perspective. If you were to net those things out, we would have still came in at
about -- we would had about a 5% growth in constant currencies. So, first, just a level set that's very important.
The long-term targets that we have established are exactly that. They are the long-term average targets that we believe
are viable for our business. So the 6% to 7% is that long-term target. We also know that one year doesn't change our
strategy. One year will not change our results. We don't think that there's been a fundamental enough shift for us to
change our targets as we move forward, and we think that the plans that we have around the world are strong enough
and viable enough for us to again move toward and achieve those targets.
Kathy Martin, Vice President of Investor Relations
Next question is from John Glass from Morgan Stanley.
John Glass, Analyst
Thanks. First, if I could just ask you to clarify the commentary around January, is this a global, I mean, every region
phenomenon is negative or is this specifically driven -- you highlighted Chinese New Year and some other issues? Is it
really just APMEA and maybe we'll see other regions, as being better or slightly positive? Because in the U.S., you
really saw a trend change in December, I don't -- I guess we're all trying to figure out if that's an anomaly.

That's just a clarification. And then, the margin question, in the U.S., food inflation is going to be half the rate it was in
the last two years, and it sounds like you are going to price about in line with inflation. So, why wouldn't that be a
relatively positive sign that you could maybe just hold margin in '13? I understand it's sales dependent to some degree;
if sales cooperate, you could hold margin for the first time in a couple of years?
Peter Bensen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Hey John, it's Pete. On January, it's not our practice to get into the regional breakout of that. So, we need to get the
month behind us and then we will give you all the texture and commentary when we release in early February. As far
as the U.S. margin goes, you hit on it. It's really a top line gain.
So well, yes, we are going to experience some relief in the commodity side. We are still going to have a shrinking
eating out market based on the most recent projections, anywhere from 20 to 50 basis points are the forecasts I have
seen. So, in that environment, it makes it even more challenging from a pricing perspective to recover all of those input
costs.
So, once we get past the first quarter which is our toughest comparison, I want to believe that the comparisons and the
margin performance will be less pressured than it was in 2012. But until -- we really see an expansion in the consumer
environment and the eating out market, is the margins will continue to be challenged.
Kathy Martin, Vice President of Investor Relations
Our next question is from Jeff Bernstein from Barclays.
Jeff Bernstein, Analyst
Great. Thank you, very much. Just kind of moving more toward Europe. The value focus has been in place now over
the past few quarters, just wondering whether in your view it's reasonable to assume that the goal to stabilize traffic
kind of at the expense of average check-in margin was a success, and as we look to '13, maybe should we see benefit
from some trade backup to whether it would be core premium menu as you guys have alluded to in the past, before a
return to perhaps positive comps margin expansion in Europe?
It seems like Germany and France are the areas where color would helpful and then just as an aside, you mentioned
extended hours in each region in your prepared remarks. I'm just wondering if you can give us an update on where we
stand on extended in 24 hours in each market.
Donald Thompson, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi Jeff, I'll touch base on the front end and then I'm going to ask Tim Fenton to talk a little bit about what he is seeing
relative to some of the plans from -- some of the markets across Europe.
If we go back to 2012, one of the things that we mentioned is that we needed to really institute a stronger value
messaging in France and in Germany. We had one that we felt fairly strong about in Spain. We needed to really initiate
a stronger value platform in Italy. And so that was kind of the way we entered into 2012.
We are and we do feel much better relative to having -- have France make many steps forward which Tim can talk a
little bit about relative to their value enhancements. In Germany, Germany is a tough environment from a consumer
perspective, it is, as we've always mentioned, the most cost sensitive from a promotional perspective. We have some
things that we've been doing now with the 3.79 meal deal, but there are some other pieces that have come out that Tim
and the team have looked at relative to France and Germany.

So, do we feel like we've established value platforms across Europe? Yes, much more so than when we were in 2012,
so it won't demand the same level of trying to implement value. But now what we've got to do is make sure we're
reinforcing some of the other parts of the plan. So Tim has been meeting with the folks and going over plans recently.
So, Tim?
Tim Fenton, Chief Operating Officer
Sure. Well, there are some headwinds obviously in Europe. Decreasing consumer confidence I think has been at the
all-time low since they've been tracking it. IEO continues to contract; however, Europe gained market share for 2012.
France back in the second quarter put much more emphasis on some of their value initiatives that they have with peak
pleasures, just started and that Don alluded to the Casse-Croute in France about 10 days ago, which is basically a
baguette and a drink EUR4.50, just started 10 days ago with advertising. So, we really don't have a lot of input on that.
As far as Germany, the McDeal started back in June which is two EVMs for EUR3.79 and this has been the most price
sensitive country we have as well as shifting some of our focus, our GRPs on our SMS which is equivalent to like $1
menu that we have here in the U.S.
So tough not, working at it. The good thing is, we're coming from a position of strength as far as market share, as far as
share of voice, physical plants, operations. So it's a strong case for us moving forward.
Peter Bensen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
And Jeff, a quick update on the 24 hours. APMEA leads the system with 60% of the restaurants at 24 hours, the U.S. is
at 44% and Europe is at 26%. All of those continues to be a focus as we talk about broadening acceptability being one
of our three global priorities, operating more hours continues to be a focus in all the markets around the world.
Kathy Martin, Vice President of Investor Relations
Our next question is from Jason West from Deutsche Bank.
Jason West, Analyst
Yeah, thanks, just one quick one on Japan, if you could talk a bit more about what you're doing to turn that around. Is
that really just a broader market issue or is it something you can do there to change the trend and when that might
happen?
And then just bigger picture on the CapEx and the growth outlook. Don, you guys are kind of pushing a little bit harder
on unit growth again and you are not changing your long-term EBIT growth number. So, it does suggest the returns
could be under some pressure. If you could just talk about the decision to ramp up growth when you are seeing some
issues with margins? Thanks.
Donald Thompson, President and Chief Executive Officer
Tim, do you want to talk about Japan?

Jason, it's Tim. First of all, I think Japan is probably one of the most competitive markets we have right now in the IEO,
and it is a declining IEO market. In spite of that, again, Japan has gained market share in 2012. They are also
strategically working -- moving away from some of the tactical promotions or discounts they'd had, and if look in 2012
-- or 2011 was a lot on the 40th anniversary.
So they're moving away from the tactical to more of a strategic value, revamp some of their Dollar Menu or JPY100
menus to go with 100 to 250 and 500, and to really try to address the erosion that we've had in average check. We've
had good guest count growth. We've just lost at an average check with some of the new premium products that we are
bringing into them.
Donald Thompson, President and Chief Executive Officer
And Jason relative to CapEx, I know you referenced ramping up. It is not really a ramp up. What we have established is
a long-term development strategy. It is a part of the overall plan to win and one of the three global priorities on the
broadening accessibility.
Our goal is to be able to grow to the real opportunity that McDonald's has out there and we think that we do clearly
have some opportunities there. What we don't want to do Jason is get into an old habit that we have which was -- we
start developing and maybe the economic environment will get slightly more difficult, so we slow down. We'd ramp up
the teams and the resources and ramp then down. We were inconsistent in growth. We changed that in China.
We are now looking at markets that are higher opportunity markets around the word to be able to ensure that we have a
steady, consistent planned strategic growth as we move forward. And on the CapEx piece specifically, I ask Pete to
make couple of comments there.
Peter Bensen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Jason, I mean, the increase in units, if we just take the midpoint of our 2013 guidance, it's a little over a 100 increase in
units, more than half of those are coming out of China and we've talked about the opportunity there and the strategic
importance to growth there. Europe's another 30 of those roughly in places like Russia, Italy, Spain, where again as
Don mentioned, the opportunity continues the to be large and over the last couple of years, we've worked on building
our pipeline of sites and we have a very strong pipeline and feel very confident that this is absolutely the right thing to
do for the long-term future.
Kathy Martin, Vice President of Investor Relations
All right. We have about 12 people left in the queue. So I am going to ask you to try to stick to that one question. So
our next question comes from Joseph Buckley, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Joseph Buckley, Analyst
Thank you. Pete, I want to stay on the CapEx side for a moment. You've referenced in the G&A in the fourth quarter
the acceleration, the IT slowing a little bit. It sounds like you're shifting resources away from remodels towards new
units and I'm not sure where the IT plans fit in, in that.
Has that been slowed a little bit as well and maybe could you just talk about the pros and cons of moving to new unit
development over remodels, if that's the choice you're making?

Page 14 of 20
Joe, the slowdown in the IT acceleration really was more impactful to G&A than it was to the CapEx. And the
slowdown really was just a shift. So, we had identified the plans that we have and just as things softened a little bit at
the end of 2012, we made a conscious decision to slow down a little bit on that. And so, we are continuing to focus and
that's primarily as you know, rolling out our new POS system and doing some things around our financial and HR
systems around the world.
Those continue to be a focus. We're just pacing that slightly differently. In terms of the CapEx, as Don mentioned, this
is growing to market opportunity. So, it's not -- we're going to get 2.5% of our sales growth in 2013 from unit
expansion and that's half of our 5% kind of top-end target. So this is not really a dramatic change or shift and again, if
you think about more than half of that increase coming from China where we know the long-term opportunity is huge
and again, that comment, it's very important that Don made. It's very hard to start and stop new restaurant development
and you can't use one year's results or one year's pressure on margin to make a quick and short-term decision that has a
negative impact to the long-term.
So, we've worked hard these last couple of years to build the pipeline, to improve our tools, to improve the unit
economics such that when we open these restaurants, they are opening at good volumes around the world. So, we
continue to think that it's absolutely the right thing to do and will be beneficial over the long-term.
Donald Thompson, President and Chief Executive Officer
Joe, also the need does shift a little bit. If you look at Europe, we are over 90% complete with the interiors. Australia is
fully reimaged and so, when those markets don't need the level of reimaging capital, then we are able to be able to
deploy and strategically deploy some of our capital to the new opening opportunities as long as those opportunities are
within the plan and we view those opportunities as viable growth opportunities for the future.
Kathy Martin, Vice President of Investor Relations
Our next question comes from Howard Penney from Hedgeye.
Howard Penney, Analyst
Hi, thanks very much. I wanted to address the U.S. business if you don't mind, and I know all the data is not in for the
fourth quarter and I can't see the informal eating out market, but if I benchmark yourself against some of the other
competitors that we can see the data for, it doesn't look like you are actually gaining market share.
I know a lot of these concepts are nipping at your bud in terms of copying your menu and narrowing the gap in terms of
the look and feel of the restaurants with yours. I was just wondering how you respond and when I say that I know you
are not going to respond to certain competitors' actions, but it certainly feels like the industry is coming closer to where
you are and they haven't been there in the past. So, I was just wondering how you look at things from a competitive
standpoint and what you do to maybe widen that bar between you and the competition? Again, thanks very much.
Donald Thompson, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi, Howard, I'll take the first part and I'll ask Tim to speak a little bit about some of the things he's seeing relative to the
U.S. as they just went through again plan reviews. But overall, here is what I would say to you. Clearly for the year
2012, we grew market share in the U.S. and so we feel good about that. Howard, clearly, as we came to the latter part
of the year in the third and fourth quarters, we felt some softening and some slowing in our sales and made some
adjustments in the plan, a couple of things we needed to do stronger.

We need to have and execute -- we had it but execute a more robust menu pipeline for our consumers and that's across
the board in beverages and beef offerings and chicken offerings, and I feel good about that and Tim will expand on that
a bit. We needed to be able to reestablish value. We were kind of middle of a place that was not good. We were
between Extra Value Menu and Dollar Menu.
We have an iconic property in terms of Dollar Menu to be able to put the advertising and the weight back there and add
some creative juice to that is what we wanted to do, and so I think those things were archived in 2012. So now as we
move into 2013, we've got to take those to the next level in menu and being able to make sure that we secure even more
customers.
So, with that, and knowing that we have to make sure that we don't price ourselves out of consumers' pockets. Tim and
the folks from the U.S. with Jeff Stratton now had been focused on that. Tim?
Tim Fenton, Chief Operating Officer
Yeah, Howard, actually in December we had a positive 1.1% gap versus our competition after being slightly negative
in October and November. I think what we feel really good about coming through the last meeting was our pipeline as
Don mentioned in his -- for new products in his new comments is much more robust than it was this time last year.
We've got over 180 products. We can pull from our menu globally and we found that a lot of these products, they travel
quite well and I guess a good example would be the CBO that we just ran in the fourth quarter which came out of
Europe, was very successful for us. Chicken McBites came from Australia. But we have a lot of things in test. Beef
chicken, breakfast items, beverages and snacking that was again more robust than we had at this time last year.
Kathy Martin, Vice President of Investor Relations
Great. Next question comes from Matt DiFrisco from Lazard.
Matt DiFrisco, Analyst
Thank you. Just looking at the other income line, it looks like that was a big benefit, unexpected benefit and it looks
like your sort of gain on sales of restaurant businesses in Europe and Canada. Curious is this something that is also
going through 2013 as far as maybe more of a contributor, as I think it was basically a third of the contribution to the
EBIT expansion year-over-year in dollar terms and then this sort of goes into the -- also along with those lines below
the line for your guidance for '13.
I'm just curious, have you changed your position, Pete, as far as the technology expense. It appeared as though in prior
calls you were saying '13 was going to be flat with '12. That wasn't going to be a source of leverage and now there are
some numbers shifting.
Is technology going to be more of a weight on G&A? I guess this is just going to help us all understand. I'm trying to
figure out is the guidance of 6% to 7% long-term for EBIT or is it actually for '13 as well? Thank you.
Peter Bensen, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
All right, Matt, a lot wrapped in there. Other operating, that number is -- I don't want to say it's hard to predict, but it
does depend on transactions and activities around the markets around the world. The primary source of that as you
pointed out was refranchising in Canada, a couple of markets in Europe and China. And so, specifically, China, that
was the combination of about four DL transactions and some conventional franchising.

Page 16 of 20
That activity will continue in 2013, as well as some limited refranchising in some of the other markets, but it's hard to
give an exact prediction on where that number is going to be.
Regarding technology let me clarify. So, when we first started 2012, we indicated that we expected about $100 million
of incremental spending, about half of which was going to be related to the Olympics and the convention and half
which was related to technology and that going into 2013, we did not expect the extensive growth in the technology to
be the same in 2013 as it was in 2012.
Part of what we are experiencing here Matt, is as we scale back some of that spending in 2012, we are now by default
having some additional spending in 2013 on top of a slight acceleration in the pace of new products rollout, and some
of that spending that we made in 2012 and prior was capitalized on the balance sheet and results in additional
amortization expense. So, it is up slightly in 2013, but because of those two issues and not because of a change in
strategy.
As Don mentioned in his remarks regarding the six to seven, we don't give annual guidance, but those are intended to
be long-term annual targets for our business and targets that we feel comfortable or appropriate for a Company of our
size.

Okay, and we are starting to run out of time, but we'll take Jeff Omohundro from Davenport, you're next in the queue.
Jeff Omohundro, Analyst
Thanks. Just a quick one on the U.S. and the pacing of new products given the change at leadership. I was just
wondering if could give some details around plans to speed up pacing across the barbell, and if so, how soon would we
see that during 2013? Thanks.
Donald Thompson, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi Jeff, thanks for the question. Relative to pacing of change across the barbell, we've got and again I mention, we
need, we have a solid value platform. We just needed to talk about it and make sure that it was top of mind for
consumers. And I think we've begun to do that and reiterated our position there.
What we've got to do is make sure we have that other side of the barbell and that's the entree side of the barbell and
ensure that that is going to be -- we have new entree news in beef and chicken across the year. We'll also say that we've
got to make sure that we're talking about our beverages. We've done quite a bit on the McCafe lineup to ensure that this
is a viable growth vehicle for us into the future. So, you will see more new about that.
And lastly, you will see some news about breakfast, and so all of those things are going to be rotated through if you
will, the calendar in 2013.
Kathy Martin, Vice President of Investor Relations
Okay, we're going to take four more, because I know we're going to go over a little bit here. Jeff Farmer from Wells
Fargo.

Great, thanks. Just along those lines, is there a way you can quantify your increase to media support for the Dollar
Menu in the fourth quarter, and I guess into early 2013. More specifically, how does that compare to what you saw
through the first three quarters.
So, really just trying to gauge how much more intensity you put behind the Dollar Menu focus in the most recent
quarter?
Donald Thompson, President and Chief Executive Officer
Jeff, basically the way that I would try to explain this to you is that we looked at the overall value expenditures, those
that we spent on Extra Value Menu and those spent on Dollar Menu. If you took the composite of those two, and then
you look at the fourth quarter, if you are not going to see something that was substantially different in terms of our
media expenditures. What we did was we shifted the allocation to Dollar Menu rather than the allocation being an Extra
Value Menu. That's the biggest difference there.
Kathy Martin, Vice President of Investor Relations
Okay, our next question is from Sara Senatore from Sanford Bernstein.
Sara Senatore, Analyst
Thank you. Actually I did want to follow up on the question on the Dollar Menu comment. Basically, you are going
more towards value. Obviously, we've seen mixed results in some of your markets. I mean, I think there was a
comment about how Japan -- the fact that ticket was really under pressure, Australia was obviously more successful
with that.
Is there -- I guess could you help calibrate why that might be the case and in the U.S., would you expect to see as you
get more innovation on value and more marketing spend, would you expect to see that pressure on average checks like
you did in Japan?
Donald Thompson, President and Chief Executive Officer
Sara, just to clarify, we don't expect to have a tremendous amount of innovation around bringing a lot of new products
into the Dollar Menu unless they are going to be favorable from a profitability or margin perspective. So, when you
saw the Grilled Onion Cheddar Burger, that helped us in terms of the overall offset of margin.
So, I wouldn't look to see a lot of new Dollar Menu-based products. What we want to see is a stronger balance relative
to the entree-based products. So that's what's happening in the U.S. It is not going to be -- and as I've also heard that we
are focusing more on Dollar Menu. Yes, more on Dollar Menu, but not more on the overall value perspective. The
expenditures are similar, but we are focusing on a core equity that we have. Relative to Japan, that's a slightly different
strategy. I'll let Tim talk a little about what we've done in Japan.
Tim Fenton, Chief Operating Officer
In Japan, Sara, coming off some intense promotional activities we had in celebration of the 40th anniversary of going
into Japan. We are trying to get away from a lot of the couponing they were doing. It's been flooding the whole
marketplace from all of the IEO industry to be more strategic and more of a branded value.
So, we've got a little growing pains there right now, but we think it's the best for the brand. We're seeing it resonate
with our core products and again, we are still gaining in our market share. So, yeah, we have a little tough time going

through this next couple of months, but we think long-term it's the way to reset our business.
Kathy Martin, Vice President of Investor Relations
Okay, next question is from Nicole Miller Regan from Piper Jaffray.
Nicole Miller Regan, Analyst
Good morning. I was wondering if we could shift the conversation over to the human capital angle, because you've
talked a lot about the marketing and menu tactics and strategies. With some of the shifts that you have had in the past
year or so at the executive level, would you look at this as an inflection point and what changes do you think could be a
result of those new dynamics? Thank you.
Donald Thompson, President and Chief Executive Officer
Hi Nicole, I'm going to assume, Nicole, you're talking about the shift that we had in the U.S. in leadership relative to
Jeff Stratton and Jan Fields. One of things I'd say first and foremost is, Jan was a solid leader for us at McDonald's and
did an outstanding job in the U.S. business. When we looked at the results and where we wanted to take the business,
we made a decision to move forward and make a leadership change.
Jeff Stratton is a seasoned veteran with McDonald's. One of the things that Jeff brings is a global exposure relative to
markets around the world and some of the things that they have done quite differently to enhance things like our menu
pipeline. Jeff also brings a lot of operations experience -- I think he was the head of our Restaurant Solutions Group --
relative to our capacity and productivity in the restaurants. And So, the change that we made was a change that we saw
as most appropriate for our business and we needed to be able to continue to move forward.
I think his relationships with the franchisees is very solid, as Jeff at one point was one of the divisional presidents in the
U.S. and so he set the ground running with collaborating with the operators, our marketing changes and enhancements
that we made going into the next and we feel very good about the prospects of where we're headed in the U.S. business.
Kathy Martin, Vice President of Investor Relations
All right and our final question will be from John Ivankoe from JPMorgan.
John Ivankoe, Analyst
Great, hi, thanks. I'll make this quick. On the U.S., the rate of unit development in 2013, where specifically are you
seeing that opportunity and I guess the question is, would there be some cannibalization that could happen as you locate
close to existing restaurants of is it the fact that you haven't grown in 10 years more or less, but there is a lot of trade
areas where you simply haven't touched and there is opportunity for completely new sales generation.
And then, secondly, how much would moving to a developmental licensing structure in China allow unit development
or introducing more developmental licensees I should say, allow China unit development to go up over the next couple
of years?
Donald Thompson, President and Chief Executive Officer
Thanks John. Tim will talk about the deal opportunities. Just on the new development aspect -- as we look at
opportunities around the U.S. and we do have opportunities around the U.S. and we're able to cite those through some

of the proprietary software that we have and also our field visits. We understand we have opportunity.
But also take into account that we're not going in and establishing a target of X number or restaurants must be built. We
are building to real opportunities. We are not going back to days when we wanted to just build 400, 500, restaurants,
regardless. That's not something that we'll ever do again John.
And so, when it comes to impact on existing restaurants, we really evaluate the net system sales positive effect of any
new site that we will open up. We want to make sure it is accretive to overall system cash flow, accretive to franchise
cash flow. So, that's one of the things that we guard against and we look to minimize any kind of same-store impact
that we might have. Relative DLs, I'll ask Tim to just speak about our DL strategy moving forward.
Tim Fenton, Chief Operating Officer
Yeah, John, I know we spoke on this several times before. We will continue to move our portfolio towards
refranchising in China. It's taken us years to build up that inventory. As we've stated before, our goal is to be anywhere
between 20% and 25% franchised by 2015. We will continue to use the DL concept that's worked very well for us. As
far as putting a number on how many additional restaurants, it takes them a while to get used to our business as well
and as we've learned the right way on just development of real estate takes some time for them to be comfortable with
their area. So, I don't have a number on that, but we will continue to move not only with developmental licensee but
conventional licensing in China.
Kathy Martin, Vice President of Investor Relations
Thanks everyone. We're ready to close this up with Don who has a few final comments.
Donald Thompson, President and Chief Executive Officer
As we bring the call to a close this morning, I really just want to thank all of you for joining us today. I also want to
acknowledge the recent passing of our honorary Chairman and our first grill man, Fred Turner. We as McDonald's have
been so fortunate that Fred Turner chose to dedicate his talents and his foresight to our great brand and we pay the
greatest tribute to Fred, as we continue to deliver a consistent QSE experience to our 69 million customers each and
every day.
The fundamental strength of our global business remains solid, as we continue to make the right strategic decisions to
mitigate short-term pressure in these challenging times. I'm confident that we'll continue to grow our global market
share which is very important while delivering enduring profitable growth for the system and our shareholders.
Our McDonald's system of franchisees, supply partners and Company employees are very well aligned as we execute
our plan to win and long-term strategies to drive growth, and we'll do that by optimizing the menu, we'll modernize the
customers experience and broaden accessibility around the world.
So, thanks again for joining us today and have a great day everyone.
