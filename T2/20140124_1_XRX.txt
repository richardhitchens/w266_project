different than those expressed herein.
At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.
Ursula M. Burns
Good morning and thanks for joining the call. Today, we're reporting our fourth quarter earnings that are largely in line
with the expectations that we communicated last quarter. We managed the anticipated impact of headwinds in a handful
of businesses while we continue to build in the areas of strength and future profits. Let's begin with a review of the
strategy.
Our shift to a Services-led company requires us to constantly enhance our offerings and deliver unique Xerox solutions
to our customers. They've partnered with us because we help them take the complexities out of their business
processes. For example, we're simplifying Services in government healthcare with enterprise, our systems for
Medicaid. And we're creating smart parking solutions Merge, a real-time analytics based technology that addresses

urban parking challenges. Our Managed Print Services have been awarded highest honors for global market leadership
by industry analyst firms, a distinction that validates the strength of our document outsourcing business.
In our Services business, we are continuing with the implementation of the five-plank strategy that we reviewed at the
November Investor Conference, which includes improving our cost structure, while supporting investments in areas
where we see opportunity and differentiated benefits for our customers.
We're maintaining our leadership in document technology and effectively managing this profitable business with strong
cash characteristics. With a robust portfolio, we're capturing market share with new products like ConnectKey. We're
transforming the graphic communications business with new workflow and digital automation Services and we're
growing our channels operations to expand our reach to small and medium businesses.
And across both segments, Services and technology, we have a key focus on profitability. Delivering on these strategies
will enable consistent earnings expansion and strong cash flow, which we are committed to deploy in a balanced way
that will enhance shareholder value.
Here is a closer look at Q4 results. We reported adjusted EPS of $0.29 and GAAP EPS of$0.25 with the difference
being the amortization of intangible assets. Total revenues were down with Services flat as the student loan run-off
continued and we saw no benefit from acquisitions in our revenue. Services operating margins was lower than we
planned, and although they were driven by known issues, which is an area where we need to make more structural
progress, it's a constant focus for us. Services signings were up 20% for the year. BPO and ITO renewal rates were at
92% and above our target range of 85% to 90%, both positive results that position us well for 2014.
In Document Technology, revenue stabilized with positive results in global imaging and graphic communications,
offsetting weaknesses in developing markets and Europe. Segment margins remained strong and above our target
range, reflecting strong cost management and expense management.
In total, operating margin was down 130 basis points year-over-year. A decline in margin was anticipated given known
headwinds, but nonetheless, emphasizes why we are undertaking our margin improvement strategy and our continued
need for disciplined focus on operational excellence.
Cash flow from operations came in at the high end of the full year range and we ended the year with $700 million of
share repurchases. As we look to 2014, I'm pleased with the strategy that we've got in place to expand earnings. I'm
confident that we have all that it takes to move our business forward and deliver value to our shareholders.
With that, let me turn it over to Kathy, then I'll wrap up and open up the call for questions.
Kathryn A. Mikells
Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. Much of Q4 played out as we expected, with the exception of Services
margins where we have more work to do. We hit our EPS and cash flow guidance and got a bit more done on share
repurchases. We feel good about the continued positive trends and leading indicators, our strong cash flow and the
progress we're making implementing our Services initiative to accelerate growth and improve margin in 2014. Let's
start with a look at overall earnings.
Revenue was down 3%, or 4% at constant currency. With Services flat year-over-year, are down 1% at constant
currency and Document Technology down 6%. For the full year, Services is up 3% and Document Technology was
down 6%. Document Technology declines were roughly in line with the full year, and Services revenue growth
decelerated as we faced a number of known headwinds that we guided to last quarter. Gross margin of 30.7% declined
130 basis points year-over-year, driven by a continued pressure on Services margins from startup of healthcare
platform projects, student loan run-off, as well as from volume declines, with higher pension settlement costs impacting
primarily Document Technology.
Our ongoing productivity initiatives drove improvements in RD&E and SAG, in line with the decline in revenue. This
resulted in operating margin of 9.3%, down 130 basis points year-over-year, consistent with the decline in gross

margin.
Adjusted other net was $96 million, down $74 million year-over-year. There's a couple of drivers here. Within OID,
there's a gain of $29 million associated with the sale of a portion of our Wilsonville, Oregon, asset and product
development resources. This was a win-win arrangement that enabled us to right-size our resources and further
strengthen our 17-year relationship with 3D Systems. Notably, we retained our intellectual property as well as
capabilities in ink and print-head development. The gain enabled us to do a greater level of restructuring in the quarter,
with restructuring of $56 million coming in about $20 million higher than what we originally guided to and $35 million
lower year-over-year.
Our adjusted tax rate of 24.5% was in line with our guidance and modestly higher year-over-year. Adjusted EPS of
$0.29 was down $0.01 from 2012 and in the middle of our guidance range of $0.28 to $0.30.
So in summary, we were pleased to deliver our EPS guidance, but need to make more progress to fully overcome
near-term headwinds and deliver sustainable earnings expansion.
With that, I'll move to the Services segment slide to review in more detail the drivers there. Services revenue growth
was flat, with document outsourcing up 4%, ITO up 2%, and BPO down 3%. Growth rates have decelerated and are
playing out as we expected, with document outsourcing showing stable, mid-single digit growth and ITO growth
tapering consistent with the slowdown in signings. BPO growth has temporarily gone negative, reflecting no inorganic
contribution, the toughest compare for student loan as well as lower volumes than anticipated in customer care.
We expect Q1 to show modest improvement in growth, driven by BPO. As compares improve, signings continue to
ramp and we begin to see some inorganic contribution. Signings in Q4 were once again positive, with new business
signings up 5%. Total contract value for all signings was flat due to less renewal opportunity in the quarter compared to
the prior year.
BPO total contract value was up 20% in the quarter with strong growth in healthcare payer, healthcare provider, finance
and accounting as well as in Europe. For the year, BPO also had strong signings, with new business up 9%. Document
outsourcing overall signings were weaker in Q4 due to less renewal opportunity, but new business signings were up 1%
and for the year were up 23%.
ITO had lower signings as we continue to see trends toward smaller contract sizes and our focus remains executing on
previous large deals and improving our margins. Renewal rate was also positive at 92% in Q4 and full year, which was
seven points higher than the full year 2012. Our new business signings, combined with our strong renewal rate, yielded
total contract value growth of 21% for the year. The leading indicators are strong coming into 2014. Shifting to
profitability, segment margin was 9.6% in Q4, down 160 basis points year-over-year, and a little lower than the roughly
10% we were targeting. The year-over-year drivers were largely anticipated, reflecting the effect of student loan
run-off, which peaked this quarter, and cost us 60 basis points on margin and a point and a half on revenue, with
continued pressure from our new government healthcare Medicaid platform and healthcare exchanges and volume
pressure in wireless customer care.
That said, margin was a little lower than expected as a result of technology customer care volumes ramping up slower
than forecasted and healthcare platform expenses coming in above our original forecast as we've had to put even more
resources towards improving our operational performance there.
At the same time, we're in the early stage of implementing our five-plank strategy in Services that we had outlined in
our November Investor Conference. We expect benefits from these actions to build throughout 2014, improving trends
and revenue growth and margin.
Turning to Q1 guidance, we expect a modest improvement in Services revenue growth to approximately 1%. Our
margin will be seasonally lower and we expect it to be at about the same level as the prior year margin of 9.3%. For the
full year, we continue to expect at least a 50-basis-point margin improvement with the greatest improvement coming in
the second half of the year, as near term margin pressure dissipates and the impact of our margin improvement actions
accelerate.

I'll now turn to Document Technology. Revenue in Document Technology was down 6% at both the actual and
constant currency for both the fourth quarter and the full year. Equipment sales revenue was down 4% year-over-year
in Q4 as relative strength in the U.S. and mid range and high end was more than offset by weakness in developing
markets. Supplies revenue also declined in Q4 and was down 9% with almost half of the decline, the result of actions
that we took to reduce channel inventory.
Additionally, our previous finance receivable transaction negatively impact annuity revenue growth. High-end
continued to perform well and had positive equipment revenue growth in the quarter as color growth more than offset
the mono decline. We are gaining share in this segment and expect that positive momentum to continue. Mid-range had
another solid install activity quarter. We had seen strong activity growth for the ConnectKey class of products since
launching it last year and we continue to receive very positive customer and industry feedback.
Finally, entry revenue was weak, driven by the continued weakness in developing markets as well as the impact of
channel inventory reduction. Overall, Document Technology margin was quite strong at 11.7% and although down 60
basis points year-over-year, reflected the ongoing benefits from cost and efficiency saving and a currency benefit from
the weak yen. The two drivers of the margin decline were lower gains from finance receivable sales and higher pension
settlement expense.
On an absolute basis, this quarter's finance receivable transactions resulted in a $15 million gain, contributing 60 basis
points to technology segment margin. However, the gain was $6 million lower year-over-year. Higher pension
settlement activity resulted in $36 million in higher expense for the company, the majority of which is in Document
Technology. So overall, in line performance for Document Technology for the quarter. Looking to Q1, we expect
Document Technology to have revenue down mid-single digits and margins up year-over-year. With that, let's turn to
cash flow.
Cash flow from operations was at the high-end of guidance, with close to $1 billion generated in Q4 and $2.4 billion
for the year. Free cash flow was $1.9 billion for the year with CapEx of $427 million. Our cash flow results include a
net benefit from finance receivable sales of approximately $130 million in Q4 and $300 million for the year, resulting
in underlying cash flow from operations of $2.1 billion for the year, which compares to underlying cash flow of $2
billion in 2012.
The $100 million year-over-year improvement was mainly due to lower pension funding as working capital was
roughly flat for the year. It should be noted that working capital timing was purposely smoothed out in 2013 unless we
have less of a benefit in Q4 than prior years.
Looking to 2014, we are maintaining our operating cash flow guidance of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion (sic) [$1.8 billion
to $2.0 billion]. This reflects our expectation of no finance receivable sale with underlying cash flow of $2.2 billion to
$2.4 billion. The drivers of underlying improvement include Services EBITDA growth as well as working capital
gains. Consistent with our normal seasonality, we expect Q1 operating cash flow to be the lowest of the year with
forces roughly offsetting uses.
Moving down to cash flow statement, investing cash flows were a $53 million use in the quarter. We spent $111
million on CapEx and had proceeds of $33 million from the 3D Systems transaction and $15 million from the Europe
paper deal. We had no acquisitions in the fourth quarter and spent $155 million on acquisitions for the year.
As previously communicated, acquisition spend was tracking below our full year plan of $300 million to $500 million.
In December, we announced the Invoco acquisition which expands our European customer care presence, but it just
closed last week, so it will be in our Q1 result.
Cash from financing was a use of $100 million and included the issuance of $500 million in senior notes, $71 million in
common dividend and $524 million in share repurchases, which put the full year repurchases total at approximately
$700 million and resulted in a $36 million net reduction in shares for the year.
Moving to the next slide, I'll walk through our capital structure and capital allocation plan for 2014. We ended the year
with $8 billion in debt, which is $500 million higher than our September ending balance, driven by our early December

$500 million senior note offering. Given attractive rates, the offering was $200 million higher than originally planned,
which will prefund a portion of the roughly $1.1 billion senior note that comes to maturity in May of this year.
Applying seven to one leverage on financing assets, our allocated financing debt is $4.4 billion, leaving core debt of
$3.6 billion.
Our financing debt continued to decline, driven by the finance receivable transaction and lower origination. Our capital
allocation plan is as follows. On debt, in light of the $200 million prefunding, we expect to refinance about $900
million of the $1.1 billion in debt that comes due in May. On share repurchase, we continue to plan to do at least $500
million in 2014 and expect those repurchases to be more evenly spaced through the year.
On acquisitions, we expect to spend up to $500 million. With the recent Invoco acquisition, we're off to a better start
than in 2013 and I feel good about the quality and progression of the deals in our pipeline. And finally, for dividends,
we're announcing today a 9% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.625 per share. This will result in spend of
approximately $300 million, which is only modestly higher year-over-year, as share repurchases have served to help
self-fund the increase.
Strong 2013 operating cash flow combined with the lower level of acquisition spend and larger December debt offering
resulted in a year-end cash position in excess of $1.7 billion, providing upside to our capital allocation plan.
So in summary, we entered 2014 on solid footing. Document Technology is performing well, with stabilized revenue
decline, a strong market position and continued good profitability and cash flow.
In Services, we're well underway in implementing our five-plank strategy that includes not only cost initiatives but also
active portfolio management to drive growth and direct investments towards our higher margin, more differentiated
offerings, and we feel good about our cash position, cash flow and ability to continue to drive shareholder return
through balanced capital allocation.
Looking at Q1, at the consolidated level, we expect revenue will still be somewhat pressured and down low single
digits, with Document Technology down mid-single digit and Services growth modestly improving to roughly 1%. And
for margin, we anticipated will be seasonally lower with Services roughly flat and Document Technology up
year-over-year. As a result, we expect earnings per share of $0.23 to $0.25 for the first quarter, which includes
approximately $0.01 for restructuring.
With that, I'll hand it back to you, Ursula.
Ursula M. Burns
Thanks, Kathy.
Our performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year reflected our ability to deliver bottom line results while we
continued working to strengthen our operational delivery capabilities for the long-term.
Services signings are growing as we continue to win in the marketplace and strive to differentiate our offerings, deliver
state-of-the-art platforms and innovative world-class solutions to customers around the world. Our Document
Technology business is stable. We're gaining market share. We're keeping cost down and we're delivering advanced
products in key areas of the printing industry. Both of these contribute to a healthy annuity stream that will benefit our
long-term performance.
Throughout 2014, our focus will be on executing our Services strategy. This strategy is designed to promote revenue
growth and improve margins. We continue to plan for at least 50 basis points of margin improvement in the Services
segment. We'll capitalize on the most advantaged segments of the Document Technology business to maintain our
leadership position in the industry. And we'll continue to deliver healthy cash flow driven by the dynamics of our
attractive recurring revenue business model.

With this in mind, we are reaffirming our 2014 guidance and we announced today a $0.02 increase in our annual
dividend rate to $0.25 a share. I am confident that we have the right strategy, the competitive strength, the dedicated
workforce and a disciplined focus on execution to build on our progress. Thank you.
And now, I'll turn it over to Jim.

Thanks, Ursula.
Also let me point out that we have several supplemental slides at the end of our deck. They provide more financial
detail that supports today's presentation and complement our prepared remarks. For Q&A, I ask participants to limit
yourself to one follow-up question so we can get to everyone. At the end of our Q&A session, I'll turn it back to Ursula
for closing comments.
Operator, please open the line for questions now.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citi.
<Q - Jim Suva>: Thank you, Ursula and Kathy, and congratulations to you and your team there on Xerox, it seems like
the Services are really turning around. A quick question on the Services. It sounds like that you had to invest a little bit
more for the healthcare. If indeed that is correct if you can confirm. And I assume it was probably just you wanted to
make sure it pulled off without any bumps.
And that being said, can you let us know going forward, it sounds like the 50 basis points improvement is still indeed
intact. As we look forward to 2014 in the Services areas, are there any more roll offs or headwinds? I know student
loan, I think, it's going to impact by about 25 basis points. But anything else like more renewals, more large contracts,
more – anything that could impact pricing or do you pretty much have a pretty firm grasp on what's going on with the
Services now 2014 rolls out?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: I'll start with the healthcare investments and then I'll turn it over to Kathy for the – to answer
the rest. Healthcare, you are correct. We actually made a conscious, necessary decision to invest more, particularly in
the rollout of our health exchange platform in the states that we are heavily involved in. That's one investment. We had
already expected, which we actually communicated last quarter, to invest a little bit more, but we actually went even
beyond that to assure that we respond to any needs that the clients in the states had. And we'll continue to do that. I
think it will be less necessary as we go forward. If you know what I mean, we're at a level that I don't think we have to
go very much above. This is an area that for quarter four we made sure that we didn't fall any further behind and that
we actually serves the client on the ground very well.
Kathryn will talk about the 50 basis points and additional headwind.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: And so, Jim, at this point I think we have our headwinds very well understood and
recognized and if you look at where we had guided to a quarter ago, I'm talking about what impacts we thought we
were going to see. Now, I think we were roughly in line there with the only additional pressure that we saw really, as
Ursula just mentioned and as you mentioned, looking to put more resources behind standing up successfully those
healthcare platform implementations that we had.
If I look at the progression for improving 50 basis points in 2014, as we talked about on our Investor Conference, it's
naturally back-end loaded as you look at the known pressures and how those known pressures will dissipate during the
course of the year. So, a good example of that is, I've mentioned that as a result of the implementation of our new

enterprise MMIS platform, we're drawing amortization now; we will lap that beginning in the second quarter and so
that year-over-year impact and pressure will start to dissipate with respect to student loans, right, which caused 60 basis
points of the pressure in the quarter and 1.5 points of pressure on revenue. When we get to the fourth quarter of next
year, we actually lap the government piece of that business just going away.
And in terms of that margin pressure, you're absolutely correct. It lightens up year-over-year and again, that's a little bit
more back half end loaded, which is why you're going to see the progression of our margin improvement throughout
the year and I'd say similarly in terms of the pressure that we're seeing on revenue, we feel great about forward
indicators and our ramp basically bringing BPO revenue growth coming back kind of beginning towards the end of the
first quarter and then building into the year. So, that gives you a little bit on the puts and takes for what we think the
progression's going to look like.
<Q - Jim Suva>: Great, thanks. And as a follow-up for this year, any both size or quantity of renewals coming up we
should be aware of, like more than last year or any potential, hey, in Q3, we have a lot more than normal or five
megadeals coming up for renewal? Anything we should just be aware of – conscious of for 2014?
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Yeah. The only thing that I would flag is we had a really strong first quarter of 2013 in
terms of total signings. I think the number is $3.7 billion. And so we have a tough compare in the first quarter, but
there's really nothing else going on in that. And I spoke to a little bit in my prepared remarks, the overall kind of
composition in terms of mix, one of the things that we talked about at our Investor Conference was really a focus on
improving mix, both taking resources and making sure that we're adequately putting resources where we have
high-margin business. We're trying to accelerate growth, data analytics obviously being a component of that continued
innovation. But as you look at kind of the mix of new business and as you look at the overall mix of signings, it is
skewing towards places where we do have high margins and so that, again, over the course of the year is going to help
us to actually mix up.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Jim.
<Q - Jim Suva>: Thanks and congratulations to you and your team.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Thank you, Jim.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Thank you.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Operator, can we have the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross from Cross Research.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much. Good morning.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Good morning, Shannon.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Good morning, Shannon.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: So my first question is on restructuring. I mean you took over $100 million worth of
restructuring charges this year or I guess in 2013; you are planning on taking, I think, at least that amount in 2014
probably. Can you give us an idea of exactly where those dollars are focused, how we are seeing the benefit even if not
necessarily in margins because of other things that are going on within the business? But if you could just sort of give
us an idea what you sort of focused on in 2013 and how you are going to shift the dollars or focus in 2014 so we get an
idea of what support level might be behind some of the margin improvement.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Sure. I'll speak to the fourth quarter in terms of the restructuring we did in the fourth
quarter. A fair amount of that was targeted towards the U.S., targeted towards the back office and then we're starting to
see more restructuring within Services and expect that as we progress into 2014, in part, associated with looking to shift

a greater percentage of our total labor base towards low cost countries.
On the technology side of the business, restructuring is really normal course. It is what we have to continue to do in
responding to the overall pressure of that business to ensure that we're maintaining strong margin. And so I feel really
good about what we see coming in on the bottom-line as a result of that restructuring and that is a good portion of the
total dollars that we spent, because restructuring is more expensive on the technology side of the business than it is on
the Services side of the business. But we will continue to see that and when we talked about it at the Investor
Conference, we said that we expect to have at least as much restructuring in 2014 as 2013 and obviously, we've guided
to a $0.01 of restructuring expected right now in the first quarter. We did a little bit more restructuring in the fourth
quarter. We started out with guidance of $0.02, ended up doing $0.03, but that's going to continue and we feel good
about the savings that, that drive.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Okay, great. And then, Ursula, maybe if you can talk a bit about what's going on within both
technology and DO in terms of underlying trends. It sounds like U.S. is relatively stable but emerging markets are
weakening, your low end printers were under pressure but you had strength in color. So if you can just frame sort of
what you are doing for your customers, what specifically is going on, why annuity was down 6%, anything you can
provide there would be helpful.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Let me give you – thanks, Shannon. Let me give you kind of run around the world from a
technology standpoint and then by the line of business and then I'll give you a wrap-up on Services. What we're seeing
in the U.S. in enterprise accounts is a little bit of uptick primarily focused around our document outsourcing offering. If
you look at the signings there, we are seeing those signings, U.S. signings increase and I think that's a little bit of a
bright spot for us. We still have to stand them all up, implement them, et cetera. So – and then in small and medium
size businesses in the U.S., we're seeing a pickup and that's primarily because of our partner print Services as well and
also because we have an unbelievable channel there, a channel that's doing extremely well in taking share as the global
imaging business.
So U.S., pretty much par for the course, fairly normal and working very well in technology and fairly well in Services.
Europe, you may see a twinkle of light in certain areas, but it's pretty much the same, business – we haven't seen a
significant change in the European marketplace up or down throughout 2013 and our outlook for 2014 is pretty much
the same. We're going to increase our focus on operationalizing some of the cost reductions that we have there, some of
the restructuring that we have is focused on that area. I'm counting on the fact that we're not going to have a big upturn
in the economy. We're just going to continue to drive through efficiency so we can keep our profitability in that portion
of the market strong.
Developing economies is the place that we saw, primarily Russia and Eastern Europe are the places that we saw a
significant change in trend quarter three to quarter four significantly, saw a change in trend quarter three to quarter
four. Some of that was driven by us. We literally, as we talked about in the third quarter, changed and tried to drive
down our channel inventory actually to protect ourselves to make sure that we actually don't leave a lot of things
stranded in the channel. We moved down our channel inventory, which dampened our revenue, but also we saw just
market weakness in Russia and Eastern Europe. It's a big market for us, a very profitable market for us. We are still
very successful there, but just the general overall market activity is lower there.
In Services, we're seeing strength in signings in Europe, which is a good leading indicator for us. We started to sign
more in Europe, signings are up about – over 20% in Europe, which is really good. We have a good base. We put in
place some activities a year ago – a little bit more than a year ago and it's starting to come to fruition and the rest of the
globe is pretty much normal from a Services standpoint.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Barclays.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Yeah, hi, how are you doing? Wanted to ask about what, some of the positives could be the
margins during the year. Is there an incremental benefit you are going to see on the cost side from the yen? And can we
also just talk a little bit about – on the Services side, a little bit more of the timing when like student loan reverses and
then what quarters that could be a year-over-year benefit and whatnot. We talked about some of the hits, I think, in
detail in the beginning of the year and if we could talk about the positives as we flow through, that would be helpful in
both divisions. Thanks.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Thank you, Ben.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: And so overall in terms of just positive impacts on margin, one of the things I'd talked
about at the November Investor Conference was an expectation that we were actually going to get some relief on the
pension side of the house. So I mentioned that pension settlement expenses were up $36 million in the fourth quarter
and a big part of that cost was we printed the discount rate that's used to determine people's pension benefits in August
and there was sort of a, I'll call it, a blip of an upturn in August and so that caused people rightfully who are trying to,
I'd say, optimize their economics to choose to take their pension at the lower discount rate in December.
And so we had a lot more activity in terms of people coming into what, I'll call, the cash register to cash out their
pension towards the end of the year. So we continue to expect we're going to get margin uplift in terms of just overall
lower pension expense next year. We also expect that we'll get some benefit in terms of yen flowing through to gross
margin in the technology business. It's going to be, I'd say, not quite to the same degree as we got this year. In total, this
year, we got about a $60 million benefit. We expect that next year it's probably going to be roughly $40 million. So
those are some upsides.
And then, as you just talk about other activity that's going to assist us in margin, the slowing of ITO growth relative to
BPO growth over the course of the year helps us to naturally mix up the signings that we're now ramping up and
implementing are more heavily weighted towards higher-margin businesses. So as I went back to the bubble chart that I
talked about at the November Investor Conference, those bubbles that are the naturally higher-margin businesses
starting to pick up a higher growth rate as a result of positive signings activity. So those are some of the puts and takes.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Great. On the buyback side, too, is that more front-end loaded? Maybe you said that. I'm sorry
if I missed it.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Yeah. I said today and I certainly said at the Investor Conference. We have an expectation
to do share repurchases throughout the year, right? If you look at our activity in 2013, we did a little bit in the third
quarter and then we did a whole lot in the fourth quarter, and that isn't exactly what we would like to see. So we're
already repurchasing shares this year, to date. As we sit here today, we've done about $45 million worth of share
repurchases. But what you should see is more of a steady progression over the course of the year.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: All right. Thanks a lot.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Thank you.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Thank you, Ben.

<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi. I have two questions. The first is on a theme we've brought up before and it's labeled
consistency in Services. So it doesn't seem like it's changed much in that your Analyst Day was on November 12 and
you talked about 10% operating margins there and they came in at 9.6%. And then I don't think any investors thought
during the quarter certainly from leaving that meeting or anytime during the quarter that Services revenue growth
would be down 1% in constant currency for the quarter. So my question is, what is Xerox doing to improve the
consistency particularly of the Services when it's 45 days left in the quarter, I think investors would generally say that
they're disappointed with the performance of Services relative to message communicated at the investor event.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: So a couple of things. I'd start with – we said that we thought we get to roughly 10%
margin for the quarter. At Investor Day, I said I thought full year would be anywhere between 9.8% and 10% for the
full year. We're obviously at the low-end of that and we actually guided to Services overall revenue being about flat for
the quarter, and so it was flat on an actual basis. So we're a little bit off of, I would say, when you say that we're a lot of
and overall in terms of the trajectory as we go forward, there is a lot that we are changing to improve the overall
trajectory of Services.
But there is a number of things that are one-time, right, and not, I'd say, on a long-term basis, systemic to the business.
So when you look at the revenue pressure that we are currently facing, student loan and the reduction in wireless
coming largely from a single customer account that was very large is a temporary transitional issue. Similarly, M&A,
which last year in the fourth quarter gave us two points of revenue and this quarter gave us nothing and starting to now
see that activity pick up this year is again a transitory issue.
If we look at what we're doing in terms of executing our five-plank Services strategy, I'd say our forward indicators
look good in terms of improving our mix and business kind of clearly start – part of that strategy. M&A is off to a
better start. We've got a very keen granular focus and higher level of engagement in terms of really managing the KPIs
around the strategy execution. We're continuing right now to put more resources behind areas of growth. A great
example would be WDS, which we've talked about, does analytics in our customer care telecom space, investing more
there, more heavily in R&D in order to build additional platform so that we can go into additional vertical. So I'd say,
we are doing a whole lot in terms of really actively managing the strategic execution to ensure that we get the
improving trajectory that we've talked about in 2014.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay. Well, that relates to my follow-up, Kathy. And at Analyst Day, you had talked about
growth in 2014 of zero to 2% consolidated. And I just want to revisit on your conviction around those numbers. But as
part of that, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how we should be thinking about M&A contributing to that
number. And specifically if you could talk about how much the deal that you already completed will help in the March
quarter. Thank you.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: So the deal that we completed – I'll give you what we spent on the deal and that will help
you to roughly size it. It was a $60 million deal. With regard to the overall trajectory of M&A, we're starting from zero,
right? We obviously expect a positive contribution and we expect that to ramp over the course of the year. We have a
fair amount of conviction about not continuing to under-spend in M&A with a focus and discipline around ensuring
that we do high quality good deals that are going to drive good returns for our shareholders. So we feel good about that
and making sure that we're focused strategically and that we're – looking at deals where we're going to have synergies
to help us be more competitive on price pressure. Our pipeline continues to be pretty robust as well, kind of up mid to
high single digits and so we feel good about the leading indicators and Services.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Keith. Operator, if we could have the next question, please?

Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray.

<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Good morning.
<Q - George K. F. Tong>: So we saw some fairly healthy metrics in the Services segment over the past 12 months
around signings and retention rates and in pipeline growth particularly in the BPO segment. So looking out in 2014,
what areas are you targeting in terms of penetrating growth opportunities and how should those metrics translate into
Services revenue performance?
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: And so if you look at Services revenue performance and the fact that we were on an actual
basis on top-line flat for this quarter, guiding to about 1% growth. In the first quarter, we're expecting to see a positive
progression from there as we continue to ramp up the positive signing numbers that you referenced as well as start to
pick up on M&A activity with one deal already over the finish line right now.
And as I mentioned earlier, the composition of the new business that we've been booking and if you look at the
composition of total signing, it's really skewing more towards higher margin businesses, which should start to give us
some tailwind as opposed to headwind in terms of overall margin. So payer provider, overall retail, federal government,
U.S. transportation, these are all businesses that are already at very good margins and the fact that those growth rates
should increase relative to other businesses like ITO, as an example, really should help us in overall margin.
One of the things that I mentioned at Investor Day is two-thirds of our BPO portfolio is already at 10% or above
margin. So by continuing to look to accelerate growth of the higher margin businesses, we should really start to give
ourselves a little bit more help during the course of the year.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: And when we were not at the 10% margin, George, government healthcare is an area that
we're not – we're making progress. We're really focused, as I said, in responding to the first question on making sure
that we get this right and we do not, like I said, put any additional risk or pressure on any state. But as we do that, we
are stabilizing more and more. And so throughout 2014, this significant investment that we're making – that we made in
2013 and in the tail-end of 2012, should start to pay off with more accretive performance – accretive results to the
company. I'm very confident of that. We have a lot of energy around it and it's not totally visible to – the detail is not
totally visible to the investors, but there is a lot of energy behind this to make sure that we get it right and that we don't,
like I said, risk our customers.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: And the one other thing I would just add on government healthcare is we stood up a lot of
things in 2013, right? So we implemented a new MMIS platform in New Hampshire. We implemented one in Alaska.
We obviously had the lead on the Nevada health insurance exchange and we supported a handful of other health
insurance exchanges in other states. So that's a lot of things to stand up in government healthcare in a given year. And
as I look forward to 2014, we have one MMIS customer that we're standing up, but on a relative basis year-over-year, it
is nothing in comparison to everything that we had to stand up this year.
<Q - George K. F. Tong>: That's very helpful. And as a follow-up question, do evolving costs to stand up healthcare
contracts alter the individual components of your bridge to get to 50 basis points of margin expansion? And if you can
also give us an update on how Project Compete is tracking according to plan?
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Yeah. And so it really doesn't, I'd say, overall alter the bridge that I talked about at
Investor Day. I'd say with regard to the progression on government healthcare, I had already taken into consideration, I
talked about the amortization of the platform, which has a big expense, and the fact that we will lap that year-over-year.
Sorry, the second part of your question, George?
<Q - George K. F. Tong>: Project Compete.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Yeah. So Project Compete is well underway. I mentioned it a little bit earlier that we're
very engaged in ensuring that we're driving kind of KPIs down to the lowest level on the business. A great example of
that would be, Ursula and I were on a call with, I'll call it 25-ish folks across the Services organization earlier this
week, really walking through their KPIs across all of the metrics we're tracking on strategic execution. Obviously,
Project Compete is one piece of how we intend to get labor costs as a percent of revenue down. That's about Project

<Q - George K. F. Tong>: Thank you very much.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thanks. The question I have – well, both questions actually on Services and the first one
is, if you guys are spending so much on M&A the organic growth rate in Services this year is very close to zero. Is that
roughly right or will it actually grow? And what percent of long-term revenue growth rate we should think about in that
business since you've gone through this transition period?
And then on the margin from Q1 to Q4, let's say, as we go through this year on Services, actually, just want to
understand that Q1 will be the trough it sounds like and then the ramp is a combination of the run off impact stating
some of the cost initiatives and just standard leverage. There is nothing else that has to happen for you to, let's say, do a
11% or slightly above that margin in the fourth quarter in Services. Is that the right way of thinking of it?
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Yeah, it is. So I'll start with the second part of your question. That's all it is, is the ramp
over the course of the year and that's exactly how you should think about it. Obviously, with the guidance of our
margin in 1Q being roughly the same year-over-year, it suggests that we've got to get to reasonably above 10% for the
remainder of the year. But my expectation in terms of the year-over-year ramp is that it's going to start out slower in
terms of year-over-year gains, and obviously, it's going to be second half of the year loaded.
If I then flip back to your first question, which started with, hey, with all of the spend on M&A, I mean, I'll kind of start
there and say we – it isn't as if we've had a lot of spend on M&A and we certainly didn't guide to a different overall
target number really than we've been trying to execute to previously. So historically, M&A has given the company two
to three points in revenue growth. We're not expecting that we're going to get a wildly different answer in terms of
overall growth from M&A. We're just looking to get M&A activity back up to where it's been historically.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thank you.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Can we have the next question, please?
Operator
Certainly. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital.
<Q - Ananda P. Baruah>: Hey, thanks, guys, for taking the question and congrats on a solid quarter.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Thank you.
<Q - Ananda P. Baruah>: Yeah. Yeah. You're welcome. And I guess two from me. The first one would be, can you
give us a sense of how we should expect BPO revenue to ramp, I guess, through this year and into 2015? And kind of
what the components and the timing of those components are, even if the components are the removal of headwinds
like student loan runoff, kind of government and commercial as we go into 2015? And should we expect or is it your
expectation that BPO get back to mid-single digit in 2015, or I guess, more specifically entering 2015. And then I have
a quick follow-up.

Page 13 of 15
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Sure. So overall, I'll start with the last part of the question. BPO will get up to mid-single
digits, but that's not where it's going to start at the beginning of the year, obviously. If you look at where we ended 4Q
overall in terms of Services, right, when BPO being down year-over-year and first quarter, BPO may be down kind of
marginally still but kind of quickly then ramping up to be positive. So some of the factors in terms of how we lap some
of the pressures that we're currently facing, right? In the fourth quarter, the student loan pressure on revenue, 1.5 points.
That's the worst quarter we're going to see.
Overall, the way that progresses in 2014 is it gets much lighter when we hit the fourth quarter because that's when we
hit the compare in terms of the federal government piece of the overall student loan business going away. Right now, in
the fourth quarter, the wireless volume pressures that we talked about in customer care caused about a point decline in
the fourth quarter on revenue. That will dissipate over the course of the year. So when we get to the back half of the
year, that pressure basically falls away. And then M&A, which year-over-year was a two-point decline on revenue, no
contribution versus the prior quarter of about two points of revenue. We would expect that will ramp over the course of
the year.
<Q - Ananda P. Baruah>: Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess this is my follow-up. And as we get into 2015, are
we – what are the headwinds that remain in 2015 of the ones [indiscernible] (53:43).
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Yeah. So the only headwinds are the things that we talked about that we'd expect in 2015
is student loan is two pieces. And I just talked about the government piece, which when we get to the fourth quarter of
2014, we totally lap that business going away. So overall, student loan portfolio will continue in slow decline, so we
will still have a negative impact when we get to 2015. But it's not going to be anything near the numbers that we've
been talking about. So we're calling attention to it, obviously, because it's having a big impact right now. By the time
we get to 2015, yeah, there will be an impact but it's nothing near what we're talking about now.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah. In addition, [indiscernible] (54:26) in 2015, a lot of the contracts that we signed in
2013 and 2014 will have ramped. We're seeing that benefit toady – just early portions of it, particularly our technology
customer care business that's actually doing very, very well, that's going to ramp and by the time we get to 2014, it will
be at the ramped stage, sorry.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Yeah. And we're obviously focused talking about BPO or BPO/ITO. With respect to
document outsourcing, document outsourcing, new business signings were up 23% this year as well. And strategically,
we're incredibly strong – strongly positioned there. We had talked about previously the fact that Gartner has put us in
the "Magic Quadrant". We've got a new leader, which is well-positioned there. So that also will assist us in the Services
segment.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thank you, Ananda. If we could have the next question, please.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz from JPMorgan.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Yes, hi, and good morning. Is Lynn Blodgett on the call right now?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: No, he is not. Lynn is dealing with a personal/medical situation and we expect him back on
the next call.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Okay, good. I hope the best for his recovery there. The reason I asked, I just think it has
been pretty point blank here today about how important Services is. I was just hoping we could ask a few questions of
him. But we will wait to another day on that. But maybe I can just talk a little about the Services M&A ambitions here
because it was definitely absent last year and that was always kind of one of the hallmarks of ACS in terms of the
M&A funnel or activity. What has changed now? You are feeling a little more confident, we can move forward with
acquisitions. Does it have to do with just getting the cost structure in order or the balance sheet in order? Or do you
guys have to assemble a new team under Kathy's leadership around M&A and integration and all that stuff? I'm just

kind of curious what's changing now where you're feeling a little more confident about making M&A.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: I'll have Kathy respond to the actual operational piece on how she does it. Let me just make
sure that I make clear what did change in M&A from a strategic standpoint when we acquired ACS. We are
significantly more pointed about what we want to acquire. Margin accretive, global expanding, innovation based
acquisitions are what we are after. That selection funnel obviously makes it harder than before we had that funnel. So I
think based on the history of ACS and what we know about the margin progression and growth progression of this
business, that funnel is the right funnel. Kathy will talk about the pipeline that we have in M&A better. But let me give
it over to her now.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Yeah. So I'd start with, we have one deal over the finish line [indiscernible] (57:33) that I
spoke about. We spent $60 million. That's already a level that's higher than what we did last year because while we did
three deals, they were all quite small. When I first joined the company, I would have told you that the pipeline was
light. And as you know, M&A just kind of ebbs and flows. Our pipeline has built over that period of time. It's matured.
We obviously have one deal that's over the finish line. We've actually added resources into the M&A group. And then
I'd say the other thing we're doing is working really closely with the businesses in trying to generate what I call
non-brokered deals and so looking for our pipeline to also have a number of deals that we have been through the
business kind of courting over a period of time to just improve our success rate.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Okay. Thank you there. And then just a follow-up, if I could. Can you help us, Kathy,
understand for 2014 in terms of EPS guidance, how much is predicated on the increase in off-shoring of labor within
the Services business? Is that a big part of EPS in terms of a support or backstop or is that more for 2015?
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Certainly, over the course of the year, we expect, overall, looking at our labor cost as a
percent of revenue to give us a fair amount of help in EPS. A piece of that is clearly moving our footprint more towards
low cost centers but another piece of that is just getting more productive and more efficient and we do that both by
literally shifting work into low cost countries and also through attrition just hiring up in low cost countries and trying to
shift that without necessarily incurring restructuring charges. So for sure, it's meaningful, but it is not the only piece
that we're focused on in terms of getting our labor cost down.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Mark. If we could have the last question, please, operator.
Operator
Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Bill Shope from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay, great. Thanks. I have two questions actually on the technology segment. Could you give a
bit more color on the developing markets comments you made earlier? And given the volatility we're seeing in some of
these regions, can you comment on whether or not we should think about just adding any material risk to the
stabilization process we've seen in the tech segment as we progress to 2014?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: I would say not material and not continuous. We have a long history in developing
economies, in general, that history shows us that it does come and go. The good news is that we have a big base of
business in many different areas around the developing economies, we know them all. In this quarter and second half of
this year, this has been pressured in Russia and Eastern Europe. Our fundamentals are good there and we're not losing
share. We are participating in a [indiscernible] (60:30) as the economies start to improve, we expect – or the regulations
start to improve, whatever drives the changes in Russia and Eastern Europe starts to improve, we'll participate as we
normally do which is in the leadership way.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: And the only other thing I would say is DMO developing market as a percent of total tech
revenue is not really high, call it, between 12% and 13%. And we have a quite good history of managing profitability
there when we see revenue decline.

<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay, great. And then my last question would be a bit more clarity on the supplies inventory
situation. Was that – I'm not sure if I misunderstood this. Was that primarily because the DMO weakness or was that a
broader base inventory correction? And then, I guess, off of that, are you comfortable that you're fairly done with that
process now?
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Yeah. So we're comfortable we're fairly done with that process. I mean we were working
towards it in the third quarter. And so in the fourth quarter, we had a bigger impact. It shows up in DMO and also in
indirect channels so that's where the inventory change takes place. And then DMO just overall was a little bit softer.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: And this is something that we initiated and it's – I think it's a good business practice for us to
be on given the volatility that we see in general in the world. And so we just wanted to make sure that we didn't have a
lot hung-up through our partners. And so we made the decision to pull this back. It definitely did impact the SMB
segment and DMO, but I think it's a good business decision to make.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay, great. Thank you.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Bill. And that's all the time we have for questions today. Thanks for your interest and,
Ursula, anything more to wrap up?
Ursula M. Burns
Yes, let me just wrap up with two points. Thanks for joining us today. It was good to hear from you. I said this earlier
but I think it's worth repeating. We are focused on delivering on the strategies that we've outlined, which enable
consistent earnings, expansion and really strong cash flow, cash that we are committed to deploying in a balanced way
and enhance the shareholder value.
James H. Lesko
Thanks, Ursula. That concludes our call today.
[Abrupt ending] And if you have any further questions, please contact me or any of our Investor Relations team.
Thanks very much.
