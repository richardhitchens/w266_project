MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the
question-and-answer portion of today's call. [Operator Instructions] Today's call is being recorded. If you have any
objections, please disconnect at this time.
I would now like to turn today's call over to your host, Mr. Rich Kinder, Chairman and CEO of Kinder Morgan. Sir,
you may begin.
Richard D. Kinder
Okay. Thank you, Erin, and welcome to the Kinder Morgan Quarterly Investor Call. As usual, we'll be making
statements that may fall within the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
As usual, I'll give an overview of the quarter. Kim Dang, our Chief Financial Officer, will follow with the financial
details; and then Steve Kean, our Chief Operating Officer, Kim and I and together with the rest of the executive team
will answer any questions that you may have.
The second quarter was good for the Kinder Morgan companies. All three companies increased their distributions or
dividends and all are on track for a successful full year 2013 and beyond.
Let me start with KMI. We increased the dividend to $0.40 a share. That's up 14% from the second quarter of 2012
when we distributed $0.35. Cash available for dividends actually in this quarter is down compared to the second quarter
of 2012, and that's a result of the timing of the cash tax payments this year versus last year, which Kim will go into in
detail.
But we remain on target to meet or exceed our goal of $1.60 declared dividends for full year 2013 and that compares
with $1.40 in 2012 and with our original 2013 budget of $1.57. The $1.60 equals a 14% increase in dividends declared
comparing full year 2013 to full year 2012 and an 18% increase in cash available for dividends year-over-year.
I think we're also well positioned for future growth. We have about $14 billion now in expansion and JV investments
that we are pursuing the building up across the Kinder Morgan companies. Now, turning to KMP, we raised the

distribution there to $1.32 a quarter, that's $5.28 annualized, that's up 7% from the second quarter of 2012.
We had segment earnings before DD&A of $1.337 billion, that's up 39% from a year ago. We had distributable cash
flow of $505 million, that's up 38% from a year ago. And we had a distributable cash flow per unit of $1.22, that's up
from $1.07 in the second quarter of 2012 or a 14% increase. The growth at KMP was driven by dropdowns associated
with the KMI's 2012 acquisitions of the El Paso Company, by assets acquired in the Copano acquisition which closed
on May 1 of this year, by strong oil production in our CO2 segment and by good results in our Products Pipeline
segment.
Now, in our certain items net income, you will see some big numbers and let me just focus on that for a minute and
Kim will go into more detail. You will see that we totaled a gain of $383 million principally related to two items, the
first is a gain of $558 million related to the re-measurement of KMP's original 50% interest in the Eagle Ford joint
venture that we had with Copano before we bought Copano.
Now, let me just be very clear, in my judgment that's meaningless from a cash flow basis or from a substantial subsidy
standpoint but it's there and that's one of those places where accounting sort of departs from reality.
But that is a big gain that is in the income from certain items area. The second is more realistic, I think, and that's a
$162 million loss related to additional legal reserves primarily attributable to California Appeals Court decision
upholding the previously announced CPUC ruling denying an income tax allowance for our California intrastate
products pipeline. The decision is disappointing to us. It contrasts with federal rulings permitting an income tax
allowance for MLPs but we don't anticipate that the reparations we would pay will have an impact on distributions to
our limited partners.
Now, let me turn to the segments. Starting with Natural Gas, this segment more than doubled its segment earnings
before DD&A and we expect it to exceed its plan for the year. The growth is driven by the dropdown of Tennessee Gas
Pipeline and El Paso Natural Gas and by the Copano acquisition closed on May 1.
Both TGP and EPNG continue to outperform our acquisition model when we did the El Paso acquisition and the
Copano assets, particularly those in South Texas, appear to be off to a good start. Segment transport volumes were
down 5%, that's primarily attributable to lower power plant gas demand as gas prices are significantly higher than they
were in the second quarter of 2012. But that said, our Texas intrastate sales volumes were actually up 2% as we
continue to connect more customers in the Texas market.
Obviously, we're very bullish on the future of natural gas in America. You've heard me say this before, it has so many
advantages, it's domestic, it's clean, it's abundant and it's reasonably priced. And we see additional medium and
long-term increase in use for natural gas for a number of purposes, domestic, industrial use, power generation, exports
to Mexico and volumes to be used in LNG export facilities. And with our enormous footprint, we think that will put us
in a great position to grow dramatically in this segment over the coming years.
Now, I mentioned earlier that across the Kinder Morgan companies, we now have a project backlog of about $14
billion. The backlog in this Natural Gas segment is about $2.8 billion, that's at both KMP and EPB, and we expect that
backlog to continue to add projects as we go throughout the rest of 2013 and beyond. We detailed about 10 of those
ongoing projects in the other news section of our earnings release at KMP, and I won't go through them all but I'll just
mention that our Northeast upgrade project on TGP is on target for its November 1, 2013 startup.
And that amongst several projects allowing additional exports to Mexico during this quarter, we signed new long-term
contracts with three customers in Mexico for in excess of 200 million cubic feet a day of capacity on our Kinder
Morgan Texas and Monterrey pipeline systems. The cost of accommodating that additional throughput will be about
$115 million and we've already received an amended presidential permit to increase the border crossing capacity at that
particular point on the Texas-Mexico border to 700 million a day from about 425 million a day.
During the quarter, we averaged almost 1.8 billion cubic feet a day of gas exported into Mexico across all of our Kinder
Morgan systems. And in fact, last week we're actually over 1.9 Bcf a day. That's significant at the present time, and we
think we'll get even bigger as we bring these various expansions into fruition over the coming months and years.

Also in our Natural Gas segment, on TGP, we executed precedent agreement for our proposed Cameron expansion.
That's about a $140 million project and would provide 900,000 dekatherms a day of additional capacity to LNG export
customers in Louisiana.
Turning to CO2 segment, we had a very good quarter in that segment and we expect it to be slightly above its plan for
the full year 2013. Oil production continued to increase compared to a year ago. It was up about 2,600 barrels a day on
a gross basis. SACROC gross production was up 6%, 1,600 barrels a day to 30,000 barrels per day of production, and
Katz increased from 1,800 barrels a day to 2,500 barrels a day.
Our NGL production was also strong despite a maintenance turnaround at our Snyder Gas Plant in May. Now on the
negative side, we continued to be impacted by lower NGL prices which were down about 11% when you compare the
prices in the second quarter 2013 to the equivalent period a year ago.
Looking forward, we have a backlog in the CO2 segment of projects which total about $2.7 billion, and that's an area
where I think we've probably understated what our real opportunities are, and I'll get to that in just a minute. We had
two important developments in this segment during the second quarter. The first is that we acquired the Goldsmith
Landreth San Andres Unit from Legado Resources for about $285 million. That's presently producing about 1,250
barrels a day of oil. We expect that production to increase to a peak of over 10,000 barrels per day within the next 10
years. It'll be a long ramp-up with a lot of increased production. In addition, in that transaction, we obtained a
long-term CO2 supply contract that will potentially benefit not just this asset, but all of our oil production activities in
the future.
Secondly, in this segment, we continue to see very robust demand for CO2 from our customers in the Permian Basin
and the expansion opportunities we see are increasingly obvious. Right now, we believe they can lead to capital
expenditure opportunities on [ph] a 8H (10:52) basis of well over $2 billion over the next few years and would result in
increasing our CO2 sales and transport volumes by about 800 million cubic feet a day by 2017, taking them up from
around 1.2 Bcf a day moving to the Permian Basin to about 2 Bcf a day.
Now that's an increase from our earlier estimate we've talked in the past of spending between $1 billion and $1.5 billion
to get about 400 million cubic feet a day of additional capacity. So we think we'll have the opportunity to spend more
now at very good returns and to provide more CO2 for the use of our customers. Right now, we are now prorating the
system, that's how strong the demand is.
We've provided the details of our current operations that are underway to increase our CO2 production at our
Southwest Colorado, McElmo Dome and Doe Canyon sites and those are detailed in our earnings release.
Turning to our Products Pipeline segment, they're having a good year. We expect that segment to slightly exceed their
plan for the full year 2013. Even after reduction in revenue as a result of the current year's impact from this California
Court of Appeals decision on the income tax allowance that I referred to earlier, even after that is taken into account,
we expect them to be slightly above their plan for the year.
Refined product volumes were up pretty nicely for the quarter. They were up 3.5% across our system, versus the
second quarter of 2012. That compares to EIA national numbers which were up 0.7% or a little less than 1% across the
nation for the same period of time.
Gasoline demand on our system was especially strong, it was up about 5.9%, while jet fuel was down by 3.8%, largely
as a result of reduced military flight activity in California and Nevada on our SFPP system and we think that's caused
probably by the sequestration efforts now in effect. NGL volumes were up 12% and biofuels in this segment were up
26%
We have a number of important new projects underway in our Products Pipeline segment, and we've detailed a number
of those in our earnings release. Those listed in the release total over $900 million net to KMP and the total backlog of
this segment is actually just north of $1 billion, again all part of the $14 billion that we've been talking about.
In particular, we continue to expand our Kinder Morgan crude and condensate line deeper into the Eagle Ford play in
Texas, and we're now beginning construction on both our Cochin Reversal Project and our 100,000 barrel per day

petroleum condensate processing facility located on the Houston Ship Channel. In addition, our Parkway refined
products pipeline project is expected to come online on September 1 consistent with our original target.
Turning to our Terminals segment, it continues to show growth over 2012, but we expect it to be slightly below budget
for the full year 2013, which called for 12% growth. Our liquid terminals are performing well and this reflects new and
restructured contracts with higher rates. But on the bulk side, both coal and steel volumes declined for the second
quarter compared to the second quarter a year ago.
Although coal volumes and revenue should pick up over the next several quarters as our expanded coal export facilities
come online and those, of course, are underpinned by long term take-or-pay agreements with our customers.
This segment has a backlog of projects totaling about $2.1 billion, several of which are described in our earnings
release. Especially noteworthy, I think, is the additional tank capacity expansion at our BOSTCO facility. Now, this is a
facility that won't even be – in the first place, won't even be completed until this fall and we're already in the process of
expanding it and the expansion will come online in the fall of 2014. With the expanded tankage, the terminal when
completed will now consist of 7.1 million barrels of tanks fully subscribed under long-term contracts.
We're also expanding our Edmonton Terminal in Alberta to 9.4 million barrels of capacity and we're building
significant new facilities adjacent to our Pasadena and Galena Park terminals on the Houston Ship Channel.
All these projects are supported by long-term contracts with credit-worthy customers and are truly examples of our toll
road philosophy.
In addition, we now have four crude-by-rail terminals in operation, two more where we have – the board has approved
with signed agreements with our customers and two more under development with customer agreements backstopping
the initial capital costs.
Turning to Kinder Morgan Canada, this segment is running slightly below the results of the second quarter of 2012 and
we expect it to come in for the full-year slightly below the budget because of our sale earlier this year of the
Express-Platte Pipeline.
In that sale, you may recall we received approximately $400 million of gross proceeds for our interest which delivered
a little less than $20 million a year to us. So if you look at the impact of the sale on the overall KMP bottom line, the
sale is expected to be modestly accretive for the year but in this segment, it is a negative.
We continue to see strong throughput on Trans Mountain and very importantly in this quarter, in the second quarter, we
crossed a significant threshold when the National Energy Board of Canada approved the commercial terms on our $5.4
billion Trans Mountain expansion and we expect, as we've previously said, to file our facilities application with the
NEB later this year.
Now, turning to El Paso Pipeline Partners, EPB, we increased the distribution per unit there to $0.63, that's $2.52
annualized. That's a 15% increase over the second quarter of 2012. DCF and DCF per unit were above 2012
year-to-date but slightly below as we expected for the second quarter. We expect to declare a distribution of $2.55 per
unit for the full year 2013 and that will be a 13% increase over the full year 2012.
We've entered into agreement with our customers to [ph] settle the weak (18:02) Section 5 proceeding and the SNG
rate case and the latter settlement was approved by the FERC last week without modification. Both settlements have
been taken into account in our 2013 distribution guidance. We have a number of projects underway at EPB, and we've
detailed them in the earnings release. The most significant is the joint venture with Shell to build a natural gas
liquefaction facility at our terminal near Savannah, Georgia. Phase 1 is not conditional on any non-FTA approval.
And we already have our FTA approval, so this is a go project pending only the FERC certificate to build. EPB's
investment in the project including the ancillary facilities to service this new liquefaction facility is about $850 million
and we expect to be in service in late 2016 or early 2017.

So to sum up, the Kinder Morgan companies are performing well this year. To put it in perspective, we've said that
when asked that our long term growth rate at KMI is 9% to 10% a year and at KMP is 5% to 6% a year, we're on target
this year to substantially exceed those targets, 14% growth at KMI and 7% growth at KMP. On top of that, we have an
enormous backlog of future projects already nailed and we have an expectation of continuing to better serve our
customers and increase our cash flow by exploiting our extensive asset base of 82,000 miles of pipeline and 180
terminals. So that's the overview.
With that, I'll turn it to Kim.
Kimberly Allen Dang
Thanks, Rich. I'm going to start on the KMP numbers, I'll do EPB second and then KMI last. The first page of KMP
numbers is the GAAP income statement. As we've said many, many quarters, we don't find that overly meaningful. But
I see that the press has already picked up that our profit multiplied sevenfold and as you can see, our income is up
658% in the quarter.
So let's start with the second page and let me tell you what we really think happened in the quarter. And this is our look
at distributable cash flow. The distributable cash flow per unit for the quarter was $1.22, up 14% in the quarter.
Year-to-date it's $2.67, up 9%. Year-to-date, we are ahead of our original budget and we expect to be ahead of our
original budget for the full year on DCF per unit as a result of the Copano acquisition. And all this is consistent with
our revised guidance that we put out in May at the time we closed Copano of $5.33 in distribution per unit for the year.
In the quarter, the $1.22 of DCF versus $1.32 distribution, we had negative coverage of a little over $40 million that
was consistent with what we told you at the time of the budget and consistent with what we told you on the first quarter
call that we expect KMP to have positive coverage in the first quarter and the fourth quarter and negative coverage in
the second and the third with coverage for the full year.
The DCF, the total number of DCF, $505 million, up $139 million or 38% for the quarter; for the six months, $1.055
billion, up to $227 million.
So let's look at where the $139 million in the quarter and the $227 million of growth is coming. If you look up at the
segments, segment earnings before DD&A for the quarter up $378 million and for the six months up $625 million.
Now just a little under 90% of that, about 87% of that, both in the quarter and the year, is coming from Natural Gas.
Natural Gas is up $328 million in the quarter and $546 million year-to-date and Rich went over the reasons for that.
Year-to-date, Natural Gas is above its budget and we expect them to end the year above their budget, largely as a result
of the Copano acquisition. When you look at the full year for natural gas absent the Copano acquisition, they would be
slightly below their budget, primarily because of lower than expected performance on some of our treating assets and a
little bit slower sales there.
CO2 in the quarter up $31 million, year-to-date up $34 million. We are on budget year-to-date and for the full year. As
Rich said, we expect to slightly exceed. That's a function of two things; one, the Goldsmith acquisition that we
completed in June and, two, price. Now, price is not as much of a benefit as you would expect.
For the full year, we typically tell you that for every $1 increase in WTI, it equates to about $6 million in DCF, but that
metric is – we are doing – the price is having a little bit less impact benefit than that primarily because NGL prices are
going to be – right now we're projecting to be about 6% below our budget.
Products Pipeline is up $13 million in the quarter, up $37 million year-to-date. Year-to-date, Products Pipeline is on
their budget. For the full year, we expect them to slightly exceed and that's outperformance on Transmix and Cochin
and that's going to be somewhat offset by the impact of the California Court of Appeals decision and the lower rates on
our California intrastate system.
Terminals in the quarter up $8 million, up $8 million year-to-date. They are below their budget year-to-date. We expect
them to end the year about 2% below their budget and that's a function of the weaker bulk business primarily on the

coal and steel side as well as a little bit on ethanol.
Kinder Morgan Canada is relatively flat both in the quarter and year-to-date. For the full year, as Rich mentioned, we
expect to be below our budget probably about 5% due to the Express sale. Again, the Express sale is a benefit to KMP
overall but the benefits show up in reduced interest and reduced equity issuance.
G&A in the quarter up $33 million; year-to-date, it's up $48 million and that is all a function of the dropdowns in the
Copano acquisition. Versus our budget year-to-date, we are about 4% over our budget year-to-date on G&A. We expect
to end the year pretty close to budget, probably within about 1%, maybe – less than 1%, maybe being slightly over on
G&A.
On interest, interest is up $76 million in the quarter, up $124 million year-to-date. That is largely a function of balance,
although we do have some impact of rates and that's our average rate is up both in the quarter and year-to-date. It's a
function of the debt that we assumed on the dropdown assets, that debt had a higher average rate than the existing KMP
portfolio.
Year-to-date, interest is very close to our budgets. For the full year, we expect it to be over budget as a function of the
Copano acquisition, although some of that impact is being mitigated by the lower interest as a result of applying
Express proceeds to reduce our debt.
Sustaining CapEx, we're about $18 million over 2012 in the current quarter, $22 million year-to-date. Year-to-date
versus our budget, we actually have a benefit. But for the full year, we expect to be over our budget on sustaining
CapEx, largely as a result of the Copano acquisition. Absent the Copano acquisition, we'd be – expect to be slightly
under on sustaining CapEx.
Turning to the certain items, as Rich mentioned, they total a gain of $383 million in the quarter, $558 million gain on
the re-measurement of the – of our initial 50% interest in the Eagle Ford JV. And we had to basically re-measure this
asset to the amount of the $5 billion Copano purchase price that we allocated to their 50%, and that's what generates the
gain. That's offset by the $162 million increase in reserves that we took related to the California Court of Appeals
decision.
Now, what you see in the certain items is the prior years. So the prior years' reserve is impacting the certain item. The
current year impact of the lower rates in the reserve that we're taking there is reflected in the segment.
The other two certain items of any significance are the acquisition cost on Copano of about $28 million and then the
gain on insurance which is we received about $16 million in insurance proceeds during the quarter related to damage
we incurred during Hurricane Sandy.
So that is it on KMP's DCF. On KMP's balance sheet, when we look at our total debt, we ended the quarter at $18.6
billion. That translates into debt to EBITDA of about 3.9 times. We expect to end the year between 3.8 and 3.9 times.
That's up from what I mentioned in the first quarter call and also up from our budget, which were both 3.7 times. And
that's due to the Copano acquisition where we only have a partial year benefit from those earnings.
The change in debt for the quarter was $1.4 billion, year-to-date it's $3.2 billion. In the quarter, we spent about $6
billion on acquisitions, expansions and contributions to equity investments with the largest piece of that being $5
billion that we spent on the Copano acquisition. And we spent about $650 million on expansion CapEx, which is the
second largest piece of the $6 billion.
We issued equity of a little under $4.5 billion, $3.7 billion of that was issued in the Copano transaction. We issued
$522 million and that's actually the proceeds that we received in the quarter. I think when you read the press release,
the number is $585 million. There is some of the sales that closed after the quarter end, $522 million in proceeds under
the ATM. The KMR dividend generated $158 million in cash and then the GP contribution composed the balance.
And then we had about $150 million in other items with the largest of that being a little under $100 million we received
on the swap unwind. Year-to-date, debt is up $3.2 billion. Cash out the door on acquisitions, expansions and
contributions to equity investment, $8.75 billion. Acquisitions are $7.5 billion year-to-date and that is primarily the

$1.655 billion dropdown and $5 billion on the Copano acquisition.
And then in addition, it reflects the $558 million of debt that we assumed associated with the first half of El Paso that
came on to our books when we bought the second half. So we started consolidating that debt that when we originally
owning only 50% was not our balance sheet. Expansion CapEx was $1.1 billion in quarter and we contributed about
$140 million to equity investments.
We issued $5.1 billion year-to-date, again $3.7 billion of that was associated with Copano. We received $400 million of
proceeds from the sale of Express. And then we have $17 million in other items, the largest piece is the swap unwind
and then we had working capital outflows associated with the timing on accounts receivable, accounts payable and
inventory. So that's KMP.
I'll now move to EPB. EPB, again, first page is the income statement which we don't think is overly useful for
investors. Second page is the DCF. DCF per unit in the quarter, $0.60. That's down $0.08 versus a year ago. As we
discussed at the time of the budget for the full year, we expect DCF at EPB to be down and that's largely caused by the
increase in the distribution. And just to give you an example of that, if in the quarter we kept the distribution flat at the
prior year distribution of $0.55, then DCF per unit would have been up 3% in the quarter.
Year-to-date, DCF $1.38 which is up 2%. Coverage in the quarter, the $0.60 of DCF versus the $0.63 of distribution
results in negative coverage of about $7 million. Similar to KMP and what we told you in the first quarter and also at
the time of the budget, we expect negative coverage in the second and the third quarter, excess coverage in the first and
the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, we actually have positive coverage of over $25 million.
DCF in total was down $6 million in the quarter. It was up $20 million or 7% in the year or year-to-date. And so I'm
going to reconcile the $6 million down and the $20 million up. For the quarter, the assets generated about $10 million
in incremental earnings. That's primarily the Cheyenne Plains acquisition and the Elba Express Pipeline expansion
project which came online on April 1 of this year.
G&A is a benefit in the quarter, meaning it was lower than a year ago primarily due to the cost savings that we
implemented after the merger. Interest expense was an increase of $5 million in the quarter, largely as a function of
rate. We turned out some debt that was on the revolver as well as some Cheyenne Plains debt. So floating rate debt
moved to fixed rate debt at a higher rate.
Sustaining CapEx was $2 million increase in the quarter and then the GP incentive was about a $19 million increase
associated with the increase in the distribution. That gets you to $6 million for the quarter. Year-to-date up $20 million.
The assets generated about $52 million in incremental earnings, that's the $44 million that you see in increase in
earnings before DD&A. And in addition, because EPB has acquired partial interest in assets, you see part of that benefit
down below in reduced non-controlling interest expense, that gets you the other $8 million to get to the $52 million.
That's associated – the $52 million is associated with the acquisitions or the dropdowns, and it's associated with the
expansions on Southern Natural Gas and also the Elba Express Pipeline expansion. G&A is down $19 million in the
quarter, so decreased expense which is a benefit, $19 million versus year-to-date last year. Interest is up $11 million for
the same reasons as I mentioned in the quarter. And then the GP incentive is up about $43 million largely related to the
increased distribution which gets you to about $20 million increase.
Last two points on this page, if you look at the certain items for EPB, they total about $8 million in the quarter, $2
million in a tax reserve which is non-cash and related to capital projects and $3 million is amortization that for
regulatory purposes get captured in other income as opposed to DD&A. And then a small amount of offshore repair
cost.
As Rich said, we still expect at EPB to declare $2.55 per unit in distributions for the full year. EPB's balance sheet, we
ended the quarter at $4.1 billion in debt. That translates into debt-to-EBITDA about 3.6 times. Debt is down $15
million for the quarter and down $108 million year-to-date. In the quarter, we spent $22 million on expansion projects,
we raised $65 million in equity under the ATM and then we had $28 million in other items which primarily relates to
timing on accrued interest.

Year-to-date, we spent $43 million on expansions, we've raised $87 million in EPB's ATM and then we have positive
coverage of about $28 million and then also a benefit on working capital of about $36 million related to timing on AP
and AR and accrued interest.
Now looking at KMI, KMI, we declared the dividend of $0.40 in the quarter. We've generated cash available to pay the
dividend of about $0.28. So similar to KMP and EPB and consistent with what we told you at the budget in last quarter,
we had negative coverage in the second quarter. As we said, we expect negative coverage in the second quarter and the
third quarter and excess coverage in the first and the fourth.
Cash available to pay dividends in the quarter $294 million, that was down $13 million versus a year ago, and that's
primarily related to timing on cash taxes, which I'll take you through in just a second. So, looking at how you get to the
$13 million change, the distribution from KMP generated – that goes to the – from the GP interest and LP interest
generated $95 million in additional cash, largely associated with the 7% increase in KMP's distribution.
The distribution that we received from EPB, an incremental $26 million. So the MLPs delivered an incremental $120 –
a little over $120 million of incremental cash flow. G&A and interest was up about $9 million and then cash taxes were
up $69 million in the quarter, and a lot of that is timing on the full year – sorry, timing related versus 2012.
For the full year, we expect cash taxes to be up, as we showed you on our budget, about a little under $100 million.
And so what you're seeing is about 70% of the full year variance hitting in the second quarter. And so, that's what Rich
and I mean when we talk about the timing on the cash taxes.
Cash available from other assets is down about $56 million and that's a function of the dropdowns. So the dropdowns,
we lose the income from those assets that were previously at KMI. You picked up a benefit but the benefit that you
pick up shows up in the – there's a distributions coming from the MLPs and it also shows up in decreased interest
expense, which you can see that in the quarter, we have lower acquisition debt interest expense. And we've also paid
down some of the debt that is up at KMI with these proceeds, and so when we get to the year-to-date numbers, you'll
see a benefit there as well.
In the six months, cash available to pay dividends is up $197 million. If you look at the cash coming from the MLPs,
that generated $320 million of incremental cash. G&A and interest expense is actually a benefit of $6 million. Cash
taxes are up $61 million year-to-date. And then the cash available from other assets is down $68 million largely as a
function of the dropdowns.
Year-to-date on cash available pay dividends, we are above our originally published budget as a result of Copano. For
the full year, we also expect to be ahead of our budget, and we expect that cash available to pay dividends will be up
about 18% versus 16% in our original budget. And all that is consistent with the increase in guidance to declare $1.60
per share in dividends that we gave at the time of the Copano acquisition.
Looking at KMI's balance sheet, KMI ended the quarter with $9.5 billion in debt. We still expect KMI to end the full
year around 5 times on a fully consolidated basis. Debt is up, a little over $100 million, $111 million from last quarter,
but it's down $1.9 billion since the end of last year.
In the quarter, we spent $51 million on warrant repurchase. $48 million were contributions made to the two MLPs for
KMI to maintain its ownership percentage, it's 2% ownership. And then we had negative coverage of $121 million.
And then we had cash inflows of about $110 million associated with other items.
The most significant of these is that the cash taxes that we use in the metrics are higher than the cash taxes that we
actually pay and that's because we are utilizing more of the NOL than we assumed that we can use in the metric. In the
metric, we assumed that we can utilize $300 million of the NOL and we're actually utilizing more than that.
Year-to-date again decrease in debt, $1.9 billion. We received $2.2 billion on asset sales between the drops – or $2.2
billion in proceeds plus debt that was moved or assumed in conjunction with the acquisitions by KMP. And so, that's a
reduction in debt of $2.2 billion. Warrant repurchase was $131 million year-to-date. We made pension contributions of
$50 million. We made about $65 million contributions to the MLP, $50 million in contributions to other equity
investments and then we had other items of $25 million. The most significant was the benefit that I talked about on

cash taxes. We have that similar scenario in the year-to-date. And then also that's slightly offset in the year-to-date
numbers by timing on distributions from equity investments.
And so with that, that gets us through the numbers.
Richard D. Kinder
Thank you, Kim. And before we go to questions, I'll also mention I neglected to do this in the opening comments, our
board today at KMI also approved a share and warrant repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase in aggregate up
to $350 million of either common stock or warrants. And there's no minimum repurchase obligation, that's just a
maximum that we can do. But the board has granted us that discretion so we'll be looking at buying back either
warrants or shares in the future.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Erin and we'll take any and all questions you may have.
Q&A
Operator
Great. Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Darren Horowitz with Raymond James. Your
line is open.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Good afternoon, Rich.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hey, Darren, how are you doing?
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Good. Thanks. How are you?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: I've got two quick questions. The first, Rich, and you referenced this, your thoughts
around ramping Eagle Ford condensate volumes and more specifically the opportunities for the export of the products
like naphtha. I mean, you scaled up your investment to accommodate the second split or your storage capacity is going
to be over seven times the current splitting capability just from a throughput perspective. So how big of an issue do you
think that that's going to be on the Gulf Coast? And specifically, do you guys have a view as to when Canada might hit
a blend wall for condensate to be used as diluent and maybe that impacts volumes on Cochin or Southern Lights?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, let me start with – if I understood your question on the Eagle Ford condensate, first
of all, I think it's pretty obvious every quarter we are expanding our reach into the Eagle Ford and the ability to handle
more and more condensate and crude coming out of the Eagle Ford. And of course, post the Copano acquisition, we
can move that either across our Kinder Morgan crude and condensate volume to the Houston Ship Channel or down to
Double Eagle line which is a joint venture with Magellan, down to Corpus Christi. So we're giving people like Conoco
and Anadarko and others tremendous optionality. So our volumes are ratcheting up – will be ratcheting up on these
facilities and that's a very good thing.
Obviously, as you look at the – what happens downstream like on the natural gas side, the tendency is that you move
the bottlenecks downstream and then free enterprise being what it is, that bottleneck gets solved. So I think there will
be additional export of products. Certainly, we're looking at that partially in conjunction with this BOSTCO facility.
That's not the original purpose of it but we certainly have land down there that we will be able to participate in export
facilities.
As for as the blend wall on the diluent, I really don't know. As you know, we are reversing Cochin. That project is now
underway. It's about a $260 million project and we're fully subscribed except for the portion that we have to leave open
for spot buys, but everything else is taken up under long-term contracts there. To us, that's the big indicator that people

are very interested in the ability to move diluent across our line or across Southern Lights.
So I think you're going to see continued interest in doing all that. Beyond what they're shipping on us, I really don't
know what the future holds, but we're very happy that we're locked in on our investment on reversing Cochin.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: That's all I had. Thanks, Rich.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Thanks.
Operator
Next, we have Bradley Olsen with Tudor Pickering. Your line is open.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hello.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Quick question on the announcement you made earlier this quarter about potentially acquiring coal
royalty asset, I just wanted to hear your thoughts on why you'd make that announcement, whether or not there are
specific assets that you have your eye on or whether you're just kind of telegraphing to the market that this is an area
that you might get more involved with in the future?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, let me just say a couple of sentences and then I'll turn it over to John Schlosser who
runs our Terminals group and he can talk in a little more detail about our thoughts. But basically, as you know, Kinder
Morgan is hugely optimistic about the role of natural gas in the future in this country and to a large extent, it will
displace coal in electric generation.
That said, coal is always going to be an important fossil fuel both in the U.S. and around the world for the foreseeable
future. And by that, I mean decades and decades. So whether it's 40% of electric burn in the United States or 30%,
there's still going to be a lot of coal to be handled. And if you look at it, internationally, it's now I think 43% of the
total...
<A>: [ph] 43% (49:08)
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: ...fossil fuel use around the world. So there is still opportunities there. What's happened is
that most of the coal producers are needing cash infusions, looking for sources of cash, and we think this is a good time
to be able to serve those customers.
And with that, I'll turn it over to John who'll talk about – we're going to be very conservative about how we do this and
I'll turn it over to John.
<A - John W. Schlosser>: Yeah, I'll tell you what, it's not that we've opened up a big teller window with a sign saying
bring us your reserves. We're looking strategic investments where there is low mine cost, reserves that are highly
competitive, where there's high quality reserves that are uniquely positioned and the more versatile the better, if it can
go export and domestic or if it could be tied to a Kinder Morgan terminal, all the better. We're going to use the same
disciplined approach that we do with all of our KM investments. We're looking at guaranteed minimum returns on each
of these projects and we're not taking product or market risk.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: So would it be safe to interpret those comments as indicating that you'd only look for something
with a long-term fixed price takeaway agreement?
<A - John W. Schlosser>: Yes, I think that's a good analysis.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yeah. And also, I think, John was getting at this too, but we're not taking mine operating
risk on these investments either.

<Q - Brad Olsen>: Got it. Okay. And so are you looking specifically at one basin or another or is this something
where you would be looking to develop a diversified portfolio in coming years?
<A - John W. Schlosser>: There is some that are more preferable than others.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: And that's one reason that we brought on board an ex-CEO with 35 years or whatever
experience in the industry to lead this team because we're going to look very carefully and I will say that post our
announcement, we have had a lot of discussions already with people who have come forward, and we'll continue to
look at what makes sense for us. And if it doesn't make sense, we won't do it.
So we're going to look very carefully and this is a – we're going to construct – if we're successful on it, we're going to
construct a very conservative portfolio.
<A - John W. Schlosser>: I think the interesting part too is this could be a great platform to look at our other 1,000
some odd products we handle. Right now, we're initially going to focus on just coal, but we hope to get into some of
the other commodities that we touch today, some of the other customers we touch.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Great. That's great color. Thank you. And a follow-up around the Freedom pipeline. Apparently
refiners in California expressed a preference for rail, but given the recent incidents that we've seen in the news where,
I'd say the safety of crude by rail has been maybe brought into renewed scrutiny. Does that – as well as the fact that the
Brent-WTI spread is seeming to be more favorable to pipeline projects, at least where it is today than it would be to
rail. Do you think that this brings pipeline projects that maybe had been discarded in favor of rail back into the money?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, I think it's too early to opine on that, Brad. What I will say is that clearly, as I said
earlier on a previous call, that the Freedom pipeline did not get sufficient customer backstopping to do at this time.
When on our Trans Mountain expansion in Canada, we went out twice with open seasons over the years and didn't get
sufficient throughput to build it, the third time, we get 708,000 barrels of throughput commitment.
So a lot just depends on a whole bunch of factors, all of which you mentioned are important. But we've got it on the
shelf, but we know what it costs both from a standpoint of tariff and from the standpoint of what our returns will be
based on the construction cost and the conversion cost. And if the California refiners and/or the Permian producers
demonstrate they want to go forward with the project, we're certainly there to accommodate them.
<Q - Brad Olsen>: Great. That's all from me. Thank you.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Thank you.
Operator
Next, we have John Edwards with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hey, John, how are you doing?
<Q - John D. Edwards>: Doing well, Rich. Just a couple of real quick ones. You gave a backlog number on Natural
Gas, I think it was for KMP and EPB combined, I think you said $2.7 billion or thereabouts.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: It rounds to $2.8 billion, yeah.
<Q - John D. Edwards>: $2.8 billion. What's the breakout between KMP and EPB on that?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, it's about $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion at KMP and...
<A>: [ph] About a $1 billion (54:14)
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: ...about $1 billion at EPB. The biggest at EPB is the joint venture with Shell that's, as I
said, is about $850 million.

Next, we have Brian Zarahn with Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Brian Joshua Zarahn>: Good afternoon.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Brian, how are you?
<Q - Brian Joshua Zarahn>: Doing well. I guess following up on the warrant, the buyback, just to clarify that $350
million is a new authorization and replace – and it's an addition to $250 million it seems like you just completed?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Right, the $250 million is complete.
<Q - Brian Joshua Zarahn>: Okay. And then it looks like this authorization includes buying back stocks. Can you
talk a little about the – looking at stock versus the warrants?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Right. And so we're going to look at the prices of the relative securities and given what
our view is on future stock price, decide which one is more economic for KMI to buy.
<Q - Brian Joshua Zarahn>: Okay. And then on your long term 9% to 10% dividend growth guidance at KMI, just to
confirm that includes the impact of the warrants.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: It includes the impact of the original $250 million.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yes, to the extent we buy back more warrants, that would tend to make our growth a little
higher.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: The $350 million is not included.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Right.
<Q - Brian Joshua Zarahn>: Okay. But it includes eventual conversion of the warrants...
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: It does.
<Q - Brian Joshua Zarahn>: Yeah.
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: It does.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: That's correct.
<Q - Brian Joshua Zarahn>: Okay. And then I guess on dropdowns, any additional color as to completing the process
