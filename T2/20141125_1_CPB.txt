Today we'll make forward-looking statements, which reflect our current expectations. These statements rely on
assumptions and estimates, which could be inaccurate and are subject to risk. Please refer to slide four or to our SEC
filings for a list of the factors that could cause our actual results to vary materially from those anticipated in our
forward-looking statements.
While in the current quarter we had no new items affecting comparability, our comparisons of fiscal 2015 with fiscal
2014 will exclude previously-announced item. Because we use non-GAAP measures we provided in our appendix, a
reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.
With that, let me turn the call over to Denise Morrison.
Denise M. Morrison
Thank you, Jennifer, and good morning, everyone.
Today I'm going to share my perspective on our first quarter 2015 performance. I will review the key drivers of our
results including our positive organic sales performance across most of our core and acquired businesses, then I'll
discuss the challenges we are facing and the actions we are taking. Our challenges include our gross margin
performance and the impact of currency headwinds, which Anthony will review in greater detail in his presentation. As
reminder, we said on September 8 that we don't expect our growth in fiscal 2015 to be evenly distributed across
quarters. As a result, we believe that evaluating our business performance on a first-half basis rather than a quarterly
basis will be more meaningful.
Let's start by examining the key growth drivers in our core business in the quarter. I was pleased that we drove top and
bottom line growth in U.S. Simple Meals with higher sales in our U.S. soup portfolio. Our U.S. soup performance
benefited from a stronger seasonal sell-in and the timing of our quarter-end relative to the Thanksgiving holiday. As
we've stated, one of our strategic priorities is to expand our presence in the faster growing Premium Soup segment,
which represents roughly 10% of the wet soup category. We made good progress as we launched new Slow Kettle
varieties in the quarter to drive the brand's double-digit sales growth.
Many of our retail customers have created dedicated shelf space for our premium soups, where we have gained
additional linear feet. The next step in our plan is to expand further with the launch of six varieties of Campbell's
organic soup in easier-to-open cartons this January.
Another key driver in U.S. Simple Meals was our strong performance in sauces including Prego, Pace and Campbell's
Dinner Sauces, as we introduced new products and leveraged merchandising. We expanded our Dinner Sauces platform
beyond skillet and slow cooker pouches with the launch of Oven Sauces in the quarter, which is quickly achieved 52%
ACV. Overall, Campbell Dinner Sauces now have over 80% ACV with dedicated sections that are becoming a
consumer destination.
Within Global Baking and Snacking, a significant improvement in our core business was our performance in Australian
biscuits. We're moving in the right direction to stabilize the business in Australia, where we drove Arnott's sales and
earnings.
Our team grew consumption and share in total biscuits by strengthening planning and execution with our retail partners,
increasing marketing and promotion behind core brands and driving innovation, including new Tim Tam varieties and
light & crispy Arnott's Shapes. I was also pleased with the continued strong growth in our Indonesia business, which
expanded beyond sweet biscuits into savory crackers with the introduction of Arnott's Shapes.
Now let's look at the performance of the trio of growth engines that we acquired in the last two years: Bolthouse Farms,
Plum Organics, and Kelsen. Strategically, we acquired these businesses to expand into faster growing spaces and
respond to the seismic shifts in the consumer landscape including the focus on health and well-being and the growth of
the middle class in developing markets. Together these businesses contributed one point of organic sales growth to our

company in the quarter.
We were encouraged by Bolthouse Farms strong top line growth. We continue to expand distribution in package fresh
super-premium beverages and fresh salad dressings. Bolthouse Farms has strengthened its number one share position in
premium beverages over the last year while simplifying and streamlining its beverage portfolio, increasing space for
higher velocity offerings and reducing out of stocks.
During the quarter, we also launched Bolthouse Farms Kids, the brand's first line of healthy beverages and Veggie
Snackers for children. We're merchandising Bolthouse Farms Kids with a dedicated shelf set in the fresh produce
section to further expand our position in the fast-growing perimeter. Our goal is to become a branded leader in the
$18.6 billion packaged fresh category.
Plum Organics delivered double-digit sales growth after facing challenges a year ago. As the number one brand in the
organic segment of the U.S. baby food market, Plum continued to expand distribution and drive innovation in Simple
Meals and Snacks. We're continuing to integrate Plum to leverage Campbell's scale and amp up its expansion while
maintaining its entrepreneurial spirit.
Kelsen, which we acquired early in last year's first quarter to expand our Global Snacks business, delivered higher sales
as it continued to meet our expectations. We're focused on expanding distribution in key cities in China. The second
quarter historically marks the peak season for Kelsen sales and earnings, as authentic Danish butter cookies are often
exchanged by friends and families in China as gifts for holidays and festive occasions, including Chinese New Year.
Now let's take a look at some of our challenges and how we are addressing them. I'm going to focus my remarks on two
businesses that underperformed, Pepperidge Farm and U.S. Beverages. But before I get to those, let me say that our
gross margin of performance in the quarter did not meet our expectations. Some of the pressure came from higher than
anticipated commodity inflation and some came from unexpected costs in our supply chain, including manufacturing
and transportation costs. Anthony will describe these issues in greater detail in a few moments. We are taking action to
manage costs aggressively and working all the levers to mitigate the unexpected pressure on gross margin.
Turning to the businesses, Pepperidge Farm's performance in the quarter was mixed. I was pleased with our growth in
cookies, driven by Milano and crispy Pepperidge Farm varieties. We also drove strong results in fresh bakery, which
continued to outperform the market with consumption and share gains. Fresh bakery benefited from our focus on
seasonal offerings and quality improvements.
Our main challenge in this business is to restore growth in crackers. It's important to examine the total cracker category.
For the past two years, dollar consumption growth trends have slowed in the category and were flat to declining in the
quarter. We see several crucial drivers in this category deceleration. First, we're seeing a shift in consumer snacking
preferences. About half of cracker consumers are buying crackers and other snacks less frequently. And when they do,
they're shifting in some cases to snacks that are better for you or, on the opposite end of the spectrum, more indulgent
snacks.
Second, approximately three-quarters of the losses in the total category have been in sandwich crackers where we don't
compete. Third, total advertising in the category has declined more than 20% in the last year, impacting velocities as
price and distribution held. And finally, there has been a decline in the number of new products introduced in the
category, resulting in less excitement from innovation in the cracker aisle.
In this environment, some major brands have continued to outpace the category. One of those brands is Goldfish, which
has consistently outperformed the category over the last three years. In the first quarter, despite growing consumption
and share and outperforming the category, Goldfish sales declined, due in part to cycling the distribution build of the
launch of Goldfish Puffs. We're not satisfied with this performance given the brand's steady track record of growth over
many years.
We continue to expect Goldfish sales to be up for the year behind strong holiday programs, increased advertising and
consumer promotion, and improved in-store merchandising. Going forward, we are increasing advertising by about
20%, with a quarter of our spend in digital media. Our plans include increased innovation, including new flavors of

Goldfish and Goldfish Puffs.
Turning now to U.S. Beverages, although we grew operating earnings, sales of V8 V-Fusion and V8 vegetable juice
declined, as shelf-stable category remained under pressure. Our plans to revitalize our V8 platform are underway. The
next step is the January launch of V8 Veggie Blends. We are optimistic about this launch as we plan to tap into the
juicing trend by offering nutritious, affordable juicing that's convenient for the consumer.
Separately, in the quarter we extended the V8 brand to a new category with the launch of V8 protein shakes and bars to
expand into adult on-the-go nutrition, a multibillion dollar category. This is another example of our focus on driving
breakthrough innovation to expand into faster growing spaces.
So looking ahead, although we face more challenging comparisons, we are confident about our plans for the year,
which include: driving continued growth in U.S. Simple Meals; continuing our turnaround in Australian biscuits, which
moved in the right direction in the first quarter; restoring growth in Goldfish crackers and improving Pepperidge Farm's
top line performance; revitalizing V8 to bring news to the shelf-stable juice category; and delivering strong
performance in Bolthouse Farms, Plum Organics, and Kelsen.
Across our portfolio, we are responding to the consumer shift to health and well being with new on-trend products,
ranging from Campbell's organic soups and V8 Veggie Blends in the center of the store to Bolthouse Farms Kids in the
fresh perimeter and V8 protein shakes and bars in the health and beauty aisle. Finally, we are taking action to mitigate
gross margin pressure in the remainder of the year.
To sum up, we delivered organic sales growth across most of our core and acquired businesses in the first quarter, with
stronger performances in U.S. Simple Meals and Global Baking and Snacking. We have more work ahead and
challenges to overcome this year, but we remain focused on our strategy to strengthen our core business and expand
into faster-growing spaces to reshape our portfolio for a more profitable growth trajectory.
I look forward to answering your questions in a few minutes. Now let me turn the call over to Anthony for a detailed
review of our financial performance.
Anthony P. DiSilvestro
Good morning and thanks, Denise.
Before getting into the details, I wanted to give some perspective on our results and guidance. As Denise said, we are
encouraged with our top line performance as we start the fiscal year. However, this top line performance is dampened
by gross margin pressure from higher than anticipated cost inflation and supply chain related costs.
The other item I want to call out is currency. Due to the recent and significant strength of the U.S. dollar against most
major foreign currencies, we are seeing a negative impact that we did not forecast. Based on this headwind and
volatility from currency translation, we have reduced the low end of our guidance ranges. Importantly, our currency
neutral expectations have not changed.
Now I'll review our results. First-quarter net sales increased 4% to $2.255 billion. Organic net sales increase by 5%
with volume and organic sales gains in four of our five reportable segments. Sales in the quarter benefited from
movements in retailer inventory levels from a stronger seasonal sell-in and the later timing of our quarter relative to the
Thanksgiving holiday. In aggregate, the movement in retailer inventories represents about half of our organic sales
gains in the quarter.
We are encouraged by the sales performance in Australia and from the performance of our recent acquisitions as
Bolthouse Farms, Plum and Kelsen contributed one point of total company organic growth in the quarter.
Adjusted EBIT increased 9%, reflecting the higher sales, the benefit of lapping the prior-year Plum recall and lower
administrative and marketing expenses, which were probably offset by the decline in our gross margin percentage.
Adjusted earnings-per-share increased 12% to $0.74.

Decomposing our sales performance, favorable volume mix was the main driver of the increase primarily in the U.S.
Simple Meals and Global Baking and Snacking segments. Overall, increased promotional spending was negatively
impacted sales by one point. While our promotional rate was stable in our largest segment, U.S. Simple Meals, the
increase was driven by higher rates of spending in the Global Baking and Snacking segment. Currency also negatively
impacted sales by one point as our two primary foreign currencies, the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar both
weakened against the U.S. dollar.
We are disappointed with our gross margin performance, which did not meet our expectations. The bridge on this chart
highlights the factors impacting our performance. First, cost inflation and other factors had a negative impact of 340
basis points. Most of this was cost inflation, which as a rate, increased by almost 4%. Recent and unanticipated
increases in dairy, beef and aluminum have added to the overall inflation impact. Also, with pressure on carrier
capacity, we are seeing much higher freight costs. For the full fiscal year, we now anticipate cost inflation at the high
end of our 3% to 4% range.
In our North American supply chain, we experienced higher-than-expected manufacturing and freight costs from
significant volume demand early in the quarter. As a result, we ran production more weekends, increased the use of
co-packers, and incurred higher freight costs in this spot market.
Promotional spending negatively impacted gross margin by 70 basis points primarily impacted by higher spending in
the Baking and Snacking segment, and while volumes increased in the segment, trade had a negative impact on margin.
Moving to the right, as we wrap both the Plum recall and the one-time purchase accounting impact on the Kelsen
acquisition, these represent a 90 basis point gain. Lastly, we continue to drive meaningful productivity gains in our
supply chain, which contributed 140 basis points of improvement.
Looking ahead, reflecting our revised inflation outlook and first-quarter performance, we now expect our gross margin
percentage for the full-year to decline 50 to 100 basis points due largely to the residual cost inflation and costs to
maintain our customer service levels as we recover from the early spike in demand. Longer term, our investments in
soup common platform and broad capacity will increase our flexibility to respond to volatility in demand. Importantly,
we will manage the balance of the P&L to mitigate the negative impact including our overhead and supply chain costs
and our marketing programs and also evaluate price realization opportunities.
Marketing and selling expenses decreased 5%. As you may recall, we increased advertising in the prior-year quarter to
support new product launches and Bolthouse Farms. Marketing reductions in the current quarter reflect lower
advertising spending in U.S. Simple Meals primarily advertising and production costs and a shift in advertising in U.S.
Beverages to the back half of the year to support the launch of our new V8 Veggie Blends platform.
Administrative expenses were down 9% driven by lower long term incentive compensation cost and cost savings
related to prior-year structuring initiative. Given that our annual cycle for long-term incentive compensation is at the
end of the first quarter, we have favorability through this quarter and as we've discussed previously, expect a significant
headwind for the balance of the year.
For additional perspective on our performance, this chart breaks down our EPS growth between our operating
performance and below-the-line items. As you can see, we grew adjusted EPS by $0.08 per share, $0.07 of which is
attributable to the growth in EBIT. Net interest expense declined $5 million versus a year ago as we reduced our debt
level using the proceeds of European Simple Meals divestiture and this contributed $0.01 to EPS growth in the quarter.
Our tax rate remained relatively flat declining 40 basis points to 31.8%.
We resumed repurchases under our strategic share repurchase program in the quarter repurchasing 50 million under this
program. However, given the timing there was no impact on EPS growth in the quarter. While currency had a one point
impact on sales it did not impact EPS in the quarter. For the full-year, and based on current exchange rates, we estimate
currency will have a $0.03 per share negative impact. As this was not anticipated, we've adjusted the lower end of our
guidance range to reflect the impact.

Now turning to our segment results; sales growth in U.S. Simple Meals was 8% driven by strong volume gains, U.S.
soup sales increased 6% benefiting from movements in retailer inventory levels due to a strong seasonal sell-in and the
later timing of our quarter end relative to the Thanksgiving holiday. Sales of other Simple Meals increased 14% driven
by growth in Plum, Prego benefiting from white sauces and in our dinner sauce platform which now includes Oven
Sauces. Operating earnings for U.S. Simple Meals increased 15% with eight points of the growth due to cycling the
Plum recall in the prior-year.
In Global Baking and Snacking we achieved 3% organic sales growth driven by the improved performance of Arnott's.
We are pleased with our consumption and share gains in the Australian biscuit category given our previous challenges
while Indonesia delivered another quarter of double-digit sales gains. Within Pepperidge Farm, fresh bakery and cookie
sales grew. Goldfish crackers had share gains but sales declined. Sales of frozen products were also soft. Operating
earnings for Global Baking and Snacking increased 15%, of which 10 points was due to wrapping the negative impact
of purchase accounting on the Kelsen acquisition in the prior-year.
In the Bolthouse and Foodservice segment, growth continued to be driven by sales gains in Bolthouse premium
beverages and salad dressings. The decline in operating earnings was primarily driven by a lower gross margin
percentage with cost inflation across the segment. International Simple Meals and beverages grew organic sales by 5%.
Strong sales gains in Canada were driven by innovation and higher levels of promotional activity. Declines in operating
earnings reflect the impact of increased marketing support. U.S. beverage sales fell 3% on declines in the immediate
consumption channel as we continue to implement our new route to market. Across the portfolio, sales declines in V8
V-Fusion and V8 vegetable juice more than offset gains in V8 Splash.
Operating earnings improved as we shift the timing of our marketing programs to the back half to support the launch of
Veggie Blends platform. Within U.S. Soup, the 6% sales growth was driven in by gains in Condensed and Swanson
Broth. Condensed eating and cooking varieties rose. Swanson Broth continues to perform well in the marketplace led
by aseptic broth, which benefited from earlier holiday shipments.
Sales of ready-to-serve soup were comparable to the prior-year as declines in volume were partly offset by lower
promotional spending as activity was shifted to the second quarter of this year. While our soup sales increased 6%,
consumer takeaway in measured channels for the comparable 13-week period ending November 2 declined by 2%.
Here's a look at U.S. Wet Soup category and our share results as measured by IRI. For the 52-week period ending
November 2, 2014, the category as a whole declined 0.5%. Our sales in measured channels declined 1.6%, with
weakness in condensed and ready-to-serve soups partly offset by strength in Broth. Campbell had a 59% market share,
a decrease of 70 basis points. All other branded players collectively had a share of 28%, with gains driven by smaller
players. Private label also grew share finishing at 13%.
We had strong cash flow performance as cash from operations increased from $38 million to $188 million, reflecting
lower working capital requirements, lower pension contributions, and reduced payments related to hedging activities.
Capital expenditures increased slightly to $62 million. We continue to expect capital expenditures of about $400
million for the year as we increased capacity to support growth in our faster growing businesses. We paid dividends
totaling $101 million, reflecting our current quarterly dividend rate of $0.312 cents per share.
In aggregate, we repurchased $73 million of shares in the quarter, $50 million of which were under our strategic share
repurchase program. The balance of the repurchases was made to offset dilution from equity-based compensation.
Based on our current investment plans, we anticipate making strategic share repurchases at this pace on average for the
balance of the year. Net debt declined almost $700 million to $3.8 billion, including the proceeds from the European
simple meals divestiture.
Approximately 22% of our sales are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, with the Australian dollar
and Canadian dollar making up the majority of our non-U.S. sales. Since September, both of these currencies have
declined in value relative to the U.S. dollar and while not a material impact to the first quarter, if the current rates hold
for the balance of the year we will see a more meaningful impact. At current exchange rates, we estimate it to
negatively impact our full-year performance by one percentage point of sales, EBIT and EPS, and is the reason we're

adjusting down the lower end of our guidance ranges as illustrated on the next chart.
As we announced earlier this morning, we've adjusted our fiscal 2015 guidance as shown. Our currency neutral
expectations have not changed for sales and earnings. While we now anticipate some pressure on our gross margin
percentage, we have plans in place to mitigate the impact. We now expect sales growth of zero to plus 2%, adjusted
EBIT from minus 1% to plus 2%, and adjusted EPS from minus 1% to plus 2%, or $2.42 to $2.50 per share.
As we've said previously, we anticipated stronger first quarter performance. And because we are cycling a more robust
second quarter last year, we expect a first half that's more consistent with our full-year guidance.
Thank you, and now I will turn it back to Jennifer.

Thanks, Anthony. We will now start our Q&A session. Since we have limited time, out of fairness to other callers,
please ask only one question at a time.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is
open.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Alexia.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Good morning.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Denise, you mentioned once or twice the fast-growing perimeter of the store. From what
you've seen, are the retailers expanding fridge space at the moment? And what does this mean for the shelf space in the
center of the store? Obviously, it's great for Bolthouse. It might be more difficult in the ambient products. Thank you.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Thank you, Alexia. We have seen over the past several years an expansion and a build-out
of the perimeter of stores. Within the produce section, however, the additional space that we are getting for the
Bolthouse Kids launch is largely a reconfiguration of existing space; so pulling from other things in produce and
carving out a section for Bolthouse Kids. And that's been largely the way the premium beverage and the salad dressings
sections have been expanded as well. So I think it's more, yes, perimeter space continues to expand. And then within
the produce section, there has been a larger dedication of space to CPG items.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: I would add to that. If you look at the center of the store and our soup business, given
the level of innovation we're bringing to the market with the premium expansion and soon the organic soup launch,
we're expecting to gain shelf space in our soup category.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.

<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Good morning.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: I wanted just to probe a little bit more on this gross margin issue. This looks to be a
fairly significant issue. I think, Anthony, you said now down 50 basis points to down 100 basis points for the full year.
And previously the expectation – correct me if I'm wrong – but it was up modestly was the prior expectation. Is that
correct?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: I think we said it was expected to be stable. So versus stable, yes, we're down. We're
now looking to be down 50 to 100 basis points. And just to dimensionalize that, we did not anticipate the recent
increases in dairy, beef, and aluminum and also what freight costs are doing. And that's the majority of that 50 to 100
basis point decline. The other piece of it is higher than anticipated supply chain costs related to that early spike in
demand that we had to deal with.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: May I say that I always thought that you had pretty good visibility on the protein
side because of your relationships with your suppliers. These things didn't just suddenly come up. And I thought the
entire purpose of that was that gaining pricing in soup during soup season is like all but impossible. So maybe is my
recollection of history correct, and why is it different this time?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: I think we have a pretty broad array of input costs, and certainly on proteins it's a
significant part of it. And we do have good relationships obviously with our suppliers. But the markets have been
extremely volatile, and I don't think we're the only ones that are seeing this type of activity. There have been issues on
the supply side related to the drought. There have been issues on the demand side related to foreign buyers. And this
just created a lot of volatility that, frankly, we didn't anticipate.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: And the way you offset this is by, number one, it's going to be lowering marketing
spending; and then, number two, lower overhead spending Do I have that the right order?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: I'd switch the order of that.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: Okay.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: And I'd also add that we're evaluating price realization opportunities and also pushing
on our supply chain to, one, fix the problem and to contribute to those cost savings.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Your line is open.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. I just had a quick question for you, if I could. If you look at this quarter, you're
getting what seems to be an increasing contribution from the sauces business within U.S. Simple Meals in particular, as
well as premium soups. I wondered if you could give a little color around how those two products benefited sales for
that division in the quarter. And maybe related to that, ready-to-serve was a little weaker than I thought against a
relatively easy comp. Premium soups would fall into ready-to-serve, I presume. I wanted to make sure that was clear
and then understand why that was a little weaker than I thought.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Okay. First of all, we have had for the past several years a very good run with our base
sauce businesses, particularly in the Prego line. Recall, part of our innovation plan was the successful launch of Prego
white sauces, which has done incredibly well. We've increased our advertising against the brand. We are also
advertising to Hispanics, which has been very productive for us. So we're very pleased with the innovation and the
brand-building that's gone on in our base sauce businesses. And Pace also had a very good quarter.

One of the things that is also impacting our sauce business is the building of the dinner sauce platform. And although it
started small with one initiative in skillet, as we've built from skillet to slow cooker and now introduced oven, as we've
gained an additional section in the store to house these sauces and create a consumer destination, we really believe that,
that has added seriously to our sauce performance. And of course this is a very good margin business for us as well.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: The only thing I would add to that is Plum is reported inside of Simple Meals, and it
had a significant increase in sales in part due to wrapping the recall and in part due to expanded distribution.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: So within in ready-to-serve presumably premium soups grew, that was a contributor to
growth in the quarter. Was there one element of ready-to-serve that was weak whether that be Chunky or Homestyle?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yeah, there was a very good reason for that. Our ready-to-serve business was relatively
flat and that comes mostly from promotional timing move to the second quarter out of the first quarter relative to last
year.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. Thank you.

<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi Ken.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Hi, Ken.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: Denise, you've spoken in the recent past I think about course correcting in your deals a little
bit – deal backs – by going deeper in terms of discount but maybe a little bit less broadly. I'm just curious if this is still
the plan because we look at Nielsen data, we are seeing deeper levels of price discounting, you're doing what you said
but we are not really seeing a change in the percent and lift from promotion. So I'm just curious how you think about
that breadth versus depth decision going forward here?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yep. Well, we do expect our total marketing to be in the range of 24% to 25% of total list
sales. So – and within that, the mix will be different by category. And we do recognize this, we're very diligent about
going back and looking at the productivity of our trade spending and we recognize that some of the spending last year,
particularly in Pepperidge Farm and in soup, did not achieve the anticipated lifts; predominantly it came from
increasing the frequency of promotion. So we do expect our overall trade rate trends to improve in the second half as
we've course corrected in this area.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: Great, thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Hi, thank you.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hey, Rob.
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Good morning. So I guess I was wondering about this unexpected spike in demand. If we
look at the sales in the quarter, they didn't come in that different from what we had modeled and I don't think it came in
that different from what you had modeled. So was this a specific customer making a last-minute decision that you felt
like you had to react to? And then secondly, gross margin being down 130 bps despite volume being up, Anthony, was
there any overhead absorption benefit from all this volume, and if not, why not?

Page 10 of 14
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Let me start with the last part of that question. No, there wasn't an absorption benefit
because we still expect to make the same full-year production so it was just moving fixed costs with those cases
between the quarters, so on a rate-per-case basis nothing really changed. In terms of the volume spike, what you don't
see when you look at the quarter is the monthly variations, and we had very strong volume demands early in the
quarter, so August, September. And it's not a particular customer, it has to do with just overall programming and the
timing at which customers place orders.
So in order to meet the customer service requirements, we had to run some more overtime, we had to run some more
weekends, and obviously that costs a bit – cost us a bit more. And we had to get into the freight market on a spot basis
so that's obviously a little more expensive so it's going to take us a little while here to catch up with that requirement
but we would foresee improvements when we get to the second half of the year.
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Okay. Was it on a specific line of products or not?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: It's mostly in our soup and sauce business in the U.S.
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Okay, thank you very much.

Our next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Hi, good morning. Happy holidays to you and your family.
<A - Jennifer K. Driscoll>: Same to you, Eric.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Good morning.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: I want to follow-up on Rob's question because I think it goes to the point. I mean what –
obviously we knew the timing of Thanksgiving and you have said that the shipments were well ahead of consumption.
So the first part is what are we looking for from sales in the second quarter given how much it seems like there was
over shipment versus consumption?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: I think that's a good point. We, as you know, benefited from the retailer inventory
movement last year's first quarter relative to this year's first quarter. And when you look at where we ended this quarter,
it's within the the historical ranges, but we're a bit higher than where we were last year, so it's hard to predict exactly
when that will come out but it could be a little bit of a headwind for us on second-quarter top line. As we've said also
said we did expect stronger first quarter and a relatively softer second quarter and to finish the half with results more in
line with our full-year guidance, so it's not unexpected but again the thing we didn't expect was within the first quarter
the acceleration to the earlier month or two.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: We actually had a stronger sell-in against back-to-school and as predicted, had our
holiday shipments, some of our holiday shipments shipped in October, and about the soup business at least about 75%
of our consumption actually occurs in the second and the third quarters.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay, and then, Anthony, I don't understand your answers to Rob's question about the
volume lift and the absorption. So are you saying that you basically just regardless of quarterly volume you basically
spread the fixed cost over the entire year, like on some basis as opposed to counting it more specifically within the
quarter?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: It actually goes with the volume so you figure out our fixed cost per case and you
recognize those fixed costs as you sell them. So it's not a straight line. It moves with the volume.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Right, so with the volume so strong in arguably the highest margin products that you have, I
guess you just must have paid extraordinary cost on the freight market and I would assume Pepperidge Farm and

Goldfish is a very high margin product. Was that also an offset? Because otherwise my guess is most investors are
saying that this would have been a much bigger margin quarter.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Yes, I think your reference of mix benefit and we do see that and you saw it on the
gross margin bridge that I reviewed, so we are seeing mix benefit but as I said, on a fixed cost per case basis, we don't
necessarily see that but we do see it in the mix line so I think there's 30 or 40 basis points of mix benefit given the
performance of Soup and some of our higher-margin business relative to the balance. But, that being said, the inflation
impact on dairy, beef and aluminum and freight is about half of that gross margin mix and the other half is the supply
chain related costs, which aren't insignificant and did hurt our gross margin performance in the first quarter.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: All right. I'll respect the time. I'll pass it on and will follow-up on this. Thanks.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: It was 40 basis point mix benefit.

Our next question comes from the line a David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hello David.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Good morning, a big picture question about Campbell improving towards its long-term
algorithm. I am imagining this year that Plum, Bolthouse, V8, those are going to be areas of improvement this year and
perhaps you can comment on that. But thinking longer-term, one issue and I think Chris was hinting at this on his
question, Campbell has been improving somewhat in the meal helpers, the sauces, the cooking soups essentially
helping the millennials and others prepare meals and participating in that importantly in a higher-margin way for
Campbell. And over time it's certainly believable that there could be a tipping point when these platforms again
higher-margin platforms for Campbell could start to sort of carry the P&L, to contribute on revenue in a way that isn't
one where you are fighting the gross margins of the products that you're growing with. Can you comment on that and
perhaps when you could see a tipping point like that? Thanks.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: First of all, I don't think I could've articulated the strategy any clearer than you did, so
thank you for that. I think that as opposed to a tipping point, I think we're starting to see the impact of some mixed
change as these particular faster-growing businesses come into the portfolio and are now captured in our organic sales.
And I liken it what we did with aseptic broth. Once upon a time broth was a canned business and over time we
introduced the aseptic cartons and the cans gradually declined, the aseptic cartons of broth increased at a very
significant margin. So, we were pretty excited about that and I think as these other businesses will come into the
portfolio and mix accordingly but that said, we are still putting a very concerted effort on our core businesses to
strengthen them as well.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: I guess my major, the big question, the million dollar question is whether these sauces and
helpers essentially can – and sometimes it is hard for us to tease that out of your general soup numbers because some of
these are cooking soups, when those will again carry that line item in a margin accretive way. I guess that will be for us
to just wait and watch.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: I think that's right. One of the things we do know is that these types of products are
attracting a more affluent and younger consumer into our franchise and we're very encouraged by that.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Thank you.

<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Hi, Matt.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hello, Matt.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Just to drill down on one of these newer business lines, I was surprised to see
profitability down pretty sharply in the Bolthouse and Foodservice segment and granted one quarter but you're
obviously generating strong top line growth on Bolthouse. Foodservice seems to be in a more stable position. So is the
margin contraction here during the quarter a function of the timing of investments in new products, or should we think
about there perhaps being Bolthouse specific cost pressures that could persist over the course of the year, or are there
other factors that play just here during the quarter?
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Matt, there are a couple things. Within Bolthouse, the CPG businesses, so beverages
and salad dressings grew both top and bottom line. The issue within Bolthouse has been carrots, so there has been some
significant inflation in there. It's partly due to the drought, so we've had higher water extraction costs and higher land
cost. We also had higher freight costs. We were growing up in Washington state and trucking down to California, and
since the first quarter that production has moved to central California, so that should help a bit.
The other impact is on the Foodservice business, so not in Bolthouse, significant cost inflation in the Foodservice
products and also some investments we're making to expand our retail fresh business so it's a combination of those
things.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. So it's fair to say it may not be the same magnitude, but some of these things
directionally could continue to pressure operating profit for the next few quarters?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: I would expect things to get better.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yes, we expect improvement.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay, all right, thank you, everyone.

<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Hey, good morning, everybody, and Happy Thanksgiving.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Bryan, same to you.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Thank you.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: I just wanted to ask a question about M&A. Denise, we're now a couple of years into this
current strategy, and you've been very articulate and clear about where the M&A targets are. But at the same time, there
are two things that have probably shifted more in the last three years. One has been the trend towards or the size of the
impact on health and wellness has become I guess more pronounced and larger in the U.S. And then also international,
especially developing in emerging markets, at least right now have slowed, and I think there are a lot of mixed opinions
in terms of when it turns and how it turns and where it turns. Can you just talk a little bit about how you've looked at
those dynamics changing and if at all it begins to have you refocus or adjust at all your lens for where you're looking to
do acquisitions? Thank you.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: So we've said previously that some acquisition may be required to further diversify our
portfolio, and we still believe that to be the case. But that said, we've also said and still are very tight with this. We
have a very disciplined approach to how we evaluate acquisitions and the strategic fit of acquisitions into our program
here. That said, we do have the financial flexibility to make a meaningful acquisition if we can find one that is a good
fit and gives us the returns that we would expect to create value over time. So we still are active in this space, but we're

being very disciplined about our approach to it.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Has there been any change in focus areas or areas you're looking just because the global
economy has slowed, things are slower in developing and emerging markets, and there seems to be an increase,
certainly appetite in the investment community, but also just broadly as health and wellness related products and
categories begin to expand? Has that all changed the areas where you're looking, or is it still the same basket, same
proportions in terms of where you are looking?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: If you think about the acquisitions that we've made, Plum Organics and Bolthouse Farms
in packaged fresh have both been what we believe are very solid plays in health and wellness. And the Kelsen business
was a good add for us for international expansion, particularly with 40% of its sales in China and Hong Kong. We'll
continue to look for targets similar to those kinds of acquisitions.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: And then just one last one related to this, just in terms of investment. So rather than M&A,
is there any more broad thought to just changing – making investments organically in your own business to adjust
towards simpler ingredients or more health and wellness above and beyond what you've already done, so something
that might maybe change production processes or change ingredients? Is that at all part of what you're looking at in
terms of your investment dollars? Thank you.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: I think if you really look at the platforms for growth, in addition to what we just
discussed, we've got a concerted effort on breakthrough innovation. And one of the platforms in breakthrough
innovation is health and well-being because we've got V8 Veggie Blends coming, V8 protein bars and shakes. We've
got advances in innovation in Bolthouse Farms and Plum and we have the new Campbell organic soups coming to
market. So we're very active in innovation in the health and well-being space. Packaged fresh we just talked about. And
then also increasing our availability, we've got an enormous opportunity in other channels outside of grocery,
particularly in immediate consumption channels, that we're in the process of building out that network. We've put a
sales team in place and we still have a lot more work to do there, but that's a great expansion space for us.

<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Hi, Akshay.
<A - Anthony P. DiSilvestro>: Same to you. Good morning.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: Good morning. My question is on freight cost. Can you talk a little more broadly about
freight cost? A lot of companies have been mentioning that in the food space as being a headwind. Is seems like a
general industry trend that snuck up on us. Is that the case? What is your read on that and is it a transitory issue and
perhaps how long might that last?
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yeah, I think it really stems from the carrier capacity situation. And there's just
significantly more demand than there is availability especially on the spot markets. So it hit us two ways this quarter.
One just a general increase in freight rates, the other because of our volume demand we had access to spot market and a
higher proportion than we've done in the past. What we are doing about this is we're trying to get more committed
carrier capacity in our highest volume freight lanes and that will protect us from coming to the spot market. You may
have to pay a little bit more but it gives us some protection in our supply chain group is in the process of doing it right
now. So, it will be a negative impact but it should moderate as we go through the year here a bit.

Our final question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open. Alexia, your line
might be muted.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Thank you for the follow-up question. Can I just ask about the shift into digital on both
the advertising and promotional front? A number of companies have been saying that promotional spending
particularly has been getting less effective of late. I am just wondering how quickly you are shifting into digital on both
advertising and promotion and how you can be confident that that's giving you I guess better effectiveness as you make
that shift? Thank you.
<A - Denise M. Morrison>: Yes. Yes, we have been experiencing and encouraging the same shift into digital. We're
up to about 20% of our spending in digital. And what happens is, it is the production costs of digital are less, but you
need to produce more content. So there is a bit of an offset there. So yes, you could see non-working come down
because of the price of producing in digital but then again, it's a different production and making sure that content is
fresh and works on multiple screen sizes. But we do believe that this shift will continue. This is the way to connect with
the next generation of consumers. We still do have a significant portion of our spend in TV because of our large baby
boomer population that still watches TV as their major media.
