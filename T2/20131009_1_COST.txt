To begin with, our fourth quarter operating results for the 16-week quarter reported earnings per share came in at $1.40,
up a penny from last year's 17-week fourth-quarter earnings of $1.39. I will come back to this in a moment. In terms of
sales for the quarter, total sales were up 1%, which was, again, was impacted by the extra week. Comp sales which
compares like 16-week periods were up 5% both on a reported basis and excluding gas and FX.
For the quarter gas prices year-over-year were effectively flat, so no impact on the 5% U.S. comp figure, however
foreign currencies weakened relative to the U.S. dollar year-over-year in the fourth quarter, primarily in Canada and
Japan, such that our reported 4% international comp figure assuming flat year-over-year FX rates would have been up
7%.
In terms of sales for the five-week September period, total sales increased 6% year-over-year, reported comparable
sales increased 3%, and that 3% was comprised of 4% in the U.S. and 0% internationally and excluding gas and FX,
comparable sales would have been up 5%. The 4% U.S. reported would have been a 5% excluding gas deflation and
the 0% internationally would have been an up 6% assuming FX was flat year-over-year in local currencies.
In terms of comparing our $1.40 reported earnings for the fourth quarter to last year's fourth quarter of $1.39, several
items of note. First, there are a few items that I've discussed in each of the prior several earnings calls. Last year's
fourth quarter had the extra week. Simply dividing the 17 weeks into the $1.39 figure would have suggested that the
benefit from that extra week was about $0.08 a share. Membership fee income, of course, included about $25 million
pre-tax extra and that relates to the late 2011, early 2012 annual fee increase in the U.S. and Canada and how that
works its way to our income statement based on deferred accounting over about a 23-month period.
Interest expense, of course, was higher in the fourth quarter by about $13 million pre-tax or $0.02 a share. This related
to last December's $3.5 billion debt offering that was done in conjunction with the $7 per share special dividend. There
were also a few items that year-to-date through the first three quarters had represented positive year-over-year profit
variances, but that swung the other way in Q4 year-over-year. For example, FX. Whereas strengthening foreign
currencies relative to the U.S. dollar added to earnings per share year-to-date through the first three quarters, it swung
the other way in the fourth quarter. And in Q4 foreign currencies -- the foreign currencies where we operate weakened
versus the U.S. dollar, resulting in foreign earnings in Q4 when converted into U.S. dollars being lower by about $10
million pre-tax or $0.015 a share than those earnings would have been had FX exchange rates been flat year-over-year.
A similar year-over-year profit swing occurred in the profitability of our gasoline operations. Year-to-date through the
third quarter gas profitability was higher year-over-year through the third quarter year-to-date. In Q4 it too swung the
other way coming in lower at Q4 year-over-year. In addition to these factors, I'll point out in our discussion of SG&A a
few other items that resulted in our expense percentages coming in higher year-over-year in Q4. In terms of new
openings for all of fiscal 2013 we opened 26 new locations, 12 in the U.S., three each in Canada and the U.K., five in
Japan and one each in Korea, Taiwan and Mexico, ending fiscal 2013 with 634 locations worldwide.
For fiscal 2014, we've ramped up our expansion plans. On our docket are plans to open 36 new warehouses with half of
these in the U.S. and the remaining in international markets including our first two planned for Spain next spring and
summer. Inevitably a few of these will probably get delayed, so I would estimate that a number in the low to mid-30s is
more likely. Still a pretty good increase above the 16 and 26 new warehouses opened in each of the past two fiscal
years. During the first four months of 2014 through calendar year-end, we plan to open 15 of these locations, 10 in the
U.S., including three next week, two each in Canada and Australia and one in Mexico.
Also this morning I'll review with you our membership trends, our e-commerce activity and, of course, additional
discussion about margins and SG&A. Quickly on the start to the call here in terms of fourth quarter results more detail.
Sales for the year's fourth quarter were $31.8 billion, up 1% from last year's 17-week fourth quarter of $31.5 billion.
And again if you normalize the 17 weeks by taking 16-seventeenths of it, if you will, it would have been up 7% on a
normalized comparable week basis. On a reported comp basis, Q4 comps were up 5% for the quarter. For the quarter
our 5% reported comp was a combination of almost flat average transaction for the quarter. That included the detriment
of FX of about 80 basis points so we were up slightly without – assuming flat FX, and an average frequency increase in
the quarter of 4.5% up.

In terms of comparisons by geographic region, most U.S. regions registered mid-single-digit comp increases for the
quarter, with Texas, Midwest and Southeast being the strongest. Internationally in local currencies, Korea and Taiwan
were on the weak end due in part to cannibalization on a relatively small base of existing units, with Canada and
Mexico the strongest in terms of comp sales increases. In terms of comp sales by merchandise category for the quarter
within Food & Sundries, which were mostly in the mid-single digits, Deli, Wine and Spirits, Beer, Frozen Foods and
Candy were all relative standouts.
Within hardlines, fairly flat numbers year-over-year. The departments with the strong results were office, health and
beauty aids and hardware. Electronic sales, which is a relatively large-sized sub-department within hardlines, were
weaker year-over-year in the fourth quarter. For softlines, low double digits for the quarter. Small electrics,
housewares, domestics and apparel were standouts and the same old department media continuing being the relatively
weak department there.
In Fresh Foods comp sales in the mid-single digits, Deli and produce showing the best result. For September, the
five-week month, sales were $9.9 billion, up 6% from last year's September reporting period. On a comp basis
September comps were reported 5% -- oh I'm sorry; were up a reported 3% for the month. That 3% included a negative
1.3% average transaction. This includes the detriment of FX of about 1.5 percentage points and deflationary gasoline
which deflated quite a bit, about one percentage point. So the 1.5 percentage points and the one percentage points,
those 2.5 percentage points negative is included in that minus 1.3% transaction. Average frequency up by about 4%.
Excluding FX and gas effects, comp sales for the month of September were plus 5%. In terms of sales by geography for
the September, most U.S. regions were in the low to mid-single-digit comps, with Southeast and Texas being on the
strong end. Internationally, Korea and Japan were on the weak side of all the international countries, with Canada and
Mexico showing the strongest comp sales increases in local currency.
In terms of category sales for September, Food & Sundries low to mid singles. Hardlines low singles, similar to the
quarter. Softlines in the low to mid-teens, up a little bit from the quarter. Fresh Foods continues in the mid-single-digit
range, led again by produce and Service Deli.
And lastly, ancillary business comps were slightly negative on a reported basis basically due to the gasoline business
which experienced 8% deflation year-over-year in the average price per gallon during the five-week monthly reporting
period. Gallons in terms of gas were slightly positive.
Moving on down the line items of the income statement. Membership fees were up 3% or about $22 million, increase
of 4 basis points year-over-year to $716 million. Both membership fee numbers for this year's fourth quarter and last
year's had some items to look at. Within the $716 million of course, this year it included the $25 million benefit that I
talked about from the fee increase. And last year's $694 million again was a 17-week quarter, taking one-seventeenth
out of that you would reduce that number by $41 million. So I think the 3% reported increase in dollars, again adjusting
it for those two anomalies, would have been up about 6% but 3% is what we reported. In terms of membership, renewal
rates remain strong both in the U.S. and Canada and worldwide.
Continue to strengthen our Executive Membership program. You remember signups in the quarter company-wide were
very strong, up 9% year-over-year despite one last week in the quarter. That strong performance was mostly reflective
of very strong signup at our three Japan openings that opened in the fourth quarter. As I mentioned in the past we've got
very strong openings signups at locations in Asia and Australia.
In terms of number of members at fourth quarter end, Gold Star were, ended the quarter in the year at 28.9 million up
from 28.2 million 16 weeks earlier. Primary Business remained at 6.6 million. Business add-on remained at 3.5 million.
Again you get some of those add-ons moving into other categories as they opt for executive. Total paid memberships
went from 38.3 million at year end to 39.0 million – I'm sorry. 38.3 million at Q3 end and 39 million at fiscal year-end.
And total cards went from 69.9 million at third quarter end to 71.2 million at fiscal year-end.
Executive Members continue to increase. We're up over 13.5 million at the end of the fiscal year, which is about
250,000 increase in terms of members since Q3 end or about 15,000 a week added during the quarter. As I've
mentioned before Executive Members are over half – over a third of our member [ph] raise (11:55) and about

two-thirds of our sales as well. In terms of membership renewal rates they too continued strong. Our business renewal
rates went from a 93.9% at the end of the third quarter tweaked up to a 94.0%. Gold Star went from an 88.9% to 89.1%
so total business in Gold Star went from 80.99% to 90.0%. And those numbers by the way are for the U.S. and Canada
which we've always showed in the aggregate. That's about a little over 82%, 83% of our business. Worldwide the
number went from an 86 4% at the end of the third quarter to an 86 3%. And the reason there is with all these new
international openings you're always going to have much lower renewal rates in start-up years of new locations in
particularly in new markets.
Excuse me. Going down the gross margin line again I'll ask you to jot down a few numbers. We'll have four columns.
The columns would be reported and without gas – and the second column without gas. That would be Q3 2013 and Q3
2013. The third and fourth columns would be reported for Q4 2013 and without gas for Q4 2013. As I mentioned in Q4
there's no inflation so the third and fourth columns will be the same numbers. The line items – the first one would be
core merchandising. Going across to the four columns would be minus five basis points year-over-year, minus 11 basis
points, minus four basis points and minus four basis points. Ancillary and other businesses plus six basis points, plus
five basis points and then plus three basis points and plus three basis points in the last two columns. 2% Reward minus
two basis points across the board. LIFO plus six basis points and plus six basis points in the Q3 columns and plus seven
basis points and plus seven basis points in the Q4 columns. And Other was plus seven basis points and plus seven basis
points in the Q3 columns and zero basis points and zero basis points in Q4 columns. That related to a lawsuit recovery
that we mentioned last quarter.
All told, reported in Q3 year-over-year gross margin was up 12 basis points, but again taking out gas inflation it was up
five basis points. This year both the reported and without gas, it was up four basis points. Now to provide a little color
on these numbers. Core merchandise component of the gross margin was down four basis points year-over-year. Three
of the four core categories: food & sundries, hardlines and softlines showed higher year-over-year gross margin
percents on their own sales in the 10 basis points to 25 basis points range each while year-over-year and Q4 Fresh Food
margins were lower by about 80 basis points. As I mentioned on the last few earnings calls our investment in pricing
occurs throughout many of the merchandising departments, but it has been most notable in Fresh Foods.
Ancillary business gross margins were up three basis points year-over-year in Q4. Gas and Food Court margins coming
in a little lower than Q4 last year, with others like pharmacy, optical and hearing aids coming in a little bit better. The
impact from the increasing Executive Membership business represented a reduction to the gross margin of two basis
points reflecting the cost of higher penetration of sales going to the Executive Member Reward program.
LIFO in the fourth quarter, we recorded an $8 million pre-tax credit a year ago. That compares to an $11.5 million
pre-tax charge – I'm sorry – an $8 million pre-tax credit this year in the fourth quarter compared to an $11.5 million
pre-tax charge last year in the quarter. So that was a year-over-year seven basis point swing in our favor. All in all, a
pretty good margin result in the fourth quarter.
Now moving to reported SG&A. Our SG&A percentages Q4 over Q4 were higher by nine basis points coming in at a
9.75% this year compared to a 9.66% last year. Again, we'll jot down a few numbers. The same four columns. Reported
and without gas and then again reported and without gas. And the first two columns will be for Q3 year-over-year. And
the third and fourth columns would be Q4 year-over-year. Going across operations plus two basis points reported in Q3
2013. Plus seven basis points without gas. That means, a plus sign means better or lower. In Q4 it was a minus nine
basis points and a minus nine basis points. Central, plus two basis points and plus two basis points in columns one and
two. Plus three basis points and plus three basis points in columns three and four. RSUs or equity compensation minus
one basis point and zero basis points and minus three basis points and minus three basis points. All told in Q3
year-over-year we reported a plus three basis points or SG&A better by three basis points. Without gas inflation it was
actually better by nine basis points looking at it that way. And again in Q4 year-over-year it was higher or minus nine
basis points.
The core operations component again was nine basis points year-over-year. There are several moving parts to that. For
example, the benefits and workers comp expenses were higher year-over-year in the fourth quarter by five basis points
– four basis points on the benefits side and one basis point on the workers comp side. In part due to year-end true-ups

of various expense accruals as well as some increases. So again some of that I would say would be more normal and
some of it's just how we true up things at year end. Several additional basis points of our expense comparisons in Q4
year-over-year resulted from a variety of other year-end expense accrual true-ups that in the aggregate had helped us a
little last year in the quarter and tended to hurt us a little bit in – this year in the quarter.
These items notwithstanding within core operations our payroll as a percent of sales continued to improve
year-over-year. Central expense, it was better or lower by three basis points as you saw in the chart. This benefited by
bringing back a little bit of our bonus accrual for the year. That benefit was somewhat offset by ongoing IT
modernization costs. I will – happy to mention also that – I want to mention also that IT expense as a percent of sales
will continue to be negatively impact SG&A throughout the upcoming fiscal year as we continue these modernization
efforts. Lastly, our equity compensation, which is provided as part of a compensation package to more than 3,000
people at Costco represented a three basis point hit to SG&A in the quarter. So all told, there were a few things that I
think were anomalies and a few that were a little higher expense, all resulting of course in reported higher SG&A.
In terms of the income statement pre-opening expense, $15 million last year, up $2 million to $17 million this year. No
real surprises. Last year we had six openings, four in the U.S. and two international. This year we had seven openings
in the quarter, two U.S. and five international. All told reported operating income in the fourth quarter increased
slightly year-over-year, coming in last year at $949 million versus $954 million this year. Again, lots of reasons for
this, the extra week and many of the items that I pointed out earlier in this discussion.
Below the operating income line reported interest expense was $14 million higher year-over-year with Q4 2013 coming
in at $36 million versus $22 million in last year's quarter. This difference relates to the additional interest expense again
in the December 12, $3.5 billion debt offering which equates to about $44 million pre-tax year and about – between
$13 million and $14 million for the 16-week quarter.
Interest income and other was lower year-over-year by $2 million, coming in at $36 million this year from $38 million
a year ago. Actual interest income within this figure came in at $14 million compared to $16 million a year ago. The
other component of interest income and other amounted to income of about $22 million in each of the fourth quarters,
essentially the same year-over-year.
Overall pre-tax income was down $11 million versus last year's fourth quarter, coming in $954 million this year versus
$965 million last year. Again, last year's fourth quarter included one more week of earnings results than this year's
16-week fourth quarter.
In terms of income taxes, our company's tax rate this quarter came in at 34.8% versus 35.6% a year ago. So a little less,
about 0.08% lower year-over-year tax rate. While many of the items I talked about in expenses tended to go against us
in the fourth quarter this year versus last year, there are a few discrete items in taxes that tended to help us and reduce
that rate a shade from a year ago. Overall net income was up $8 million versus last year's fourth quarter from $609
million last year to $617 million this fiscal year in the fourth quarter.
Now for a quick rundown of other topics. While the finance balance sheet is included in this morning's press release, a
couple of balance sheet informational items. Depreciation, amortization for the quarter totaled $295 million and
therefore $946 million for the entire fiscal year. Merchandise accounts payable, again, and when you look at accounts
payable on the balance sheet it includes majority of it is merchandise related. The other component is typically
construction related. And excuse me. Oh, here I am, sorry.
So anyway, on the balance sheet, our reported AP ratio was 100% this year down from 103%. Just using merchandise
accounts payable to inventories it was 89% down from 90%. Average inventory per warehouse last year it was $11.7
million per warehouse, this year it was $12.5 million; about $800,000 per warehouse or about 7% up year-over-year.
The $800,000 increase is really spread throughout many merchandise departments and overall our inventories are in
good shape. Our physical inventories at fiscal year-end came in as good as they've ever been.
In terms of CapEx in the first three quarters of this year we spent $488 million, $455 million, and $435 million
respectively. So in Q4 we spent $705 million; not only is it more weeks in the fiscal quarter but again it's related to all
the openings we've got coming on this fall. So for the total year we spent $2.83 billion. I'd estimate that our fiscal 2014

CapEx given the planned 36 openings will be approximately $2.3 million to $2.5 million. Again, the lower end of that
range taking account that probably there's a couple things that will slip during the period.
Costco Online, currently costco.com, which is our U.S. e-commerce, costco.ca and costco.co.uk for Q4 sales and
profits were up over last year even with the extra week last year. Q4 e-commerce sales were up 8%. So again if you
extrapolated that for the extra week it would have been about 15% normalized. E-commerce is again a little over 2% of
our sales. We replatformed dot com sites, our dot come sites last fall as I'd mentioned. We also launched the Android
and Apple apps during the same time. Costco.uk was launched last fall and this fall we plan to begin e-commerce
operations in Mexico.
In terms of expansion for the year, again, this assumes that we open the 36 that I mentioned that in our plan. It would
be 14 in the first quarter, 2 in the second quarter including one which is before calendar year end. That's how I got to
the 15 earlier, 9 in Q3 and 11 in Q4. So in fiscal 2013, the 26 we added represented about 4.5% square footage growth.
Assuming 36 on a base of 634 this year that would be 5.5% square footage growth. If you assumed at the low end,
perhaps 30, that would be about 4.7% square footage growth. So something in the 4.5% to 5%, closer to 5% range
should be our expectation this year.
The new locations by country assuming 36 figure, half would be in the U.S., three would be in Canada, seven would be
in Asia between four in Korea and three in Japan, five would be in Australia, one in Mexico and two would be in Spain.
As I mentioned we'd enter in the spring and the fall. As of fourth quarter-end, some of you asked about square footage
we stood at, square footage stood at 90.805 million square feet, an increase year-over-year 4.5%.
In terms of dividends, our current quarterly dividend stands at $0.31 per share or $1.24 annualized. That was up 13%
from the previous $0.275 per share quarterly dividend. This $1.24 annualized dividend represents total cost to the
company of about $541 million. And, of course, these quarterly dividends were in addition to the $7.00 per share
special dividend, which totaled a little over $3 billion that we paid to shareholders back in December of 2012, our fiscal
second quarter of 2013.
The usual supplemental measures will be posted on the Costco Investor Relations site later this morning. And lastly,
our fiscal 2014 first-quarter scheduled earnings release date will be Wednesday, the 11th of December. That will be for
the 12-week fourth quarter ending on November 24.
With that, I'll turn it over to Felicia.

<Q - Steven Forbes>: Hey, Richard. It's actually Steve Forbes on for John today.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Hi.
<Q - Steven Forbes>: When you think about I guess the holiday selling season coming up, does the shorter selling
season between Thanksgiving ex Christmas not matter? Or does something get done differently from a merchandising
or operational standpoint?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It doesn't matter. I mean, every pre-holiday Christmas Day is better than a post-holiday
Christmas Day. But overall we're approaching it the same from an inventory standpoint, being fairly positive on our
buying.
<Q - Steven Forbes>: Okay. And then just on Canada how are you progressing with the rollout of gas? And then I
guess is there a target for the number of locations that offer gas as for the end of next year?

six to eight is my guess on a – oh here. I got the numbers here. Gas in Canada, we have 43 currently at the end of -- as
of this past Sunday.
<A>: [indiscernible] (26:48)
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: And that's out of 85 total Costcos in Canada. So on a base of 43, six to eight would be a
good guess.
<Q - Steven Forbes>: And then just lastly on cost pressure, actually the competitive environment. I guess you
mentioned Fresh Foods, the 80 basis points and so forth. Is there anything else you can give a little additional color on?
And I guess are you – is there any sense of the return that you're seeing on these investments?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, keep in mind -- the return, I've used the example of the rotisserie chicken in the past.
We get more positive press out there from keeping that incredible giant chicken at $4.99, and over the last year, year
and a half, the underlying poultry prices have skyrocketed. So we've – the underlying prices have skyrocketed such that
there's very little margin on it right now. Although it looks like there's some relief in terms of where pricing is going
over the next few months based on poultry futures cost. Doesn't mean we're raising prices. It means that we'll at least
make a little margin. But, you know, sometime – that's us and that's what we do.
In terms of the competitive environment out there, I mean from what I see at the every four-week budget meetings from
all the regions, it's not easy but it's not – there's always pockets of something but there's nothing that's changed in the
extreme either way.
<Q - Steven Forbes>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Matt J. Fassler>: Thanks a lot, and good morning. Can you comment on whether you bought back stock this
quarter and what your general thought process is on the buyback at this stage of the game?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Sure. Well, we did not – sorry. I forgot to mention that. So for the year we bought very
little back, about $34 million I think at the very beginning of the fiscal year back in September. On a long-term basis,
we're still look to – we're still positive about the outlook of our company long term and we'll continue to look at it. We
report once a quarter and we'll let you know next quarter what we've done or not done this quarter. We did of course do
the $3 billion special dividend back in the fall at a time when the stock was showing a lot of strength. And so we feel
good about the combination of the two over time and I'm trying to be as coy as possible because I can't give you any
direction until we let you know a quarter from now.
<Q - Matt J. Fassler>: Understood on that. And just a quick follow-up. On the electronics business, can you give us a
sense whether the weakness was volume or price driven and what you think your market share did during the quarter?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, it was both. I honestly don't know what others have done. We've been very strong up
until the fourth quarter like through May. It seemed like every month we had what we call majors which is electronics
principally and TVs within that's the biggest category, tended to be up in the 5 to 10 percentage point range. A little of
that I think back then was higher average price point even though electronics tends to be deflationary. We were selling
bigger and bigger and more advanced televisions, 60s and 80s. Back in June-July as we saw some weakness and we

And your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher Horvers>: Thanks, good morning, guys. Can you talk about how you think about inflation in key
categories going forward? And does that provide some – an opportunity for some margin relief such that maybe
moving back to flat core margins? Or – and then related to that, how should we think about the LIFO impact related to
that?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Okay. Well, first of all, again, as I've said several times in the last year or two, when
margins have showed a little year-over-year downturn, it's us – in our view it's us more than our competition and we
have been pretty extreme on certain categories. I think a year ago it was the Food Court. I mentioned rotisserie chicken.
When you're selling 60-plus million of those a year, that adds up to more than a couple of basis points alone to the
company. But that's overall what we do.
In terms of LIFO, in terms of what does inflation or deflation do, certainly inflation, we tend to – ultimately you've got
to take some of it subject to the competition, but we tend to be a laggard historically. With deflation we tend to be the
first out of the box. So certainly though when there's inflation, there's a perhaps a little bit of an opportunity. And that
gets to the LIFO question. What generally you see is when there's a LIFO credit, meaning that there's been deflation,
you've also had some price reductions. So part of the reason I think the core year-over-year was down a little as that as
well and when it goes the other way they tend to go in opposite directions. Not all the time but that's the case, so I think
that we do better when we're reducing prices and driving business. And overall that's good for us better than others. We
view that – we tend to be more aggressive and take more advantage of that to show a difference between us and our
competition.
<Q - Christopher Horvers>: So does that mean that – are you seeing more deflation and do you expect more deflation
going forward? And would that result in -
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Keep in mind we're not seeing a lot of anything right now. I did mention gasoline in
general. Gasoline is quite deflationary. Year-over-year in the month it was 8% lower but it's kind of everything else is
kind of neutral – certainly well under a percentage point. Again I mentioned poultry as an example. That had more to
do with the fact that poultry prices had risen dramatically over a couple of year period and we've maintained a $4.99
price on that which again we find ourselves in the news about that which is a positive. Now that it seems like there's
some downward pressure on both feed and poultry prices futures over the next few months as the commitments for the
producers go through the higher cost stuff we would expect hopefully to see those prices come down which adds to
margins since we'll maintain that $4.99.

<Q - Christopher Horvers>: But what about – isn't there pricing on the grain side, isn't that causing pressure, meaning
there's some Nielsen data out today suggesting that prices are coming down on the grain side. And if you look at corn
and soya out there and where they're priced in the market today that would suggest that prices will come down in the
future. So are any of the merchants talking about on the dry grocery side or other areas in the box where they expect
pricing to come down or is the outlook basically neutral?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: If our landed costs come down generally you expect to see our prices come down. I think
where we have the anomalies with the outliers are going to be something like an extreme item. And by the way,
rotisserie chicken is just one form of chicken we sell. We sell frozen and fresh and everything else but just that one
item is $300-plus million dollars. So when we have been the leader in terms of keeping the price down despite very
upward increases and underlying costs, as those come down that gives us a little margin relief. But generally speaking
across what I'll call the supermarket, canned and boxed categories we're going to try to lower prices.
<Q - Christopher Horvers>: Understood. And then any commentary in terms of how September played out from a
cadence perspective week-to-week?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I don't have that detail in front of me. A lot of it has to do with how Labor Day falls and
what the weather is with back-to-school. There's probably a 3% or 4% range between the weeks but I don't have that in
front of me.
<Q - Christopher Horvers>: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to touch on a couple of things. First with regard to
competitive pricing. As you know one of your competitors has been out there with a new vendor book program that I
think they've done now three or four times. Just curious in your more, in your price sensitive organization, how are you
dealing with that? Are you matching price when they do a vendor book or do you just sort of do your own vendor book
and disregard that as promotional pricing that's not every day?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: We're going to do what we do. Look, if they keep doing it, it must be working and we've
been doing it for a long time ourselves. We're always out there trying to do new things as well and I think that's fine.
We take that into account when comments I mentioned earlier about levels of competition out there.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: But I guess just day-to-day when they have a vendor book out there, do you feel compelled to
lower the price on those items or do you just treat it as a one-off promotional event that you don't necessarily match?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, in a perfect world absolutely yes every time. The reality is, is just like on our MVM
booklets when we're getting – we've negotiated a specific deal with a specific vendor and it's essentially a lower cost to
us because of that but that's because of a deal we negotiated. We're not going to go way down to match something all
the time. We look at it as promotional. At the end of the day all of the big retailers from the biggest to the next three or
four and the large supermarket chains as well, all the big manufacturers have various buckets, and different silos of
promotional monies. Whether it's for the MVM or slotting allowances or seasonal, back-to-school, whatever it is. And
different retailers are going to use it at different times in different ways. So ultimately everyday blocking and tackling,
we're going to match prices. We're not going to go crazy, 20% below cost if somebody else had used that their silo of
promotional monies in a way on a promotional basis. As I wouldn't expect they would either.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: And then with regard to Canada, I think you guys were a little bit more aggressive in front of
Target's openings. They kind of came out of the gate maybe a little bit higher price than people thought. Just kind of
curious how you've adjusted to that or if you have at all?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I would say it's been less of an issue that we had thought. We never thought it would be a
huge issue other than the fact that having a formidable player and they certainly are formidable and respected, coming

into a market where that would impact promotional activities with Walmart, with Loblaws and others up there, that
there'd be a lot of marketing and excitement and promotional stuff.
There has been some but probably not as much as we had felt. Now we've also been helped by the fact that we've rolled
out things like gas that drives business and the economy overall in Canada has been very strong over the last few years.
They've not suffered the economy strains that we have here in the U.S. So maybe [ph] you do the math on it (39:06) but
we haven't seen a big deal.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: So have you been able to take price back up since they weren't as aggressive? Or has it stayed
pretty stable?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: No. We tend not to do that.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Yeah, okay. Last item was just on this other income line. You mentioned $22 million outside
of interest income. Was that related to like FX gains? I know you have that Mexico peso issue against the dollar.

Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with ISI Group.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Hi. Thanks. Richard, thanks for the walkthrough on the membership fee income. I did have a
follow-up there. You said the 3% really sort of gets to 6% if you try and back out the extra week in fee increase. Does
that also adjust for FX, which I presumably would have been a headwind to that year-over-year in the quarter?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: That would affect it a little more. You're right.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: So that might be another 100 bps? Should we just think of it as proportional to the business?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It's probably a little less than that. But I should have mentioned it. I always try to find
reasons here.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Okay, all right. So that, basically in local currency, membership fee income might have been
up 7%, not 6%?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It could have been. I just don't have – I need to calculate it out. But yeah certainly – there's
something, but I don't know if [ph] it really makes a dent (40:31)...
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: [ph] A whole lot. (40:31)
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: And then second on SG&A I just want to make sure I got the 9 bps of headwind, that I got that
right. The workers comp sounded like most of it was a catch-up for maybe under accrual earlier in the year. And then
there were a few other things that you said were sort of a true-up by year-end. Could you summarize, of the 9 bps how
much of it was true-up versus how much of it is actual cost of running the business ongoing?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I don't want to get that granular, not because the number's worse than I think. Somewhere
in the middle is probably the right answer. There are literally, the two big ones of course are benefits in workers' comp,
which I mentioned was 5 bps year-over-year. I know within workers' comp, first of all understand what a true up is.
You think about workers' comp, we have just the U.S. workers' comp well in excess of $100 million of incurred

expense every year. There's also what we reserve. When somebody gets injured or whatever – or was to say – was on
disability, we set a reserve based on what we think. Now to the extent it's a bad injury it might be reserve of tens of
thousands if not a few hundred thousand dollars based on anticipation over a several year period. Every quarter-end our
actuaries look at that to adjust the – what's on the balance sheet, if you will, we've expensed or reserved already.
So on top of that 100 a year of incurring items, you're also truing that at the end of every quarter correctly under GAAP
accounting. That, I think the reserve on our balance sheet at any given time just on workers comp is over $300 million.
And so a swing of $5 million or $10 million one way on actuarial changes based on what happened in last quarter of
real expenses and adjusting those things sometimes it helps you by a few million, sometimes it hurts by a few million.
And there's several large expense accruals given our size, that we try to be granular to help you understand the numbers
but again, if I had to look at last year in Q4, a few more of those moons lined up for us this year, a few of those
expenses lined up against us and probably somewhere in the middle of that 9 bps is the right number. I'd hate to go
further than that because I don't know.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: All right, fair enough. And then lastly on the CapEx. Understand that it's going up this year
with more openings. But how should we think about that number? Is there – is that number – I know you spend money
on land and everything well before the opening. So should we think about that number as proportional to a number that
might be out there in 2015? Or – in other words, if we model it out. If we're going to open 30, 35 clubs a year, is this
the run rate we use now or is this year elevated because you're going into Spain and there's like stuff going on?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I'd say more of it is the run rate than a one-time elevation. So yeah I mean I think
something in the 23 to 25 is a best guess for right now.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Right. So that makes sense with this sort of opening level.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Right. And again if it's six or seven less and we got delayed on a couple of property
purchases and we did a little less or more on depots, all those things add into that. But probably something in the –
something between two, two and a half is the right guesstimate for the next few years.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.

The next question comes from the line of Jason DeRise with UBS.
<Q - Jason A. DeRise>: Yeah, hi. It's Jason DeRise here. I just wanted to understand a bit more on the membership
income in addition to what was shared before. I guess maybe just looking forward though, what kind of – now that the
accrual base is in there and you've taken the fee increase and renewal rates are high, I mean what can be done to drive
more members per store? Is Executive Membership going to be a bigger focus now that we've done a couple years from
that fee increase? And if you can share anything in terms of the international progress in terms of membership,
obviously the renewal rates are lower than the U.S., but what can be done there? Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, first of all, I mean, what I've always been surprised at is the continued increase
penetration of Executive Membership even in countries like the U.S., which has been around for 13 or 14 years, and
Canada which has been around for 10 years. We do a better job I think in store of converting people to Executive
Membership, both when they – new signups. I remember, several years ago, 10 to 15 of every 100 signed up in our
existing warehouse in the U.S. and Canada, signed up as an Executive Membership. Now it's in the 30s and 40s. Part of
that's us being a little bit better just doing that and hopefully as we point that out, they'll see that value.
In terms of driving membership, the fact that we're getting a lot more members in some of these countries like Asia and
Australia certainly helps that as a higher percentage of our openings go to those markets. The low renewal rate is – I
remember the first few years even in the U.S. back in the mid-80s and the Canada in the late 80s, if you signed up 100
people in the first year, to get to that what was ultimately then a mature a mid-80 renewal rate would have been great.
Of course now it's a 90. In that second year maybe 70 or 72 or 73 of those hundred signed up, but then a new hundred

signed up also in year three, a higher percentage of that is 70 or 72 plus 70 or 72 of the second year's hundred. So it
kind of builds over time.
I'd say those starting renewal rates in Asia start out a little lower than that 70, sometimes in the 50s or low-60s and then
build from there. But mind you it's been somewhat a phenomena where we get a lot of press, very densely populated
cities and people coming in from a little further distance in cities where it's a little harder to travel. So I think all those
things have tended to be the reasons why. We're going to keep doing what we do as it relates to driving membership. I
think we've gotten better in our marketing activities in what we do. And so I think overall, we'll keep driving
membership the old-fashioned way in terms of opening new warehouses and certainly in less penetrated countries that
is a bigger help, giving them value. And historically we tended to raise fees about every 5, 5.5 years. And I can't
promise when it will be again, but that's what it's been for 30 years.
<Q - Jason A. DeRise>: In terms of the age of the stores in the international market and the maturity process there
obviously we're adding – you're talking about adding new stores. And new countries even. Is there anything in the
cadence of that that we should think about in terms of if we're modeling on a member per store basis on a
year-over-year basis? If there's anything that you can share there for the coming year or so compared to prior years?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I mean, it tends to be higher internationally. I think when we opened in Australia we got
off to an incredible start, our highest per share volumes ever in a country. Again, I think people around the world know
what a membership club is and we get a lot more press when we go into a country. We've had outsized numbers. It
helps when you've got five or six location in a 20 million population city and it's getting good press. And so I think
given our, the size of our whole company and the fact still 70% of our company is in the U.S. and another 10% or 12%
is in Canada that, yes, the international keeps moving the needle but moves it a little upward.
<Q - Jason A. DeRise>: And maybe just to wrap up my line of questioning on the member fees, so talking about 6% is
the clean number, maybe something closer to 7% really clean for FX for the way that it grew in the fourth quarter, how
would you consider that as a run rate? And with the new store openings, do you think it could be better than that? Or do
you think that – I guess let me let you answer how you think about that.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah, we're going to try. But I think that, again, something plus or minus a couple of
percentage points from that is probably a best guess at this point. Mind you, also there's deferred accounting. So again
I've shared examples when we open a new unit in the United States, membership signups as of opening day, which
tends to be the 8 or 12 week period prior to opening day through opening day because you've got tabling activities there
were people who come in and sign up once the parking lot you can get in and out of.
And in the most, in the best markets in the U.S., greater Northern Cal, Southern Cal, Seattle, when we've opened a new
unit it's a no-brainer success story. But you might only have 6,000 or 5,000, 5,000 to 8,000 signups or 4,000 to 8,000
signups because a lot of people are already members. They're going to come more frequently because we're closer to
them.
When you open in some of these countries you might have 20,000 to 40,000 new signups through opening day. Now
even if that's the case it takes a year for that to get into the system based on its deferred accounting because it's
basically you book that annual fee one twelfth a month. So I think again it'll trend in there over time. But on a base of
635 or 640 locations, an extra few locations internationally, again it moves the needle in the right direction as it relates
to this question, but it's not a giant mover.

consumer information that you have and begin more personalized couponing or targeted promotions versus the
standard three-and-a-half week MVMs that you're currently doing?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I would say we're closer than we've ever been but it's still going be a while. One of the
modernization things that we're doing is rewriting the membership system. Let's start with some of the basics, that the
extreme example was last year when we replatformed dot-com a year ago. Prior to that, the search engines couldn't
even crawl on the site. So we would never, -- you'd never Google us and see Costco.com. Analogous to that is the
membership and the data mining. I think that Craig has shown a little openness to our marketing people. But we're not
going to go crazy quickly for us. But there's some opportunity there. But again, as we do some things we'll let you
know it like we did with dot-com.
<Q - Charles Grom>: Okay. Fair enough. And then just to fall back on Matt's question on the balance sheet and with
$14 per share in cash and then adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of one of the lowest in retail, I guess, what's the board
waiting to see before you guys get more aggressive on the buyback? I get last year with the big dividends kind of
holding back on the buyback. But what are you waiting to see to get more aggressive?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, stay tuned to 12 weeks from now when we talk to you. We'll let you know. I mean
again I think we view our runway if you will long-term that we've got a lot of opportunity. We certainly, and I agree
with you, where even with the ramped-up CapEx we have a strong balance sheet and we'll continue to talk at quarterly
board meetings. But I really can't say a whole lot more than that at this point.

<Q - Charles Grom>: Okay. Okay. Great. And then on the 80 basis points in Fresh Foods and the 10 basis points to 25
basis points up in other three areas, can you just give us a little bit of perspective how that compared to the last quarter,
if you have it?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Why don't we go to the next question and then I'll answer it. I think I did talk about it in the
last earnings call which I have in front of me so...
<Q - Charles Grom>: Okay.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: We'll go to the next question and then I can answer that.
<Q - Charles Grom>: Okay. And then just to follow up on Chris's question earlier with regards to that price
investment. It appears that you guys weren't really necessarily offensive. It was more of a defense. I mean the fact that
your costs were going up. And so you were keeping those rotisserie chicken prices at the $4.99. Is that fair to say that
the large chunk why you saw the margin pressure in Fresh Foods?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, that was the outsized component of it, but there were a few other items within Fresh
Foods as well.
<Q - Charles Grom>: Okay. Great.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Back to your other question – I did find what I said a quarter ago. The four core categories
– this is in Q3 of 2013 – the four core categories: Food & Sundries, hardlines, softlines and Fresh Foods, each showed
lower year-over-year gross margin percents. So that compares to what I mentioned this quarter that Food & Sundries,
hardlines and softlines being up year-over-year. All four of those subcategories were lower year-over-year in Q3.
<Q - Charles Grom>: Okay. Great. All right. Thanks a lot.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Miller with William Blair.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Hi, Richard. Wanted to know whether Costco is giving consideration to having its employees
enter healthcare exchanges – going to defined contribution if you will? Additionally, if you can give us some color on
the rising healthcare costs and is it likely we'll see that continuing to run ahead of sales?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: First of all, we have no plans to change what we currently do. As it relates to continuing to
rise, the answer is probably yes. We have made a few tweaks to our plan to try to make – have the participants in the
plan make more thoughtful decisions on a few things and made some very small changes which maybe it brings down
the rate a little bit.
In each of the last three years part of the Affordable Care Act as it's transitioning in was – we estimate it was about 1 to
1.5 percentage points of increase each year. So, even when we showed an 11% or 11.5% a couple years ago
year-over-year, that 11.5% included a 1.5% from Affordable Care incrementally. And I think this is the last year of a
few of those transition items that are going in. An example would be, you have to have the same lifetime limit
irrespective of the plan. We had a different lifetime limit for part time and full time plans. We upped it as you would
expect us to do – we upped to the higher limit for both. And so there's things like that – that's part of those one and
1.5% growth items. On a sizable number to start with.
I would guess whatever it would have been, it would be a little less because of one, these annual pieces that have gone
into the Affordable Care Act that have transitioned it over three or four years now. I think this is the last year of that as
it relates to what we know now. But I've read some articles that where they've seen costs come down. And when I talk
to a few others – different industries – they don't see it -- a lot of low inflation yet either. So I don't know where those
reports are coming from. But I would guess, is it a little lower than it's run? Yes. Is it a lot lower? No.
The other thing that I think helps us on a global basis is, is the numbers I'm talking about here are U.S. We've have a lot
lower experience of these costs in all other countries because in most cases it's nationalized healthcare and expense
controlled quite a bit better as it relates to lower. And so as an increasing percentage comes from outside the U.S. that
helps us. And we get a little help from the fact that as we ramp up expansion – for you to be covered in our healthcare it
takes three to six months based on full time and part time. The fact that we're opening more units now means that
there'll be a few more people in but again that's on a very large base so that tweaks it down a little bit, but not a lot.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: On that dimension I know in year's past as your employee turnover came down, that I think
added to the rate of healthcare cost, what is the kind of employer retention year-on-year and is that a factor here too?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It's still very low. It did come down. A lot of that had to do I think when the economy hit
hard it means that the economy hasn't improved greatly. I think that probably our retention rates of employees has
continue at a low good rate in our view, because we do have a good compensation and benefits package and it's tough
out there. So I think a renewal rate overall in the U.S. is about 11%. Those numbers I'm most familiar with and after a
year it's 6% I believe. That's pretty much about how low. I think that the 11% might have been a 10% a year or two ago
at the nadir. I can be off by a percentage point here, but that's pretty much where it's been.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Okay. And a separate question. Do your buyers see much ability to trade the consumer up? I
mean really the average ticket is kind of moving with inflation it seems like at this point. But I mean are you – is your
planning for the holiday do you think you've got any ability to move it up? Usually with the upper income consumer
showing some strength in consumer confidence at least up until recently you've been able to do that. What's the outlook
now?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, we keep trying. I think we keep being successful. By the way, while the average
ticket has moved as you suggested with inflation maybe a little more or less depending on the quarter, that's
notwithstanding the fact that we've had 4 plus percent shopper frequency for five years compounding now which

compared to 1%, 1.5% compounding for each of the 20 years before that. So I think that in part tends to put downward
pressure on that number. So we're actually kind of pleased that it's held up where it is given that increase in frequency.
Also in new markets it's a lower number to start with and so that all goes into that weighted average as well. So I think
overall our numbers are holding up pretty well and, look, and mind you as merchants we're always trying to upgrade
the product. We want to save a member money, but on the best item and the biggest quantity as you might expect that
we do and so always trying to drive that. And sometimes that's because we can drive more value that way, particularly
on very competitive items.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: All right. Thanks, Richard.

Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.
<Q - Chuck E. Cerankosky>: Good morning, Richard. Regarding the venture into Spain, anything you'd point out
about those clubs that will be different from some of the others?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Nothing really.
<Q - Chuck E. Cerankosky>: Then how about -
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah, it'll be – it'll look like warehouse. I think the one thing is they'll be on one floor. As
you know in several of the very densely populated cities in Asia and even in Sydney we've got some double deck retail
facilities with two or three decks of parking on top of that or below that. In Spain our plan is to be on one level so far
but that – we could have over time but the first one will be on across.
<Q - Chuck E. Cerankosky>: And the size is in line with the corporate average?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes. The size is in line with the corporate average of new locations. I think our average per
warehouse is about 144, 143. We tend to build things in the 155 range.
<Q - Chuck E. Cerankosky>: Got you. And the real estate pipeline is ready for additional international expansion? Is
that why we're seeing this nice step-up here in the openings?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah, I mean, I think the pipeline has been built over the last couple of years there. If you
go back four or five years ago there were a few if any real estate people on the ground in many of these countries. Now
there are people on the ground in every country and that's been for the last couple of years. And so yes the pipeline is
full but it's never any easier. Sometimes when you look at the dates in these cities, it has planned opening 2016 if
everything goes well and sometimes a lot sooner but the fact is it's certainly harder than some of the smaller cities in
the United States.
<Q - Chuck E. Cerankosky>: What would you – how would you rate the prospects for additional new countries in
Europe?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I think we talked about going likely into two countries. One in 2014 and one in 2015,
and beyond that, we'll see.
<Q - Chuck E. Cerankosky>: And finally, can you give us what the gasoline sales were in fiscal 2013?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I don't know if I have that in front of me. We'll go to the next question and I'll have
somebody looking it up.
<Q - Chuck E. Cerankosky>: All right. Thanks.

And your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Matt Siler>: Hey, guys. How are you doing? It's actually Matt for Paul. I was wondering if we could talk a little
bit about SG&A. I know you kind of ran through Healthcare as an issue and some of the other things you're facing with
technology investment. But with your payroll you said – I think you said your payroll is getting better as a percentage
of costs. How do we think about SG&A for the remainder of the year? Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, look, we keep trying to bring it down. But we're not going to bring it down – we
have our own constraints on certain aspects of it like we're going to still do top-of-scale increases for our – two-thirds
of our hourly employees that are top-of-scale. We're going to not cut back, which we could easily do on certain
healthcare aspects. So we're going to do the things that we've always done. We're going to do it first and foremost by
trying to drive sales. Gas – by the way, gas deflation does hurt you a little bit. When there's inflating gas, it's a very low
gross margin business, but it's an even lower, thankfully, low SG&A business. So when you've got big gas inflation,
that seems to hurt your margin a little bit and help your SG&A conversely the other way.
So given that gas was 8% deflation in September if that continued in the next couple of months, I'll be showing you that
second column again for margin and SG&A. But that hurts it a little bit when it's deflationary. The thing that's going to
help it, first and foremost, is top line sales growth. And secondly is lower, ultimately lower structural SG&A in several
of these other countries so far that we are currently in like Asia, Mexico frankly, Australia.
<Q - Matt Siler>: Okay. Great. Thanks. I appreciate it.

Your next question comes from the line of Budd Bugatch with Raymond James.
<Q - Beryl Bugatch>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Richard, just on Asia, I think you said there was
cannibalization in Asia and I just wonder how you think about cannibalization in Asia going forward given the high
productivity of those clubs?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: We want to get more open faster, even if it's a little hurtful – even if it's a little hurtful to
cannibalization. Mind you, when you're going from five to six locations in a 20-million-population city, you might
have some cannibalization. But we've been blessed by having some units that are $250 million to $300 million plus in
some cities in Taiwan, Korea and Japan where when you open a second unit you'll take $50 million to $75 million of
that $300 million away. And the only thing that goes into your comp is that negative $50 million or $75 million for that
first year. But come second year, you've got two units that are going nicely. And so that's part of the business.
<Q - Beryl Bugatch>: And typically on the second year, or the third year, you usually start to see that first unit rebuild.
Has that been your experience so far?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: We really see it the 53rd week out and once that impact, that cannibalizing impact
anniversaries is when you'll see that rebound.
<Q - Beryl Bugatch>: So almost immediately after you get to the second year. Secondly and just lastly for me, I know
in the States we're all thinking about the government shutdown and just interested to how management thinks about
that impact on your business and if there's anything strategic you're doing because of it?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Other than scratching our head in disbelief...
<Q - Beryl Bugatch>: We're all getting bald doing that.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: The – I actually pulled our senior executives in operations, on the West Coast there's really
not seen any effect. Around D.C. is the only place where we've seen some effect downward a little bit.
<Q - Beryl Bugatch>: Okay. All right. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group.
<Q - Joseph Feldman>: Hi. Good morning, guys. I wanted to go back to the SG&A again. I had a couple of questions
just talking to some people this morning about, with the 5% comp, why not get – couldn't you get a little bit more
leverage? I know there was some incremental expense. It sounds like some true-ups, things like that. But should SG&A
had a little more leverage or how should we think about it going forward, I guess?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think the two biggest things were the fact that again, given our size and given even on a
$30 billion sales number for the quarter, $3 million, which isn't what it used to be when you're doing $100 billion a
year, $3 million of anything is a basis point swing. When you've got just a simple example of workers comp where
you're adjusting every quarter as you should for GAAP accounting actuarially a $300 million-plus tail of previous years
of workers comp issues. You've got a much bigger number adjusting in healthcare. You've got lots of other expenses.
So I think it's a combination of several of those lining up in one direction instead of some of them offsetting. There's
always going to be a range. Usually you've got half one way and half the other.
Let's see, what else was there? The fact that we've – oh 17 versus 16 weeks hurts you a little bit. Again my guess is at
the end of the day, you – we have some increased expansion efforts with opening in Spain and IT modernization. That's
a few basis points. So all those things add up. I think at the end of the day, what I was trying to convey when we look at
all the numbers is nine overstated kind of the underlying secular trend. But I don't want to suggest it was zero. It was
probably somewhere north of zero and south of five. But I don't know what the number is.
<Q - Joseph Feldman>: Got it. That's helpful. Thanks for that. And then just another question as far as holiday season
goes, any changes to how you're approaching this year versus last year? Opening, closing different times of events,
anything like that we should think about?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Nothing.
<Q - Joseph Feldman>: Okay. And then the one last thing I wanted to ask you guys was just, I know you gave us the
monthly trends so we kind of know where things are at. But want to ask anyway, any changes in sort of purchasing
habits from the core consumer in terms of surprises? When you've maybe launched a new, some of those special items
that you have that things either sold better or worse or than you may have expected? And the way people are
purchasing? Is there anything to comment on?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think – I continue to be pleasantly surprised and happy that our frequency is where it is
with a four in front of it. Recognizing some of that's gas expansion in Canada. Some of its new markets where we
opened new units. But overall, no.
<Q - Joseph Feldman>: Okay. Thanks, guys. Good luck with this quarter.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Why don't we take two last questions.

<Q - Tiffany A. Kanaga>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask how do you think small business
owners are feeling right now? What's the sentiment that you're perceiving?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I'm not an economist and – we haven't seen a big change in our small business
members in terms of their sales trends. So it's hard to say. I don't have a good answer to that one.

And your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin with Wolfe Research.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Hey, guys. Thanks for slipping me in. And I know a lot of questions have been asked so I
just wanted to talk about the magnitude of the price investments in Fresh Food next year. I guess it could vary to some
degree on what happens competitively but from what you can control do you anticipate a continuation of the trend
there?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I can't really give you any direction going forward other than we're going to be
aggressive. It's in our blood. Again, good news is, is that to the extent that certain commodity prices are coming down,
we kept our prices down when commodity – those underlying raw material costs skyrocketed. Now that they're coming
back, it hopefully will give us a fairer margin in some of those areas where we have really hit ourselves hard. And so
hopefully under that scenario, if that's a net positive to margin. But we're going to keep doing what we're doing in terms
of being aggressive. And I do want to say while we certainly aren't cavalier about our competition we think our
toughest competitor is ourselves and we're going to keep driving that.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: So just to clarify if I heard you right that you're going to be pretty aggressive but – and we've
noted this in our research, there's a chance that the wholesale prices could come down faster than what happens at
retail. So you actually think it could be a potentially a net benefit given that dynamic. Is that a good read of what you
were saying?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Potentially, and again, I'm using a data sample of one item here, the chicken. And certainly
there's a few other – a lot of those in Fresh Foods are like that because if you recall a few years ago we were talking
about Food Court margins got hammered because the cost of cheese skyrocketed. And needless to say we sell a lot of
pizza and so – but we gave that as an anecdotal example of where we're going to hold the price even though – because
it's such a value proposition. And so there are a few of those. On general merchandise subject to competitive challenges
out there it rains on all of us – all the competition out there. And when underlying costs are coming down a little bit
there's – if there's pressure out there we probably are more of it than others but a little of it we'll retain.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Okay. All right. Well, listen, thank you for taking my questions. Appreciate it.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Sure.
