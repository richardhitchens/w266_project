Now, let me turn the call over to Pete.
Merrill A. Miller, Jr.
Thank you, Loren, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, National Oilwell Varco announced third quarter 2013
earnings of $1.49 per share on revenues of $5.7 billion. Included in this number were pre-tax transaction charges of $10
million and a pre-tax gain of $102 million from a litigation settlement. Netting these out provided a net income of $573
million or $1.34 per fully diluted share. Jeremy will provide more color on these results later in the call.
Additionally, we've reported new capital equipment orders for the quarter of $3.31 billion, resulting in a quarter ending
record capital equipment backlog of $15.15 billion. This reflects the continued preference for the industry-leading high
technology products provided by National Oilwell Varco. New orders for the year have surpassed $9.5 billion. I would
like to thank all of our employees worldwide for their continued dedication to excellence as we serve the oil and gas
industry. I will come back later on the call to add some color on our operations, but at this time, we'll turn the call over
to Clay.
Clay C. Williams
Thank you, Pete, and good morning. We've long discussed four big trends that we expect to continue to shape National
Oilwell Varco's destiny over the next decade. One, the build-out of a fleet of floating drilling rigs to explore and
develop deepwater frontiers opened by technology developments of the past 20 years. Two, the blossoming of floating
production systems which we expect to produce most deepwater discoveries. Three, the replacement of old jackup rigs
with better, safer, new jackup rigs. And four, the steady progression of unconventional shale technologies into new
onshore plays overseas, which will continue to drive steady retooling of land rigs and spur demand for other oilfield
technologies.
This morning, I'd like to update you on what we see within each of these four. How they drove our third quarter results
and how they're shaping our strategies. Demand for floating rigs has remained high, underpinned by, we believe, strong
driller economics on these investments, good day rates, low cost rigs, quick delivery and available financing.
We sold another six deepwater drilling packages into newbuild projects during the third quarter, bringing our total for
the year to 22. Strong floater demand contributed to Rig Technology's third quarter capital equipment orders of $3.3
billion, our second highest level ever.
Our year-to-date orders totaled $9.5 billion through three quarters. And we're not done. We expect fourth quarter orders
to be good, maybe great, but down a little from Q3's grand performance. There are many new potential projects under
discussion, but we know the holidays may interfere with contract signings and sometimes we just run out of calendar.
Nevertheless, Q4 is off to a solid start and should wrap up an extraordinary year for orders.
We recognize offshore rig orders are cyclical, exhibiting periods of diminished demand from time-to-time, but we
expect deepwater orders to remain good more years than not for the next several. The reason for this is that we see the
opening of deepwater provinces by new technology as presenting an unprecedented opportunity to the oil and gas
industry. One that requires the unique, sophisticated drilling tools National Oilwell Varco and our shipyard partners
provide.
The engine driving this demand, the possibility of monetizing billions of barrels of oil beneath the world's deepest
oceans, is powerful. Technology has literally opened up two-thirds of the planet to oil and gas exploration, which
requires a substantial fleet of floating drilling rigs. This leads me to the second major trend. Once oil companies
discover deepwater hydrocarbons, they will produce these and we believe floating production systems will emerge as a
preferred method in most deepwater basins.
Over the past few years, we have invested in unique products required for floating production systems, including
flexible risers, turret mooring systems, specialized deck machinery, pumps, sand handling and production equipment

and composite piping solutions. Category-leading products, superb project management skills and close shipyard
relationships, position NOV extraordinarily well to emerge as a preferred supplier of floating production solutions.
FPSO construction projects have historically had a pretty bad record. Most, in fact nearly all, are late and over budget.
Our strategy is to bring configurable designs and modern manufacturing techniques to this industry, analogous to what
we have done successfully in the drilling rig construction world.
We are making steady progress. Many projects began to translate into orders this year. In fact, our APL turret mooring
business, expects to post record orders this year. Project margins are rising modestly as we work to standardize
component designs to reduce engineering and commercial risk. Additionally, we will mark the startup of our new
Flexibles plant in Brazil this quarter, which will lead our NKT Flexibles business to new records in the future.
While it will take to develop, we believe that FPSOs will create the next major growth leg for National Oilwell Varco.
The third trend affecting National Oilwell Varco, jackup rig demand, has been white-hot lately. As operators seek to
replace aging fleets, 54% of the market of jackup fleet is more than 30 years old and as NOCs in Mexico, Saudi Arabia
and elsewhere seek to ramp shallow water production to offset onshore production declines.
In the third quarter, we sold 13 jackup packages, bringing our total so far this year to 42 jackups. We expect that fourth
quarter demand will remain very strong as well to complete a truly brilliant year for jackup demand. Generally, we see
strong demand looking to establish yards in Singapore, but Chinese yards are pursuing projects aggressively, including
offering attractive financing and entrepreneurs are signing up with them.
The fourth major trend driving our fortunes at National Oilwell Varco is the proliferation of technologies enabling
unconventional shale production. Shale technologies, or more accurately unconventional technologies, because these
are techniques being applied to enhance production from all sorts of rocks, are positive for virtually everything NOV
does and sells. Profitable unconventional developments require new, modern rigs capable of drilling horizontally.
Specialized premium drill pipe, which must be coated and carefully inspected, mud motors, and bits are all needed to
drill horizontally. Frac fleets, flowline equipment, frac heads, coiled tubing and coiled tubing units are all needed to
hydraulically stimulate unconventional reservoirs. Composite tubing and coated and thoroughly inspected OCTG is
required to transport and produce fluids, drill cuttings, and water and waste management technologies are applied to
minimize environmental impact.
NOV is the leading provider of almost all the major hardware and technology required for unconventional shale
success. And as we survey our products and services in this realm, we see two unconventional production markets at
different stages of evolution. First, North America, the birth place of unconventional shale technologies, appears to be
evolving most rapidly towards a more industrial efficiency-based approach. Rig productivity and well cost management
are top of mind for E&P customers, and while much that NOV does enhances and enables such efficiencies, this isn't
100% good news for us or our oilfield service peers.
By that I mean, the E&P customers are focusing on supply chain management, read price, for their drilling programs. A
few years ago, dozens of speculative shale plays were being probed. Today, these are coalescing down to a handful of
the most profitable. So, even in a flat rig count environment, the most active basins steadily become more competitive
as oilfield service companies reposition their assets and buy their way into the game in this handful through
discounting. And the least active basins become more competitive as companies get desperate and discount to win
dwindling work.
The winning strategy in this knife fight must therefore focus on adding value, i.e., reducing well costs, increasing
productivity, enhancing efficiency. NOV seeks to provide differentiated products and services that do just that and our
unique positioning enables us to drive value for our customers throughout the oilfield food chain. Much that we make is
consumed at a steady rate by rigs and frac fleets operating 24x7, near redline RPMs in these plays.
Our outlook for North America in 2014 is cautiously positive. Given the strong oil-driven wellhead cash flows to E&P
companies and the relatively low reinvestment rates of the past year, if oil remains near $100, we believe we'll see
more spending in 2014 and NOV is well-positioned to enjoy an activity uptick in North America. This thesis should be
helped by a large inventory of drill sites across North America with minimal geologic risk and steadily rising takeaway

capacity which tends to enhance producer cash flow at the wellhead.
The second major shale market encompasses basically the rest of the world, outside North America. Here is where
infrastructure is less developed. We view this market as considerably less evolved with tremendous potential and work
to be done that will likely span a generation. It is not coincidental that the shale revolution was born on the continent
with two-thirds of the world's working rigs and the highest level of geologic understanding. Shale plays,
unconventional plays are by definition marginally economic, requiring established efficient oil services infrastructure
capable of birthing a well, the cost of which is marginally exceeded by the value of the hydrocarbons produced from it,
at some reasonable expected commodity price.
Carrying the unconventional shale style of play, built on finely-tuned well construction costs into regions with less
developed oilfield infrastructure will predictably encounter headwinds and delays. After all, it took the industry here in
Texas a couple of decades to figure it out. I would submit that one of the most interesting economic opportunities in
this scenario would be for a company that actually builds out oilfield services infrastructure, a company like NOV.
Hunger for infrastructure for new modern rigs and drill pipe and downhole tools helped fuel our third quarter orders
and results. Land rig sales jumped with more than two dozen sold in the quarter, almost all overseas and most going
into more sophisticated horizontal drilling applications, employing unconventional techniques. In particular, we saw
strong demand from Latin America, where Mexico is seeking to add new modern land rigs and where Argentina has
lifted duties on rig imports for the next several months.
The Middle East, Russia and the Far East also saw a strong demand for land rigs. Our overseas expansion projects
continued to strengthen our capabilities as we make strategic investments in manufacturing and service infrastructure in
promising international markets. NOV is uniquely positioned to provide the tools required to bring the shale revolution
to these new areas, an opportunity that we remain extremely excited about.
The evolution of the vast international shale market will shape NOV's fortunes for decades. Last quarter, we talked
about some of the delivery challenges we faced in our Rig Technology segment. We are making good progress against
these and saw margins improve slightly, but we continue to wrestle with very high volumes moving through our
system, and with record levels of installation and commissioning activity in shipyards. Strong orders continue to load
up our manufacturing plants, filling up the capacity we've been adding aggressively, which requires we continue to
outsource more and to spend a little more than we'd like to expedite equipment.
As a consequence, we perceive challenges continuing but expect steady progress quarter by quarter. We've also made
progress on pricing and commercial terms on new projects flowing into the backlog, although it will be a while before
consolidated segment margins reflect this. Notably, we continue to face a very soft market for pressure pumping
equipment in North America and rising FPSO product sales are somewhat dilutive to the segment's EBIT margin.
Reviewing our progress, I am again reminded of how very fortunate we are to have such talented professionals at work
executing our business. Our Rig Technology segment by itself will generate over $11 billion in revenues this year at
EBIT margins north of 20%. This is nearly double the size of all of NOV when we first merged in 2005 and would rank
midway through last year's Fortune 500 list with far better than average profitability of most public companies. This
accomplishment would not be possible without an extraordinarily talented team and we are grateful for the tremendous
results that they and all NOV employees produce. Many, many thanks to all of you.
Now, I'm going to turn it over to Jeremy for a more detailed review of the third quarter.
Jeremy D. Thigpen
Thanks, Clay. National Oilwell Varco generated earnings of $1.49 per fully diluted share in its third quarter of 2013 on
$5.7 billion in revenues. Excluding $10 million in pre-tax transaction charges and $102 million in pre-tax gains
resulting from the settlement of an outstanding legal claim, third quarter 2013 earnings were $1.34 per fully diluted
share up $0.01 per share from the second quarter of 2013 and down $0.18 per share on – or 12% from the third quarter
of 2012.

Sales of $5.7 billion improved 2% sequentially largely driven by a resumption of activity in Canada post breakup and
grew 7% year-over-year despite a 3% year-over-year reduction in the number of drilling rigs worldwide. Excluding
transaction charges from all periods and the gains resulting from the outstanding legal claim in the third quarter of
2013, operating profit for the quarter was $853 million, up 3% sequentially and down 10% from the third quarter of last
year.
Operating margins on this basis were 15% for the third quarter of 2013 compared to 14.7% for the second quarter of
2013 and 17.8% for the third quarter of last year. Sequentially, operating profit flow-through or leverage was 31%.
Now, let's turn to our second operating results. The Rig Technology segment generated revenues of $2.8 billion in the
third quarter, flat sequentially and up 12% compared to the third quarter of 2012. Operating profit for the segment was
$606 million and operating margins were 21.3%, up 60 basis points from the prior quarter.
On the Q2 conference call, we expected Rig Tech revenues to decrease in the low single-digit percentage range, as
continued declines in the sale of intervention and stimulation equipment and somewhat lower project revenues would
more than offset continued growth in our aftermarket business. Well, as expected, revenues for intervention and
stimulation equipment declined an additional 13% sequentially. However, our Q3 Rig Tech revenues were slightly
improved from Q2 as revenues out of backlog which were flat at $2.1 billion and individual component sales, both
outperformed our expectations.
And albeit at a slightly slower pace, which was simply a function of timing, our aftermarket business continued to grow
to a new quarterly record of $627 million, which represented 22% of total Rig Tech revenues in the quarter. Needless to
say, we're excited by the fact that our aftermarket business continues to grow both in total dollars and as a percentage
of our total Rig Tech revenues.
Turning to Rig Tech margins, we were pleased to see the 60 basis sequential uplift, as we have successfully avoided
some, but not all, of the cost overrun that impacted us in Q1 and Q2. Still, we continue to face the same three
challenges that we detailed in the Q2 conference call, including one, the stress on our supply chain. Two, product mix
with continuing declines in our North American land related businesses and three, the incremental expense associated
with numerous strategic growth initiatives and capacity expansions.
However, with each passing quarter, we become increasingly more confident that we are taking the appropriate steps in
each area to further expand our already industry-leading margins. From a supply chain standpoint, everyone is working
hard to bring our new manufacturing capacity online, which will ultimately lead to operational efficiencies. However,
it's important to remember that we are continuing to secure orders at a very rapid pace.
As Clay mentioned, this year alone, we have already secured 22 floaters and 42 jackups. It's also important to
remember that the lead time for jackups is 6 months to 8 months shorter than the lead time for floaters, which applies
additional pressure on our plants. Still, with our new capacity and our skilled and dedicated team of employees, we
have complete confidence that we are up for the challenge.
From a product mix standpoint, we do not expect to see any near-term meaningful orders for new frac spreads, coiled
tubing units or land rigs in the North American market, but we know that our customers are utilizing and therefore
consuming their existing equipment, and will ultimately need to return to us for repairs or to order complete
replacements.
From an expense standpoint, many of our large strategic growth initiatives and capacity expansions are nearing
completion, which will help to alleviate some of our recent margin pressures, but we still have some large projects that
have yet to conclude, including the new flexible pipe manufacturing facility in Brazil, a new riser manufacturing
facility in Brazil and a new rig building facility in Russia, that will all carryover into 2014.
Additionally, we will likely add to our footprint in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as the outlook for that market remains
very positive, and local content requirements are ever-increasing.

And while not previously referenced as one of our three challenges to expanding margins, the new contractual terms
that we implemented in Q2 for our offshore equipment components and packages will over time help us to expand
margins. As revenues from this new higher-priced backlog begin to start flowing out later next year. So, overall, we are
clearly moving into right direction, but it will take some time to return our margins to the 24% level that we have
established as our target for this segment.
Now, let's transition to the Q3 capital equipment orders and our resulting backlog. As evidenced by the $3.3 billion in
new orders, industry demand for floaters and jackups remain very strong. And our customers continue to recognize
National Oilwell Varco for our industry-leading technology, our proven track record of delivering projects on time, and
our unmatched ability to support our equipment globally. For the quarter, we booked five drillships, one semi and 13
jackups. Of the six floaters that we booked in Q3, we secured the subsea BOP stacks on four, plus two spare stacks.
And of the 13 total jackups that we booked in Q3, we secured five of the stacks.
In addition to the strong orders offshore, we were awarded a number of international land rig packages both drilling and
workover destined for Mexico, Argentina, the UAE, Indonesia and Australia. Rounding out the order intake story, we
secured a number of sizeable orders for our NKT products including flowline and riser, reconfirming our belief that we
are still on pace to book roughly $1 billion in flexibles and new floating production equipment for the year.
All of these new orders were partly offset by revenues out of backlog of almost $2.1 billion, resulting in a book-to-bill
of almost 1.6 times, and another record quarter ending backlog of $15.2 billion, which was up 9% from Q2, which by
the way was the previous record, and up 30% year-over-year. Of the total backlog, approximately 92% is offshore and
94% is destined for international markets. We expect a little over $2 billion to flow out of backlog in Q4.
Looking into the fourth quarter of 2013, we expect orders for new offshore drilling equipment packages and floating
production equipment to remain strong. And we hope to see continued demand for new land drilling rigs in Latin
America and the Middle East and perhaps some workover rigs in Russia.
While we do not yet know if we will see a fourth consecutive quarter of new orders above $3 billion, we have enjoyed
a very strong start to the quarter and we're in the middle of some very encouraging and constructive discussions that
could soon materialize into new orders. However, as you all well know, timing is everything. If we do not receive the
signed contract and the down payment by December 31, we will not book it in this quarter.
As of now, we're planning for Rig Technology revenues to increase in the mid-single-digit percentage range, as
continued declines in the sale of intervention and stimulation equipment will be more than offset by an increase in
land-related revenue associated with our Q3 bookings, higher offshore project-related revenues, as we help the
shipyards to get back on schedule and continued growth in our aftermarket business.
And although we realized some slight improvements in Q3, we remain cautious about Q4 margins, sticking to our
previous guidance of 20% to 21%, as Q4 is expected to be the busiest quarter for installation and commissioning work
in the history of NOV.
Transitioning to Petroleum Services & Supplies, the segment posted revenues of $1.8 billion, up 3% sequentially and
up 5% year-over-year. Operating profit improved 7% sequentially to $324 million and operating margins were 17.9%,
up 50 basis points from the second quarter of 2013.
On the Q2 call, we guided for revenues in this segment to improve in a low to mid-single-digit percentage range,
primarily driven by increasing activity in Canada as it rebounded from breakup. We also forecasted margins to remain
relatively flat, as many of our groups were or are still actively integrating acquisitions that were consummated late last
year or earlier this year. Well, as it turned out, our revenue guidance was spot on, however, the source of the revenue
was somewhat surprising. As expected, Canada was the primary driver of the improvement but we were pleased to
finally experience some growth in the U.S. market, which posted an 8% sequential gain.
From a margin perspective, the quarter played out a little better than expected as well with 33% leverage or
flow-through on the 3% sequential increase in revenue. As we enter the fourth quarter of 2013, we believe Petroleum
Services & Supplies segment sales will improve in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range as Canadian drilling

activity reaches its seasonal highs and we benefit from some end of year project sales into international markets. We
believe that growth in these regions will be partially offset by a U.S. market that typically slows during the holiday
season. Still, since we've right-sized our businesses in this segment, we expect margins to move modestly higher on the
incremental revenue.
The Distribution & Transmission segment posted revenues of $1.3 billion, up almost 4% sequentially and up 2%
compared to Q3 of last year. Operating profit dollars improved 10% sequentially to $78 million and were flat as
compared to Q3 of 2012, and operating margins improved 30 basis points from Q2 to 5.8%. Like PS&S, we forecasted
revenue within the Distribution & Transmission segment to improve in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range,
again primarily driven by increasing activity in Canada. This occurred as expected. However, we were very pleased to
see continued growth in our international operations which posted a 13% sequential improvement on top of the 9% gain
that we posted from Q1 to Q2. We also suggested that segment margins would likely remain fairly flat. However, the
incremental volume helped margins to expand in Q3 to 5.8%.
Looking into the fourth quarter of 2013, we expect Distribution & Transmission group revenues to decline in the
low-single-digit percentage range as increasing activity in Canada will be more than offset by reductions in the U.S.
where the holiday season will result in fewer billing days in the quarter. As a result of the slightly lower revenues, we
will likely experience some margin erosion as well in Q4.
On a topic of distribution, I'd like to briefly cover two important and exciting topics. First, the integration of Wilson
and CE Franklin is progressing exceptionally well with facility consolidations and ERP implementations proceeding as
planned. Second, on September 24, we announced the company's Board of Directors had authorized management to
explore a plan to spin off NOV's Distribution business from the remainder of the company, creating two standalone
publically traded corporations.
As Pete mentioned in the press release, we believe the company's Distribution business now has the size and scale to
operate as a standalone world-class distribution company. And as a standalone entity, we believe that distribution will
be better positioned for future growth because one, it can more aggressively pursue opportunities outside of the
upstream oil and gas space. Two, it will not be competing for capital with higher margin, higher return businesses
within NOV. And three, the separation will remove any conflicts that currently exist between distribution and NOV's
manufacturing competitors, which will open up opportunities to sell products to NOV's competitors and to market those
competitors' products through its distribution network.
In addition to being a great opportunity for the Distribution business, we also believe that the proposed spin will help to
highlight the remaining portion of NOV as a technology and manufacturing company that is focused on designing,
manufacturing, delivering and then inspecting, servicing and supporting the most advanced, robust and reliable
equipment in the industry. Needless to say, we're excited about the opportunities for both businesses. If approved, we
would expect to close the transaction in the second quarter of 2014.
Now let's turn to National Oilwell Varco's consolidated third quarter 2013 income statement. Gross margins improved
20 basis points sequentially to 23.8%. SG&A increased $8 million sequentially, but as a percentage of revenue SG&A
remained unchanged from Q2 at 8.8%. Transaction costs primarily related to the Robbins & Myers acquisition totaled
$10 million in the quarter, which were more than offset by a $102 million gain, associated with the settlement of some
outstanding litigation. Interest expense in the quarter declined $4 million sequentially to $26 million, largely
attributable to the launching of our commercial paper program.
Due our strong financial condition, a favorable market outlook, our leading market position, and a track record of solid
execution, we were able to secure top ratings from both Moody's and Standard & Poor's, which enabled us to
meaningfully reduce our already low borrowing costs, through the conversion of existing bank debt to commercial
paper.
Equity income in our voestalpine JV was $13 million, down $2 million sequentially, as the plant was temporarily shut
down for its annually scheduled maintenance. We expect equity income for the JV to decline even further in Q4, as
demand for drill pipe and therefore, green tube in the U.S. will continue to be somewhat muted.

Other expense for the quarter was $15 million, which represented a $28 million delta sequentially, but is more
consistent with historical trend. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 30.8%, which was just slightly lower
than Q2. Unallocated expenses and eliminations on our supplemental segment schedule was $155 million in the third
quarter. That's up $19 million sequentially on higher volumes of intersegment business. Depreciation and amortization
was $191 million, up $1 million from the second quarter, and EBITDA, excluding transaction charges, and the gain
from the legal settlement was $1 billion or 18.4% of sales.
Turning to the balance sheet, National Oilwell Varco's September 30, 2013 balance sheet employed working capital
excluding cash and debt of $7.2 billion, that's down $78 million from the second quarter, as we, for the second
consecutive quarter, realized a slight sequential reduction in inventory. As importantly, we also experienced a
turnaround in customer financing, which improved by $378 million sequentially, as prepayments and milestone
invoicing on major projects outpaced costs incurred.
Current and long-term debt net of cash was $1 billion at the end of the quarter versus $1.8 billion at the end of the
second quarter with $3.7 billion in debt offset by $2.7 billion in cash. Of the $2.7 billion in cash, only 11% of the
balance was in the U.S. at September 30. Cash flow from operations was $1 billion for the third quarter, which was an
all-time quarterly record surpassing the old record of $912 million, which was in Q2 of 2011.
During the quarter, we paid down debt by $371 million, made cash tax payments of $218 million, made dividend
payments totaling $111 million and we spent $164 million in CapEx bringing our year-to-date CapEx spending to $484
million. We expect CapEx spending to increase slightly in Q4 to finish the year just under $700 million in total.
Now, let me turn it back to Pete.
Merrill A. Miller, Jr.
Thanks, Jeremy. And I think both Clay and Jeremy have really given you a very comprehensive overview of both our
financials and our operational situation. So, I'm just going to make a couple of real brief comments. First, as you take a
look at catalysts that I think are going to project out over the next two or three years, I'd keep my eye on a couple of
international plays. I think number one will be Russia. I think the Russians are going to be very aggressively doing
things the next few years.
We have felt that way for a long time and the consequence of that is that we started building a plant over in Russia and
we're going to be prepared to be able to really take advantage of that as we move into the latter half of 2014 and the
early part of 2015.
I think another area that's going to be very exciting and certainly you should keep your eye on will be Mexico. You've
had the change of the laws down there. I think as we move into the rest of the year, you'll have a constitutional
amendment hopefully and then you'll have the laws that'll come out in the first quarter. I think that's going to really
open up a tremendous area for a lot of the service companies and in particular National Oilwell Varco. So, those are
two areas I'd keep my eye on.
Third one for us and Clay mentioned it in his comments is China. I think as you take a look at China and especially the
aggressiveness of the shipyards over there, we're uniquely positioned to be able to take advantage of that and to help
those shipyards and add the legitimacy that they need, to be able to go out and increase the business. So, I think that's
going to be a very positive catalyst for us as we continue to move forward.
And then finally, the old standby is Brazil. Brazil is very important to us today. But I think we're going to move into
another plateau or not plateau but another tier if you will, which is going to be the production in the FPSO and the
flexibles. As we bring our flexible plant online, as we take a look at some of the different engineering ideas we have in
FPSOs that Clay motioned earlier, I think Brazil is going to be a very, very positive area for us. So, if I'm looking into
the future, I'm really keeping my eyes on those. I could go on and I could talk about the Middle East, I could talk about
both coasts of Africa. But the point is, there is going to be a lot of international catalysts out there, I believe, that are
going to help drive our business over the next few years.

So, with those brief comments, Paulette, I'd like to open it up to questions that any of our listeners might have.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes
from Jim Crandell from Cowen. Please go ahead.
<Q - James D. Crandell>: Good morning, guys. Great quarter, great orders.
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: Thanks, Jim.
<A>: Thanks.
<Q - James D. Crandell>: Pete, first question, could you talk to how the new Brazilian yards are progressing in terms
of their building rigs and how this might affect the delivery of rig equipment packages from NOV?
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: Sure, Jim. Actually the Brazilian yards are we think moving along very, very well. We've
– we're in the process of doing some – a lot of different work down there today. We're basically talking about four
different yards that we're involved with. Now, Jim, by definition, the deliveries are going to be slower in Brazil.
They – when you look at the Koreans, I mean we're getting those rigs out much, much faster, but even the Koreans, if
you go back to the early part of this decade, had a harder time. You got to get on that learning curve. And that's going
to happen in these yards. And so the revenue that we actually have in backlog for these orders will have a much slower
velocity coming out of backlog than we will have, for instance, for something coming out of one of the Korean or
Singaporean yards. But overall, it's been very positive. We're seeing good things down there and progress is being
made every day.
<Q - James D. Crandell>: Okay. Good. Clay, question for you. Can you talk about some of the cost reduction
initiatives you've put through since you became COO and can you also talk to how these new facilities coming on will
impact Rig Tech margins?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: You bet, Jim. We've had a lot of activity and a lot of progress in Rig Technology this past
quarter and really continuing through the year, specifically around adding capacity. A lot of those initiatives we
launched a couple years ago and they are designed to be able to let NOV meet the needs of our customers with all these
– with these orders flowing in.
And so, as you can imagine, they've been a little disruptive to our production schedule. Those are continuing
week-by-week, quarter-by-quarter, we're making progress and as we get those set. We can expect to see benefits from
them.
Probably the main initiative underway right now in Rig Technology is to get through this first group of rigs. I think we
talked about this a little bit on the last call. But the rigs that we're building today and the rigs that we're delivering now
and through the next couple of quarters, really are new designs or new rig floor layouts. We are satisfying new class
requirements in the Post-Macondo era, ABS 2012, DNV, other class requirements. And so in a lot of ways, the rigs that
we built from 2005 to 2010, 2011 were different designs, and we're kind of – we've lost a lot of little learning curve
effects on those.
So in terms of margin progression over the next several quarters, a lot will hinge upon getting the engineering
completed on these new rig designs, actually getting them constructed in the shipyards and getting them out the door
and as we make the second and third and fourth copies of those same rig designs, I think that's where you're really
going to see the benefits flow through. It's really pretty much a repeat of what we saw in the 2006, 2007, 2008 era. And
so, we're very confident of how this plays out.

Some other things we have underway. We're doing a lot to ease some of the congestion in some of our plants. So, for
example, we're moving some land BOP products for example out of our BOP plant and moving those to a different
operation to free up more bandwidth within that plant to be able to handle the extraordinarily high volumes moving
through there. We've got plans to also move our rubber components out of that particular plant as well. And so – and
that's just one operation, I'd say across the board lots of things going on manufacturing wise to make our business more
efficient.
<Q - James D. Crandell>: Okay. Thank you. And one quick final one for you, Pete. You had a substantial increase in
your dividend earlier this year. Can you review with us your current thinking about how you are viewing the dividend?
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: Well, Jim, we doubled the dividend in May. And what we want to be able to do in this
company is continue to increase the dividend on a fairly systematic basis, where we want to return money to our
shareholders, we think the dividend is absolutely the best policy. We made a very significant jump in May, but our
Board is committed to continue to try to increase the dividend as we move forward, and I think you'll see that happen.
Whether or not I'd tell you we'll double it, that's – that's a little bit different, but at the end of the day, we're going to
continue to try to increase our dividend to return what we can from the shareholder in that regard.
<Q - James D. Crandell>: Okay. Thanks very much.

Our next question comes from Jeff Tillery from Tudor Pickering. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: Hi, Jeff.
<A - Loren Singletary>: Good morning.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: On the – the spinoff of the Distribution business, I think it makes a lot of sense strategically. I have
gotten a fair number of questions, just kind of, was this part of the plan all along in terms of scaling the business up? A
little bit of confusion just around purchasing two of those businesses last year and then spinning them out so quickly.
So, just interested to hear your color around that.
<A - Loren Singletary>: Jeff, this is Loren. And it was not the plan initially. What we really did there is, we had the
opportunity to consolidate from a strategic standpoint, the upstream Distribution business in North America and around
the world. And once we started the integration process, it became apparent that the stars had aligned and that we had
the critical mass to actually have a company that, standalone, could be world-class in its own right.
And so that was really the genesis of why we did that. It was not because of the initial purchase of Wilson and CE
Franklin because those are targets that we've looked at for many, many years, but to add value to our shareholders, we
think this is something that's going to be very important going forward and just another way that we can return capital
to our existing shareholders.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: And then my second question is just on the PS&S consumables business here in North America.
Are you seeing anything change on the order front there? Or do you think we're going through something
constructurally different in terms of the way your customers manage inventories?
<A - Loren Singletary>: Yeah. I think, I think it's probably more the latter there, Jeff. We are seeing the kind of
inventory overhang come down, but it's not really changing customers' buying habits. As Clay mentioned in his
remarks, our customers have consolidated into a handful of basins. All of our competitors who are supplying them with
similar products have consolidated in those basins as well, so our customers have ready access to supply. And so what
we're seeing now is they're being really more efficient in the management of their supply chain and they are only

ordering products when they need them as opposed to ordering them for additional inventory and so it's almost kind of
a hand-to-mouth approach that we're seeing today. Until we see some more rigs and kind of spreading out into some
more basins, it'll probably be like that for the foreseeable future.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Yeah. I think we overshot inventories a little bit a couple years ago when the supply chain
was very tight and deliveries were months out. Our customers tended to double order and over order a little bit when
the rig counts started creeping down. They took delivery on those inventories and so that's – we've ended up with this
overhang that we're working through. I can't tell you when we're going to get through it, but we do know day by day
they're chipping away at it.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: It's going to be tough to calibrate if we're in a flattish rig count world, we're still consuming drill
pipe. We're still using your products and services. And at some point, we're going to see an increase in that without
necessarily an associated increase in rig count. So, I just didn't know if you guys were seeing anything turn yet?
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: I don't think we're seeing a turn yet. I mean Q3 was promising. We did see an uptick in
the U.S. Q4 we expect to kind of tick down as I mentioned just really more the holiday season than anything.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Couple of things that head-faked us a little bit, but broadly speaking, we don't see the turn
just yet, so probably sometime hopefully in 2014.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Thanks, Jeff.

Operator
Our next question comes from Jud Bailey from ISI Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jud E. Bailey>: Thanks. Good morning. A follow-up on some of the comments, Clay, you made regarding some
of the new design rigs that will be coming out of the yard here soon and getting those behind you. Could you give us a
little more color, are those going to be largely delivered in 2014 and be done by 2015 or can you give us a little more
color on the timing of those delivers?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Yeah, they're being delivered throughout – that's exactly right, through 2014 and into 2015,
these new class designs. The real benefit of all this work is that once you build that first rig, you've get all the
engineering done. You have all the lessons learned through the first copy of it. You apply those lessons and this is what
I think our team is extraordinarily good at, is capturing those lessons and benefiting from them on the next copy. So, it's
the second and third copies that you really start to see the benefit. That's exactly what we saw in 2008, 2009, and 2010,
as we kind of got deeper into that way, we started seeing a lot of positives and a lot of efficiency gains.
Those were in contrast, candidly, to issues and problems we faced earlier in that buildup when you're making the first
copy. So that learning curve effect is well-established and we're looking for to benefiting from it as we get into back
half of next year and into 2015.
<Q - Jud E. Bailey>: Okay. And then my follow-up would be, my understanding is several contractors right now are,
for their next few newbuilds, are actually looking at new designs or enhanced designs. Do you take a little bit different
strategy in taking the next – when looking at the next generation given some of the problems you've had, do you take
any pricing strategy and what not?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: We do. I mean we try as best we can to factor all this in, but it's – when you are building
something for the first time, you are always going to face some challenges that are a little bit unexpected. And I would
stress, we encourage our customers to stick with proven designs. It really I think reduces the cost and risk of their
newbuild programs.

it, but I may have missed it. Do you have a revenue out of backlog number updated for 2014?

Our next question comes from Brad Handler from Jefferies. Please, go ahead.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: Good morning.
<Q - Brad Handler>: I guess I was, the last question was one I was going to ask as well. So, maybe, Jeremy, you can
fill it in a little bit. So, the revenue out of backlog for 2014, sorry, I'm not looking at my notes, has it been roughly $8
billion for 2014 and then how much would be in 2015?
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: That's probably about right. That's probably right, Brad.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Okay. Got it. And then do you have a 2015 reference?
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: No, I don't think so, yeah.
<A - Loren Singletary>: 2015 and beyond, so in the $5 billion....
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Yeah.
<A - Loren Singletary>: $5 billion range.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Based on what we have today.
<A - Loren Singletary>: Yeah.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Okay. Okay. Maybe I have a multi-part follow-up, but it's, I think it's all kind of in the same
context and it's coming back to Rig Tech margins. We've had a conversation, you've helped us in understanding kind of
your challenges and I – and we appreciate that. The – how – the path to getting back to the 24% margin, I mean, I
would certainly appreciate it if you – does it happen at some point in 2014 or what are the challenges to having that
happen at some point in 2014? And then maybe before I just turn it back to you, related to that is, we've – it's easy – it's
easy for me to certainly understand some efficiencies in learning curve as you're describing them. It's also easy to
understand capacity additions and so some of the expediting costs go down. But it does sound like installation and
commissioning challenges have been real as well.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Yep.
<Q - Brad Handler>: And I don't know how those are enhanced or how those costs come down, if you're delivering a
lot of rigs in 2014. But perhaps you could help describe why that also gets a little easier or cheaper or what have you in
the process?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: That's a great question, Brad. Let me explain. And when we set up our initial plans to build a
rig installation and commissioning on a drillship, we typically budget five to six months to accomplish that. What we
find is delays, some of our own making, many not, some from the ship – our shipyard partners, but we're all building a
new rig for the first time. So, we typically launch those I&C projects late and into a project that may drift beyond its
delivery deadline and we're under a lot of pressure to speed up our I&C activity. So, we get asked, "Hey, can you guys
shorten that up to four months or three months?" And to accomplish that, we – it costs us money. We have – we go to –

we've taken the extraordinary step of going to 24-hour operations on certain things that we're doing in the I&C world.
We're paying extra to expedite equipment and people and move resources around our system to try to get back on track
on these projects or as close as we can there, too. So that's costing us extra money.
So, all this – this is all tied together and the installation and commissioning is the last thing we do on a rig. And so, it
shows up there as well.
But on that subject more broadly, I've touched on a number of factors and I don't think these are new to anybody, but
probably worth delineating them all again. The new designs that we're building right now for the first time and the loss
of the copy effect from the preceding cycle is an issue. Expansion in our plants has been an issue and the installation
and commissioning efforts being – that are underway right now, Jeremy mentioned, we're going to be at record levels
of I&C here in the second half of this year, and as we move into 2014, were all contributing to this, but I would say on
all three fronts, we see this getting better. We get better as we progress through it. I would add to this the resumption of
land rig demand that we saw in the third quarter will help the segment's margins.
And the last factor is the fact that our aftermarket piece of Rig Technology in the third quarter, it grew but only by a
couple of percent. So, you didn't get sort of the positive impact on margin expansion out of aftermarket that you would
otherwise expect. I would stress that that aftermarket is a transient thing quarter-to-quarter.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Timing.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: It's a timing thing and we are going to see that business continue to grow, we're very
confident. So that will help contribute to margin expansion. However, some of the risks and headwinds that we face,
first, we are glad to see rising demand for FPSO products, but those are a little bit dilutive to our EBIT margin. Second,
as we mentioned, demand is down for pressure-pumping equipment, particularly for North America. So that business
really has really kind of been at rock bottom on order.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: And margins in that business are accretive to overall Rig Tech.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. And the third is, the shortened deliveries that we have on these rigs
means that we have a little less headroom and safety factor than we've had in the past.
We've talked about this in the past too. We're making these offshore rigs faster and faster, and so to the extent we run
into unexpected problems, the timeframe that we have to recover is much more limited. So that's a little bit of a risk.
And finally, the fourth issue is in the third quarter. Again, we had very strong demand once again for jackup rigs. We
sold 42 jackup rig packages. That's a little quicker term kind of capital and so we're putting more volume through our
system, and so that makes our congestion issues a little more challenging. So, those are kind of the puts and takes going
into our margin outlook overall.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: And as you – to your first question around when do you get back to the 24% margins? I
would expect as we get through Q1 of next year to see some slow, steady progression in margins in the Rig Tech
business, but I wouldn't expect to get to 24% next year. 2015, I think is more likely and if we can get some help, as
Clay said, on the orders for pressure-pumping equipment that we can ship and turn into revenue and margin, I think we
can get there in 2015.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Very helpful, thorough explanation. I appreciate it. And I'll turn it back. Thanks.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Thanks, Brad.

<Q - Stephen D. Gengaro>: Thank you. Just wanted to hit on the PS&S business. And can you give us a sense there,
and I know you've had – the U.S. rig count has been, everybody has been expecting it to go I think higher, more rapidly
but you're still at a very healthy level. How should we think about sort of the structure of the business right now and
what you see from a demand perspective in 2014? Is it simply rig count intensity driven or is there sort of an inventory
issue that could help growth there?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Yeah. I think, we're cautiously optimistic is how I would describe it. We think producer cash
flows have been pretty strong. And so, we think there is good financial resources to see an uptick in the rig count.
As I mentioned in my comments, increasingly we see North America become more and more competitive. This
inventory overhang issue has been out there. The fact that the industry is kind of restructuring and coalescing into the
handful of the most profitable basins has created some headwinds, but I would add, this rig efficiency phenomenon that
everyone has been talking about, we believe ultimately will grow the pie.
It's going to make some of the less economic basins now more attractive and more economic and so with ample
financial resources and kind of growing opportunities perhaps in other basins, we think that's a pretty good backdrop to
see expansion some time out there in 2014.
We haven't seen it yet, but I think it's – it's – we're entering with a pretty good backdrop for 2014, and I would also
reiterate that the very intensive nature of drilling and completion operations in the major shale plays is consuming what
NOV makes and so we know day by day, these inventories are being whittled away by day-to-day operations.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Yeah. And I think if you look at PS&S, you almost have to segment it by product types. I
mean, things like drill pipe and downhole tools as long as well count is high, which it has been, those products get
consumed and they get consumed pretty quickly. So, there was definitely an inventory overhang for both of those types
of products, the downhole tools and drill pipe.
We'll work through that at some point in time next year and we'll start to see more demand for those products. As you
get into the more consumable type of items like fluid and expendables, valves, seats, and liners, pistons, those are
probably going to be consumed as customers need them as opposed to really building up inventory levels, because
there is ample supply out there, so it's going to be a bit of a mix between the products.
<Q - Stephen D. Gengaro>: Okay. Thank you. And then as an unrelated follow-up, as we think about CapEx and we
think about the tax rate for 2014, what's the impact of the spin? Does it change the tax rate much or the CapEx number?
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Yeah, I think, it's too early to answer that right now. We're still working through the
process ourselves and as we get closer to the finish line, we'll come back with more information.
<Q - Stephen D. Gengaro>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Thanks.
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: Thank you, Stephen.

Our next question comes from Marshall Adkins from Raymond James. Please go ahead.
<Q - J. Marshall Adkins>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: Good morning, Marshall.
<Q - J. Marshall Adkins>: We've heard from this season of a few of the offshore drillers talk about rig equipment
delays. And this quarter, we see your backlog burn slowing a little bit. Is there anything we should read into that? Are
lead times getting longer? Is there anything going on there, or is it something else?

<A - Clay C. Williams>: No, I mean we're, as we've talked about on lots of calls, we're pretty loaded up. $15.2 billion
backlog and so we're having to be very careful about what we sign up to do on deliveries. I think some of the issues
you're talking about, some of the deliveries again go back to this, the fact that we're building the first versions of rigs
under new class standards with new rig floor layouts for all us. And we've collectively faced some issues, but I would
stress that NOV has moved heaven and earth to try to get those rigs back on schedule as best we can and many we
have, not all, but many. And so, I think we're moving progressively towards – up that learning curve and getting better
and better at it, month-by-month.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: And the other thing I'd add, Marshall, just real quickly, the backlog burn is pretty high
level $2.1 billion which was consistent with last quarter, and just slightly below our peak at Q4. So, we're getting better
at delivering, I think.
<Q - J. Marshall Adkins>: So, don't read too much into other than just the new rig design?
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: That's about right.
<Q - J. Marshall Adkins>: Okay. Second question on the backlog, I'm going to stay on this subject. We've seen a
pretty good ramp up this year in the jackups you're doing, I can't believe these number are right, but I had like eight
jackups last year and 50-ish jackups by the time we end this year and deepwater rigs are going from 24 rigs last year to
high 20 rigs this year. Where are we going to go next year? I mean, I'm just kind of – trying get my arms around it
right, you're almost 30 deepwater rigs. Are you going to order another 30 rigs? It sounds like in your guidance for
backlog, we fall off a little bit from that. Is that – am I reading that correctly?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Well, there is probably a little conservatism baked in that, but yeah, I mean our customers are
pretty busy. They've ordered a lot of rigs. They have a lot of projects underway. We'll – time will tell where we end up
next year. But I think bigger picture and this is some of the – part of the theme that I touched on in the opening
comments were – it's an enormous opportunity out there. And with high commodity prices, we're seeing a lot of oil
companies and a lot of drillers avail themselves of these opportunities. And so we think again the backdrop, the
fundamentals are very strong. Day rates are strong, financing is available. The shipyard infrastructure is offering hulls
at very, very low cost. The risk around building these things is low. And so, you're seeing drillers go after that
opportunity and grow their business by investing in these assets.
And with regards to the jackups, there is an – still an awful lot of – over half of the marketed jackups are still more than
30 years old. And so there is a lot of rigs to build. On the floater side of things, you take all the floaters that were in
existence prior to 2005, and you add all floaters built since 2005, and you add all the floaters that are on order, to be
built, you're almost up to – almost up to half of the rigs working in the State of Texas to go out and drill up the rest of
the – two-thirds of the planet covered by deepwater. So, we think that's again a huge opportunity.
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: And, Marshall, I might add that the same sort of question was asked of us in 2007. It was
asked of us in 2008. Probably was asked in 2009, I just can't remember.
Before of last year, it was asked before of last year. And we continue to be very bullish on the need for the equipment
and the rigs that we make for oil exploration and gas exploration in the rest of the world.
<Q - J. Marshall Adkins>: Well, the difference this time is you're also going to get a kick from the FPSO, even if it
does slow a little bit, that would be ramping up I would suspect?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Yeah, yeah.
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: Absolutely, absolutely. As we tell people, these drillships aren't drilling for practice.
They're drilling to discover oil and gas, and the approved solution on that production is going to be the FPSO business.
<Q - J. Marshall Adkins>: Thanks, guys.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Thank you, Marshall.
<A - Merrill A. Miller, Jr.>: Thank you, Marshall.
