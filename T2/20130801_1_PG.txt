MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning and welcome to Procter & Gamble's quarter end conference call. Today's discussion will include a
number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see
a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections.
As required by Regulation G, P&G needs to make you aware that during the call the company will make a number of
references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Management believes these measures provide investors valuable
information on the underlying growth trends of the business. Organic refers to reported results, excluding the impact of
acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange where applicable.
Adjusted free cash flow represents operating cash flow, less capital expenditures and adjusted for after-tax impacts of
major divestitures. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding
divestiture gains. Any measure described as core refers to the equivalent GAAP measure, adjusted for certain items.
P&G has posted on its website www.PG.com a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures.
Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.
Jon R. Moeller
Thanks, and good morning, everyone. I'm joined this morning by A.G. Lafley and Teri List-Stoll. I'll start our
discussion with the review of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2013 results. A.G. will discuss our key strategies and focus
areas going forward, and I'll then wrap up with guidance for fiscal 2014.

Fourth quarter organic sales results were at the high end of our forecast range, with core earnings per share slightly
ahead of plan. Organic sales were up 4%. Importantly, this sales growth was underpinned by strong organic volume
growth of 5% and was achieved during a period in which underlying market growth rates were decelerating. Pricing
was neutral to organic sales growth, and mix reduced sales growth by one point. Foreign exchange lowered sales
growth by two points, resulting in all in sales growth of 2%.
P&G global value share was around 20% for the March to May period, roughly in line with the prior year. Market share
improved sequentially throughout the quarter. In May, the last period for which we currently have global share data,
volume share increased 0.4 points versus prior year, with growth in all regions, except Central and Eastern Europe,
Middle East and Africa.
On a mixed adjusted basis, May global value share was up 0.2 points. In the U.S., where we have data through June,
mix adjusted value share was up 0.3 points. We held or grew global market share in businesses representing nearly
60% of sales in the March to May period. In the U.S., we held or grew value share in businesses representing over 70%
of sales.
Moving to the bottom line, core earnings per share were $0.79, $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range due to
cost savings and a $0.01 help in tax. Core earnings per share was down 4% versus the prior year as the benefits from
top of range organic sales growth and strong cost savings were more than offset by mix, higher marketing spending and
a $0.06 per share or roughly seven percentage point earnings-per-share growth headwind from foreign exchange rates.
All-in earnings per share were $0.64. This includes a $0.02 non-core impact from restructuring costs, a $0.04 non-core
impact from legal items in Europe and a $0.10 non-core non-cash impact of a further impairment of intangible assets
related to the Braun business, reflecting the 20% devaluation of the currency in Japan where Braun earns the majority
of its profits.
Core operating profit margin declined 130 basis points as core gross margin was down 90 basis points and core SG&A
costs increased 40 basis points. Operating margin was about 50 basis points less than we had originally anticipated due
largely to foreign exchange. The core effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.3%, in line with last year. We generated
$2.8 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, repurchased $1 billion in stock and returned $1.7 billion of cash to
shareholders in dividends.
Turning to the fiscal year, we met our commitments on each key measure. Organic sales growth was 3% and the
midpoint of our initial guide range of 2% to 4%. We grew core earnings per share of 5%, above our initial minus 1% to
plus 4% guidance range. We absorbed the unexpected impact of the Venezuelan bolivar devaluation and significant
overall dollar strengthening while increasing marketing investments as the year progressed. We continue to make good
progress on our productivity plan. Through June, we reduced non-manufacturing enrollment by 7,000 roles. This is
1,300 role reductions ahead of our initial enrollment reduction target for June 30, 2013.
We delivered over $1.2 billion in cost of goods sold savings and improved manufacturing productivity by 7% versus a
target of 5%. Our progress on working capital and capital spending productivity enabled to us deliver 98% adjusted
free cash flow productivity ahead of our 90% target. We returned $12.5 billion to shareholders, 110% of net earnings
through a combination of $6.5 billion in dividends and $6 billion in share repurchase. In April, we raised the dividend
by 7%.
We're beginning to restore growth in the core U.S. market that represents over a third of P&G's sales and an even
greater percentage of profit. U.S. fourth quarter organic sales grew at 7% on volume growth of 5%. We maintained
good developing market momentum. Organic sales growth in our top 10 developing markets was up 8% in the fiscal
year. We grew profit meaningfully ahead of sales in developing markets while increasing investments in these markets
year-on-year.
We stabilized global market share and ended the year with modest market share growth. We're moving in the right
direction, but there is more work to do. To talk us through that, I'll turn the call over to A.G.

Alan G. Lafley
Thanks, Jon. We've spent a lot of time doing a deep dive over the past two months making sure we fully understand our
reality, ensuring we see things as they are, not as we want them to be. We've gotten grounded in the realities of our
consumers and markets. I've personally dialogued with customers, partners and suppliers. We've listened to a range of
outside advisors, critics as well as fans. We've taken a hard look at business strategies, reviewed budgets and business
plans and dug deeply into innovation programs and productivity initiatives. We know we're not winning like we know
we can, and we're committed to make the changes we know we need to make to improve P&G's performance
significantly.
First, we will establish value creation, first and foremost for consumers but also importantly for share owners as our
clear priority. Operating TSR will be our primary business performance measure. Operating TSR is an integrated
measure of value creation at the business unit level requiring sales growth, progress on gross and operating margins and
strong cash flow productivity.
We focused on business unit value creation because we're determined to have more P&G business units deliver more
operating TSR more consistently. We will be guided by disciplined strategies and operating plans. We will focus
strategically on core businesses, our leading, most profitable categories and brands and leading and most profitable
markets, channels and customers. Delivering consistently strong results in our core business is the largest contributor to
shareholder value creation, an important contributor to growth and an important enabler of investments in developing
markets and innovation.
Many of our strongest business units and total company positions are in the U.S. We need to ensure P&G's home
market stays strong and growing. We will focus developing market investments on the categories and countries with
the largest size of prize and the highest likelihood of winning. Developing markets, driven by demographics and
household income growth, will continue to be a significant growth driver for the company. We will continue to focus
the company's portfolio, allocating resources to businesses where we can create disproportionate value and continuing
to exit those where we cannot.
Second, we will strengthen and accelerate productivity and cost savings. Productivity and innovation are the primary
drivers of growth in value creation. Productivity is particularly important in a slower growth world and in an
environment of increased volatility in foreign exchange, commodity and interest rate markets. And more productivity
means more opportunities to invest in core business growth and developing market expansion and in innovation.
Here's what we're doing specifically with P&G's productivity initiatives. We will deliver the productivity program we
promised on or ahead of schedule, but that is not an end point for productivity improvement it's just the next milestone
along our productivity journey. We know we can do more.
We are already mobilized to address the next round of productivity initiatives. We are working these significant
opportunities in parallel, not sequentially. They cover a full range of cost and cash opportunities. The projects are being
led by business unit and function leaders. They're being worked on short cycles. Some are yielding savings as we
speak, others will take years to fully implement. We have opportunities to further localize supply chains in developing
markets, reducing cost and improving customer service.
In developed markets, we are taking a blank sheet of paper look at supply chains, designing from the consumer and
customer back. We are studying option that would reduce the number of facilities, build scale across categories and
reduce cost and inventory, all while improving customer responsiveness and service. This will require investment but
will generate very attractive returns. It's a huge opportunity.
We will redesign and strengthen our go-to-market operations in North America and Europe to be more effective and
efficient. In Europe, we will look to scale operations across larger and fewer country clusters. We will evaluate
organization design options to improve effectiveness and efficiency in developing markets. We will further reduce the
size of support staffs and move from fully dedicated functional support organizations to a more productive hybrid of
dedicated and flow-to-the-work resources and shared services. We will improve marketing ROI, driven by an

optimized mix of advertising media, greater clarity of communication and messaging and greater efficiency in
non-advertisement marketing spending.
The key point to understand today is that we are committed to making productivity a core strength for P&G like
branding or innovation. And with innovation, a second big driver of operating TSR and value creation. It has to for
P&G to deliver leading value creation and growth. Productivity will become systemic, not episodic. We will
continuously improve our effectiveness and efficiency. We'll measure productivity, we'll recognize it and we'll reward
it.
Third, we will improve our operating discipline. We simply have to execute better, more consistently and more reliably
every day, everywhere to win with consumers and win with customers. Execution is the only strategy they ever see.
Winning with consumers and winning with customers, day in and day out, is what it takes to generate leadership
returns in our industry, and that's what we've committed to do.
Fourth, we will reallocate some of our savings to make strategic investments, in a very focused way, in innovation and
go-to-market capabilities. These are two of the company's core strengths and two important sources of competitive
advantage. They're critical to winning the first and second moments of truth with consumers.
We will build on the past year, but we will be more focused. We'll commercialize brand and product innovations with
excellence. We'll prioritize productivity initiatives, significantly simplifying and streamlining how we work together,
and we will bring a sense of urgency to realizing hard savings. We'll focus on best-in-class execution and we'll continue
to invest selectively, where needed, to win.
I'm confident that P&G has what it takes to win with consumers, with customers and for all of our shareholders. We
have a strong brand portfolio, with 25 category leading billion dollar brands and 15 more between half a billion and a
billion dollars in annual sales. We have leading brand equities in most of our categories.
We have consumer preferred products, and in the majority of our brand product lines we have a well-balanced
geographic portfolio. We have the leading CPG business in the U.S., the largest and fastest growing developed market,
and we have the leading household and personal care business in developing markets. Both are significant sources of
value creation opportunity.
We have an innovation portfolio and pipeline that will only get stronger. We have an exciting portfolio of productivity
initiatives we're working hard. We have outstanding people. The productivity and organization design changes we are
making are freeing up P&Gers to fully leverage their creativity and initiative, their skills and capabilities. They are
passionate about the consumers they serve and about their businesses. They are committed to win. They are our most
important asset, a critical source of strength and, ultimately, competitive advantage for this company.
We've taken a hard look at what we need to do, how we need to change to perform better; more business units have to
deliver more consistently. We're committed to do what it takes to get P&G back to balance, consistency, reliability and
sustainability in the creation of value for consumers and customers, and value for shareholders and employees. It takes
time to work out of a tough patch. We take encouragement from the progress we've made in the year just closed, but we
are focused on the future, and we are determined to deliver industry-leading value creation.
Jon R. Moeller
Thanks, A.G. As we said we would at the Deutsche Bank conference in June, A.G., Teri, John and I have spent some
time reviewing our guidance framework. We've talked to shareholders and analysts, as we've done this work, and we've
looked at a number of benchmarking studies.
The preponderance of feedback we've received supports a decision we've made to focus our guidance on the fiscal year,
which we'll update quarterly. This approach is the norm in our industry. We believe it provides a better match between
our guidance timeframe, the long-term view we take while managing the business and the investment time horizon of
many of our shareholders.

We've also reviewed long-term guidance targets. We continue to believe that the right organic sales growth target is
one that is modestly above the rate of market growth. At current market growth rates, we see high single-digit bottom
line growth as the right objective. We believe these targets will allow the company to strike the right balance between
long-term investments in growth; flexibility to respond to macro and competitive challenges; and delivery of consistent,
dependable results and our value creation goals.
With that, let me move to guidance for the fiscal year. Fiscal 2014 presents several challenges and opportunities.
Headwinds include weaker underlying market growth, a much stronger dollar, higher commodity costs and a highly
competitive operating environment. Opportunities include positive market share momentum, a number of promising
innovations and savings from productivity improvements.
We're currently forecasting organic sales growth of 3% to 4%, which is better than last year at 3%, and compares to
expected market growth rates of about 3% to 4%. Foreign exchange is expected to be a sales growth headwind of about
two points, which leads to all-in sales growth in the range of 1% to 2% for fiscal 2014.
Moving to the bottom line, our current forecast is for core earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%, equal to prior-year
growth at the low end of the range and within our long-term annual growth target range at the high end. This core
earnings per share guidance includes a six point impact from foreign exchange.
We expect the effective tax rate on core earnings to be in-line with prior-year levels. Our plans include another year of
strong productivity improvement. We have line of sight to $1.4 billion and cost of goods sold savings in fiscal 2014,
including manufacturing productivity improvements of around 6%.
As I said earlier, we exceeded our overhead enrollment reduction targets by 1,300 roles as of the end of June, giving us
a nice head start on the 2% to 4% reduction we were planning for fiscal 2014. We will deliver this and accelerate fiscal
2015 reductions into fiscal 2014.
We expect marketing spending to increase in absolute dollars, but decrease modestly as a percentage of sales, as we
continue to drive higher ROI. On an all-in GAAP adjusted basis, we expect earnings per share to grow approximately
7% to 9%. This range reflects somewhat lower non-core restructuring costs in fiscal year 2014 versus the prior year.
We continue to operate in a volatile environment with uncertainty in the foreign exchange and commodity markets,
decelerating market growth rates and a rapidly developing policy environment. Our guidance is based on mid-July
foreign exchange spot rates. Further strengthening of the dollar or significant devaluations, for example, in Venezuela,
are not built into our forecast.
As we described last quarter, one particular risk not included in our all-in earnings guidance is the potential impact
from revaluation of Venezuelan bolivars, earmarked for foreign currency transactions through the new SICAD auction
rate market. At this the time, there's no official information available on details or planned frequency of the new
auction process or the underlying rates.
So far, we've measured all of our Venezuela exposures at the official exchange rate of 6.3 bolivars to the U.S. dollar. If
it becomes clear, as the auction rate market forms, that it will operate in a liquid and transparent matter at a different
rate we may need to adjust our balance sheet, which will result in additional non-core impact on earnings. We'll keep
you updated on this as we learn more.
Major changes in market growth rates or significantly adverse policy changes are also not assumed within our guidance
range. Absent these or other unanticipated events, we believe our core earnings per share guidance range is realistic and
balanced. It reflects the headwinds we are facing, the investments we'll be making and the strong cost savings progress
we are committed to deliver.
As you think about earnings progress throughout the year, there are several headwinds that will impact first half
earnings growth that will dissipate or disappear in the second half. For example, foreign exchange will be a significant
headwind in the first half, but should moderate in the second half.

We will continue to have relatively high spending and manufacturing start-up costs, but this will largely annualize in
the second half of fiscal 2014. We'll annualize the operating impacts of the Venezuelan bolivar devaluation in the
second half. Stepped up marketing support levels will also annualize and productivity savings will build throughout the
year. Last, the first half comparison includes the one-time gain from the Western European bleach business in the base
period.
With all of these factors considered, core earnings per share growth will likely be down modestly in Q1 with slight
improvement in Q2. Second half earnings will be much stronger.
We expect to deliver another year of about 90% free cash flow productivity. Our plans assume capital spending in the
range of 4% to 5% of sales and share repurchase in the range of $5 billion to $7 billion, continuing to deliver on our
commitment of cash return to shareholders.
In closing, our primary objective for fiscal 2014 is to continue to build on the momentum we've created, making this
year another stepping stone back to our long-term growth objectives. Our plans are even more focused and even more
balanced. We will make choiceful investments in our core business, most promising developing markets and biggest
innovation opportunities, and we will aggressively drive productivity and cost savings. Above all, we will remain
focused on value creation for consumers, for customers and for our shareholders.
That concludes our prepared remarks. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our press release and
will be available on slides, which will be posted on our website, www.pg.com, following the call. A.G., Teri and I

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Faucher with JP Morgan. Please proceed.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Thank you. Good morning. And welcome back, A.G. Good to have you back.
<A - Alan G. Lafley>: Thank you.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Quick question for you. Your – historically, you guys had talked about revenue growth 100
basis points, I think, ahead of the market. So if we look at your organic sales growth guidance this year, it's more sort
of, an in-line number. Then when you factor in, you're dropping a decent amount of the productivity to the bottom line
can you talk about maybe why you're not spending more to maybe get a little bit more market share, given the growth
of the category? So what's driving the decision, in terms of dropping more to the bottom line versus potentially
spending it back? Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Well John, we'll continue, as we have good opportunities to drive return and create value, to
invest behind innovation, as A.G. mentioned; behind go-to-market capability and advertising where we can generate a
return. And as I've said many times before, cost savings is not the objective, value creation is the objective and we will
not follow cost savings out the window at the expense of capability and opportunity of which we have many.
<A - Alan G. Lafley>: John, two quick points. Past five years: two, three, three, three, three. Most recent quarter: four.
Okay? So if you're going to see things as they are, we've got to demonstrate we can grow faster, point number one.
Okay? We're prepared to invest to grow faster. And with clearer strategies, we'll make investments where the size of
the prize is attractive and where we think we have the plan to win. Second point, this is our external commitment. We
have internal goals.

<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Hi. Good morning. Welcome back, A.G.
<A - Alan G. Lafley>: Thank you, Bill.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Hey, you've talked about this – the deep dive that did. Can you just talk about what you think
that P&G was doing wrong during the period? And then maybe what you're going to stop doing? And then maybe
empirically, like how you are going to define success going forward? Maybe try to put some numbers around it?
<A - Alan G. Lafley>: Okay. I'd like to take a couple of minutes here to step back because this is an opportunity to talk
about strategy, I think, at the company level and at the business unit level. The quick answer to your second question,
or second part of your question, Bill, is it's value creation. Okay? In the first place, we've got to create value is for more
consumers more consistently. Okay? With our brands and product offerings. And then the second place we have to do
it is for the company and for shareholders, and that's a balanced, okay, a balanced mix of net sales growth, gross and
operating margin growth and cash productivity.
If I may on the strategy, at the business unit level – at the business unit level, we want to be more choiceful, clearer, we
want to be more focused and we want to be really clear about our priorities. And we want to be very specific about
what is winning for the business unit, with consumers, to create value. We want to be very specific and prioritize where
we're going to play.
We're going to be much more specific about our business model, how we're going to win. And we're going to get really
clear in our core strengths, not just how we leverage the core strengths that the company has, but what very specific and
particular core strengths we need to win in that industry. Okay? Or that market. So that's really the focus at business
unit level. Get more focused, get clearer, set our priorities and then operate with discipline and execute with excellence.
At the company level, the keyword is balance. And you've followed this company, many of you have followed this
company and this industry for a long time, and when we have a pretty good decade three things happen. We grow the
value of our core businesses, whatever our core is at that time. We find at least one major new business that we can turn
into core, baby diapers in the 1960s; tissue towel, now family care, in the 1970s; sun Care in the 1980s; hair care in the
1990's. Arguably, we got home and oral care, and family care back into the core fold. The team did, over the last
decade, and we made some progress creating cores in skin and prestige beauty. And we bought a shaving business
which is core, okay?
So that's the second leg of the stool. The first leg of the stool is you grow the value of your existing core. The second
leg of the stool is you find some new core. And the third leg of the stool has been moving into new space. Generally,
we talk about geography, but it's also included channels. Okay? And if you really look at the history of the company,
we found new geography and we've found – and we've also found new channels. Okay?
But we need to do all three. We need to grow from the core, we need to accelerate growth into faster growing, higher
margin, more structurally attractive. That means less capital intensive, less competitively concentrated industries and
we need to extend into emerging markets, and we're just trying to get that balance back. And as I said in my prepared
remarks, generally, winning in the core drives a surprising – the existing core – drives a surprising amount of the value
creation, and actually a surprising amount of the growth each decade. And here's the key, it's what enables. Okay? It
brings us the capabilities, it brings us the cash, it brings us the human resources, okay, to extend into new industries and
categories that can be core, and to extend into new geographies and channels.
So we're just working hard to get the balance right. Okay? And when you've got an $80 billion plus company that's in
15 to 20 different businesses, depending on how you count them, and 100 plus geographies, balance is really important.
The other thing we're doing is, we're taking a hard look at our core strength. And again, as I said in my prepared
remarks, we've got to turn productivity into just as strong a strength as innovation because those are the two biggest
drivers of value creation in the P&G business model. Okay? We've got to turn operating with discipline and executing
with excellence into a core strength, just as we turn choiceful, sharpened strategies into a core strength.

We still have to have a deep understanding of consumers, we still have to be able to create brands and build them
forever, if we can. We still have to be the innovation leader in the industries and categories we choose to compete in,
and we still have to have our go-to-market capabilities and grow them. And we try to create, as we go along, some
scale. Okay?
So that's really where we've focused. We've focused on balancing, getting crystal clear about what is winning,
balancing the where to play and taking a hard look at the core strengths. So again, we have a balanced – a balanced set
of core strengths to go forward. We're locked on it.
I think at the company level, all that's left to do is get the expression in the fewest possible words, which is a burden
that Jon and I will predominantly carry in the next couple of days. And at the business unit level, as you might imagine,
we're just grinding our way through one business at a time. And we've been through them all once, we've been through
their operating plans and budgets for the next year, which is another shot at them. And now we're doubling down and
working real hard where we think we have the most opportunity, either the most upside opportunity or the most
correction opportunity.
So I hope that helps because I think it's really important to understand: balance at the company level, three legs on the
stool, core, totally new businesses where we can play to our strengths and hopefully create new core and new space.
Okay? And right now, the biggest opportunity in new space happens to be developing markets, which are
demographically and economically advantaged, but it's also e-commerce. Okay?
So like I said, I hope that's helpful. That's what we're trying to do and now, of course, we've got to execute.

Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays. Please proceed.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Thanks. Good morning. So I guess what I'm really curious about is, thinking over the
last – your review of where things stand and looking over the past few years, the message on productivity couldn't be
more clear and is obviously very important to the go forward capability to operate in a tougher world. But if you look at
the last call, at two years or so, investment in the business hasn't really been the challenge. There's been money to
spend and even when there hasn't been a lot of money to spend, there's been money spent to try to drive top line.
Yet something's still been missing. And I feel like over the last couple of years, we've seen P&G have more
disappointments on what was expected to be a good innovation pipeline, new ideas, things that would change the
trajectory of – and this is a broad statement because it sort of applies across the business units. So in this deep dive,
A.G., what have you seen that says to you, maybe we're not as good as we used to be? Or why are we not as good as we
used to be at understanding what the consumer wants, what the competitive landscape is? Because there have been a lot
of shortfalls that aren't about spending, it's about what the company's been spending on. Thanks.
<A - Alan G. Lafley>: Maybe a bad baseball analogy, but we've got to get our batting average and our OPS up, okay?
And as we go through this industry-by-industry, business-by-business where the strategies are clearer and more
choiceful, where we know who the consumers are that matter most, where the brand promise is crystal clear and we
execute it in the communication and where our products are preferred by consumers, we get it done. And in any mix of
businesses we – in just the past few years, and I'll miss a few, we had the family cares and we have the prestige
beauties and we have the oral cares, and I don't want to leave out the home cares and others that have been consistently
performing.
But I think if you do your analysis or we do our analysis, it comes back to real clarity around who the consumer is and
delivering for that consumer. Ultimately, it's a better consumer value equation and a better experience, real strategic
clarity, a proven business model. And by the way, it isn't a proven business model that lasts forever, you're continually
adjusting your business model, right? So but a business model that's agile and still actionable and still works and
frankly, the ability to operate with discipline and execute with excellence.

Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Good morning. A.G., I was hoping for more perspective, specifically on beauty, and what
strategy tweaks you were making behind that business to improve market share trends? And as you look back over the
last few years, what are some of the learnings as you look at the performance there? And then also from a portfolio
standpoint, are you comfortable with the current portfolio you have in beauty or are there gaps you'd like to fill in over
time?
<A - Alan G. Lafley>: Okay. On the second one, we're continuing to – we're always reviewing the portfolios at the
company level, at the business unit level. And again, as I said in my prepared remarks, if they're a strategic fit and
they're performing, delivering value, they're in. If they're not, we'll deal with it. Okay?
On the first one, it's not really different conceptually. Okay? It's not really different in getting the consumer focus right,
getting the brand and the product innovation program right and having the clarity and sharpness in the strategy that
translates to operating discipline and executional excellence. That's all the same.
I think again, if you really look at the beauty business; we took a business, we put together this collection of businesses.
And Mark and I and others know, it was a collection in 2000 of businesses that we called beauty. And in six or seven
years, we tripled that business, right? We took it to $21 billion. The problem is, we're still looking at it – we actually
took it to $22 billion plus. We're still looking at a $20 billion business.
Now, I view that as opportunity. Okay? In seven years – Shiseido has been in beauty for 150 years, L'Oreal since 1900.
So over 100 years. Estee Lauder, since World War II. So over 60 years. We've been really at it for 12 or 13 years.
Okay? With – fortunately, we picked up a couple of decent assets back in 2000, but it's a learning curve and we clearly
stalled in a couple of places.
But again, prestige beauty is in very good shape. We went from nothing in arguably one of the toughest segments to a
$3 billion plus business. We have a very fine fine fragrance business that makes – that's grown at a very consistent rate.
From the time we bought the two little pieces back in the early 90s, we've grown at a compound annual growth rate on
the top line of 11%. It has been a – while it's been volatile through the recession, it's been a pretty consistent value
creator. And hey let's face it, we're up against some of the best in the world in prestige skin care and fine fragrance, and
we've done quite well.
And the reason we've done quite well, is our strategy is sharp and our – we know we need a certain set of core strengths
to play in prestige beauty, and we leveraged some of the P&G core strengths to be a little bit different. We've stayed
very steady on some of our hair care brands. We have an issue on Pantene, we're working it. It's primarily, but not
exclusively, a U.S. and North America issue. We've ground through those plans a few times. We took the Board
through them. I've been here like six days, okay?
We went through an innovation review. We've been through the strategy. We know what the program should look like
over the next six months, the next 12 months, the next 18 and 24 months. Hey, businesses stall, but it stalled at $3
billion. Okay? I'd rather – one of the things I learned in private equity the last four years, I'd rather work – you spend as
much as time and energy on a billion dollar business as you do on a $200 million business and believe me, you get
better value creation for it if you can get it going.
On the skin care side, it's pretty much the same story. We went from, frankly, playing but not winning for the first 15
years after we bought Olay from RVI, to all of a sudden we took a business that was several hundred million and we
turned it into a $2 billion plus business. It stalled. Okay? And again, took the board through it. Been through the

strategy, been through the product program. We know what we're going to do over the next six, 12, 18 and 24 months.
But these are assets. They have real connections with the consumers. If we get the consumer connections back, if we
get the brand promises and architecture – collections, whatever you want to call it, right and if we execute, okay, like
we think we can with our marketing and product programs, there's plenty of room to grow.
And I guess the last point I'll make, because I know I'm going on a little long here, remember why we chose to get into
beauty and personal care in the first place. They're large; they're demographically driven. They grow a little faster,
okay? They're big in the U.S. and developed markets. They're big in developing markets and only getting bigger.
They're structurally attractive; low capital, high gross margins and they're fragmented. It's not like anybody's
dominating these spaces. There's room for a lot of players who can get it done to do well.
So long-winded way of saying, hey we've stalled. A lot of it were choices we made and maybe things we struggled at,
but we know what to do and we're on it, we're on it.

Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research. Please proceed.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Hi. Good morning. First thing, I know you had a target of delivering a 50% improvement
in your local currency EBIT margins, if you will, or in profits in emerging markets. Can you tell us where you came out
for the full year on that?
And sort of related to that, I'm having a hard time reconciling sort of the concept of balance and striving for balance
when you're talking about kind of EBIT growth 3 or 4 or 5 times your top line growth and I'm just wondering how that
sets you up, I think, AG, you know your historical strategy was to deliver consistent results and I have a hard time
seeing how that strong double-digit EPS growth is going to be sustainable and why you wouldn't, in your first year here
coming back to the company, find a bucket to put some pennies in to save them for a rainy day because it just – it
seems like it's an awfully aggressive goal at this juncture. Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: So let me provide a little bit of perspective on both of those questions, Wendy. We did grow
profit in developing markets meaningfully ahead of sales. So we did build margin. We – I'm not going into the actual
number. It's, as you can imagine with all of the currency movements, a number compared today to what we were
talking about three or even six months ago is not that relevant. What's relevant is that we continue to grow profit
meaningfully ahead of sales, and I can commit that we have done and will continue to do that in developing markets.
While, by the way, somewhat in answer to your second question, increasing investments. So this isn't about building
profitability by pulling back, it's about increasing profitability through productivity, through localization of supply
chain, through increasing scale and through the right choices.
On the second piece, if we grow our top line, let's just be optimistic for a second, at the high end of our guidance range
at 4%, that translates, absent volume leverage, to 4% on the bottom line. And the productivity program, which is about
$2 billion of savings per year, on its face is worth another 11 points. So that brings you to 15. We get benefit from
share repurchase of one to two points. So you're at 16 to 17, and we've talked about a non-FX impacted number of
something like 11 to 13.
So there is a significant amount of investment back within that number. And as I said earlier, we're not going to be
guided by specific metrics. We're going to be guided – except one, which is value creation. And when there's an
opportunity to create value through additional investment, we will not hesitate.
<A - Alan G. Lafley>: If I just may, might add two, maybe two or three points, Wendy, quickly. We have a stronger
product and brand innovation pipeline this year going in, but it's not huge yet. Okay? So a lot of the pipeline is still in
development, qualification or early stages of commercialization. So you can't invest in it in development, okay?

Second point is we said we are investing back in core strength. Without going into the specific number, we have
invested back the biggest amount of the money in this next year. We have to go back to the middle of the last decade to
get that kind of investment. And as we went through the strategies and product programs, it was very clear, to me and
to others, that we needed to make that investment back.
And I guess the third thing I would say is, we're trying to thread a needle here. Okay? And we're trying to look at what
we can really do, okay, and what we really need to get ready to do. And I think it's going to take a couple of years
before we've got everything in place so that we're hitting on enough cylinders to perform to our full potential. So we
view this as a transition year. Last year was a stepping stone year, and we'll see how it goes.
Absolute last point. Jon and I and the team are totally together. If we're on something that's taking off, we're going to
invest in it, and hopefully we've given ourselves enough flexibility. And in the end, we're going to do what's right for
the business over the mid and long-term and we're going to create value as we do it.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Just one more point, sorry. I spent a fair amount of time, maybe too much time, in our prepared
remarks talking about things that weren't in the forecast in terms of further FX weakening and those kinds of things.
And I've told you before that we're not going to follow FX or commodities out the window just to deliver a number.
We're going to execute the strategy. And I would just repeat that, in terms of our commitment to do what it takes to get
the business growing.

Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed
<Q - Jason M. English>: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. A.G., welcome back. I wasn't covering
you when you were here before. So I look forward to meeting you. I have, however, reviewed the history and some of
the initiatives you spearheaded and how you were operating. In your time apart, kind of reflecting back on some of
your private equity experience and some of your work in academia, I guess my question is how has that changed your
perspective? And as you come back into the organization, how do you see yourself either managing or operating this
business differently?
<A - Alan G. Lafley>: Well, I think there are probably three things. The first one is the importance, ultimately –
overriding importance, ultimately, of value creation in a B2B business, for your customers and your shareholders, in a
B2C business, like ours, for your consumers and your shareholders. If we get just those two pieces right, a lot of this
other stuff is going to fall into place.
Second thing is, sense of urgency. In the private equity world you don't have – you have a certain amount of time to
generate the value and I think bringing a sense of urgency is helpful. Okay?
Thirdly, we have – you have to be very choiceful and you have to be very focused and you have to be very prioritized
with your strategy choices because they drive the operating budget and plan and they drive the execution. And so I
think we're tightening them down.
And I guess the last one is, sort of our culture. We had a great conversation about this, as a leadership team, and we're
going to build on the strengths. But we've just got to – we've got to get to a much more agile, a much faster, a much
more decisive culture. And we've talked a lot about agreeing, disagreeing, committing and going, and we're just trying
to – we're making decisions quickly, we're delegating the decisions where they should be made. I need to make a few,
but most of these decisions are made by the business unit leaders or they're made in the markets where we're closest to
the customers and the consumers. So getting clear about who makes the decisions, getting clear about making the
decisions, getting on with it and then executing.
And I guess the last thing is, you get on very short learning cycles and, hey, my point is you learn as much as you can
from the past, you learn from your successes and you learn from your missteps and then you get on with it. You get
focused on the future and you get out there and you try it next time.

Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein. Please proceed.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, guys. Hey, A.G.
<A - Alan G. Lafley>: Hi, Ali.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: So from a – just quick clarification on 2014 and then a real question. Maybe, Jon, this is for you.
Want to get a better sense of, you're saying the productivity will be accelerated, but you're also saying that the
restructuring charges will be lower in 2014. And also just want to guess get a sense of how we should think about
capital allocation assumptions around buybacks, et cetera, that are embedded in your numbers?
But the bigger question maybe, A.G., for you is the story you paint out here is very exciting, in terms of fixing some
things that were wrong. But I really want to get into a little bit more specifics, if you can, at this stage. So I get that the
consumer wasn't read right, but how are you going to fix that as a company? I get that execution wasn't right, but what's
going to change on that? I get that choiceful decisions weren't necessarily made perfectly. Why was the case? How are
you going to fix that? And I ask that in the context of as you look at the company today, you've done your deep dive
over the past two months, what are the big capability gaps that you think exist? And particularly relative to your
competitive set that has clearly been progressing, during not just the past four or five years but the past decade, on
getting some of these core things that a CPG company does right better?
<A - Alan G. Lafley>: Ali, I feel like I'm repeating myself. So I'll try to get this clearer, okay? In the external world
that we've been in, choicefulness and clarity are even more important. Okay? And it's not just me, it's as I said, the
business leaders, the market leaders, channel leaders, customer leaders, country leaders. Okay?
Point number two, I'm not going to – we have the methodologies. We have the tools and techniques to understand who
our best consumer is business-by-business, brand-by-brand and to act on it, but you've got to use it and you've got to act
on it. Okay? So we've rededicated ourselves to really understanding the consumer, really winning with the consumer.
Everything begins and ends with the consumer. We win a consumer, we get a higher – our business model is very
simple. If we can get a higher trial and purchase rate and we can get better usage and more loyalty, that drives the value
creation. All right? But we need to be incredibly disciplined to stay on that business model.
The third thing is, operating discipline. The strategic discussion at the business unit level is about discipline; the
discipline of choice, the discipline of focus, the discipline of prioritization. We need to be more disciplined in our
operating plans. We need to be more disciplined in our financial forecasts. We just need to be more disciplined.
And then the last one is – and again, it's not that we don't know how to do it because we're doing it. Okay? We just
need to do it more consistently and we need to do it more broadly. We need to be disciplined in our execution. This is a
highly executional industry. Okay? And we have to win one shopper at a time; one consumer at a time; one retail
location, whether it's a store or an open market or e-commerce at a time; and we just need to be very executionally
focused. And I think some of – those are the key things. Those are the key things.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: And the answer to the first part of your question, Ali, on the relationship between the
acceleration of productivity savings and the appearance of lower restructuring next year and how those things
reconcile, I'd just make three points there.
First, not every saving opportunity – savings opportunity requires a restructuring investment. So for example,
improving our marketing ROI does not cost anything in terms of restructuring, and that's an area that we're going to get
better at next year than we have been historically. Not all cost of goods sold savings require restructuring investment,
and to the extent that we can deliver savings that are at or ahead of plan with even less restructuring investment, that's a
good thing.

Second, we've talked about over the – over the period of time, an enrollment reduction of 16% to 22%. The 7,000 roles
we've reduced represents about 13%. So we're going to keep going, and it doesn't stop at the end of the five-year
period. But a big chunk of the role reductions, which drive disproportionately restructuring spending, have occurred. So
that's kind of how that's happening. As with the prior commentary, we're not fixated on a restructuring budget. If there
are good opportunities to drive savings sooner and more, we will fund those and we'll be sure to update you on that as
we progress.
Last real quick, on capital allocation. We will continue to prioritize the dividends. This year was the 57th consecutive
year we've increased the dividend. As I've said before, without the 58th, you'll probably be talking to somebody else.
And we'll continue to repurchase shares with the balance of cash that's available. Our philosophy on this is very simple.
Cash that we have is not ours, it's yours. It's our job to deploy it, to earn decent returns and then what's left, we'll
distribute. So really no significant change in capital allocation philosophy going forward.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.
<Q - Joseph Altobello>: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just two quick sort of high level questions. I guess first, A.G.,
you've talked about looking at today's reality and seeing things as they are and not how you want them to be. So I just
wanted to clarify, what you're speaking to there is not necessarily P&G's capabilities and opportunities versus where
they were three, four, five years ago but more so, what you're seeing in the marketplace and, specifically, market
growth, which has obviously slowed in the last two, three, four years?
And then sort of related to that, you talked a lot about creating value, both for consumers as well as for shareholders
and I think part of the consumer value equation, clearly, is price. And so could you comment on how you see your price
levels right now, generally speaking? Are you comfortable with the price levels? Or does there need to be some
strategic change in parts of your business? Thanks.
<A - Alan G. Lafley>: Okay. I guess let me talk about market and maybe some first impressions of consumer changes,
and then talk about value. And I'll let Jon talk about the pricing situation. First, market. I mean, obviously, developing
markets are slowing but they're still projected to grow at 6%. And as I said earlier, all you have to look at are
demographics and economics and I think that's a pretty long arc of growth for our industry and is still a pretty big
opportunity for this company.
We've grown at that – we've actually grown since the Berlin Wall came down and the Guangzhou City markets opened
in 1988/1989, we've grown 9% a year compounded annual growth in developing markets. We've grown 14%
compounded in the last ten years. As Jon said in his comments, we've grown 10% in the BRIC market this last year.
And that growth is there – that growth is there for a lot of the players in this industry. Okay? Because a lot of it is still
tailwind, right? It's babies being born, households forming, incomes rising and you just get market growth. Okay?
Second point is, how have consumers changed. Hey, you don't go through the second biggest financial crisis in recent
history and a prolonged global recession without changing some of your habits, practices, attitudes and beliefs; and we,
of course, have been digging into that. I think you could make an argument. I'll use, you can make an argument that
there may be three critical moments of truth right now for consumers. I call it zero. Other people call it something else.
But there's clearly a period driven by the desire to get the best value they can, not only at the best price but the best
value and driven by technology, mobile technology, computer technology, the Internet, et cetera. And there's this
period of information gathering, education, brand and product comparison, and that includes price comparison. So a lot
of shoppers are coming to the purchase decision with having done a lot more preparation.
Still, what matters is – the first one that really matters is the purchase. We've got to win the preliminary. We've got to
get into the consideration set. We've really got to win the purchase or we don't have a chance at winning the usage. So I
think that's one thing that's changed.

I think the second thing that's changed, and you see it in a number of our businesses, is we really have to build a strong
vertical and horizontal brand and product line portfolio; and it's not just about developed markets and developing
markets. It's about giving more consumers more opportunities to try their way in, make that first purchase into your
brand and product line, and they're going to make the choice about where based on what they need and want and based
on what their value equation is.
So if you look at shave care or you look at hair care or you look at fabric and home care, you're looking at family care.
We've tried to build much more robust vertical offerings, and we're continuing to work hard on that so the consumer
can come in at different points. So think about it as we need to trade them in first and then we can work on trading them
up. Okay?
And I guess the – so that's the market. That's the consumer. And, hey, this third thing. No matter – part – I didn't want
to get into the details here, and I'm not going to. But every business that's really delivering, and we have at least a
handful or more, they really know who their consumers are. They have a very clear consumer segmentation model and
we need that. We need that. That's the map that we start with, right?
So here's the key. Regardless of what segment you're in, value is a factor. So if you're buying SK-II at $145 for the
opening price point on Essence, billion dollar plus brand, and prestige – ultra prestige skin care, there's still a value
equation, and we have to understand what it is for that woman. If you're buying Charmin Basic at a buck or two a pack,
okay, there's a value equation. All right? And we need to understand those value equations. We are never going to
compete purely on price. We are a differentiated, branded, innovative product company. Okay? But we are going to
compete across a broader range of price points, and we are going to compete with brand and product line architectures
that attract more consumers and give them a chance to try us.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: And clearly one measure of our success, in presenting propositions with appropriate value
equations to consumers, is our share of the market. And right now, we're modestly building market share growth, which
would imply that more times than not, not always, but more times than not, we're getting that value equation right.
We'll continue to refine that. This is something that requires kind of daily attention, but generally I think we're across
the broad portfolio in the right place.

Your next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.
<Q - Connie Maneaty>: Good morning. In the context of your comments on execution and understanding on creating
value, I was hoping to get your perspective on what's been going on with Tide Pods? Is this a product that is actually
creating value? What went wrong with the execution? We're looking at monthly sales that have been flat since the start
of the year or the end of last year, even as the capacity issues were supposedly resolved. So your perspective on that
might help give a little bit of context to the things you see as you come back. Thanks so much.
<A - Alan G. Lafley>: Sure. Well, Connie, I think, first of all, we're committed to Tide Pods. It's a $0.5 billion
business, okay, with a lot of upside growth. And it clearly – it's a good value for consumers who want – don't want to
think about the dosage amount and who want the convenience and performance that is delivered in that brand's
performance offering and product form.
Second thing is, yeah, I mean we've been struggling to keep up with demand. I don't think we were merchandised until
last month. Do I have that right, Jon? I mean the first month we were merchandised – ever merchandised, okay, so far
in a U.S. customer was last month. So I would argue, we've been out there with one hand behind our back because we
can't display it and we can't support it.
I think as we've reported, we are moving into Europe. It's a different source of supply, okay? It's not going to impact
what we're trying to do here in the U.S. and North America. But – and I guess the last thing I would say is, hey, in four
decades you work on a lot of disruptive new products and product forms. Start-ups aren't easy. We don't always get it
right the first time. We didn't on Tide Liquid back in the mid-80s. We didn't on Tide with Bleach. We haven't on some

others.
But this one is so unique, it's so discontinuous. And for a group, a segment of consumers, at least so far, early returns,
they seem to like it if they try it and they seem to come back and buy it again. It's clearly creating value for the
industry. And this is – this is a category or industry that's hard to create value in. Left to its own devices, some would
commoditize it, okay, and it's in our interest to keep it differentiated, branded and innovative. So we're taking a mid to
long-term point of view on Tide Pods and we're going to stay at it and we're going to see what its ultimate potential is
with consumers.

Your next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Please proceed.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: Good morning, everyone. And welcome back A.G. I wonder whether you could, in the
context of breaking out the fourth quarter organic sales growth between the U.S., Europe and developing and emerging
markets, not just BRIC, how this execution that you want to improve is going to be helped by the changes in the go-to
markets capabilities? Because one of the things that actually surprised us the most in the last couple of years is that the
bulk of the weakness of your business was the U.S., was in the backyard. So the inability of the company to adapt to
the volatility of the consumer environment was surprising to us. So to what extent this decision-making process needs
to be reviewed beyond making the go-to market capabilities more efficient in had terms of savings? Thank you.
<A - Alan G. Lafley>: Okay. You know, two points that I think are relevant and important to your question. We need
to grow in the U.S., even at 2% to 3% estimates for the future, 3% GDP growth, market growth, you pick a number.
But it's still growing and it's definitely growing faster than Europe or Japan and given our position, we need to grow in
the U.S. and we need to get stronger in the U.S. Point number one. I think you see, hopefully you can see, that we
reinvested in the U.S., we started to get it going again in the U.S. in this last year, and it definitely showed up in the
fourth quarter. But as far I'm concerned, that's only the beginning, okay? Point number one.
Point number two is we need to do a better job in all the important channels where consumers shop, okay? I won't go
into the details, but we're clearly strong in some channels; we play in others. We need to get stronger in those channels,
and we're even testing coverage in channels that we haven't served, in the U.S. and Canada. So I do think there's a
distribution opportunity, and I have a very simple principle. If a meaningful number of consumers shop in this channel,
whether it's e-commerce, whether it's a small urban store or whether it's a drug chain, a club store or whatever, we've
got to be there. We've got to be available. We've got to be in distribution, and we have to have the right mix of brands
and products to meet her or his needs.
I'm totally with you. I think there's an opportunity in the U.S. By the way, we also have opportunities in Western
Europe along the same lines, and that's a huge business for us too. So even though it's not growing, we've got to get our
share, right?
Developing markets is still a huge opportunity for the company, and part of the opportunity is distribution related.
Again, I won't go back into the details, but we've gone back into some big strategically core developing markets, and
we've taken a hard look at our distribution and coverage position, and we're concluding that we have big opportunities
there.
So you will see us; you will see us work hard on making sure we have availability, making sure we're in distribution
and make sure that we have the right brand and product presence where we need to, which is where consumers shop.

<Q - Olivia Tong>: Thank you. Good morning. Welcome back, A.G. Wanted to talk about a little bit about sort of the
commitment to investment spend. You've talked about it on a high level, can you talk about marketing spend you
expect going forward?
And then obviously the U.S. growth was very solid. Can you sort of provide some colors on the sustainability of that
and then the growth drivers behind that? Thank you.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: So first, in terms of advertising spend, we will, again, increase advertising spending pretty
significantly year-on-year. But we'll do it probably 20 basis points lower than the rate of sales growth. That does not
mean less advertising. It does not mean less reach, less frequency. It means more effective advertising, the right mix of
media and, importantly, reducing non-advertising costs that the consumers never see. So that's – we feel good about our
ability to continue to support growth in the business and in a more – with a more efficient model. And A.G., you want
to talk about the U.S.?
<A - Alan G. Lafley>: Yeah. One more – one very quick comment on the point Jon just made. We're interested in
effectiveness, okay? We're interested in effectiveness. We know brand-by-brand, in the U.S. and in a lot of other
markets, the range of effectiveness we can deliver and it's wide. Okay? And so we are holding all of the businesses to a
minimum ROI. Okay? We're pounding away on communication effectiveness. We're pounding away on best media.
Okay? Our digital I think is now up to 35% in the U.S., roughly. It goes up and down 25% to 35%.
We have some businesses and brands where digital is incredibly effective and we're doing more. We have other brands
that are on the learning curve. They've got to get up the learning curve faster. But it's a brand-by-brand,
category-by-category, consumer segment-by-consumer segment set of decisions. And basically, what we're going to do
– our problem is not the total amount we're spending. Our problem is the mix. Our opportunity is the mix, and we're
going to get the mix better and better and better, and there's a lot of opportunity there.
On the second question, which is the U.S. Yeah, we think it's sustainable. We definitely think it's sustainable because if
you crawl inside the fourth quarter results, we're doing much better overall. But there's still – we're still being carried
by fewer businesses than we would like to be. There's an opportunity for all of our businesses to do better in the U.S.
and North America.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Steib with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
<Q - Michael Steib>: Good morning. My question relates to the portfolio overall. You spoke at length about focusing
on the core business. Could you talk a little bit about what criteria you might use to determine what's not core, for the
longer-term growth prospects of the company, since you mentioned I think a couple of times that you might have to
exit some businesses?
<A - Alan G. Lafley>: Strategic fit. Particularly is it a strategic fit with our core strengths and core capabilities. Value
creation, potential and performance. And then, frankly, the ability to deliver. That's it.

At this time, we've reached the time for questions. I would like to turn the call back over for closing remarks.
