Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to EMC's call to discuss our financial results for the third quarter of 2014. Today,
we are joined by EMC Chairman and CEO, Joe Tucci; David Goulden, EMC Information Infrastructure CEO; and
Zane Rowe, EMC's CFO.
Joe will begin our discussion with his view of the trends happening in IT, EMC's vision and strategy, and how the EMC
Federation is managing the transition to the 3rd platform. For this call, David will still be wearing his two hats as CEO
of Information Infrastructure and outgoing CFO of EMC. He will comment on our results and provide a bit more detail
regarding EMC's operation and success this quarter. He will also discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2014.
After the prepared remarks, Joe, David, and Zane will be available to take your questions. We're providing with you
our projected financial model for 2014. This model lays out all of the key assumptions and discrete financial
expectation that are the foundation of our outlook this year. We hope that you find this model helpful in understanding

With that, it is now my pleasure to introduce Joe Tucci. Joe?
Joseph M. Tucci
Thanks, Tony. I'd like to welcome everyone to today's call and thank you for joining us. Overall, we are pleased with
our execution and results in Q3, as our year-over-year revenue and non-GAAP EPS growth accelerated to 9% and 10%,
respectively.
Looking across our three major businesses, VMware grew at 17%, Pivotal at 24%, and EMC II at 6%, representing
very good balance. I believe that when you compare our results with those of our large cap enterprise IT peers, our
growth rate will stand out. Why? Because our strategy, our product offerings, our portfolio of services and solutions,
coupled with crisp execution sets us apart in the minds of our customers.
I would like to thank my 65,000-plus colleagues from EMC, VMware, and Pivotal, and our valued partners around the
world for their professionalism and hard work and their total dedication to our customers' success.
Whenever I meet with investors or analysts, I almost always get the question, is the change we are seeing in IT
spending patterns secular or cyclical in nature? To that question, I always respond that it is primary secular. The reason
for this is that virtually all businesses and forward-thinking governments are embarking on software-defined business
strategies. These strategies call for new ways to interact with their customers and core constituencies, suppliers,
partners and employees, in new real-time ways, ways that are far more agile, rapid and, yes, disruptive.
To free up ample investment dollars to fund these 3rd platform software-defined business models, CIOs must find ways
to constrain spending on their first-generation and second-generation mainframe client server PC-based infrastructures.
To be clear, this is not easy to do, for the vast majority of the business processes and applications, which an enterprise
runs on today, were built on first-generation and second-generation IT platforms, and a majority of these applications
are not going to be replaced any time soon.
So for an IT organization, balancing these two conflicting needs is paramount. But it is a bit like changing the tires on a
bus, while traveling at 70 miles per hour. And it does cause considerable angst and some hesitation in IT spending;
hence, my secular shift answer.
That said, there is also political, economic and social unrest in several areas of the world that does add a cyclical
element to IT spending patterns. Some of these cyclical factors have dominated the news cycle in recent days and
caused some concern. So, while our field forecasts support our updated expectations, we continue to closely monitor
these factors. To be clear, in time of significant secular change, business as usual is not and will not be a viable option.
Major secular IT shifts always come with strong disruptive headwinds, but also with massive opportunities. Our job as
a leadership team is to chart out a course that rides through the waves of disruption and capitalizes on the vast
opportunity that the 3rd IT platform will present in cloud computing, mobile, big data and security, and this is exactly
where the EMC family of companies is focused. And as our Q3 results indicate, we are gaining significant traction.

With our products, services and solutions, we help our customers maximize their efficiency and effectiveness in their
second-generation IT platforms. We help our customers in their journey to third-generation hybrid, private and public
cloud data center technologies. We help our customers with mobile device management and security strategies for their
employees, partners and customers. We help our customers build real-time experiences with new agile business
models, and we help our customers with their cyber security needs.
We are also being bold by investing heavily in new growth vectors. As we discussed last quarter, EMC II, VMware and
Pivotal have made numerous big bets in advanced technologies that are very disruptive in their nature.
With Nicira NSX, we are targeting software-defined networking. With AirWatch, we are capitalizing on a need for
mobile device management and security. With Pivotal, we are developing new cloud and data fabrics, along with
technologies that build and deploy applications faster.
With ViPR, ScaleIO and ECS, we are leading a heterogeneous software-defined cloud scale storage. With XtremeIO,
we are offering high-performance flash scale-out storage. With DSSD, we are developing extremely fast rack-scale
flash storage for 3rd platform data centers. And in our VCE joint venture, we pioneered and now lead in converged
infrastructure.
To demonstrate the potential and progress of these technology investments; in 2014, we expect combined revenue from
NSX, AirWatch, Pivotal, XtremeIO, ViPR and ScaleIO to be approximately $1 billion and growing extremely rapidly.
Additionally, ECS is just beginning, and DSSD is still in development. And David will talk about VCE's
accomplishments in a bit.
Collectively, these technology investment bets cost us over $6 billion and are having a negative high-teen cents per
share impact to 2014 earnings. We are making these investments because of our conviction that they will pay off
handsomely for our shareholders in the years ahead, as each of these six product areas has $1 billion potential for us in
annualized revenue.
In addition to the investments I just mentioned, I am pleased to say that today we are announcing the next phase of
evolution for VCE, our converged infrastructure joint venture with Cisco.
In this next phase, EMC will have a controlling interest in VCE, which will continue to operate with its own mission,
charter and structure reporting directly to David Goulden. We believe this move will provide VCE with the agility
required to continue to lead the competitive converged infrastructure segment, as well as expand the solutions which it
can offer to customers.
Cisco and VMware will continue to have a strong commitment to and equity interest in VCE. I look forward to blazing
new trails with the 2,000-plus people from VCE and I would like to welcome them to the EMC family.
Let me now close with a few additional comments on Q3. This past quarter, we have had a lot of interest, meetings and
feedback with and from our investors. And I want you to know that we take this input very seriously. We also received
quite a bit of press coverage on numerous different speculations. Through all of this coverage, we continue to focus on
our mission at hand. I assure you we have great assets and a strong market position and our board and management are
very focused on enhancing shareholder value. We plan to complete our $3 billion 2014 buyback before the end of this
year.
Now, we are also working on our capital allocation policy for 2015, as always, with a focus on the needs of our
business and shareholder returns. You can expect our approach to shareholder returns in 2015 to be aggressive and
consistent with our company's need to maintain strategic and financial flexibility.
Thank you again for joining us. But before I turn it over to David Goulden for more details on Q3 in 2014, I'd like to
introduce you to our new Executive Vice President and CFO, Zane Rowe. Zane was the former CFO of Continental
Airlines and United Continental, where he did a fabulous job and built a great reputation with both his colleagues and
investors. Zane was recently at Apple, reporting to Tim Cook running consumer and enterprise sales in North America.
We are pleased to welcome Zane back into the CFO fold. I know he'll be a great add to the EMC leadership team.

Zane, welcome. The mic is yours.
Zane C. Rowe
Thank you, Joe. And thank you to everyone at EMC for the warm welcome I've received so far, and good morning to
all of you on the call. I'm looking forward to getting to know many of you over time. I'm excited to be joining the team
right now for a number of reasons. EMC has a proven ability to foresee change, invest wisely and execute successfully.
As a result, we are very well-positioned and are taking advantage of some of the massive changes that are occurring
right now in cloud, in mobile, and in big data. With the leadership position we've built in the data center, I believe we
have the kind of opportunity that just doesn't come along every day. The results this quarter strengthen my view.
Obviously, our continued share gains in storage and ongoing market leadership in virtualization are highlights. The
success we're seeing in our investment areas such as ViPR, XtremIO, VCE, AirWatch and Pivotal is encouraging
evidence of our ability to position ourselves for future growth, and I believe the best is yet to come. We have industry
leading assets and talent, combined with a sound strategy, a flexible business model, and an ability to execute that is
second to none.
As David will discuss, it was a solid Q3 and the teams I've met with are working hard driving results in Q4. I'm thrilled
to join them and I'm looking forward to helping EMC continue to create and grow value for shareholders, customers
and employees.
Thanks again, Joe. Back to you.
Joseph M. Tucci
Thank you, Zane. And again, welcome. It's truly great to have you on the team. As I turn the call over to David for his
formal remarks, I would like to personally thank him for doing double duty as EMC's CFO and leading EMC II. David,
you have been and are a pure pleasure to work with.
Thank you for everything you do. The floor is yours.
David I. Goulden
Thanks, Joe. I would also like to welcome Zane. It's great to have you on board. I'm sure you've realized by now that
you're inheriting a world-class finance organization, so I know you'll fit right in. Zane has worked closely with me and
our team over the last few weeks as we prepared for today's call, and I look forward to transitioning more of the lead to
him in future calls.
So good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss a strong Q3 that was on track and in line
with our expectations. We believe our success in the quarter was in no small part due to the value proposition we've
created with our strategically aligned businesses as customers seek to take advantage of cloud, mobile, big data and
security technologies.
We believe we've anticipated and invested for the changes in IT better than our peers; and as a result, we are
outgrowing them. This is evidenced by our Q3 results. We grew consolidated revenue to a third quarter record of $6
billion or 9% year-on-year, and non-GAAP EPS grew 10% to $0.44. We saw strength across the business with Pivotal
revenues up 24%, revenue from VMware up 17%, and EMC Information Infrastructure revenue up 6%.
Within our major geographies, revenue grew 8% in North America, 15% in EMEA, 4% in APJ, and 1% in Latin
America. Our BRIC+13 markets also grew at a healthy 9%.

Looking at line items driving our earnings growth, consolidated gross margin in Q3 was 63.7%, down 10 bps
sequentially and 20 bps compared with Q3 of last year. Within this results gross margin of Pivotal and VMware
declined, reflecting the impact of their growth initiatives as well as a continuing shift to subscription-based revenues of
Pivotal.
EMC II gross margin was approximately flat both sequentially and year-on-year. We saw good improvements in
margins for mixed flash pricing, and leverage from lower fixed costs. However, these improvements were masked this
quarter by difficult compares with some variable cost benefits we recognized in Q3 of last year.
Normalizing for these benefits, we would have shown solid year-on-year gross margin improvements for EMC II. The
increasing mix of VMware was helpful to the overall Q3 gross margin rates. Overall, gross margin profit dollar
increases as the $0.11 per share for the quarter's non-GAAP EPS versus last year's.
Operating expenses grew 9% year-on-year, reflecting major investments we're making at Pivotal and VMware, and
while we continue to make significant investments in EMC II, operating expenses there grew only 3%. This increase in
consolidated OpEx in Q3 over last year amounted to about $0.07 per share.
Non-operating expense was higher versus last year's Q3 due to VCE and FX-related expenses. The reduction to our
share count versus last year contributed $0.02. As a result, we finished Q3 with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.44,
again in line with our expectations.
We generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow in Q3, and $3.2 billion year-to-date, approximately $700 million higher
than our non-GAAP net income year-to-date. Our cash and investments at quarter-end were $15.4 billion, $3.6 billion
of which is in EMC II U.S. We repurchased approximately $375 million worth of EMC shares in Q3 and returned
about $240 million to shareholders via our quarterly dividend. We plan to complete the balance of our share buyback
commitments of about $1.6 billion before year end.
Successful enterprises balanced this return of capital with growing the returns on shareholder capital through intelligent
management of the business. Through our strategy and investments, we are addressing several great opportunities in
some of the hottest segments of technology, and we're incredibly well-positioned to continue to build the business as
we move forward.
IT is at a threshold, where CIOs are looking to do things for their business that were impossible just a few years ago.
Among their priorities are new cloud agnostic application development via platform-as-a-service. Simple and
automated, virtualized scale infrastructure that can connect seamlessly and securely to off-premise environments as
needed via enterprise hybrid clouds. And keeping architectural options open with solutions that allow for choice.
Customers are seeking strong partners that are well-equipped to help them achieve their new IT goals. The broad base
of technology and expertise available through EMC is a distinct competitive advantage for us, and one that grew many
customers to us in Q3. Trusting EMC as the only vendor capable of the delivery in time and quality for the entire
infrastructure stack were key to the choice of EMC and VMware technologies at a global bank in Australia.
And the combination of an even broader set of EMC and VMware technologies drove the win at a state government in
the Midwest, which expects to fund its strategic IT and cloud transformation with savings captured from its
transformation to a consolidated standardized infrastructure.
There is a desire among customers for us to be more tightly integrated and provide more cohesive solutions to help
them with bigger problems. This is a common refrain. We are having strategic meetings with many customers,
including a recent and well-publicized meeting at a large financial institution where they're asking us to work more
closely together, not less.
We expect to grow the number of wins that leverage capabilities from across the Federation considerably as we build
out our portfolio of joint solutions from EMC II, VMware, and Pivotal.
Pivotal is the fastest growing of our Federation businesses, benefiting from the transition to next-gen applications by
the enterprise. Q3 revenue grew 24% year-on-year, driven by strength at Pivotal Labs and Pivotal CF, our commercial

distribution of Cloud Foundry which also gained traction in Q3.
Large enterprises look for platform-as-a-service on which they can build out their next-gen applications over the next
several years. In the early stage of these build-outs, where we find ourselves today, just a fraction of the application that
really builds on Pivotal CF exists. As more applications and the data associated with these applications get created, the
revenue associated with these implementation grows along with them.
We continue to expand the number of customers adopting Pivotal CF in Q3, including the addition of three major
financial institutions, three technology companies, a major sports league network, a mobile carrier and Lockheed
Martin. Lockheed Martin is using Pivotal CF to improve the deployment of systems and software for missile and flight
systems R&D with the help of Pivotal Labs and analytic tools, Pivotal HD and HAWQ.
The aforementioned sports network approached Pivotal Labs to create a system for measuring cellular data and live
video usage through mobile applications. Using Pivotal software solution including the big data suites and Pivotal CF,
the team is creating a solution that will optimize media revenue through analytics. And these, as with all Pivotal CF
deployments, we are laying the foundation for what we expect to be many years of high value business partnerships.
Pivotal is benefiting from its place as the leading commercial distribution of Cloud Foundry, as well as promised place
in the Federation, as many of its wins in Q3 were in partnership with other EMC businesses.
VMware too continues its rapid growth, with revenue within EMC up 17% year-on-year in Q3, driven by continued
traction in VMware's three areas of focus, software-defined data center, hybrid cloud solutions and end-user
computing. The expansion of VMware's business beyond service virtualization was evidenced by its non-standalone
vSphere license bookings in the quarter, which were once again greater than 50% of total licensed bookings. VMware
has several other indicators of success in each of its strategic areas of focus in the past quarter. In SDDC, NSX
customer count grew to over 250, from over 150 last quarter.
In hybrid cloud, the newly branded vCloud Air continues to expand its global footprint. With a new location in New
Jersey, the announcement of an early access program in our first locations in Japan and Germany, and an early access
program for vCloud Air government service in the U.S. vCloud Air Object Storage joined VMware's hybrid cloud
portfolio. vCloud Air Object Storage is based on EMC ViPR technology and also extremely scalable, cost-effective and
durable storage for unstructured data.
And in a survey by Jefferies, VMware scored at the top of the list of cloud providers with 80% of respondents
considering VMware for parts of their hybrid cloud deployments. This enthusiasm was collaborated by a survey of over
400 of our channel partners, where VMware topped the list of cloud service provider the partners carry or intent to
carry well ahead of Microsoft and Google. And in end user computing, we grew new license bookings more than 60%
over last year's Q3; and within this, desktop license bookings, once again, grew double-digits year-over-year.
Finally, with the OpenStack and contained announcements in the quarter, VMware clearly embraces one of the key
values of the Federation, that of customer choice. It's through choice that we're able to deliver tremendous agility to our
customers.
Now, moving to EMC Information Infrastructure. Year-on-year, Q3 revenue growth in storage accelerated to 6%,
demonstrating clear share gains and traction of several of our strategic investments, including notably strong growth in
XtremIO, ViPR and ScaleIO. We also benefited from considerable solid growth in our unified and backup recovery
portfolio of 6%, which was helped by accelerated growth of both VNX and Data Domain.
The decline in the high-end eased from last quarter to 7% year-on-year. The VMAX3 became generally available on
September 26 and we're pleased that shipments of new systems in the quarter were in line with expectations. Some of
these went to Superna, which operate data centers where companies can test and develop highly available and scalable
DR systems. Superna adopted VMAX3 for its performance, its highly available architecture and its ability to quickly
and simply provision storage. These features make it an ideal platform to build and simplify cloud-enabled DR
solutions for their customers. With the game changing capabilities that VMAX3 brings to high-end, we expect to
extend our lead in this segment of the market as the VMAX3 ramps starting in Q4 and through next year.

Emerging Storage products grew 47% year-on-year, and this category is now almost 50% the size of the high-end.
CIOs continue to invest heavily in areas that will take their business to the 3rd platform and are redeploying dollars
from their 2nd platform savings to do so.
Flash, software-defined storage and Hadoop are among the hottest trends in the data center right now, and we invested
early to establish leading solutions in each. XtremIO, our all-flash array, surpassed the $0.5 billion mark on an
annualized demand run rate in Q3. This is an incredible milestone for a product that's been on the market for just over
three quarters.
XtremIO continues to be very popular with customers building out mobile strategies with virtual desktop
infrastructures. And with the launch of snapshots and compression earlier this year, we saw a notable increase in the
deployments of XtremIO for database in Q3.
There have been two major keys to success here. One is our superior scale-out architecture as evidenced by a win rate
of over 90% in Q3, based on the number of deals. The other is the ability of our sales force to quickly identify and seize
opportunities for XtremIO technology.
Our software-defined storage solutions, including ViPR controller, ViPR data services, and ScaleIO, enable customers
to automate and simplify their storage environments. By abstracting array-based storage to drive high levels of
automation and by providing new storage systems like Objects and HDFS on commodity off-the-shelf hardware, ViPR
allows customers to bridge their existing and next-gen workloads. As a result, its popularity is ramping rapidly.
Isilon's growth accelerated again in Q3, driven by strength in financial services and manufacturing, as well as by newer
growth vectors in the areas of video surveillance and analytics, where its native Hadoop capabilities allow cost and
time efficient analysis of big data. In fact, Isilon now has over 400 customers running Hadoop on iPhone systems.
Pivotal is a popular analytics option here, as is Cloudera. One of the bigger wins in the quarter was in partnership with
Pivotal for the delivery of a database solution for a U.S.-based Internet company's operations in Japan. The ISP shows
Isilon to simplify management and improve processing of the environment, which had been running on application
servers. The improved processing speed the customer will be able to gain with Pivotal HAWQ were an important part
of the value proposition.
Our Emerging Storage product group's 47% growth in Q3 propelled us to a $2.3 billion annualized revenue run rate.
Clearly, our investments here are paying off, and our strategy is working. While cloud, mobile and big data are driving
changes to the underlying technology, they're also driving changes to deployment models and selling the motions as
well. The popularity of converged infrastructure, as evidenced through the success of VSPEX and Vblocks, speaks
volumes about customers' preference for simplicity and speed and ease of deployments.
Our channel partners continue to drive the success of VSPEX's referenced architectures, demand for which grew at
over 30% in Q3. Our partners have been essential to our ongoing share gains and in Q3 grew revenues considerably
faster than the rate of storage overall.
VCE surpassed a $2 billion annualized demand run rate for Vblock and Vblock-related products and services exiting
Q3, which was its sixth consecutive quarter of greater than 50% growth in demand. Bringing the rapidly growing VCE
more fully into EMC is a great move, as it allows us to more fully benefit from the clear leader in the converged
infrastructure market segments.
I would like to welcome VCE CEO, Praveen Akkiraju; President, Frank Hauck, their management teams and VCE's
more than 2,000 employees, who are experts in the design, building, sale deployments and support of CI systems into
EMC. Within EMC, we'll expand the chart of VCE to become the converged infrastructure systems integration and
enterprise hybrid cloud solutions arm of our company.
Our professional services grew nicely in Q3, benefiting from an increasing focus upon delivering business outcomes as
well as from its role in assembling cross-Federation solutions. EMC's services business led a number of engagements in
the quarter that leverage a combination of technology from EMC II, VMware, and Pivotal, and in some cases all three
together, including a Dutch bank building out secure IT-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service, ; U.S.-based healthcare

provider building out IT-as-a-service and a big data analytics platform; a Canadian oil company looking to simplify its
IT by deploying a hybrid cloud; a Chinese service provider looking to build out platform and security as a service
offerings. I'll stop here because I think you get the picture, and there are several more laid out in our slides.
Again, these are only some of the cross-company deals facilitated by our professional services teams and there are
many more wins that leverage our cross-EMC capabilities that happen either without a consulting engagement or with
partner support.
In fact, bringing these solutions together on a more scalable and repeatable basis, is the objective of our Federation
solution sets, drawn from a combination of technologies from EMC, VMware, and Pivotal. These engineered solutions
are focused on 3rd platform opportunities, and make it easier for customers to get value from the combination of
products across the EMC entities.
We just launched the first of these five solutions the Federation software-defined data center earlier this month and
expect to launch the remaining four; virtual desktop, enterprise data lake, platform-as-a-service, and security analytics
over the coming quarters.
Turning now to security and content management; security remains a top priority as organizations build out hybrid
clouds, RSA grew 4% over Q3 of last year, with strength in the newer part of the business being offset by lower growth
in the traditional identity segments.
Our Information Intelligence Group revenue grew 3% from last year with Syncplicity continuing to do very well. I'm
proud of the strong financial performance EMC II demonstrated in Q3 and would like to extend my thanks to the entire
team who worked hard to grow the business and control costs. I would also like to thank our customers and partners for
their continued support.
Now on to guidance; we're updating our expectations for 2014 and now expect to achieve revenue of approximately
$24.5 billion, still up 6% year-on-year, but reduced by $75 million due to the currency headwinds we now expect in
Q4.
Non-GAAP operating margins are approximately 24%. Non-GAAP EPS of approximately $1.90 due to a slower
decline in shares outstanding than we anticipated three months ago. And free cash flow of approximately $5.35 billion,
driven by a $450 million reduction of VMware free cash flow from their July guidance.
Finally, we expect the addition of VCE to be neutral to our 2014 EPS results. In 2015, consolidating VCE will result in
higher revenues and the movement of non-operating expenses to operating expenses, which will lower operating
margins. We expect the net effect of these changes to be slightly diluted to 2015 EPS. We're excited about the growth
and strategic potential of VCE and expect it to contribute to EPS growth beyond 2015.
In closing, we have a strong competitive position and successful strategy, and these advantages have enabled us to
outgrow our peers. More importantly, these advantages, combined with the leading portfolio of technology assets we've
carefully assembled over the past several years, increase our relevance with customers at a time of unprecedented
change and opportunity. The result is that we continue to out-execute today and we're making the right strategic
investments to out-execute in the future.
With that, I'll turn over to Tony to moderate today's Q&A. Tony.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. Our first question comes from Aaron Rakers of Stifel. Your line is open.
<Q - Aaron C. Rakers>: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I want to touch on the guidance and what would be
implied as a deceleration in growth for your EMC Information Infrastructure business into the calendar fourth quarter.
And that on the heels of what looks to be obviously an important high-end product cycle. So, can you talk a little bit
about your assumption there? What you're seeing in terms of the installed base of the VMAX3 and how we should
think about the cannibalistic effect of the XtremIO product in that installed base? Thank you.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Aaron, this is David. Good morning. Let me take that. So, I think you need to look at the Q3
versus Q4 progression on a sequential basis and it's very much in line with what we talked about coming into the year.
Bear in mind, we've actually got quite a big sequential growth in Q3 to Q4, because the change in business practices
around the way we're handling the quarter-end. So, the reason why you see the absolute growth rates change going
down from Q3 to Q4 is really to do with the compare with last year; and this year is sequentially exactly in line with
what we've been talking about.
You also mentioned VMAX and XtremIO, so let me touch upon those. As we said, we started shipping the VMAX3 at
the end of the third quarter. We expect to start ramping up shipments into quarter four. Remember, this is a very major
architectural change in the VMAX family. Every 6 years or 7 years, we introduce a brand new architecture. It takes
longer to get to the 50% transition than when we do a tech turn. This is one of those longer transitions, so expect it to
be in the middle of next year before we get to the 50% mark in terms of percentage of new system being shipped.
And then finally, you mentioned XtremIO, which we always have phenomenal growth in the quarter of XtremIO, I
talked about a $0.5 billion run rate. As we said last time, most of those systems are going into either net new
applications or competitive environments. About 20% of the XtremIO systems we're installing, are basically taking
applications from either a VMAX or a VNX. So, understand, it can impact both systems, but 80% are going into net
new environments for us.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thank you for the question. Next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Next question is Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thanks. I have a question, a clarification for David and a question for Joe. David, for
you, on the gross margin within the information storage business, it did disappoint again and there was some
commentary about variable costs. Could you just explain that again or be a bit more specific?
And then the question for Joe I have is that I appreciate there's been obviously lots of conversations with your investors
and lots of strategic discussions EMC are having. My basic question is, is there a point at which the outcome of
whatever you're discussing is going to be communicated to the street and is there a timeframe we can think about for
that? Many thanks.
<A - David I. Goulden>: All right. So, Kulbinder, good morning. Let me go first. Yes, on the gross margins, let me
explain to you, first of all, year-on-year, as I said on the call, the important things that we look at, are what's happening
to the impact of a mix in the portfolio and pricing; and as I said, we got benefit from those year-on-year. Also, what's
happening to our fixed costs, the changes we're making to our business processes are helping us to bring our fixed costs
down. We've got good leverage from that on the higher volume.

The compare year-on-year is not as strong as you would have expected, because it's masked by some variable cost
benefits we got in Q3 of last year. Those variable cost benefits related to some product vendor rebates and some other
credits that really helps the gross margins a lot in Q3 last year.
If you took those out, you'd see really strong growth year-on-year. Another way to look at it is that we did see gross
margins increase sequentially from Q2 to Q3 on a modest volume increase, so you see a very normalized impact of
margins going throughout the year, as we expected. And then, of course, what I just talked about is going to help us
also going into Q4.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: I'm not going to answer your question specifically. Let me say it this way, I do believe, we
owe our investors and those that follow us an update, and kind of an Investor Day and Analyst Day, and we will do that
early in the new year.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thank you.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thanks, Kulbinder. Next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Next question is Maynard Um of Wells Fargo.
<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Hi, thanks. VCE becoming an EMC business seems to put greater odds against parts of
VMware's portfolio on the converged side. I'm just wondering, if you can help us understand this dynamic and how this
plays out really kind of going forward. And then, Joe, could you just touch on your plans following February of 2015?
Thanks.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Right. Maynard, good morning. VCE coming into the portfolio, bear in mind, VCE is
producing converged infrastructure based upon building blocks that come from EMC, VMware and Cisco. So, bringing
it in doesn't really change that profile, and as you already know, EMC is partnering with VMware around the
EVO:RAIL initiative to produce low-end CI systems as well. So, bringing it in really doesn't change the positioning of
the portfolio. We'll continue to build Vblocks. We'll build an expanded family of Vblocks going forward over time as
part of EMC.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: You asked about my plans and they really haven't changed. You should view February of
2015 as a guidepost, not a definitive date. I have told the board in many discussions, and they are actively involved in
the succession process obviously. It's theirs to do. I have told them that if they had a person and you wanted to move
earlier, that's fine with me.
If you need me to stay a little bit longer, and I'm not talking years, I'm talking a little bit longer, months, quarters, that's
fine. And then, I also have offered that if you wanted me to stay on in some kind of Chairman role, I would certainly
contemplate that favorably. So, that's kind of where we are.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thanks. Before we move on, we have to remind you that we're only taking one
question, please. No clarifications, so you're going to have to pick one. Next one, please?

Thank you. Next question is Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: I figured Tony was going to put that law down before I asked a question, so I'll stick to one.
Maybe if you could just touch on some of the linearity that you saw in the quarter. One of your larger peers, IBM,
obviously talked about a big slowdown in the month of September. Your geo data doesn't suggest much is happening
there. Maybe in APJ, there's some softness; but maybe just touch on the linearity in the quarter, if you saw anything on
a geographical basis that stood out to you towards the end?

<A - David I. Goulden>: Yes. Good morning. And thank you for the one question. Our linearity, obviously, we saw a
good September. We saw, as you would expect in Q3, particularly with Europe being relatively quiet for a couple of
months and coming back in September.
In order to have a strong Q3, you need to have a strong September, and we saw that. We did see, as usual, customer
caution kind of push things more towards the back end, and the back-end loaded nature of the quarters continue.
From a geography point of view, let me just make a couple of comments about how we saw things developing. And
obviously, we saw a strong growth in Europe. I mean, much stronger than our peer set. And there we saw really good
growth in every market apart from Russia. Russia was down significantly year-on-year for kind of obvious reasons. But
without exception, we saw strong growth across the business in Europe.
In APJ, in China, we saw double-digit growth, which we were pleased about. We saw some continued weakness in
Japan, which was largely due to currency, and that kind of gives you, I think some of the highlights around geo flavor.
I would comment in North America, we did see a bounce-back in the federal business. Of course, we had a really tough
year last year on the EMC side of things because of the budget problems a year-ago and we saw a much more normal
quarter in the Q3 in federal.

Thank you. Next question is Keith Bachman of Bank of Montreal.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi, my one question for Joe is strategic choices. Joe, your stock has underperformed the
S&P over a number of different measurement periods; one years, three years and five years. So, at least as measured
against one metric, stock price, your strategy has not been rewarding shareholders. You've acknowledged that you've
spoken with shareholders, but it sounds like you want to embark on more of the same strategy. And so, the broader
question is, are you willing to consider more meaningful changes in your strategy? And as part of that, it has been
widely reported, and HP has even acknowledged it, that you've had some M&A conversations. If you could please fit in
your answer what led you to the conclusion to at least have a conversations that would be a large M&A deal? Thank
you.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: First of all, I don't know, I'm not aware of any statements that HP made, but we have been
very clear that we don't comment on speculation rumors. So, I'm not going to do that today.
And talking about the business, it's kind of baffling in a way because if you look at, counting this year, assuming we
make the forecast, and we believe we will, if you looked at our top line over the last three years, we've grown at 7%. If
you look at our free cash flow, we've grown at 8% and if you look at our EPS, it's also about 8%, and that's CAGR. So,
obviously, the stock price has not moved a lot, so I agree. So, it's not reflecting our performance.
So as I said before, our management board is very focused on enhancing shareholder value, but we also believe, and
again, this is what we do believe with Elliott, that we are in good businesses and we have a strong position in those
good businesses. We do have great technology assets. We have a very talented leadership team and a great workforce.
And, yep, we're undervalued, and that's why we're undertaking, and making sure that we're very focused on enhancing
shareholder value. But the underlying performance of the business, if you compare it to companies kind of born in
when we were born, which is we were born in the client/server age. So, if you look at companies born in the
client/server age or before, we are right at the top in terms of producing results.
So, it is a bit baffling, and I think we have tremendous bets. David talked about $2.3 billion now our emerging markets
on EMC II side. VMware posted good growth numbers yesterday on their emerging site. And Pivotal is 100%

So, I know we have great assets and so we're taking all these things and basically saying we need to, A, communicate
better, continue to retain customer confidence and wins which we're doing and make sure that we focus on enhancing
shareholder value. So, a longer answer than I probably should have done, but that's what's going through our heads
right now.

Operator
Thank you. Next question is Ittai Kidron of Oppenheimer.
<Q - Ittai Kidron>: Thanks. And Joe, I was hoping to get a little bit of color behind what drove the change in the VCE
ownership, what was working, what was not. Why did you feel that the partnership with Cisco and VMware on this had
to change from what – it was working up until now? And with the change also in management there, what new
opportunities are now opened up to VCE that were potentially more limited under the previous ownership structure?
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: I'll give a little color but this business VCE is going to report to David, so let me let David
start.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Okay. So, Ittai, let me kind of start where you ended. So, in terms of what we can do with
VCE as a member of the EMC family, it's actually very exciting. First of all, understand what we've built with VCE.
We've built the number one player in the converged infrastructure marketplace with now a $2 billion revenue run rate
growing very rapidly. Over 2,000 people are immersed in this technology. It's a really key strategic asset and to have
the ability to bring into EMC is very exciting because CI, of course, is very important to our strategy as a company. So,
we created this particular part of the strategy outside the company and bringing it in really lets us now double down
with it.
So, in terms of focus and expansion, first of all, it lets us – we'll be basically maintaining, but slightly expanding the
charter inside of EMC. First of all, we'll expand the charter to over time produce an even broader range of converged
infrastructure solutions than we have right now from VCE. But very importantly, you've heard us talk a lot about
enterprise hybrid cloud.
You'll hear us talk a little bit more about it in a couple of weeks' time. What we're going to also charter VCE we're
doing is to become the solutions arm of the company to really help deliver these enterprise hybrid clouds to our
customers, because a lot of our enterprise hybrid cloud activities are actually based on top of Vblocks.
So, having the Vblock capability and the ability to integrate the Vblock and now put more software on top of it to really
help our customers get all the way up to enterprise hybrid cloud is a really great opportunity to expand upon the charter.
So, that's what we're doing with VCE as it comes in. We do expect it to close just before the end of this year. And at
that point in time, we'll move into the mode, which I just talked about.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: I assure you this was done with very close cooperation of Cisco. I think you'll all agree that
any time you do a joint venture, they never just kind of sit there and percolate forever. They need to morph and change.
And this is one of those morphings. VCE was created and John Chambers says it well, it's how you not only react to,
but lead in an industry transition that defines a company and you could see VCE was right there on the top of that and
kind of led the entire industry.
And, again, this is morphing and I think this will actually improve our relationship with Cisco and they're still
committed and obviously an owner and I just think it's going to work better for both companies and we think it's going
to continue to be a major growth driver for EMC.

Next question is Nehal Chokshi of Technology Insights Research (sic) [Maxim Group].
<Q - Nehal Chokshi>: Thank you. I'm actually with the Maxim Group now. Can you talk about how you expect each
of your major service product lines to perform in the fourth quarter? I'm especially interested in understanding
expectations for mid-range and backup and recovery services, given that we're now looking at a relatively tougher
comp for the December quarter and vice versa for high-end, given its just refreshed product line?
<A - David I. Goulden>: I believe your question was to do with the fourth quarter. I just want to clarify before I
answer it.
<Q - Nehal Chokshi>: Correct, correct.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Thank you. Obviously, we're not going to get into all the puts and takes in the fourth quarter
going forward. We don't guide to that level, but I can give you some direction obviously. We would expect on the
high-end, the product cycle, as we start to ramp up through VMAX3, to help us.
So, as I've said, I expect, in aggregate the second half of the year to be better than the first half of the year from a
VMAX point of view. We see continued steady progress in our unified backup recovery platforms and we expect to see
continued growth in the emerging markets. Obviously, some of those are tougher compares; but there, again, a year
ago, we didn't have XtremIO apart from in a very minor way. So, I think that you're going to see the portfolio kind of
shape up broadly similarly in the fourth quarter than you saw in the third quarter.
<Q - Nehal Chokshi>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Next question is Brian Alexander of Raymond James.
<Q - Brian G. Alexander>: Okay. Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to go back to the VCE and I want to just ask
what gives you the confidence that Cisco will remain committed to the partnership and why shouldn't investors be
concerned about customer retention here as maybe customers sense the relationship between Cisco and EMC is
fraying?
And especially as it sounds like you're considering forming partnerships with more of their competitors, at least that's
what I read into your expanding relationship comments, David. And I guess related to that, who ultimately controls the
customer relationship in most of these VCE deals? Thanks.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: This is Joe. I'll start and give it to David. In the VCE deals, VCE has a considerable sales
force there, and they're on top of this. What gives you confidence is common sense. This is a $2 billion business, which
is very meaningful for both Cisco and EMC. Our customers are applauding this. And there's a lot of rumors floating
around this past quarter, and VCE grew over 50%. So, it has got momentum, it's got customer acceptance. With over
1,000 customers, over 2,000 Vblocks, both cultures of EMC and Cisco are going to be – we're going to support the hell
out of our customers, and we're going to try to continue to drive as much revenue together as we could. And that's
exactly how – when I get together with John, that's how we talk.
And I believe Cisco is one of our top, top partners and will remain one of our top, top partners. And obviously, there's
co-opetition is alive and well. And they do sell their UCS servers and Nexus switches with other competitors of ours.

We'll have some of that. But we both understand how that kind of co-opitate, so to speak, if that's a word.
<A - David I. Goulden>: And, Brian, just to pick up on that, obviously VCE is and will continue to be one of Cisco's
biggest partners in terms of a chunk of that $2 billion is obviously going to them across their server and networking
line.
Cisco remains an investor in VCE. We have multi-year engineering, resell and support agreements between the
companies, so customers can be assured of continuity. VCE comes into EMC intact as an organization, with its
omission it's an operating chart, it's an org structure, we're not going to break something that's working very nicely.
So bear in mind that VCE, as Joe says, does have a sales force, does have a service force, and that will remain inside of
EMC as a specialty group, it has its own engineering team as well. That all remains inside of EMC as a specialty team
focused upon converged infrastructure.
So, initially, I think the customers will see very little change. In fact, for the foreseeable future, existing customers will
see nothing change. There's a strong commitment to continue to have Vblocks. Vblocks will continue to be exclusively
technology from Cisco, EMC and VMware.
<Q - Brian G. Alexander>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Next question is from Andy Nowinski of Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Andrew James Nowinski>: Okay. Good morning. I'd just like to go back to your comments about 20% of
applications moving to XtremIO. Is that enough to cause customers that were previously buying multiple VMAXes to
only buy one VMAX system now and could there be similar impacts to VMAX from customers that may be moving
some data to a public cloud provider such as Amazon to only buy one VMAX system? Thanks.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Andy, let me clarify that statement, because I think you maybe misunderstood. I didn't say
that 20% of VMAX applications moving to XtremIO; far from it, I said that of the XtremIO systems which are being
shipped, 20% of those which are being shipped are being shipped into environments where people are moving
applications from a VMAX or a VNX. It's a very, very different statement.
I'm glad that you asked it, because I don't want that to be misunderstood. There's nowhere near 20% of applications
moving off. Now, there are clearly some very performance hungry applications sitting on top of enterprise class storage
systems that can do better from an all-flash storage array, but today it's nowhere near 20 points.
So, the answer to that is, it is most unlikely that customers are going to kind of buy a less VMAX in total because
they're buying to XtremIO. What customers are doing is, they're doing much more tiering where they're going into
existing environments and taking those real always on performance hungry applications and moving them on to the
XtremIO tier and then keeping all of their mix workload applications that benefit from the benefits of flash and disk
together on their VMAX systems.
But, again, to clarify, it's 20% of the XtremIO systems that we're shipping are going into environments where they're
taking applications off of VMAX or a VNX. And 80% of the new XtremIO systems are going into net new application
environments or competitive environments.

Thank you. Our next question is Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Kathryn Huberty>: Hey, David, Joe highlighted disruptive investments that are costing high-teens EPS in 2014.
Does that headwind grow or decline in 2015? And are there cost efficiencies you can drive in the legacy products to
fund these and other investments going forward?
<A - David I. Goulden>: Okay. Yes. I mean, we've wanted to clarify that the investments we have there are in the
high-teens this year; and bear in mind, we have already been self-funding a whole lot of those. So, we've been able to
create this, if you like, high-teens spending envelope while still growing our EPS in line with revenue by redirecting a
whole lot of investments from more traditional areas into these new areas. So, we're still being growing our EPS, while
making these strong investments.
As going forward, incrementally, as each one of them kind of gets to approaching $1 billion range, then they start to go
less from the negative column in towards the positive column, obviously the one that's closest to doing that right out of
all the things we've talked about is XtremIO.
But obviously, a lot of these are going to continue well into 2015. So, for example, DSSD, we didn't even have that for
the full-year of this year. We're going to have it for the full-year of next year. We're going to continue to grow it going
forward. So, there's going to be certainly a healthy investment appetite across these six areas going forward, certainly
into 2015; and in some cases, quite well beyond before they start to contribute.

Thank you. Next question is Ben Reitzes of Barclays.
<Q - Benjamin Reitzes>: Hey, thanks. Obviously, a lot of things have been asked, but I just wanted to clarify, Joe, that
you're going to give a comment in February or it sounds like early next year with regard to your strategy. Does that
imply that you're doing a strategic review now and would you be willing to say now what that strategy implies for your
VMware ownership though just to take any uncertainty off the table? And I'm sure you love this question, but
obviously that's what everybody's thinking. So, thanks.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: I'm going to stay with basically the statements I've made. I think you probably expected me to
do that, but it was a good try. We understand the balance, right. We just got the question on those six areas of
investment, which I highlighted. There's others, but I highlighted those six.
Obviously, if we didn't do them and we took the $6 billion that we used off the balance sheet and we took the EPS hit
of high-teens and invested that all into buybacks, our stock could probably be higher today. But when you see a secular
shift like we're seeing and I understand the need for shareholder return, and we talked about next year enhancing,
basically making sure we're aggressive and consistent with the needs of maintain our strategic and financial flexibility.
So, we are thinking about that aspect heavily.
But on to itself, buybacks, spin-offs, things like that are not a strategy. They're basically a tactic. And I'm not taking
anything away from tactics, but you need to build a strategy and we've invested in this strategy and we have some great
assets that we're leading, and these are going to pay off big time.
But the question is how do we do that and also get better return for our shareholders because, believe me, it's painful to
see, that you know, look at our kind of progression of revenue growth, EPS growth, free cash flow growth, and see the
stock flat for three years, but we're under performed in the market. It's painful because I know we're placing the right
bets. So, in context and we'll be at early in next year.

<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thank you. We're out of time for questions now, so we'll have a few concluding
comments from Joe.
Joseph M. Tucci
I want to thank everybody for being with us today. And I was talking about this a little bit at the end. I truly believe we
have great technology and great assets that play well in both the 2nd and 3rd platform IT worlds.
Our strategic relevance with our customers is at an all-time high. They are giving us provision to play and win in their
IT ecosystems, more so than ever. We have solid momentum. Our 65,000-plus people deeply believe in our future and
our mission, and I am blessed with a stellar leadership team that I know can take the EMC family of companies to the
next level.
So, thank you very much for being with you, and we look very forward to that meeting with you in person in early in
next year. So, thanks again. And we'll be in touch with you through the quarter.
Operator
