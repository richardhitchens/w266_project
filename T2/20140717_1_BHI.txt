Thanks, Trey, and good morning.
During the second quarter Baker Hughes adjusted profit from operations increased $103 million over the previous
quarter, a rise of 15%. The growth in operating profit is the result of improving execution across the enterprise as we
continue to drive operating efficiencies and accelerate the delivery of innovative new products and services around the
world.
Let me share a few highlights, starting with our international operations, where I'm pleased with the improving quality
of our earnings. In our Europe-Africa-Russia Caspian segment, we saw a solid rebound in activity following weather
delays in Russia and the North Sea during the first quarter. Additionally, sales for wireline services and drilling services
increased in the United Kingdom, Angola, and Mozambique based on our outstanding reliability and newly introduced
technologies for offshore exploration markets. The strong performance of these product lines along with rising activity
levels across the region contributed to record revenue and record operating profit for this geographical segment.
We also posted record revenue and record operating profit in the Middle East-Asia Pacific segment, driven by strong
activity growth in many of our key markets. Again, drilling services was a strong contributor, and we also benefited
from the delivery of high pressure, high temperature completions technologies in Southeast Asia and a new integrated
artificial lift and completion system in China.
In Latin America, flexibility and customer centricity are critical to growing our profits and reducing our risk. During
the second quarter we posted 3% top line growth despite a flat rig count. Operationally, I am very pleased with the
strong service quality we are delivering across the region, particularly in the offshore markets. Our share in Mexico's
marine region is increasing, with recent contract wins for drilling services, intelligent production systems, and
cementing. And in Brazil, we increased our share of drilling services in this challenging performance-driven deepwater
market.
Across our international operations, we are seeing strong activity growth, ever more challenging projects, and greater
reliance on newly introduced technologies. This is a perfect environment for us, and the results are reflected in the
growth and strong incremental margins in our international business this quarter.
Turning to North America, we are seeing activity growth in the U.S. onshore market in the form of more rigs, more
wells, and more horizontal drilling. Demand for AutoTrak Curve, Kymera drill bits, and Talon drill bits is at record
levels. And not surprisingly, we've set record revenues in our drilling services and drill bit product lines.
But it's the production side of our business that's beginning to deliver truly differential growth in North America. Our
customers' appetite for new technologies which can boost oil production from shale is growing. And the recent launch
of our ProductionWave solution could not have been timed better. Installations of ProductionWave are rapidly
accelerating, and we are seeing an upsurge in our production chemicals product lines, contributing to record sales in
artificial lift and upstream chemicals.
As a result of the strong contribution from new technologies like ProductionWave and improving market conditions in
the United States, we were able to overcome Canadian breakup and organically deliver increased revenue and increased
margins in North America from the first quarter to the second quarter. And this is the first time Baker Hughes has ever
achieved this since we began reporting our results geographically.
Across the U.S. onshore market, the growth engine remains the Permian. During the quarter, well counts in the Permian
rose more than 10%, including an increased proportion of horizontal wells. Growth in the Permian is creating tighter
market conditions across all other basins. These market forces have been favorable for all of our product lines,
particularly pressure pumping. In addition to the rise in activity, there are also a growing number of customers
experimenting with longer laterals and higher volumes of proppant. As a result, our horizontal stages grew, our stage
counts per well increased, and our pumping volumes per well also rose. Due to this improving mix and increasing
utilization, we achieved higher revenue per stage across virtually every major basin in the United States.

To be clear, our plan to transform our pressure pumping business is on track, and we continue to have opportunities to
improve our margins from higher asset utilization and operating efficiencies. Later on today's call, I'll share a few
examples of new technologies we have recently commercialized that we expect to have a meaningful impact on our
industry and on our earnings.
But first, let me turn it over to Peter for additional details on the quarter and our guidance on the near term. Peter?
Peter A. Ragauss
Thanks, Martin, and good morning.
Today we reported adjusted net income for the second quarter of $404 million or $0.92 per share. Adjusted net income
excludes $39 million in after-tax charges or $0.09 per share related to litigation settlements for labor claims, which
were previously disclosed in our most recent 10-K and 10-Q. Adjusted net income also excludes $12 million after tax
or another $0.03 per share for currency devaluation in Venezuela.
Compared to the prior year, adjusted earnings per share increased $0.38 or about 70%. On a GAAP basis, net income
attributable to Baker Hughes for the second quarter was $353 million or $0.80 per share. Revenue for the second
quarter was $5.94 billion, a record for Baker Hughes, and an increase of $448 million or 8% compared to the same
quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $1.16 billion, up $299 million or 35% year over year.
To help in your understanding of the quarter's results, I'll bridge last quarter's earnings per share to this quarter. In the
first quarter of 2014, we posted GAAP net income of $0.74 per share. First, add back $0.10 for severance costs and a
royalty agreement which were highlighted in the first quarter. That brings us to a first quarter adjusted EPS of $0.84.
Moving to the second quarter, add $0.06 for North America operations due to increased U.S. activity and actions to
improve U.S. profitability which, as Martin mentioned, more than offset the seasonal decline in Canadian activity
related to spring breakup. Add $0.09 for international operations due to increased revenue and profitability. Add $0.01
for industrial due to the seasonal increase in activity. And subtract $0.01 for increased corporate expenses. At this
point, our adjusted earnings per share would have been $0.99. Next, subtract $0.07 for the tax effect related to an
unfavorable geographic mix of earnings. That brings us to adjusted earnings per share of $0.92 this quarter.
To get to GAAP earnings per share of $0.80, subtract $0.09 for the litigation settlements and subtract $0.03 for the
Venezuela currency devaluation. From this point on in the conference call, any comments on revenue, operating profit,
and operating profit margin refer explicitly to Table 5 in our earnings release, which excludes these two adjusting
items.
Taking a closer look at our results from operations, revenue in North America was $2.84 billion, up $67 million or 2%
sequentially. North America operating profit was $340 million, up $40 million sequentially. As a result, our North
America operating profit margin was 12%, which is a sequential improvement of 120 basis points. The sequential rise
in revenue and operating profit is attributed to strong sales of new technologies and increased activity in several of our
U.S. geo markets.
In our U.S. onshore business, our revenue outpaced the 5% rise in well counts over the prior quarter, with particularly
strong growth in our Central and Western geo markets. Our Gulf of Mexico revenues also grew sequentially and more
than originally expected as a result of rising share of drilling services and strong sales of completion products. North
American profitability was also favorably impacted by ongoing actions to improve our U.S. pressure pumping business,
which resulted in higher asset utilization, better supply chain efficiencies, increased revenues per stage, and reduced
consumption of some raw materials.
In summary, the improvement to our U.S. pressure pumping profitability and the increase in U.S. onshore activity
played out largely as expected. However, the early rebound in Canadian rig count, increased activity in the Gulf of
Mexico, and rising sales of new technologies were all better than expected for the second quarter and resulted in North
America revenue and margins rising above our most recent guidance.

Moving to international results, we posted revenue of $2.76 billion, up $125 million or 5% versus the prior quarter.
Sequential incremental margins for international operations were just over 45% for the quarter. As a result, operating
profit increased $57 million or 16% versus the prior quarter to a total of $404 million. Operating profit margin for the
quarter improved 150 basis points sequentially to 14.6%.
Our Europe-Africa-Russia Caspian segment delivered 7% revenue growth over the prior quarter, resulting in record
revenue. Additionally, operating profit margins increased 180 basis points over the prior quarter. The increase in
performance for this segment was the result of the seasonal rebound of activity in Russia and the North Sea following
poor weather in the first quarter. Additionally, in the UK we saw increased sales in wireline services, drilling services,
and drilling fluids. Lastly, we benefited from operational leverage in Africa as we continued to gain share in the
deepwater markets on the west and east coasts of this region.
Our Middle East-Asia Pacific segment also delivered record revenue in the second quarter along with 66% incremental
margins, resulting in a 190 basis point increase in operating profit margins for the quarter. The sequential improvement
in profitability is a result of strong drilling services activity in Saudi Arabia and favorable product mix in both drilling
and completion services across China, Australia, and Southeast Asia.
These gains were partially offset by reduced revenue in Iraq, where we began the process of demobilizing on a large
turnkey contract. In Latin America, operating profit was flat as revenue increased modestly. Rising activity in
Argentina, Mexico, and Brazil was offset by reduced activity in other countries.
For our Industrial Services segment, we posted revenue of $333 million, up $12 million or 4% sequentially, primarily
as a result of a seasonal increase in our process and pipeline services business. Operating profit margins were 10.2%,
up 150 basis points over the prior quarter.
Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.2 billion, which is unchanged from the
prior quarter. Total debt for the quarter was $4.6 billion, and our debt-to-capital ratio remained unchanged from the
previous quarter at 20%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $424 million.
During the quarter we repurchased approximately 2.9 million shares on the open market, totaling $200 million. This
leaves $1.25 billion remaining under our previously announced authorization to repurchase shares. And finally, as
previously announced during the second quarter, we increased our upcoming quarterly dividend payout by 13%.
Now let me provide you with our guidance for the remainder of 2014. Our activity outlook for North America is
relatively unchanged. During the second quarter the U.S. rig count increased 4% sequentially, as predicted, led mainly
by the Permian. We expect continued rig count growth throughout the summer and fall before the typical seasonal
decline in the fourth quarter. We continue to forecast a 4% increase in the average U.S. rig count compared to last year,
with an average rig count of 1,830 rigs for 2014. Also during the second quarter, the U.S. onshore well count increased
5%, as drilling efficiencies improved following the slowdown due to weather in the first quarter. Our full-year forecast
has not changed, and we continue to project a 5% increase in the U.S. well count this year.
For the Gulf of Mexico, we are beginning to see a greater proportion of deepwater rigs performing completions work.
Although this trend is favorable for Baker Hughes, it has resulted in a slight drop in the active rig count. We still
project two or three incremental deepwater rigs to enter the Gulf of Mexico this year, but we now expect the average
U.S. offshore rig count to be flat compared to last year.
In Canada, rig counts began climbing from seasonal lows at a faster pace than normal, mainly due to a warm, dry
spring in May and June. Activity is expected to continue ramping up over the course of the year. Likewise, we have
revised our Canadian rig count forecast upwards from a 5% to an 8% increase for the full year.
For the third quarter, in North America we expect the increase in U.S. and Canadian activity and further improvement
of our pressure pumping business will contribute to increased revenue and margins. As a reminder, these gains may be
impacted by hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico this quarter.
Looking outside of North America, we project the average international rig count to increase 8% compared to last year,
with healthy growth in Saudi Arabia, Australia, Argentina, and Africa. In Iraq, we began to demobilize on one of our

two turnkey contracts. These resources are now being redeployed to more profitable markets in the Middle East and
North Asia.
Additionally, due to the recent instability in Iraq, the movement of equipment between the north and the south of the
country has been problematic. Despite these logistical challenges, our remaining operations are fully active at this time.
As we complete the demobilization on this contract during the third quarter, it is likely that our Middle East-Asia
Pacific margins may remain flat before resuming growth again in the fourth quarter.
For our Industrial Services group, revenue and margins should both increase slightly based on higher pipeline and
process services activity.
To summarize, we predict continued revenue growth in all of our operating segments, including strong growth in North
America. As a result, we are forecasting profit from operations to increase in the third quarter by about 15%.
With respect to non-operational items for the third quarter, corporate and interest expenses are expected to be similar to
the second quarter. Our 2014 effective tax rate is now expected to be about 35% for the second half of the year. In
2015, we expect our tax rate to return to a range of 32% to 33%. And finally, capital expenditures for the year have
been revised down slightly to be about $1.9 billion.
At this point, I will now turn the call back over to Martin. Martin?
Martin S. Craighead
Thanks, Peter.
I am pleased with the improving results we delivered in our operating segments this quarter and the trajectory we are on
for the year. These results are a reflection of our strategy to convert innovations into earnings. This means accelerating
the delivery of products and services which enable differential value to our customers, differential margins for our
business, and differential returns for our shareholders.
During the second quarter we launched 47 new products and services. These are new technologies designed to address
the industry's biggest challenges, efficient well construction, optimized well production, and increased ultimate
recovery. I would like to highlight just a few examples of recently introduced technologies that have the potential to
reshape our industry.
From the challenges of drilling in the ultra-deepwater frontier to pushing the limits of lateral length in the
unconventionals, improving the conversion efficiencies of wells is critical to the economics of future exploration and
development. As an example, our recently introduced FASTrak technology is helping our customers to reduce the time
and cost to evaluate their reservoir and is seeing strong demand in offshore exploration markets. FASTrak integrates
our proven wireline sensor technologies with our logging-while-drilling platform to create the industry's first
commercial service capable of retrieving reservoir fluid samples while drilling and while evaluating the target
formation.
To date, we have deployed this service on more than 50 critical deepwater projects. During the second quarter, we
performed an extensive FASTrak operation for an operator in Nigeria. On this project, we retrieved 10 high-quality
fluid samples and completed more than 100 pressure tests in a single run all during the drilling process, helping our
customer make critical completion decisions and saving days of rig time. Now any service which can reliably improve
our customer's understanding of their reservoir and save days of paying for a deepwater rig will have exceptional
demand. We are leveraging FASTrak technology to win share in several deepwater markets, including West Africa, the
North Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico.
For our customers developing North American shale resources, it's all about maximizing reservoir contact. The recently
introduced SHADOW series frac plugs are allowing our customers to redefine the limits of well geometry by
eliminating the need to mill out plugs with coil tubing.

On one project last quarter, a customer used several dozen SHADOW plugs to design and complete a well that would
have been unimaginable before SHADOW plugs. The deepest plug was set at more than 25,000 feet measured depth on
a horizontal well stepping out nearly 15,000 feet, a trajectory well beyond the range of coil tubing. SHADOW plug
technology is enabling our customers to construct well bores and access reserves that would not have been possible
with conventional completions technology.
Sales for SHADOW plug are increasing across every U.S. geo market. We have also expanded the commercialization
of this product internationally, with our first deliveries scheduled for Russia and China. The introduction of innovative
new products like SHADOW plug and FASTrak are the latest in a continuum of well construction technologies Baker
Hughes had been bringing to our industry for more than 100 years.
But we recognize meeting the world's energy needs in the future can't be solved simply by drilling more holes more
efficiently. We must optimize production from existing resources. One of the biggest opportunities for our industry
today is to boost production rates from shale. And this is one of our goals, to radically transform the production
potential of every shale oil well in every shale oil basin.
If I characterize some of the largest production challenges we are working to solve, they broadly fall under three
categories. First, understanding the reservoir; how can we identify the source of production and predict the quantity and
the chemistry of the produced fluids. Second, automation; how can we integrate surface hardware with sensor
technologies and real-time monitoring to create an intelligent, adaptive production system. And third, downhole
architecture, the development of new artificial lift products that have been designed to accommodate the extreme well
geometries, the wide flow ranges, and the multiple fluid phases which are common when producing from shale. It's
these challenges that ProductionWave was designed to solve.
The ProductionWave solution is a family of technologies which can be custom tailored on a well-by-well basis, or what
we call a service value multiplier. Since introducing this new system last year, sales have surpassed expectations, with
more than 1,000 installations year to date across every North American oil basin, from Alaska to the Eagle Ford.
ProductionWave has been one of the most rapidly adopted production technologies in the history of our company and is
becoming a meaningful driver of our North American growth story.
And today, I'm pleased to share with you the next great breakthrough that will further strengthen the ProductionWave
platform. Until now, there has never been an artificial lift product that was designed to be deployed and operate in a
horizontal shale well. And why would there be? Electrical submersible pumps were developed for vertical and deviated
well bores where production rates are high or the oil is very heavy. And rodless were meant to squeeze out a few more
barrels a day from shallow vertical wells in mature conventional fields.
Until the unconventionals took off and we began drilling 15,000 horizontal shale oil wells per year in the United States
alone, there was never a need to design a system that can navigate around a tight bend radius and operate horizontally,
and no one ever has until now. This month, we are launching FLEXPump Curve, the world's first artificial lift system
engineered to be deployed below the ever-tightening bend angles which are common in unconventionals, and then set
in the horizontal section at the maximum depth and extension possible. Why is this important? Because the deeper you
can set the pump, the higher the drawdown rate, resulting in higher production rates. FLEXPump Curve is one of
several new innovations we will be introducing to transform the way oil is produced from shale, leading to greater
energy production for the world.
For our customers with mature assets, our research and engineering investment is focused on efficient technologies to
increase ultimate recovery. In Saudi Arabia, Baker Hughes delivered a game-changing all-electric intelligent well
system, enabling controlled production of eight different zones simultaneously. Delivering a system of this size and
complexity would not have been possible with traditional hydraulically controlled intelligent completion systems.
The completion design includes three cased-hole laterals isolated by premier feed-through packers and an open-hole
main bore, segregated into five zones by swelling elastomer feed-through packers. Numerous downhole sensors are
deployed throughout the tubing and the annulus to allow real-time monitoring of production performance.

Active flow control devices installed in each zone are actuated remotely to restrict production in high water-cut zones,
increasing production from hydrocarbon-rich zones and enabling greater recovery over the life of the well. And the
entire network of flow control devices is deployed and operated using one single electric control line as opposed to
traditional systems requiring multiple hydraulic control lines. This significantly simplifies the installation process,
improves system reliability, and enables highly accurate remote control, never possible before.
This technology removes the gas work out of well intervention, reduces the total cost of ownership for this well for our
customer, and represents the future of intelligent production systems. More importantly, it has the potential to enable
more consistent production and higher recovery rates across other mature fields around the world.
The common thread to each of the operational successes I just highlighted is innovation. Innovation is enabling us to
redefine the technical limits of what's possible, such as new well geometries enabled by SHADOW plug. At the same
time, through integration we are creating differentiating new service combinations from within our product portfolio
like ProductionWave. And through interdependence with our customers, we share a commitment to tackle the
industry's greatest challenges such as intelligent well systems used to boost ultimate recovery.
And the final piece is execution, and that comes from people working with a sense of ownership towards a common
purpose. And as I said in my opening remarks, it's execution that led to our improved results in the second quarter.
As I consider the outlook for Baker Hughes, the fundamentals for our business are strong. Internationally, we are
seeing increased customer spend across our well construction product lines in all regions, a pattern we don't expect to
see reverse any time soon.
In North America, the trend of customer spending incremental OpEx towards production-related technologies is
unfolding as we expected, and we predict strong growth in this area for the foreseeable future. Against this backdrop, I
am confident the execution of our strategy will continue to deliver strong earnings growth.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Trey.

<Q - James K. Wicklund>: Nice quarter again, and you covered so much that good questions are hard to come by.
You guys have been known as a manufacturing company for a while. At your Investor Conference, you showed a
bunch of new technologies. And then the list you have at the back that, Martin, you just went through several of them,
is incredibly impressive. What percentage of your revenues these days are generated by technologies developed in the
last year or two?

<Q - James K. Wicklund>: Gee, okay. And we would expect that to continue, I guess, considering the 47 new
products, I think you said, products and services launched in the quarter?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I would hope that it continues to grow as a percentage, Jim. It should.
<Q - James K. Wicklund>: Okay. That's – like I say, I'm impressed, my unrelated follow-up, if I could. Peter, on the
tax rate, you gave us guidance in the second half of the year. Should we assume that the step up is because of the
increased profitability in the U.S. market?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: That's one factor, Jim. There are really two factors that come into play. We've had higher
than planned losses in certain countries such as Iraq that have no tax benefit associated with them.
<Q - James K. Wicklund>: Right.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: And we expect that Iraq operationally will improve over the coming quarters, so that's one
thing. That's part of the geographic mix comment. But it's also true, secondly, that we also had better than plan results
in the U.S., both onshore and in the Gulf of Mexico this quarter, which are taxed at the higher U.S. tax rate. So those
two are playing in, but we think – thinking about 2015, we are planning some structural moves that will help on the tax
rate overall, and the mix will change going into 2015.

<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Good morning, Byron.
<Q - Byron K. Pope>: I wanted to get your thoughts just on the North America landscape. You grew your U.S.
revenues well in excess of overall U.S. rig count and well count growth. As we think about the full year and
specifically the back half of the year, with the U.S. onshore and Canada and Gulf of Mexico potentially all moving in
the same direction, is it reasonable to think for the full year that Baker can't continue to grow that top line faster than
your expectation of I think the 5% well count growth for the full year based on what you're seeing in terms of demand
for your products and services?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Byron, we would fully expect to outpace the rig count, not only in North America but, as
we've done, Eastern Hemisphere as well. And there are two fundamental underlying reasons for that. One is, as you
know, very well know, in North America the service intensity per well is likely to increase, and that's starting to also
materialize as we talked about the Saudi Arabia completion installation.
<Q - Byron K. Pope>: Right.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: And this ties to the second driver, if you will, is that the technical challenges our
customers are facing, whether it be in the unconventionals, whether it be in the deepwater markets, or whether it be in
the, let's say, prolific Eastern Hemisphere land markets, this appetite for improving the ultimate recovery or optimizing
production or making well conversions more efficient is just absolutely going to continue to grow, and that means that
the money spent likely per well is just going to continue to grow. And therefore, our business should well outpace, and
we would expect – fully expect that we would outpace rig count and well count.
<Q - Byron K. Pope>: Okay, and then just a second question for me on the Europe-Africa-Russia Caspian region. It
seems there have been some – or seemed to be some concerns about activity in the North Sea in the back half of the
year on the Norwegian side. But in hearing your prepared remarks, it doesn't sound as though there's any change to the

messaging from your Analyst Day just in terms of the way you see that region progressing, especially as I think about
the deepwater West Africa market. Is that a fair assumption?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: That is a fair assumption. There are really three – like a lot of our super-regions, there are
very – contrasts within the segment. Africa is certainly a growth story, but even there you could segment the north from
the west. And Russia Caspian has really just – it's on fire. It's just posting great results, and the leadership team there is
just fantastic. We're seeing some underlying fundamentals there as well, Byron, and greater appetite for technology and
service quality, and that's a bit of a departure from the years past.
And then you have the North Sea, which – it's far more mature. And there are some dynamics there, but I think you
could say that the North Sea is still trying to find its way in terms of our customers. But we had a strong quarter in the
UK and certainly a rebound from the weather issues in Q1, as I said. And I think the Norwegian market with some of
the recent successes our customers had there geologically, but are yet, again, still struggling a little bit to try to
understand the capital allocation and the return on their own investments might slow that region down a bit for the next
12 to 18 months. But overall, we're pretty optimistic and quite ambitious as is the leadership team [indiscernible]
(33:52) to continue to outpace the market.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Sanchez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Good morning, Bill.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Martin, I was hoping you could spend a moment on Brazil. Last year you certainly saw some
margin pressures there as you demob'd from that country post the last award that came forward. You saw share loss on
the drilling services side. Now that we've seen that contract being retendered here, my understanding is you have
certainly a roofline to get more active in that market. You talked about a drilling services pickup here during 2Q. What
is your appetite for more exposure in Brazil here as we think about the retender and where Baker goes forward in
Brazil?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Our appetite in Brazil remains high, Bill. And we've never, obviously, appreciated the
reduction in our share count considering the performance that we have there, which is leading, hands down. We drilled
far more presalt wells than anyone else in country. And ourselves and one of our peers has probably drilled in excess of
80% of all the wells in those basins. And it's not just about the drilling. Our appetite across the entire product line mix
is high, and our relationship with our customer there is strong. And they represent, I think, one of the most capable
deepwater operators in the world, and our partnership with them is highly valuable. It drives value in other basins
around the world.
So as to the tender, I'm not going to share with you our strategy. But certainly economics and particularly in the global
environment we find ourselves in now, economics is first and foremost in my mind. We're not revenue hounds. We're
not share hounds. We've got our investors to look after. And that market deserves to reward its suppliers as perhaps
some of the highest in the world considering the technology that's being deployed. If we can't make those kind of
standards then we take our toys elsewhere. I don't know what else to say.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Okay. I guess my unrelated follow-up would be there was a discussion I think in terms of the
Middle East-Asia margin, Peter, being flat sequentially due to this demob in Iraq. But if I guess I heard you guys
correctly, you expect revenue up across all areas. So should we still think about Middle East-Asia revenues up in 3Q as
a whole but just margins flat? Is that correct, or is that demob causing an impact to the revenue line as well?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: No, we should expect low single-digit revenue increases across the board in international
regions.

<Q - William Sanchez>: Okay. Is the second contract – my understanding was is that both of those turnkey contracts,
the expiration wouldn't happen until next year sometime. Should we assume the second contract stays intact over that
period? Just any quick thoughts there, and I'll turn it back.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yes, you can assume that the second contract continues well into next year.

Our next question comes from Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Thank you, good morning.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Good morning, Bill.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Peter, could you just frame your comments or amplify on your comment of 15%
improvement in operating income for the third quarter? Is that only to EBIT or profit before tax? And if that presumes
flat to up sequentially internationally, then that presumes a rather muted rate of expansion in North America given the
seasonal recovery in Canada. So I'm just curious as to what drives only a 15% improvement in operating income. I
would have thought you would have done better given the momentum in North America in onshore, the seasonal
recovery in Canada, and the completions mix shift in the Gulf of Mexico in the second half of the year.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Bill, thanks for asking that question. Let me just clarify. You'll see on the cover of our press
release, we talk about adjusted profit before tax from operations.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Yes.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: $778 million. Then if you flip back to Table 5a...
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Got it.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: ...you see the $778 million, and that's operations. That's before the corporate. Then if you
take your 15% increase on that, that's a little over $100 million, and that's the number we're referring to. We are
expecting operating profit to increase with the exception of the Middle East-Asia Pacific, to increase across the board.
But I would say that with Canada coming back and the U.S. land continuing strong at high single-digit revenues, most
of that uplift of a little over $100 million will be coming out of North America. Does that clarify it for you?
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Yes, it does. It's very helpful. So I'm just looking here at mine, okay. So still $100 million
worth of operating improvement or thereabouts for North America is what you just said, correct?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: I said that there's a little over $100 million in total, most of which will be coming out of
North America.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay, that's fine. But I still – that's better and it's more transparent. That still strikes me as
a little bit conservative with regard to North America, especially given the incrementals like Canada is likely to carry
the ongoing incrementals in U.S. land given your journey of self-recovery with regard to your frac operations. What
does that imply for North American margin in the third quarter? I would have thought that would have been 15%.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Bill, you can do the math. We're not coming out with margin guidance. We're just telling you
our best guess as to the overall operating profit improvement.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: No, I understand that. I'm just trying to clarify what the thinking is behind it.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: It's still healthy growth, Bill, in U.S. land and Canada.

circumstances as well with regard to the ongoing improvement in your frac operation, your seasonal exposure to
Canada, the mix shift in the Gulf of Mexico. Be that as it may, those are my views, and I certainly appreciate the

Thank you. Our next question comes from Waqar Syed from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Are you there, sir?
Please go ahead.
<Q - Waqar M. Syed>: Yes, hi. Can you hear me?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Sorry, yes. Good morning.
<Q - Waqar M. Syed>: Hi, good morning, so a question on the U.S. pressure pumping market. Could you maybe talk
about where the margins stand there or maybe even, if you can, disclose how much of the improved
quarter-over-quarter in the second quarter versus the first quarter? And then if you could, talk about your equipment
utilization and any plans to add capacity into this market.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Okay, Waqar. Let's talk about the U.S. because we had the decline in the Canadian
business, and our largest business up there is pressure pumping, so that's an unusual event that occurs every spring, so
let's take that out. In the U.S., there was a nice margin walk in that business. We don't break out the product line
profitability. But sequentially in the U.S., it was a big contributor. But as we highlighted in the prepared remarks, we
also hit record revenues and margins in a couple of the key product lines, so it's increasingly a more balanced portfolio.
In terms of utilization, it's getting to the point now that our 24-hour schedule is probably 65% of the fleets. And we're
pretty – capacity is tight and the utilization numbers are just about maxing out. But it is also something that's infinitely
perfectible, as I say, just like our supply chain, and we're never giving up to try to sweat the assets a bit more. And I
appreciate your question around capacity adds, but I'm not in a position that I'm comfortable with to discuss those kind
of plans publicly, Waqar.
<Q - Waqar M. Syed>: Okay. And then in terms of your supply chain and the improvement that you've been working
on, where are you? Are you close to being done, or how much of that has already been done?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: You're never done. You're never done.
<Q - Waqar M. Syed>: Okay.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: All right, never done.
<Q - Waqar M. Syed>: Sure.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: But I can tell you that compared to where our pressure pumping business was two years
ago in the space of supply chain, utilization, customer mix, contract management, being in the right basins, we're
completely different. We have a plan. We have the right people in place to understand the business and execute to that
plan. At the risk of repeating myself, although I've said on every one of these calls, it's not going fast enough, but it's
going in the right direction.
<Q - Waqar M. Syed>: Okay, and then just one final question on the LEAP technology, anything to report there?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: No.
<Q - Waqar M. Syed>: Okay.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: We showed you something there quite special, but it's something that we keep to
ourselves. And you guys will be some of the first that will see it when it's ready to go.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Thank you very much. I'm wondering if you could help us think about the increased profits into
the third quarter from the perspective of what comes from the improved pricing and asset utilization in pressure
pumping versus what comes from increased sales on new technologies.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Ole, this is Martin.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: I'm talking North America, of course.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yes, I understand. And are you talking pressure pumping or all product lines?
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: I'm talking pressure pumping specifically.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Okay. Into Q3, probably as it relates to margin, let's leave revenue off the table. As it
relates to margin, we probably have in that product line 25% associated with product substitution or new technology.
We probably have another 25% associated with improved utilization. As I mentioned to Waqar, we've got still some
room to run but it is tightening up. And then the last half of that would be market forces pricing. That would be my best
estimate, Ole.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Okay, very helpful. We're hearing about huge wells using 22 million to 33 million pounds of
sand.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Correct.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Could you talk a little bit about how you feel you're set up from a logistics standpoint at the
moment, and if there are risks that as we go into the fourth quarter, there is, let's say some disappointment because of
waiting on sand or some other logistical challenge? How would you characterize what you're dealing with?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I'd characterize it as we're lot more muscled up in capabilities around supply chain and
managing that side of the business than we've ever been in my experience with that business, ever been. And so I think
we're in kind of a good position as this cycle unfolds in North America. As you say, the appetite for more sand is really
growing, particularly in the Permian as our customers stay in that experimentation mode. And as we looked at the data,
I was a bit surprised that every basin actually has incrementally added length to their wells. I thought we would have by
now maybe started to taper off.
So the trend is there's going to be more sand. And the sand issue isn't at the sand face, so to speak. I don't think there's
an issue with the mines. There are some particular issues maybe in some of the white and the larger grain 20/40, 10/30,
whatever. But it seems to be a little bit more around the logistics. And then if you drill into the logistics, it's not really
the trains and all the investments we've done there. It could be a little bit around the trucking issues, which I think is
more temporary and less structural. Could be some cost inflation on that space, but I fully expect our teams to pass that
cost on.
So the quick answer is, do I think we'll have some supply constraints in the fourth quarter? The answer is yes. I think
we'll manage them pretty well. We'll certainly manage them a hell of a lot better than we ever have in the past. And I
think it will be a little basin-specific. It won't be across North America. And I think it will be more the road transport
than the big rail transport.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Martin, very helpful. Congrats on the good quarter, and I'll hand it back.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Thanks, guys, good morning. First, on North America pressure pumping, Martin, could you
talk a little bit about what you're seeing today in the field and the spot market as far as pricing, number one? And in
conjunction with that, are you seeing tightening in any other product line outside of pressure pumping today in North
America?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Okay, good morning, Angie. I would say that staying away from the issue of pricing, let
me frame it up that capacity is very tight in a couple of basins and still a little loose in a couple of others. Overall,
across the U.S. basins in the second quarter, again excluding Canada's unusual situation, it's a materially tighter
environment than it was last quarter.
I'm glad you asked about some of the other product lines other than just pressure pumping. There are pricing gains
being realized, particularly in the drilling services, and particularly in artificial lift given the introduction of some of the
newer technologies. So those two, artificial lift and drilling, are realizing price gains. And on the pressure pumping
side, I'll just say that the capacity is tightening. Okay?
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Okay, fair enough. And then as an unrelated follow-up, certainly we're hearing that new
capacity is being added into the market as far as pressure pumping. I think some of that is to reinforce existing fleets, of
course, but some are being added with crews. Are you concerned at this point on anything that you're seeing as far as
new capacity coming into the Permian or overall into the market and just your thoughts on capacity overall?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I still think we're 20% over-capacitized in North America. I think there's still some
repositioning that has to go on. I don't think it's strictly an equipment situation. I think it's a more acute problem with
crews. So absorbing these capacities and getting it to work is going to be on getting the crews ready to go.
Am I concerned about other folks adding capacity? I don't worry about what I can't control. So we have a pretty
disciplined approach. I can tell you as to how we'll introduce capital to the market. And if it can't give us the returns
that a AutoTrak Curve can or a FLEXPump Curve or an investment in the Middle East, then we're not adding capacity.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Great, fair enough. I'll turn it over. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Chuck Minervino from Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
<Q - Charles P. Minervino>: Hi, thanks. Good morning.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Good morning, Chuck.
<Q - Charles P. Minervino>: I just wanted to get a little bit more detail on the international rig count forecast you
guys provided. If you can, just give us a little bit more color. The 8% year-over-year number, I'm not trying to pick
through this too much, but it looks like the international rig count first half of the year is only up about 4%. So you'd
have a pretty meaningful ramp in the second half of the year. Even if we don't get to 8%, it would be a very notable
ramp. So I was hoping you could just touch on that a little bit and maybe also where you see the rig count growing here
in the second half of the year?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Chuck, let me take a stab at it. We're still seeing pretty good growth. I guess the greatest
growth is still in the Middle East. That's driven by Saudi, the South Arabian Gulf, Kuwait, Qatar, et cetera. That's the
biggest single inflection. Africa we're still seeing up significantly, second to the Middle East. And that's in Central

Africa and other places. Europe still decent, third in the pecking order, if you will. Asia-Pac a little lower.
I guess if there's one disappointment, it's been Latin America. It's actually been flat year on year. We're talking about a
9% before, and Latin America has not delivered if you will. So that has caused us to take it down a little bit. So we still
feel pretty good about the second half of the year at this point.
<Q - Charles P. Minervino>: Okay, and then if I could just maybe ask one more here. Norway, I'm not picking
through the rig count too much here, but Norway the rig count looks like it slid down the last couple of months from 21
rigs down to 16, and I know that's an area of focus for you guys. Is that just more of a seasonal issue and maybe that
bounces back, or is there anything we should be more aware of there?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Norway we're showing pretty much flat year on year, maybe down a little bit, but that's made
up in other places like Continental Europe. So we're not expecting great rig increases in Norway and we're not seeing it.
<Q - Charles P. Minervino>: Okay, thank you very much.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Okay.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Becker from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Douglas L. Becker>: Thanks. There has been a jump in Europe- Africa-Russia Caspian margins in the second
quarter. Should we expect margins to improve in the third quarter? I think the Norwegian completions contract is still
scheduled to kick off. And then if that's the case, you have product sales coming in, in the fourth quarter. Could we be
seeing fourth quarter margins, I don't know, 19% – 20% in Europe-Africa-Russia Caspian?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: We are expecting a little bit of increase in Q3 in the Europe region just like we are most of
the other regions with the exception of Middle East-Asia Pacific. And product sales should improve into the fourth
quarter. I'm not going to give you specific guidance now into the fourth quarter, but certainly a little bit – certainly that
will be higher than Q2.
<Q - Douglas L. Becker>: So good trajectory there. Then, Martin, just last quarter, you highlighted GeoWaves
walkaway technology that when you combine it with surface seismic, you will get a very comprehensive geophysical
model. How do you view the importance of having seismic acquisition capability to Baker today?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Let me just follow up on the previous question. The completions contract is really a late
Q4, early 2015 I think implementation, Doug. So I just wanted to clarify that.
<Q - Douglas L. Becker>: Okay.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: As to seismic acquisition, we're not in it. We're not in the business. We feel pretty
confident in our relationship ongoing strengthening ties with CGG. And we're more focused on our own internal
processing and interpretation capabilities. And whether it's in the micro seismic world or in the Middle East, we're
trying to do some walkaways and help our customers understand the geo model better or the earth model. The
arrangement we're in right now seems to be appropriate for us.
<Q - Douglas L. Becker>: Okay, and then just a real quick clarification. Last quarter you mentioned about 10% spare
capacity in frac for the U.S. Today you mentioned North America about 20% over-capacitized. Is Canada just the delta
there, or is there some other reconciliation?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: No. I would challenge me ever saying it was only 10% over-capacitized, so I think it's...
<Q - Douglas L. Becker>: Okay, understood.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: ...probably 20%.
