Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussion during this conference call will include forward-looking
statements, and that actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. The
factors that could cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our
reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.
Discussions during this call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly
comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-K dated today, October 28,
2014.
We will now make prepared remarks, and then we will move to a Q&A session. With that, I'll now turn the call over to
Ian Read. Ian?
Ian C. Read
Yeah, thank you, Chuck, and thank you all for joining the call this morning. I'll start with a few comments regarding
the quarter, and then a few words about our strategy including some remarks about business development.
Starting with the quarter, our performance was well in line with our expectations as the business continues to perform
well. In our innovative business for Global Innovative Pharmaceuticals, the underlying business grew 9% operationally
if you exclude approximately $425 million, or a negative 13% impact due to LOEs and the loss of Enbrel alliance
revenue. Operationally, the Vaccine business grew 19%, the Oncology business grew 17%, and the Consumer Health
Care grew 4%.
For our established business, GAAP revenues for the quarter were down less than 1% if you exclude the approximately
$383 million operational or 6%, due to the negative impact of recent LOEs and Lipitor in the U.S. and Japan.
We had good operational growth in several of our key products including Lyrica which grew 16%, and the Prevnar
franchise which grew 18%. Enbrel remains a solid contributor in markets outside the United States and Canada, where
we retain marketing exclusivity. And there's good momentum of our newest products including Eliquis, Xeljanz,
Xalkori and Inlyta.
Specifically for Eliquis, a key leading indicator referred to as new-to-brand share with cardiologists continues to
improve nicely. Since launch, based on the most recent data, Eliquis' share has increased from 0% to 44% while our
main competitor's shares declined from the high of 70s to slightly above ours.
For Xeljanz, the inclusion of structural data in the Xeljanz label has served as an inflection point with prescribers. We
hope to see further steady share gains, aided by the growing attractiveness to physicians of using Xeljanz as an
effective monotherapy option.
Again this quarter, we achieved solid company-wide performance in emerging markets. Revenues increased 9%
operationally compared to the year-ago quarter, driven by growth in China and Latin America. Overall performance
year-to-date positions us to achieve a strong finish, even after taking into account that we have transitioned to a new
commercial model internally while also adapting to ongoing external market forces.
Looking ahead, the period of high LOE impact will continue through 2016, making it difficult to generate revenue
growth on a net basis. We expect the size of the impact to be substantially reduced starting in 2017.
Our strategy has not changed. It is anchored upon the following pillars: making our R&D more productive so we
deliver on our pipeline; continuing to make smart and shareholder-friendly decisions around how we allocate our
capital; and globally positioning Pfizer to be a market leader through organic and inorganic growth opportunities.

Regarding the pipeline, we recently achieved several regulatory milestones in our late-stage vaccines and oncology
pipelines. The FDA accepted the Biologics License Application for our mening [meningitis] B vaccine with prior
review and set at PDUFA date of February 14, 2015.
The New Drug Application of palbociclib was accepted with priority review with an April 13, 2013 (sic) [2015]
PDUFA date. We also had discussions with the European regulatory health authorities and intend to file palbociclib in
the E.U. next year.
The FDA approved abuse-deterrent labeling for Embeda extended-release capsules, and our investigational C. difficile
vaccine was granted fast-track designation. And, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended the
routine use of Prevnar 13 amongst adults 65 years and above in the United States.
In looking at our late-stage pipeline, there are multiple indications that Xeljanz are progressing. We have completed all
four three-phase studies in psoriasis, have Phase III studies underway in psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis, and
there are two phase – and there are Phase II studies in psoriasis for topical use, Crohn's disease and angio spondylitis.
And we're exploring the expansion of palbociclib for advanced or recurrent and subsequently early breast cancer.
In addition, we are working to advance potentially attractive opportunities that could be commercialized in 2017 and
beyond. They include ertugliflozin for the treatment of diabetes, bococizumab for cholesterol lowering in high-risk
individuals, vaccines for hospital-acquired infections such as staph aureus and C. difficile, and several biosimilars in
oncology and inflammation. Given the pipeline progress being made, I believe we have good sight to improve R&D
productivity.
In terms of capital allocation, we have a strong, solid track record of taking expenses out of the business, generating
strong operating cash flows, and having a sound balance sheet that is a competitive advantage. We have returned
significant capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. During the period 2011 through 2013, we
returned approximately $53 billion and expect to return nearly $12 billion in 2014.
All of this positions us well to pursue business development opportunities. Recently, there has been a lot of attention
paid to deals involving re-domiciling and the proposed regulations announced by the Treasury Department, which
make it more complicated and also potentially limits value that could be created by U.S. companies that re-domicile.
The fact that Treasury has left open their ability to make further changes without notice is of concern.
For Pfizer, enhanced financial flexibility from re-domiciling is certainly still one potential source for creating value. As
we've said previously, we will look at any business development opportunities based on strategic fit, including
operational, portfolio and financial synergies. We continue to evaluate a broad set of potential options on a
case-by-case basis to accelerate value creation to shareholders.
Finally, a few words regarding a potential split of our businesses. We have two primary businesses. I want to say that
again because there seems to be some confusion that I may have inadvertently created. We have two primary
businesses: an innovative R&D-driven portfolio which is managed through our Global Innovative Pharma and
Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer segments, and secondly, a Global Established Pharmaceutical business.
We have 10 months' experience operating in our current commercial model with P&L information. This is providing
valuable insights into the strengths and challenges of each business. In 2015, we will maintain a significant effort
towards setting up the groundwork required to operationalize a potential split. What we do will eventually depend upon
how our commercial businesses perform in their markets, how our shareholders value these businesses, if the sum of
the parts is greater than the whole, and whether there are opportunities to enhance their competitive positioning which
could be achieved outside of Pfizer. It is a decision – it's important to underscore that at this point in time, we have not
yet made a decision.
In summary, we have an unrelenting focus on successfully executing on our commitments so that we start 2015
financially and operationally strong, and with the flexibility to take the actions that create value and that are best for our
shareholders, patients and colleagues.
Now I'll turn it over to Frank to take you through the financial details for the quarter.

Frank A. D'Amelio
Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone.
As always, the charts we are reviewing are included in our webcast. As a reminder, because of the full disposition of
Zoetis on June 24, 2013, the financial results of the Animal Health business and the gain associated with its full
disposition are reported as a discontinued operation in the consolidated statements of income for the first nine months
of 2013. Now let's move on to the financials.
Third quarter 2014 revenues of approximately $12.4 billion decreased 2% year-over-year, reflecting an operational
decline of approximately $270 million or 2%, driven mainly by the expiration on October 31, 2013, of the
co-promotion term for Enbrel in the U.S. and Canada, the ongoing termination of the Spiriva collaboration in certain
countries, the loss of exclusivity and subsequent multi-sourced generic competition for Detrol LA in the U.S., and other
product losses of exclusivity in various markets.
In total, LOEs and declining alliance revenues had a negative impact of approximately $750 million in the quarter.
These were partially offset by the strong operational growth in developed markets of Lyrica, Prevnar, Eliquis, Xeljanz,
Xalkori, Inlyta, as well as Nexium 24-Hour primarily in the U.S., and by 9% operational growth in emerging markets,
driven by Prevnar as well as Lipitor, primarily in China.
Foreign exchange had a negligible impact of $11 million on reported revenues. Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.57
decreased 2% or $0.01, primarily due to lower revenues and a 2% aggregate operational increase in adjusted cost of
sales, adjusted SI&A and adjusted R&D expenses, resulting from an unfavorable shift in product mix, upfront
payments to Cellectis and MedGenesis Therapeutix associated with recently-announced agreements, as well as ongoing
Phase III programs for bococizumab, ertugliflozin, palbociclib and certain other new drug candidates.
Adjusted SI&A expenses, however, decreased by 1% operationally, because of continued benefits from cost reduction
and productivity initiatives, partially offset by product launch investments.
Adjusted diluted EPS was favorably impacted by fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding, which declined by
253 million shares versus the year-ago quarter due to ongoing share repurchases and the lower effective tax rate.
We recorded reported diluted EPS of $0.42 compared with $0.39 in the year-ago quarter due to the previously
mentioned factors and the favorable impact of the non-recurrence of a loss associated with the Teuto option, lower
restructuring charges, and lower expenses related to cost reduction initiatives, which were partially offset by the
unfavorable impact of a charge to accounts for an additional year of the non-tax-deductible branded prescription drug
fee under the final regulations issued by the IRS during the third quarter 2014.
Foreign exchange negatively impacted third quarter revenues by $11 million and had a net unfavorable impact of $10
million on the aggregate of adjusted cost of sales, SI&A and R&D. Consequently, the impact of foreign exchange on
adjusted diluted EPS was negligible compared with the year-ago quarter.
Now moving on to the financial highlights of our business. In the third quarter, Global Innovative Pharmaceutical
revenues decreased 4% operationally year-over-year due to the previously mentioned expiration of the co-promotion
term for Enbrel in the U.S. and Canada, partially offset by strong operational growth from Lyrica primarily in the U.S.
and Japan, and Eliquis and Xeljanz globally.
Income before taxes declined 8% operationally due to the decrease in revenues, a 12% operational increase in cost of
sales, or a 1.9% increase as a percentage of revenues, of which 1.5% was attributable to the loss of Enbrel alliance
revenues, a 6% operational increase in SI&A expenses from increased investment in new products such as Eliquis and
Xeljanz, and in-line brands such as Lyrica and Viagra, as well as a 33% operational increase in R&D expenses due to
incremental investment in late-stage pipeline products such as bococizumab, ertugliflozin and additional Xeljanz
indications.

In the third quarter, revenues from our Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer Health Care businesses grew 13%
operationally year-over-year due to the strong operational growth of Prevnar, Xalkori, Inlyta, and Nexium 24-Hour.
Income before taxes increased 19% operationally due to increased revenues, which were partially offset by a 12%
operational increase in cost of sales, driven by increased sales volume.
As a percentage of revenue, cost of sales decreased by 0.2% due to a favorable change in product mix, and there was a
13% operational increase in SI&A expenses due to Nexium launch costs and Prevnar adult investment, and pre-launch
expenses for palbociclib and our meningitis B vaccine candidate. R&D expenses, however, decreased 10%
operationally due to lower costs for certain oncology programs, partially offset by increased investment in the
palbociclib and mening B development programs.
In the third quarter, Global Established Pharmaceutical revenues decreased 6% operationally year-over-year due to
previously mentioned product losses of exclusivity and the loss of alliance revenues, and an operational decrease of
Lipitor in the U.S. and Japan.
Income before taxes declined 4% operationally due to the decrease in revenues and was partially offset by the decreases
in cost of sales, SI&A and R&D expenses, which included increased spending on biosimilar development programs.
Now moving on to our 2014 financial guidance, we are updating certain components of our 2014 financial guidance
based on our year-to-date performance, recent changes in foreign exchange rates, and our outlook for the remainder of
the year. It's important to note that this guidance does not include an adjustment for the potential devaluation of the
Venezuelan bolivar or any other currency.
We are narrowing our adjusted revenue range to $48.7 billion to $49.7 billion, from $48.7 billion to $50.7 billion. We
are narrowing and lowering our adjusted cost of sales as a percentage of adjusted revenues range to 18.5% to 19% from
19% to 20%. We are narrowing our adjusted SI&A expenses range to $13.5 billion to $14 billion from $13.3 billion to
$14.3 billion. We are narrowing our adjusted R&D expense range to $6.9 billion to $7.2 billion from $6.7 billion to
$7.2 billion.
We now expect other income to be approximately $400 million versus our previous expectation of about $200 million.
We continue to expect our adjusted effective tax rate to be approximately 27%, which does not assume the renewal of
the U.S. R&D tax credit. If renewed, the effect would not be material and we would not anticipate any impact on our
2014 adjusted effective tax rate guidance. We are narrowing our reported diluted EPS range to $1.50 to $1.59, from
$1.47 to $1.62, and we are narrowing our adjusted diluted EPS range to $2.23 to $2.27 versus $2.20 to $2.30.
Now moving on to key takeaways, we narrowed our guidance ranges for adjusted revenues and adjusted diluted EPS.
We recently achieved several key R&D milestones related to palbociclib, our meningitis B vaccine candidate, Prevnar
13, and our investigational C. diff vaccine. We continue to create shareholder value through prudent capital allocation.
To date in 2014, we've returned approximately $5 billion in dividends to shareholders and repurchased $4.2 billion or
approximately 140.4 million shares, and we continue to expect to repurchase approximately $5 billion of our common
stock this year. These repurchases and planned repurchases for the remainder of the year are expected to reduce total
shares outstanding year-over-year by a total of approximately 100 million shares by the end of 2014 after considering
actual and projected dilution related to employee compensation programs.
In total, we expect to return nearly $12 billion via share repurchases and dividends to shareholders this year. In
addition, last week, the Board of Directors authorized a new $11 billion share repurchase program to be used over time.
Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2014 and beyond.
With that, I'll turn it back to Chuck.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Great. Thanks very much for the questions. Just a few here on biz dev [business
development].
First, I just want to make sure I'm clear on your comments. Do you still see meaningful value to Pfizer from inversion
or should we be thinking about larger deals having to be much more driven by operating synergies and pipeline
opportunities, I guess, relative to let's say six or 12 months ago?
The second question is just how does potential for future Treasury action factor into that analysis in terms of, do you
really kind of know what Treasury ultimately does, and does that affect how you're thinking about this?
And then the final one is just a broader one, which is, relative to a year ago, it seems like Pfizer is much more focused
on business development. I guess this question, first, what's kind of changed over the last year that it seems like you're
just kind of seeing a big value creating event for shareholders that didn't exist maybe one or two years ago? Thanks
very much.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thanks, Chris. I appreciate the questions on BD [business development]. I just want to make the
point that BD is not a strategy; it's an enabler of the strategy. So I don't want to get us sort of totally focused on BD and
not on the strength of our underlying business, the development of our pipeline, and I think both our prepared remarks
have gone through that. So I won't repeat it here but I do want to stress that we feel the strategies we put in place on
improving our innovative core and getting capital allocation right are working and working well.
So the rules, or proposed rule changes on inversions have not stopped inversions. If you are between the 80% and the
60%, I think it's fair to say they have made it more difficult and perhaps changed the timing on realization of the value.
But we still believe on a case-by-case basis there is meaningful value to be had from inversions, and probably the most
significant is the liberation of a substantial proportion of your future cash flows out of sight of the U.S. tax system into
a territorial system.
The next question, I believe, was...
<A - Charles Triano>: Future Treasury.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Future Treasury actions. I can't predict what they're going to do, and no one can. It is worrying that
we're put in this, U.S. businesses are put in this uncertain situation and that U.S. companies are put at such a
competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis foreign competitors, both on the tax rate and also the uncertainty of the rules. But
that is where we are today, and that's what we have to live with.
I think what it means is that as you look at an inversion, you need to thoroughly understand case-by-case what the
inversion target is, what your capabilities are, and how you intend to realize the values. And they should be multiple
ways of realizing such value, because you can't anticipate the rule changes that Treasury may put in place. So all of that
will be factored in, I think, by anybody who intends to do an inversion deal.
And then I think from your question about why more focus from Pfizer now on BD, I think you've got to look at that in
the context of when this team took over the company back in late 2010, we were really focused on fixing our
innovative core, working with Mikael to make sure that our science organization was best in class, advancing our
pipeline, getting our capital allocation right, getting our expense base right, getting our culture the way we want it to be,
and I think through 2011, 2012, and parts of 2013, we got where we wanted to be, and we felt very confident about our
ability to take on a BD, either a bolt-on or a large size, and ensure we maximize the value of any such BD. So I think
that explains the timing.

Thank you for the question.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thanks, Ian. Operator, next question, please?
Operator
Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thanks. Ian, what have been the key learnings since the decision to separate your businesses
internally? I realize it's only 10 months, but I'm sure you've learned some good and bad.
Maybe part B of that question is a hypothetical. If someone were to offer you a price for the EP [Established Products]
business, and could run it in a more cost and tax efficient manner, and that Pfizer shareholders could benefit from that,
would it even be possible at this point or soon, from an operational standpoint? In other words, has enough separation
work occurred to enable that type of hypothetical to be reality? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. I will deal with the learnings, and I'll ask Frank to talk about the hypothetical of this more
immediate separation. I think the learnings are basically what we expected; it's the power of focus. It's the power of
having a leader on a team focus on Established Products with John Young leading that with crafting strategies that
address the specific issues of the EP business, of driving that business in those countries without losing focus on what
the strategies are for that business. It's about having John working on growth opportunities, his team looking for growth
opportunities. I think it's back to the whole area of give a team an objective, make it clear, make it focused, and let
them go at it, and if you've got good people, they will come up with extraordinary results.
So I think that's the learning on that, and we continue to be pleased with the way John is approaching his, the way
Albert is doing it with VOC [Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer Healthcare] and the way Geno is doing it with GIP
[Global Innovative Pharma]. I mean, these growth rates in Eliquis, and Xeljanz, and Lyrica, are a result of a great
management team working and Albert also with the growth in the Vaccines, Oncology. So I'm very pleased with the
focus we're achieving.
So with that, I'll hand it over to you.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Yes. Gregg, in terms of the timing, the way I'll answer the question relative to, for
example, our Established Products business. The way to think about this is, is it a public transaction or a private
transaction? If it's a public transaction, and by the way, I know your example is a private one, I'll get to it.
If it's a public transaction, so a Reverse Morris Trust, a partial spin, a complete spin, a partial IPO, a partial IPO
followed by a split, three years of audited financials are required, and that would be three years of prospective audited
financials. So think about that as 2017.
If it's a private transaction, by the way, your example is a private transaction, so we sell an entire segment to someone,
or we sell a partial element of the segment, or a joint venture with a minority interest, or a joint venture with a majority
interest, then it is a subject to what is called a significance test.
And then there's three tests within the significance test. There's an asset test, an income test, and an investment test. The
asset test is the target's assets as a percent of the acquirer's assets. The income test is the acquirer's income as
percentage of the acquirer's income. And then the investment is the acquirer's investment in the target as a percentage
of the acquirer's assets. If all three tests are below 20%, no audited financials are required. If any one test is between
20% and 40%, one year of audited financials is required. If any one test is between 40% and 50% two years of audited
financials are required. And if any one test is greater than 50%, two years of balance sheet, three years of income
statement, cash flow, comprehensive income, and shareholders' equity are acquired given the size of our Established
Products business, it's very likely one of the tests, if not all, would be greater than 50%.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Gregg, you can see that we've given this some considerable thought, and continue to be working
on this, and leaving no stone unturned in ways of trying to achieve our objective here. Thank you.

<A - Charles Triano>: Thank you, Frank and Ian. Next question, please, operator.
Operator
Your next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from ISI Group.
<Q - Vlad Nikolenko>: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Actually, Vlad Nikolenko sitting in for Mark. Again,
congratulations, it was a great quarter. I have a couple of questions about the R&D update.
I'm wondering if you can provide more color on the level of confidence for the ongoing palbociclib filing, which is –
our understanding is based on Phase II data, and the plans called to use the Phase III data.
And also I want to know if you can give more highlights about the ongoing PCSK9 program.
And finally, just to get some more sense about the state of the pipeline, because currently published by plan, because
more than 80 programs at different stages of development. Some of them are label extensions. Just what investors have
to focus on besides palbociclib and PCSK9 and vaccines that you already mentioned? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Well, thank you very much. Good questions, which we welcome answering. So I'll ask Albert to
deal with the palbo [palbociclib] issue, Geno with the bococizumab, and then we'll get – we'll ask Mikael to give you a
succinct description of the portfolio and what we're excited about.
<A - Albert Bourla>: Thank you, Vlad, for palbo, as you're aware, we have submitted or filed and the FDA has
accepted, the NDA, and has gave us priority review. And we have a PDUFA different date which is in April 2015. This
filing was based on Phase II data. To date, FDA has not placed any conditions related to submission of Phase III data or
results during the NDA review. In fact, we do not expect to have any Phase III data before the PDUFA date. There is an
interim review built into the protocol which is event-driven, and so I cannot speculate when it will happen, but this
interim review will not happen before the PDUFA date. So we are looking forward to continue working with the FDA
so we can bring this product to patients as soon as possible.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. Geno, palbociclib?
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Yeah, the palbociclib, the PCSK9 program, is progressing. We're in Phase III. We've been
enrolling for about a year now. We have a fairly extensive Phase III program with five LDL trials and two
cardiovascular outcomes trials. This, I think, differentiates our program from others in the category, so I believe we're
the only one with a cardiovascular outcomes trial in high-risk patients who are unable to get their LDL levels below
100 on maximum doses of the statins. And so this is a patient population where we're likely to show a benefit, and in
the event that reductions in LDL levels to very low levels don't show the linearity that we're looking for, we think this
patient population will still show the benefit.
We have a second cardiovascular outcomes trial in a broader patient population, testing whether reducing LDL levels
below the current recommended levels will confer an additional morbidity and mortality benefit. So it's a robust
program, we're moving quickly to enroll patients, and we're on track.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Mikael, some comments on the other products outside of those near-term?
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Absolutely. So the way to look upon the pipeline is, as you said, we have more than 80 projects
across Phase I to registration. And when you look at the late stage, I would encourage you to see there's four potential
blockbuster franchises supporting GIP VOC and GEP, and you're aware of palbo for VOC; for GIP, boco
[bococizumab] and Xeljanz life cycle management.
As you've heard, Xeljanz is really picking up pace in RA, and there are multiple indications at the following: psoriasis,
oral ulcerative colitis, psoriatic arthritis, and QD for RA. And then finally for GEP, the biosimilars, which are moving
to four soon in Phase III and one additional in [ph] QC study (32:16).

There is also an upside that we haven't discussed a lot, and that's progress that we are making on tanezumab in
pre-clinical safety, in dialogue with the agency, and we look forward to conclude on this data with a potential
opportunity to get back on a dialogue to restart that program pending, of course, good data and thorough agency
dialogues.
You already mentioned vaccines, and I expect that we'll see in the middle of next year that we'll have six different
programs. In addition to Staph, C. diff, we also have therapeutic vaccines now coming that include allergy, nicotine and
cancer vaccine, and I encourage you to see that as a whole technology platform that we have built.
In Immunology and Inflammation, in addition to the tofacitinib oral program, there are now additional opportunities. In
psoriasis we have recently seen encouraging data for our topical version of tofacitinib in both dermatitis and psoriasis,
and we are designing a new generation of JAK inhibitors for psoriasis as well as for IBD.
In cardiovascular metabolic, we have generated encouraging data on a novel PDE5 inhibitor for diabetic neuropathy,
and we have another drug, [ph] Cesar 25 (33:40), that is reading out in the next one or two months.
Oncology, there is a very nice mid-state pipeline with a GSI drug for genetic altered triple negative breast, a broad
program around SMO in hematology and we have recently seen encouraging Phase I data for our ALK full-on drug
3922, and as you're all aware, we're building an increasingly robust immuno-oncology second wave program, and we
are now, for example, dosing 4-1BB on top of PD-1 in a partnership with Merck. And recently we moved our fifth
antibody drug conjugate into the clinic and are addressing multiple solid tumors.
So these were just a couple of things that I think will deliver a lot of momentum over the next two years.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Mikael.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thanks, Mikael. Next question, please, operator.
Operator
Your next question comes from Marc Goodman from UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Yes. I'm not sure if Geno is on the line, but if he can talk about the Oncology business, maybe
specifically some of the products: Inlyta, Xalkori, some of these products have – look like they're slowing down a little
bit, so I was curious what's happening there.
And then I believe we got into the oncology just at the end there, about how you're positioning yourself for the future.
But I'm curious like how you're thinking about immuno-oncology and the products that you're working on.
And then on biosimilars, could you just tell us, the four Phase IIIs – has anything moved forward? When should we be
expecting the Phase IIIs to finish? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. So I'll ask Albert, who has responsibility for our Oncology business to make some
comments on Sutent and Inlyta and Xalkori. All of them are basically in line products. And then on the positioning,
perhaps, of the immuno-oncology, I would ask Mikael to make a comment on that. And then on biosimilars, John could
make a comment. Thank you.
<A - Albert Bourla>: Thanks a lot, Marc.
For the Inlyta, we had for the quarter 23% growth operationally. U.S. was 9%. And in the U.S., we have a strong
uptake in the academic setting. What we are working now is just to make sure that we have strong uptake also in the
community setting and so we have numerous programs that are in place to achieve that. In E.U., Inlyta was quite
impressive, 32% growth for the quarter. Over there the results are driven basically by positive ESMO guidelines, that
now are endorsing Inlyta as a standard second line treatment option, and also we saw this year improvement in our
reimbursement status. Right now we have basically all 16 E.U. countries reimbursing Inlyta.

If I go to Xalkori, in Xalkori we were very pleased with the performance. We had 55% growth operationally for the
quarter. U.S., 33%. It's driven by clearly increased testing for the ALK gene mutation. Right now, we are at 74%
testing. To remind you, we started at the launch at 11%, and a year ago it was 60%. So it's a significant improvement.
In the E.U., the growth was even more impressive, 74% for the quarter. Although that again, is driven by ESMO
treatment guidance, but also, we have positive data from the PROFILE 1014 study that we released, and that is driving
a lot of these results in Europe. And finally, in Japan, Xalkori is at 43% growth. And it's driven by, again, the new data
of PROFILE 1014 that compared Xalkori to the standard chemotherapy.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you very much. So if we go to the positioning on the immuno-oncology?
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Yes, so we are enthusiastic about immuno-oncology rising as a new modality in oncology, and
as you know, there has been durable but many partial responses. And we see the next level of immuno-oncology to go
to deeper and more complete responses, and that's where we really are focusing our current efforts strongly to be a
leader.
I mentioned briefly that our 4-1BB is now dosing on top of PD-1 in the partnership with Merck. We have a partnership
to study 4-1BB on top of CCR4 with KHK [Kyowa Hakko Kirin], and we're moving additional checkpoint modulators
into human studies: [indiscernible] (38:54) early next year, late the next year our own PD-1. In addition to the
checkpoint drugs, I think you will see not only IO [immuno-oncology] plus IO combos, but IO plus targeted agents,
and we are working in a partnership with Merck studying PD-1 plus Inlyta and planning to study PD-1 plus Xalkori
together.
A second modality beyond IO checkpoints are cancer vaccines where we are planning during next year to start our first
out of a series of cancer vaccine clinical studies. We also have our own platform of bifunctional antibodies that will
start delivering human agents in 2016, and as you know, we did with Cellectis, a partnership around CAR-T cells.
So we are playing very broadly with leading technologies and assets, and our goal is to move one to two
immune-oncology agents in the classes as I described every year for the coming period into human studies, mainly
focusing on combination which we think will deliver the utmost value of deep more durable responses.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Mikael. John?
<A - John Young>: Okay. So thanks for the question, Marc. So just as a reminder, in our first wave we have five
monoclonals in our biosimilar portfolio, primarily in oncology and inflammation indications.
So the three biosimilars that are already in Phase III studies that are ongoing or enrolling are a biosimilar for rituximab,
a biosimilar for trastuzumab, and a biosimilar for infliximab. So those Phase III studies are ongoing already.
As Mikael mentioned earlier on, bevacizumab – biosimilar bevacizumab has just recently completed, successfully
completed Phase I study. So the next milestone for that in development would be the initiation of Phase III. And we
have an adalimumab biosimilar which is currently in Phase I.
So those studies are progressing well, and we anticipate bringing this portfolio to the market in the 2017, 2018
timeframe.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thanks, John. Moving to the next question, please, operator.

Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.
<Q - Steve M. Scala>: Thank you. A few questions. You stated, I think, that you would file palbociclib in the E.U. in
2015. Is that based on the same Phase II data that you submitted to the FDA so the filing could be early in 2015? Or is
it based on some look at Phase III as well, which would probably push the filing to later in the year?

And two questions for Ian, and I apologize in advance for both, but why the very deliberate comment on two businesses
rather than three when the company is giving financials on three businesses and has been talking about three businesses
for several years? I know you've been talking about two companies or two businesses in recent calls, but why the need
to emphasize it now?
And then secondly, I'm not clear on the benefit to Pfizer of saying an inversion is still possible. Is it, for instance, to
prompt further Treasury clarification or for some other reason? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: I'll ask – on saying – I was answering a question about whether we still thought that inversion was
a viable strategic component of any deal. We still believe it is. I was answering a question. So I think that explains why
I answered it that way. There was no ulterior motive beyond that of reassuring investors that while the rules have
changed, we still believe, in the appropriate circumstances, that inversions can be part of the value mix of a deal. And
although we can do deals and we do see value in deals without inversion, it still remains part of our overall mix. So I
hope it explains that, Steve.
On the two businesses, the reason I was so – I've been talking to investors, and I believe there is a confusion out there,
we have two businesses.
We report one of the businesses in several, in two segments. We have our business which is our innovative business,
which relies on our core research and our core capabilities, and which I see as an integral business is made up of
oncology, and vaccines, and consumer, and what I would call traditional innovative. That is, as I see it, one business,
and the fact that we report it separately is really an artifact of the SEC rules on segment reporting, and depending on
your management constructs and who reports to the CEO. And I think that's all led to some confusion in the investment
community that we see the company as made up of more than two business segments.
So I see two business segments, one is Innovative using those resources for innovative, and one that is Established
using – and those are the ones that John runs. So I just wanted to make that clear and most of the work we're doing on
optionality is around those two businesses. Not around more than those two businesses.
Palbo in the E.U.
<A - Albert Bourla>: Yes, thanks a lot, Steve. We have had discussions with European regulatory sales authorities on
the palbo data. And it is our intention to file in E.U., and that filing will happen in 2015. I don't want to be more
specific, if it's going be at the beginning or end of 2015, it's going to be 2015. Now the anticipated the filing packet will
likely look similar to what was submitted in the U.S. to the FDA.
<Q - Steve M. Scala>: Okay.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thanks, Albert. Next question, please.
Operator
Your next question comes from Colin Bristow from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Colin N. Bristow>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Just on BD, the immuno-oncology pie seems
to continue to grow as potential indications continue to grow, making it arguably more attractive for those who aren't
first to market. How are you thing about this space with regards to your business development priorities?
And then just on Xeljanz, there's obviously a couple of competitor JAKs on the horizon. How do you view the
competitive threat and Xeljanz positioning? And are you still on track for a filing in the first half of 2015 for your
once-daily formulation? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: All right. So if Geno could talk about the Xeljanz situation, and then I will come back on the BD.
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Yes. So I think we're very pleased with the progress that we are making with Xeljanz. We
see continued adoption by the rheumatology community. We have about a 10% now share of new to brand patients

from rheumatology, which is a nice leading indicator where that business is going. Obviously the rheumatology
community is getting more and more comfortable with the Xeljanz. The majority of the use of Xeljanz is used in what I
call methotrexate-free regimens, where patients who have difficulty with methotrexate are finding adequate therapy
with Xeljanz, which is great.
So it's becoming entrenched, it's becoming established, and we think that is going to speak well for its competitive
position in the future. We are still on track for first half filing for the once-a-day.
<A - Ian C. Read>: On our immuno-oncology BD activity, I agree with you that I think the value is in combinations.
You've all seen the results of the PD-1s. There are some durable responses in monotherapy, but our belief is that the
true power of the immuno-oncology will be from combination types or two or three combinations, and so we're focused
in developing our second wave immuno-oncology, and our vaccines, and the CART technology, and are clearly open to
any type of business development which would give us access earlier to a PD-1 type portfolio that we could more
easily integrate and combine with our second wave.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thanks, Ian. Next question, please, operator.

Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Thanks very much. So I have two questions. First, regarding the net cost outlook, Frank,
could you just talk about how investors should think about cost trends going forward? And maybe you could weave in
some comments about the potential for some increased cost if you're building up two business segments from the one
that currently exists globally.
And then with respect to palbo, I'm just curious, what should investors focus on in terms of timing of next key palbo
readouts, in case the FDA does not approve palbo on the first cycle review next spring? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay, Frank, do you want to go into that net cost? And then...
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Yeah, sure.
<A - Ian C. Read>: ...Albert can look at the...
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Yeah, so, Dave, the way I think about cost trends going forward is kind of by starting with,
where are we? And I think where we are now, and I've said this before is, we're in the late innings I think on cost
reduction. But there's always more opportunity to be more efficient in everything that we do, but I think the big-ticket
items are behind us. We've basically gotten those identified, we've gotten those implemented, and we've gotten those
executed, and they're obviously in our results. So I think going forward, there'll be some opportunities, but the
big-ticket opportunities, from my perspective are behind us.
The one thing I always say though about, just kind of managing cost is, I'm making every statement based on the hand
we currently have, to the extent that we expand that hand through whatever, collaborations, partnerships, business
development, then that gives us opportunities once again to be more efficient on a going-forward basis. So I think late
innings, we've taken a bunch out, still some more we can take out, but the big-ticket items primarily behind us.
In terms of, frank, increased cost going forward, I think the way I'll answer that is, if you look at this year to last year,
so 2014 to 2013, the one area where you see a fairly sizable increase is in our R&D spend. If you look at our guidance
for the year now, we just tightened it to 6.9 to 7.2. As you take – midpoint of that range just for analytical purposes,
compare it to last year, our R&D spend year-over-year is up $500 million. It's the late-stage assets that we talked about
plus the business transactions we did with Cellectis and MedGenesis, so you see some pressure on the R&D spend at
least in 2014 versus 2013. Beyond 2014 going into 2015, we'll obviously give that guidance on every line item when
we get on our next earnings call where we close out 2014, and provide guidance for 2015.

<A - Ian C. Read>: Thanks. Frank, I think you want to comment on the – I think the comment was, is there any
ongoing expenses of setting up the two businesses?
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Oh, yeah, so thanks, Ian. So in terms of optionality, the short answer is there are. They
haven't been material on a year-to-date basis, but we're clearly incurring expenses, give or take about $50 million this
quarter, roughly twice that year-to-date. That will ramp up as we go into 2015, and obviously I'll call that out on a
go-forward basis.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Yeah, and there are two types of expenses of course. One is just the ongoing, which I think are
very modest structural expenses of running and collecting information for two businesses, and the other of which is
more one-off...
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: And one-time.
<A - Ian C. Read>: And one-time as you set up your structures and your tax planning, et cetera, et cetera.
<A - Charles Triano>: Okay. Albert? Albert, on the...
<A - Ian C. Read>: Oh, yeah, Albert, on...
<A - Charles Triano>: Palbociclib.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Yeah.
<A - Albert Bourla>: David, right now we are focused on getting in-U.S. registration, based on our Phase II
submission. FDA has accepted this submission, has given us priority review and a PDUFA date of February 2015. We
are looking forward to bringing the product to U.S., based on this submission, to the U.S. patients as soon as possible.
In Europe, as we just said, we also plan to submit in 2015 with a similar packet. I can tell you that there are several
studies that are moving on. We have PALOMA-2, which is a Phase III study, but it is expected to come to completion
at the end of 2015, so we will report sometime in March 2016. This is a replica of our Phase II study.
We have two additional studies that will give us additional registration indications, which are in recurring, and one of
them is expected to come to completion again next year. And then we have one registration study that – one Phase II
study which is in recurring advanced, in early stage with high risk of recurrence, and this is expected to come into
completion sometime in the 2019 timeframe.
So as I said, our focus right now, it is to bring the first indication, which is first line advanced metastatic in the U.S.
based on our submission in – that happened this August and PDUFA date of April 2015.
<A - Ian C. Read>: I suppose, David, to your question that while we are working with the FDA to get approval in the
April timeframe of palbo. If they decide not to improve on that, then we have the replica which we'll report out towards
the end of the year with an interim look at some point in the year when the, if we hit the number of events.
But I think the more important thing is that we have already started the trials to expand beyond advanced breast cancer
in intermediate and early, and that lead is not a lead that will be eroded by the decision on when we get approval for
advanced breast cancer. Because the fact that we've started those trials now and our competitors are not in a position to
start those trials because they don't have the data.
So if you look at it from a competitive point of view, there is competition for advanced breast cancer, which may
become more intense if our approval is delayed until the end of our Phase III trial, but I don't see that having any
implications on the competitive position on the intermediate or early breast cancer, which is a far larger percentage of
the market longer-term. So I hope that explains how we see the dynamics of that market.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thanks. Next question, please.

Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. And I just want to go back to capital allocation. I think the market is saying that you
need to do something bold. And just wondering if you agree with that, and if so, how would you, what would you
define as bold?
And what is your timeline? We've been talking about capital allocation and doing something bold now for several
quarters. How are you thinking in terms of timing?
And then thirdly, I think it's the AstraZeneca deal was sort of thought of as a potential carve out opportunity. Would
you consider, I mean, I think the GEP business is a business that really has limited longer-term growth visibility,
whereas the innovative business we see pipeline assets that would drive future growth. Can you describe your options
available to you in the GEP business? I think you've described incremental options, but is there something you could do
in that business that is on the bolder side? Thanks very much.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thanks, Jami. Well, your characterization of something bold, I – going back to the issue, we have
a great sense of urgency inside Pfizer to continue to accelerate returns to shareholders. So to the extent that BD will
allow us to do that, then I am willing to take bold actions. And I believe that the initial approach to AZ was a bold
action, one that we weren't, one that we couldn't get the right value equation, and so the deal didn't progress. But
certainly I feel a sense of urgency on utilizing our balance sheet and our capital to do deals that are incremental, add
incremental value and certainly add revenue growth in the innovative space. And we are looking at all alternatives, and
we are aggressively looking at all alternatives.
Now in the GEP space, I think we said that, I think the GEP business is somewhat difficult to analyze, I understand
that, but it is made up of what is a really great emerging markets business, which today represents about 30% to 35% of
the total GEP business and is growing. That business is based on brands and quality and out-of-pocket, and I would
model it more like I would model a consumer business, frankly.
And then the rest of it is around peri-LOEs, which are highly profitable, and managing a pipeline that is mature in the
developed markets. So we are looking at ways to add additional growth levers to that business, such as biosimilars,
which we're investing in, and we're also looking at other types of acquisitions where we can use offshore cash, so it's
highly efficient, or even where we would do acquisitions that are in specific areas, such as sterile injectables. But you
know I believe there are lots of opportunities to do BD in that area, so as to add growth.
So I thank you for your encouragement to be bold. We are looking at bold ideas. We are looking aggressively at using
BD and we have a sense of urgency. Thank you for the question.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thanks, Ian. Next question, please, operator.

Your next question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Good morning, and thank you for taking the questions. Just a follow-up on the biosimilar
comments earlier. Just at a higher level, could you comment more specifically at the commercial opportunity? I think
it's fair to say that expectations for biosimilars have come down recently. And how should we think about the
commercial prospects for your meningitis B vaccine? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: I'll ask John to talk about biosimilars, and then Albert can talk about the mening B. Thank you.
<A - John Young>: So thanks for the question, Alex. The first thing to say is obviously the biosimilars market is really
one that is still evolving. We're still seeing regulators around the world put into place their guidance around
biosimilarity and the development pathway for biosimilars. So that's the first comment to make is that marketplace is
still in evolution.

That said, it's estimated by independent analysts as being a market that is around about $100 billion globally, the
biotherapeutics marketplace overall. That biotherapeutics marketplace is going to grow to about $250 billion by 2020.
And so the market for biosimilars in that context potentially could grow as a market opportunity from around about $1
billion today to about $18 billion by 2020.
And those are the sort of general ranges that you actually see from independent analysts about the potential for this
marketplace. So I think beyond saying that we see it as being a significant opportunity and saying that we believe we
are well placed with our first wave of biosimilar assets, which as I've commented already, we're progressing as
expeditiously as we can, we believe we'll be well-placed in that marketplace. I think the general comment would be that
clearly there is much water to flow under that bridge, but we're continuing to be very actively engaged in both
monitoring and also engaging with regulators in this space.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. Albert?
<A - Albert Bourla>: Yes, from the mening B vaccine, look, mening B disease, is devastating, is characterized by
rapid onset, has very high rates of fatality, up to 20% of the people that get mening B die from it, usually within 24
hours. Many that survive will have permanent long-term sequela so this introduction, it is an important product for the
patients to start with, and addresses a high unmet medical need. On the commercial front, we believe that will give us a
modest contribution to our revenue line given the magnitude of our vaccines business.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thanks, Albert.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you.
<A - Charles Triano>: Next question, please.

Your next question comes from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just going back to capital allocation and timing of business
development, I guess, for Ian, really. Just still wondering around what your thoughts are about the potential for tax
reform now that this has become such a focus for everybody. Do you potentially get paid to wait on doing business
development? It depends what your view is around the likelihood of that happening into next year. So I'm wondering if
you can just talk about some of that. Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Yes, Jeff, I think it's an interesting question. Clearly, there is a dynamic going on about what
you're willing to pay for inversions, vis-à-vis, what you believe is the opportunity for fundamental reform in the U.S. I
think we will know a little bit more after the midterm elections but in – historically, you don't get tax reform unless the
President of the United States puts a lot of his credibility and weight behind it. There are just too many factions and too
many ways of dividing the cake. And you really need the White House to take the lead in that. And so – if you're a
betting man, you would suspect that fundamental tax reform would not occur until post the 2016 presidential elections,
but in politics you never know, it's day-to-day. So we'll look at that after November 4 and continue to factor in the
elements you comment in what we think the value of an inversion is worth. Thank you for the question.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thanks, Ian. Next question, please.

Your next question comes from Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: Yes. Thanks for taking the questions. My first question, just again on the BD side. You
touched on a couple of things like sterile injectables and maybe a little immuno-oncology. Are there any other areas
that you'd highlight in terms of where you're looking to do more investing in? And do you really have a preference

between investing on the innovative side of your business as opposed to the more established side?
And then my second question, just following up on your comments around Xeljanz earlier. You mentioned it's being
used more now in methotrexate-free regimens, I believe? So have these patients actually tried TNFs? Or is it before
TNFs? And anything you can update on your latest timelines around resubmitting into E.U.? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. So on the business development, I think in the GEP business, there is a wide range of
opportunities that stem from local investments using offshore cash, to larger type of investments to have capabilities in
hard to make generics. We just did a small acquisition in that area on InnoPharma. So there are a multitude of
opportunities, and that's what John is looking at, and going through, and trying to isolate what the best opportunities
would be.
From a point of view of do we have a preference between GEP or Innovative, everything is given by value and
portfolio balance, and you would expect a larger scale acquisition to potentially cover both businesses, it may not do.
So those are all things that we factor in.
And then there is a question on Xeljanz.
<A - Charles Triano>: On if Xeljanz is used before or after TNFs and E.U. resubmission.
<A - Geno J. Germano>: So on Xeljanz, about half the patients on Xeljanz have gone from Methotrexate to Xeljanz,
and about half of them have been on a biologic, one or more biologics. So it's a mix.
And then in terms of resubmitting in Europe, we intend to resubmit late in 2015 to the Europeans.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Geno.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thank you, Geno. In interest of everybody's time, operator, if we can take one more question,
please.

Your final question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink.
<Q - Seamus C. Fernandez>: Thanks for the question. So just wondering if Mikael could talk to us a little bit about
the differences in the bococizumab clinical trial design versus competitors? And your views on how that is
differentiated from competitors and why you think bococizumab is going to be a competitive offering in that space?
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. Seamus, we – Geno tried to do it so I'll give Mikael a chance to make it clearer this time
around. And Geno, should feel free to add anything if he thinks Mikael hasn't covered it.
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: I will build on Geno's excellent description why we think that the way we are developing
bococizumab, and importantly, the learnings we did in Phase IIb that was very extensive, that allowed us to design
what we think is a very comprehensive broad Phase III program. So a couple of key takeaway messages.
One, our Phase III program includes population for both primary and secondary prevention. We think there will be a
growing opportunity for patients that are at high risk in primary prevention, such as diabetics with a high risk
equivalent of cardiovascular disease. And to the best of our knowledge, we are the only CV outcome trial program that
includes primary prevention.
Number two, we structured it in two different trials, one addressing individuals that cannot get down to 100 or below.
And that allows us to show most likely a substantial risk reduction in cardiovascular disease since this is the segment
where we expect a strong correlation between lowering cholesterol and lowering risk for CV events.
The second trial really focusing on bringing patients in the 70 to 100 segment with high risk, both primary and
secondary prevention patients, down really low in cholesterol. And we think that will allow us to open up unmet need
in that area further by generating data.

I should say that the dose regimen that we developed in Phase IIb, is really crucial for this study design, and we
developed a dosing regimen that allowed us to start with a high-dose and get immediately down patients to low levels,
and only if necessary do a dose titration with lower dose of bococizumab. We do think bococizumab is one of the most
potent antibodies that showed really pronounced lowering of cholesterol. It performs well in every two weeks, and
we've said earlier that through our partnership with Halozyme, we're having our longer lifecycle management plan
exploration of once a month after first ensuring generating good data in the current regimen.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Yes. That Halozyme is unique to us. I think we have exclusivity on that technology.
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Correct. Thank you, Ian.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Mikael. Good answer.
