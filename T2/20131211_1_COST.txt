MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Jasmine, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to
welcome everyone to the Q1 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background
noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Richard Galanti. Please go ahead, sir.
Richard A. Galanti
Thank you, Jasmine, and good morning to everyone. This morning's press release reviews our first quarter earnings
results for the 12 weeks ended November 24th. As with every conference call, I'll start by stating that the discussions
we are having will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995 and that these statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results and/or
performance to differ materially from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include but are
not limited to those outlined in today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public
statements and reports filed with the SEC.
To begin with, for the quarter our reported earnings came in at $0.96 a share, compared to last year's earnings per share
of $0.95. Several items of note that impacted the year-over-year comparison. I'll go through six items. Membership fee
increase as I've been mentioning for the last many quarters. The fee increase that we did in the U.S. and Canada in late
2011 and early 2012, that benefited this first quarter earnings by about $8 million pre-tax or $0.01 a share. That'll be
the tail end of the benefit of that increase showing in our numbers. Interest expense was higher year-over-year in the
first quarter by $14 million pre-tax or $0.02 a share. This of course related to last December's $3.5 billion debt offering

in conjunction with the $7.00 per share special dividend.
FX in the first quarter: the foreign currencies where we operate weakened versus the U.S. dollar primarily in Canada
and Japan. This resulted in our foreign earnings in the first quarter when converted into U.S. dollars being lower by
about $14 million pre-tax or $0.02 a share and those earnings would have been had FX exchange rates been flat
year-over-year. Gasoline profits; gas is a very good business for us. It drives frequency we feel and year-over-year it's
always profitable. Although, it tends to be volatile. In the first quarter that impacted earnings by a little over $0.02 a
share.
Stock expense. That's a line item that we have in our SG&A. It was higher year-over-year in the first quarter by a little
over $0.02 a share as well. We have over 4,000 people – generally managers and buyers and above who receive
restrictive stock units as a significant part of their annual compensation as such grants are made annually each October
or in our first fiscal quarter. These RSU grants then typically vest over a five year period with accelerated vesting when
a recipient reaches 25 years, 30 years and 35 years of employment with the company.
Now factors driving this increase included a 24% increase year-over-year in our stock price on the dates on which the
RSUs are granted each year. Additional levels of accelerated vesting given many employees long tenure with the
company, and a large number of employees in the plans. I should note that this past October, our RSU grants were
reduced by an average of around 15%. That is the number of RSUs granted to each recipient. The increased expense
occurred of course notwithstanding that reduction.
IT modernization. I've talked again about that. We're in our probably second full year of a major modernization effort.
And as discussed in past several quarters these efforts will continue to negatively impact our SG&A expense
percentages throughout fiscal 2014 and probably a little beyond that especially as the new systems are placed into
service and depreciation begins. In the first quarter on an incremental year-over-year basis these costs impacted SG&A
by about $12 million or about three basis points.
Turning to our sales for the first quarter. Our 12 week reported comparable sales figures for the first quarter showed a
3% increase, 3% in the U.S. and 1% internationally. As indicated in our release, excluding gas price deflation and the
impact of FX, the 3% reported U.S. comp would have been 4% for the quarter, the 1% international would have been
up 6% and the overall 3% for the company would have been plus 5% on a basis excluding gas deflation and FX.
Other topics of interest, opening activities and plans. We opened 13 locations during the first quarter of fiscal 2014;
nine throughout the U.S., one in Alberta, Canada; one in Monterrey, Mexico, our third in that city; and two new units in
Australia bringing Australia now to five total units in operation. During the fiscal quarter one location was closed in
Acapulco, Mexico. This was due to the extensive damage that resulted from the severe flooding down there from
Tropical Storm Manuel. That may or may not reopen this fiscal year, but most likely certainly in calendar 2014.
Since the end of the first quarter, we have opened in Q2 two new locations, one in Illinois and one in Canada in
Ontario. That gives us 15 new openings thus far in fiscal 2014. For the entire fiscal year, we have a current plan of 30
new locations, 16 of which are planned for the U.S.; four in Australia including the two we recently opened; three in
Canada; two each in Korea, Japan and Spain, and of course those will be our first two units in Spain; and one additional
location in Mexico.
I'll also discuss later in the call e-commerce activities, membership trends and, of course, discussion on the components
on margin in SG&A.
Again, quarterly result, total sales were up 5% to $24.5 billion. On a comp basis, a reported 3%, which again, excluding
gas deflation and FX, was a 5% on normalized basis. In terms of the 3% reported comp that was a combination of an
average transactions decrease of 2%. Actually up almost 1% excluding deflation and FX, and an average frequency
increase of just under 4.5% for the quarter. In terms of sales comparisons geographically, for the first quarter the better
performing regions in the U.S. were the Southeast, Midwest and Texas. Internationally in local currencies the better
performing countries were Canada, Mexico and Australia.

In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter, for the first quarter, within food and sundries, candy, deli and
refrigerated were in the relative standouts. Hardlines was probably the most challenging category. Majors came in
negative for the quarter, challenging of course in televisions and in cameras. And better performing departments within
the hardlines were office and automotive, but slightly negative overall for the department.
Within the low double digit softlines positive comps, small electrics, apparel and jewelry were the relative standouts.
And within fresh foods, comps in the mid singles. Better performing departments included produce, meat and deli.
Moving down the line items of the income statement. In the first quarter, membership fee income came in at $549
million or 2.24% of sales. That's a 7.3% or $38 million increase versus the first quarter of last year and as a percent of
sales up 4 basis points. As I mentioned earlier, that did include the extra $8 million as the first time that incremental
benefit from the fee increase that we did almost two years ago.
In terms of membership, we continue to benefit from strong renewal rates. A little over 90% in Canada and U.S. and
just under 87% worldwide, continued increase penetration of the Executive Members and, of course, the benefit I just
mentioned from the fee increase. Our new membership signups in the first quarter company-wide were up 17%. That's
of course due to the fact that we opened 13 units this year in the first quarter versus nine a year ago. And this year's first
quarter included three international openings, which tend to have higher signups at opening.
In terms of the number of members at Q1 end, Gold Star members came in at the end of the first quarter at 29.6 million,
up from 28.9 million 12 weeks earlier at the end of the fiscal year. Primary Business at 6.7 million, up from 6.6 million
12 weeks ago. Business add-on at 3.5 million each. So total member households which at the end of the fiscal year had
been at 39 million even came in at the end of the first quarter at 39.8 million. So all totalled, we have 72.5 million
cardholders out there at the end of the first quarter, up from 71.2 million at fiscal year-end.
In terms of paid Executive Members, they stood at 13.9 million of those totals, an increase of about 330,000 during the
quarter, so a little over 27,000 new Executive Members per week increase. They represent about 35% of our member
base now and over two-thirds of our sales. In terms of renewal rates, as I mentioned, they continue to be strong. Our
total membership eked up a little bit from the 90.0% at the end of the fiscal year to 90.2% and worldwide from an
86.3% to an 86.5%.
Going down the gross margin line, our reported gross margins were up 13 basis points, up to 10.81%. As usual, I'll ask
you to jot down four columns and six line items. Basically, the first two columns would be reported for the entire fiscal
year of 2013 and then the second column would be also for the entire year fiscal 2013 but without gas. And then for the
first quarter, this – columns three and four would be reported then without gas deflation.
Going down the lines, it'd be core merchandise year-over-year, ancillary businesses, 2% Reward, LIFO, other and total.
So again, going across, core merchandising for fiscal 2013 versus fiscal 2012 was lower by 4 basis points in both of
those columns. Ancillary businesses was better than the fiscal 2013 – plus 6 basis points in both of those columns. 2%
Reward minus 2 basis points in both columns. LIFO plus 5 basis points in both columns. Other plus 2 basis points in
both columns. That was a – that nonrecurring legal settlement which benefited our margins last year. And the total in
fiscal 2013 over fiscal 2012 it was up 7 basis points both on a reported basis and without gas.
For the first quarter, merchandise core reported was up 12 basis points, but without gas deflation up 3 basis points.
Ancillary up 5 basis points but without gas plus 2 basis points. 2% Reward minus 3 basis points and minus 2 basis
points. LIFO minus 1 basis point and minus one basis points. Other, zero and zero. So again, total reported for the first
quarter year-over-year in the first quarter was 13 basis points up but taking out gas deflation was up 2 basis points.
Now the core – in terms of core merchandising, the component of gross margin being up again 12 basis points but 3
basis points excluding gas. Both food and sundries and hardline sub categories were up in basis points year-over-year
while softlines was down slightly year-over-year and fresh foods had lower year-over gross margins as well. Ancillary
business gross margins were up as I mentioned 2 basis points without gas. E-commerce, Business Centers and
Pharmacy all showed higher margins year-over-year offsetting slightly lower gas margins. Our 2% Reward again
increasing sales penetration of that and therefore increasing Executive Member rewards caused a 2 basis point
year-over-year reduction in margin due to the Reward program. And LIFO, last year in the quarter we had a $2 million

LIFO credit. This year, there was a very small LIFO charge of about $1 million so about a 1 basis point swing
year-over-year.
Moving on to SG&A, our SG&A percentage in the first quarter was higher or worse by 17 basis points, coming in at
10.22% versus – this year in first quarter compared to 10.05% last year in the first quarter. Again, we'll do the same
four columns reported for the all of fiscal 2013 and then without gas. And then columns three and four reported for the
first quarter year-over-year and then without gas for the first quarter year-over-year.
In terms of operations in the fiscal year, both columns are the same, columns 1 and 2, zero and zero for operations,
Central zero and zero, RSUs or stock compensation minus 3 basis points and minus 3 basis points. Quarterly
adjustment plus two basis points and plus two basis points. For a total, in fiscal 2013 SG&A was higher by 1 basis
point or minus 1 basis point year-over-year.
Columns three and four, operations on a reported basis was 9 basis points of that 17 basis points minus 9 basis points,
without gas zero, Central minus 3 basis points and minus 2 basis points, stock or RSU compensation minus 5 basis
points and minus 5 basis points and no quarterly adjustments, and then again, total minus 17 basis points or 17 basis
points higher year-over-year in the first quarter, and again, without gas minus 7 basis points.
Now core operations, again, was flat excluding the impact of gas deflation. Within operations, our payroll SG&A
percentage was actually 2 basis points better year-over-year, while benefits, workers' comp and related expenses were
about 4 basis points worse year-over-year. So, those are the two big factors within SG&A for core.
Central expense was higher year-over-year; 2 basis points without gas, again, primarily related to the increased IT
spending as we continue our modernization efforts. This will – as I said this will continue to be a drag on SG&A,
especially as the new systems are placed into service and depreciation begins.
And finally, SG&A expense related to stock compensation I mentioned earlier and I'll go through the detail again was 5
basis points year-over-year.
In terms of pre-opening, $6 million higher coming in at $24 million in the first quarter, last year in the first quarter, we
had nine openings, as I mentioned, we had 13 openings this year, so no real surprises there.
All told, reported operating income in the first quarter totaled $639 million last year and was up to $668 million this
year, or an increase of $29 million. I won't go through the items I mentioned earlier.
Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was higher versus last year, coming in at $27 million, up
$14 million from last year's $13 million in the quarter, that's essentially the $3.5 billion debt offering we did and the
interest expense associated with that.
We did that I believe in mid-December, so there'll be a little bit of a year-over-year negative impact in Q2 and then it
will be no delta year-over-year. Interest income and other was lower by $2 million in the quarter coming in last year at
$20 million and this year at $18 million. Actual interest income component was slightly up, while the other component
was slightly down, nothing of size to mention.
Overall, pre-tax income was up from $646 million last year in the first quarter to $659 million this year. Below pre-tax
– tax rates, our effective tax rate this quarter came in at 34.6% or about 0.2% better or lower than last year's rate of
34.8%. I think most of it relates to simply the various discrete items that impact each year, so a little bit of
improvement there. Overall, net income was up $416 million last year to $425 million this year in the first quarter.
Quick rundown of other topics, balance sheet of course is included in today's press release. In terms of depreciation and
amortization for the first quarter it was $231 million. One of the metrics we always talk about is our accounts payable
as a percent of inventory.
On a reported basis, last year it was 108%. This year, in the first quarter it was 99%. Now, both of those numbers
include quite a bit of non-merchandise payables, particularly as we ramp up expansion so construction payables if you
will. If you just looked at merchandise accounts payable to inventories, last year's 108% was a 94% and this year's 99%

was an 89%. I'll talk about that in a moment of why that came down a little.
Average inventory per warehouse last year in the first quarter was $13.2 million. This year in the first quarter it was up
$1.2 million to $14.5 million, or up about 9%. Both those AP ratios and the higher inventories is for the most part
because of how Thanksgiving fell; one week later, in the calendar this year. And so the first week of Q2 versus last year
was the last week of Q1. Much of that excess has since been burned off and talking to the senior merchants there's
really no issues – their view is no issues with inventory levels going into the last few weeks before calendar year-end.
In terms of CapEx, for the quarter, it was $572 million. Our CapEx is estimated to be about $2.4 billion this year,
compared to $2.1 billion last year; a higher year-over-year spend, of course, due to the increased level of planned
openings.
In terms of dividends, our quarterly dividend remained at $0.31 a share, or a $1.24 on an annualized basis. Based on
shares outstanding that's about $540 million annual expenditure.
Costco online, we're now in four countries, U.S., Canada, U.K. and most recently, Mexico. Mexico e-commerce
commenced operations in late October. For the first quarter, sales and profits were up over last year. Q1 e-commerce
sales were up 24%, and excluding again the relative recent smaller start-ups in the U.K. and Mexico, U.S. and Canada,
before it was up 22%. And the e-commerce still is a relatively small part of our company, running about 2.5% of our
total sales.
We've had a variety of initiatives in that area. We always ask those questions, so I'll point out a couple of things. Of
course, a year and a half ago we replatformed the site, and shortly thereafter added mobile apps. We've combined – in
the last year; we've combined some e-commerce merchandising efforts with in line efforts. We think that's given us a
better merchandise capability there. We've added a few categories, most particularly apparel, some apparel items, and
we've done, I think, a better job of improving the timing of shipments by expanding the various shipping points, so
getting the merchandise more quickly to our members.
In terms of expansion, last year we opened 26 units and ended the year – started fiscal 2013 a year, a quarter ago at 608
units and ended at 634 units. So, it was up a little over 4% square footage growth. This year, assuming we get to the 30
net units on a base of 634 units that would be – it would round up to about 5% square footage growth. Again, the 30
units would – if we get to 30 units – we expect to 16 units in the U.S., 4 units in Australia, 3 units in Canada, 2 units
each in Korea, Japan and Spain and 1 units in Mexico. And square footage at Q1 end totaled 92,654,000 square feet.
With that, I'll turn it back to Jasmine, for Q&A and then I'll put myself on speaker phone here.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Hey, Richard. So on the gross margin by category, can you give a little color? Like two
were up, two were down. I know mix might be some of the explanations, right? Say hardlines up because maybe
Majors and TVs down. But a little more color on that? And are there clear areas where you're making some price
investments in that grouping of four?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, clearly fresh foods is one I talked about in the past. While fresh food margins
year-over-year in the quarter were down frankly they were down I think less – in Q4 it was a bigger down
year-over-year. There are a lot of moving parts of course but those are – when I go to the budget meeting each month
and hear the merchants talk certainly fresh foods is an important part. As we go into the seasonal period of September
through December you're trying to do some hot prices on exciting non-food items as well. Bigger ticket items. I don't
think – TVs – in my view has little more to do with SG&A. When you sell a few less $1,000 price point items that
probably impacts your SG&A a little bit. But I don't even know how much it moves the needle given – it helps but it's

one of many things.
So we keep doing what we're doing. I don't think there are any big surprises to us in these numbers. If anything one of
the things I mentioned last quarter when I pointed out fresh foods were I think 80 or so basis points lower
year-over-year and it's quite a bit less than that delta in the first quarter. Part of that was as we maintain some key
prices on some very high volume key items like the rotisserie chickens as some of the underlying costs come down a
little from their peak that helps margin a little bit. So I think it's more, we haven't changed what we do necessarily to try
to reduce that delta or improve a positive delta. It's just where it came out. We're ever-diligent in being competitive out
there.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Do you think longer term over a 5 year to 10 year time horizon that as Kirkland
penetration goes up, do you think that gives you much room to get sharper on branded pricing or not really – that's an
independent decision?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I think there's 100 different – honestly there's 100 different independent decisions.
And that's part of it. Certainly, when we expand Kirkland Signature it does a lot of things. In many cases as you
suggested we can get a little bit more margin and provide even greater value to our member. As important in some
cases it drives a lower price on the branded item as the branded item loses market share to the private label. And which
again serves us and our member well. So on an overall basis probably increasing penetration of KS helps you. I think
increasing penetration of our total sales in locations that aren't – don't have a direct warehouse club competitor helps
you a little bit in some of these other countries. As you can see from our segment analysis certainly it would imply that
in Canada which again has been a very strong economy and growth for us locally as well not having a direct warehouse
club probably works a little higher margin. Not a lot. We don't take great advantage of that.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: And in terms of expansion so where do you – and I know every country will have different
levels of capacity people wise. But when you sort of aggregate it, is there a level – so you do 30 units this year maybe a
couple more next year. Is there a level where you simply for people reasons cannot go beyond that without fearing
execution might slip?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: For us long-term is two or three years sometimes. I think five years ago when we were
averaging something in the low 20s our goal was to see if can we can get it up to 30 units. And we feel pretty
comfortable as I've indicated in the last few calls that both this year and over the next three or four years some number
in the low to mid-30s we feel pretty good about. Hopefully starting at 30 units and ending at 35 units in a few years.
Beyond that, one would think that we could expand that a little bit if the opportunities still present themselves out there.
I don't think that will be a people issue.
I think more – some of it has been particularly, we've done, as you know, a lot of ramp-up in several countries. We've
gone from whatever, 8 units to 18 units or 9 units to 18 units in Japan in the last couple of years. We're going to go
from 3 units to 7 units or 8 units in Australia this year. And we're adding as fast as we can. It's harder to do in Taiwan
and Korea getting sites but we've got the pipeline full so hopefully we'll get a little more there. And so that's strains you
a little bit because you don't want to move some of those people. If anything, we've devoted more people to those areas
but I don't think that's a constraint. I mean if we did 25 units a year four or five years ago and we're doing 30-ish plus a
year now, and five years from now certainly something north of that assuming the opportunities out there present
themselves is certainly a likelihood.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Paul E. Trussell>: Hey. Good morning, Richard. Just if we kind of strip out the impact of gas, could you just
speak more to operating margin performance this quarter in the various segments between U.S. versus Canada and
international?

<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I think the detail will be in the Q. I don't think there's any big trend changes from
most recent year and quarters. In terms of operating profitability as a percent of sales, Canada is stronger than the U.S.
It has had a great economy. It's been a great business for us. It has no direct warehouse club operator. Its healthcare
costs on average are a little lower. So all those things work in our favor. The other column is – it generally is more
profitable but again we're opening a lot of new units so we're cannibalizing. You know, going into Spain we will
certainly have not only initial – not only a little extra pre-opening but once we get open, half a million or a million a
month just in central over there, with one partial unit for a few months. So I think those things tend to make that
column a little harder to understand other than generally speaking many of those countries in that other column tend to
be a higher pre-tax percent of sales than the U.S.
<Q - Paul E. Trussell>: Thank you. That's helpful. And then just moving to the U.S., could you just give us an update
on the top line trends that you're seeing in California?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: No big differences. I mean, I think the big differences in California were way back when
the economy first got hit. Not only California but Arizona, Las Vegas and Florida [indiscernible] (27:25) if I recall
correctly. Those were the ones that were hit hardest. I think California overall is probably a shade lower than the rest of
the U.S. but the rest of the U.S. includes Midwest, Texas where we're opening new units and we've been pretty
successful in seeing little – more robust top line sales growth.
<Q - Paul E. Trussell>: Got it. And just my last question: can you just remind us and give us on expense side how
should we think about some of these investments that you're making and the impact over the next few quarters?
Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, the one that I pointed out for now the last probably five fiscal quarters, all of the
quarters last year and plus this first quarter is IT modernization. We finally had the courage I think a few years ago to –
recognizing that we had great homegrown systems that were kept together and allowed us to do what we want to do but
as we're becoming more global and bigger and getting to a platform and a whole IT infrastructure, that will serve us as
we go from hopefully $100 billion to $200 billion in the next many years. That's several hundreds of millions of dollars
over three or four years. We're halfway into it, maybe a little under halfway into it. So again my guess is I'll be talking
to you about a few basis points each quarter year-over-year and incrementally probably into 2015 before it starts
flattening out and coming down.
But those have not only is a lot of that expenditure necessary, there's dividends that will come – we believe that will
come from it too. In a way, one of the first modernization things we did even before we called it modernization was
replatforming dotcom a year and a half ago. We feel that is – again, we had a website that the search engines couldn't
even crawl on it to give you a simple example. We see the potential there. Still small, relative small business to our
company, but a very profitable business. So we think there's a lot of opportunities as we replatform and rewrite the
membership system that the basic buying systems, the depot systems but it's necessary as well. So beyond that, I mean,
it doesn't seem like healthcare costs are going to change dramatically in the U.S. as a higher percentage of our total
company is from overseas, outside of U.S. For the most part every other country that we operate in, the healthcare
related cost are lower as a percent of sales. I might be wrong on one country but for the most part that's correct.
So those are the kinds of things that I, again, there's some probably a few structural things that as non-U.S. sales
become a higher percentage of the total company, whether it's a lack of direct warehouse competition in many of these
countries, whether it's lower healthcare costs as a percent of sales, in some cases a little higher membership fee
percentages as a percent of sales, maybe in some cases occupancy as a percent of sales is a little higher but more than
offset by the other things I mentioned. So generally speaking I think that will tend to help us a little bit and I've tried to
point that out as we go along here.

<Q - Meredith Adler>: Hi. Thanks very much. I'd like to start, as you're talking about international and you are going
to be opening a couple of clubs in Spain, could you talk a little bit about what your strategy is about Europe? Is there a
reason for Spain and not for France or Italy? Just wondering how you think about that.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, we've talked about Spain and France with Spain coming first and France hopefully
the following year. So we have a few people on the ground in France or less than a few but we're working towards that.
And when we looked at where are we going to go before we decided on those two, there's various different parts of the
world, we felt that we've had a place of operation in the U.K. for many years under a little different format in terms of
how we market to our Gold Star members in the U.K., but we always looked at Western Europe as a good opportunity
for us.
Frankly, the economies over there we feel have allowed us the opportunity to get in and to be welcome. We provide
good high paying jobs where we're great competitors and frankly, we see the economy a little better than some of the
numbers you just read about in unemployment. So we think it was, A, an opportunity for us to get in when historically
it was a little harder and we'll see where we go from there. But to start with, it will be Spain first, France second and
then we'll let you know when we know.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Okay. And is it fair to say that you are looking at places where people are looking for those
unique values, so Germany where the economy's been stronger there would just be something that would come lower
on the list of priorities?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, we do better in stronger economies, frankly. I think each country has its own set of
challenges compared to the United States. And again, we really haven't looked – I'm not prepared to talk a lot about
some of those other countries at this point since we're focused right now on really ramping up the existing countries
we're in like Asia, the newer countries like Asia and Australia as well as what we're doing here in these new two
countries over in Europe.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Okay. Great. And then I have a question about e-commerce. First, I was just wondering, I'm
sure you do talk to your members, what kind of feedback do you get from them about how much they want
e-commerce to be sort of part of what they get from Costco? And is it discussions with them that has a big influence on
what you actually sell online or are you trying to test new things or sort of branch out in any way through e-commerce?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, we take member comments all the time both online and in warehouse. Look,
e-commerce is certainly an important component of what's out there and what's growing. We recognize we're a retail
competitor. It's part of the landscape. We're very much a brick and mortar. It's – 97%-plus of our business is in-store,
not online. What we have done is we looked at it as not trying to offer a million different items to our members.
Arguably, we don't offer a million different items to them in-store. We offer less than 4,000. And we view it as an
extension of that in some categories as well as some overlap. We've been successful in bigger ticket items or hard to
handle items like furniture and televisions.
But I think the example I mentioned earlier about apparel, we tried some apparel items several years ago online, and it
underwhelmed us and our members. We're trying some different things now, and it seems to be working. But again,
e-commerce is a small percent and a given department like that is a small percent. But we are getting some traction.
Look, we want our members to buy everything at Costco, whether it's in store or online, and we'll keep trying some
new things.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Great. That's very helpful. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Montani from ISI Group.
<Q - Michael D. Montani>: Hey, Richard. Good morning. I wanted to ask about inflation. It looks like maybe with

out there 6-9 months out?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, currently, again we had I think a very small LIFO charge. Given the volatility in gas,
it was deflationary, although I don't think we took any of that in the first quarter. We tend to wait into the year. That's
what we've done over the past many years. Probably including gas, yes, it was slightly deflationary but not reflected in
our LIFO, a small LIFO charge.
In terms of outlook, the only thing that I can recall from the budget meetings again has to do with some fresh food
items and commodities, an outlook of – three months ago the outlook was three months to six months hence, so that
would be now to three months. Generally speaking, I think that's still the case with the exception of some produce
items, which are more a function of what's going on with weather in different places. I know there's been shortages in I
think berries, and each of these items are big volumes for us, and that drives the price of these up, so the availability of
these things up. But overall I haven't heard about a lot of – from the general nonfood areas anything big.
If I look at the last month, just scrolling down, the 30 biggest inflationary items, many of them – there's a few on the
beef side. There are several produce like strawberries is up 25%-plus, blueberries up more than that on a cost basis.
Then I look on the deflationary side, you have the usual suspects of electronics and gas, of course as I mentioned earlier
and a few other items that generally are some commodity items that peaked a year ago and have come down some. So
again, no big inflation raise at this time.
<Q - Michael D. Montani>: Got it. And then just a quick follow-up on Kirkland. Can you just remind us where the
penetration is today? And is it still kind of 50-75 bps-type penetration increases that you're seeing?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It's in the 23% plus range. My guess, it's 0.5%. Part of that is, is gas – as we roll out gas in
Canada and as gas continues – aside from gas deflation right now, gas overall is generally – as gas for the company has
gone from 9% to 10% to 11% to 12%, everything else, KS is increasing relative to that other 87% or 88%.
<Q - Michael D. Montani>: Got it. Okay. And then just an e-commerce question actually that has somewhere of the
two parts, if you'd bear with me. The first part is, can you just talk about some of the efforts that you have to sort of
integrate your work online with the in-store experience? And how there's interplay there? And then the second one is,
the AP-to-inventory ratio this quarter obviously came down a little bit. When we look at one of your largest
competitors in Amazon, it's north of 200 basis point. So I'm just wondering if there's opportunity for initiatives there to
really increase that? And if we'll hear about you guys cohabiting so to speak on warehouses, with some vendors or
anything like that?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah, well, first of all, as it relates to Amazon's enviable 200 basis point, I think a lot of
that, as I understand it, for every dollar of reported sales they've got close to $0.50 of other throughput which is not a
sale. It doesn't report on their GAAP income statement, because they're handling merchandise for others where they
charge service fees for doing that. In many instances when that merchandise is sold, it's sold through Amazon. Amazon
gets the money and doesn't pay those third party sellers if you will until after. So a big chunk of that has to do – my
understanding is, and I could be wrong, a big chunk of it is that.
I would assume as they handle more inventory that are in their sales, that will pressure that number a little bit, but by no
means, that's a very enviable number to have. In our case, on the one hand we've always looked how can we get to
100%? Can we get no cash required for our inventories? It's going to fluctuate. This one downturn here, it has more to
do with Thanksgiving than anything. That one week burning a couple extra days of sales or incremental equivalents of
a day or plus of sales, get that back in order pretty quickly.
I think that as we're ramping up expansion that will tend to reduce the number a little bit. But we've always been in the
high 80s to very low 100s depending on which fiscal quarter and timing it is in. I don't see a lot of change there.
Ultimately, if we can turn our inventory faster it's going to help that. If – gas has helped it in a perverse way. That
means when we turn our gas many times a week, forget about – many, many times a year, so we've got a lot of
payables there relative to inventory. So I think that it's going to fluctuate a little bit. The only thing I wanted to point
out in this quarter was Thanksgiving had more to do with the reduction there. I think our inventory turns – our goal is to
continue to turn it faster. E-commerce turns it faster for sure for us but it's 2.5% percent of our business.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Fassler from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Stephen V. Tanal>: Thanks a lot. Good morning. This is Steve Tanal on for Matt Fassler. We were hoping you
could comment on the buybacks. Specifically, did you guys do any this quarter and if so, how many shares did you
repurchase?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: We did not do any this quarter but stay tuned.
<Q - Stephen V. Tanal>: Okay. And then just to clarify an item on the stock expense. I guess you mentioned that
some of the increase year-on-year was related to sort of more people – basically with more tenure. Is that a trend that
continues here going forward and would you expect additional pressure on that line because of it?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: That'll continue to have some pressure. Recognizing every time somebody is – a given
person hits 25, 30, or I think very few examples at 35 – that's going to hit it although that reduces that amount because
it's the same charge over five years. It just comes sooner. And so it'll be bumpy sometimes. When I looked at the four
quarters this coming fiscal year the big hit is in Q1. It dips a little bit in Q2. It dips back up in Q3 and dips a lot in Q4
relative to theses increase, the increase we saw in Q1. Some of that has to do with the timing of acceleration.
In addition, we've always put again a lot of compensation focus in most of those people's cases – in many of the
managers and above if you will. Over half of their annual compensation relates to stock and hopefully stock price
performance. But we tended to try to keep the number of grants each year to a given person at given responsibility level
the same. This is the first time in many years that we've reduced it recognizing the stock has been very strong not only
this year but the last several years.
Now again, by reducing the grant by an average of around 15% per recipient and it ranged from zero for lower grants to
20% for our CEO and Chairman and board. That will continue to impact us for a few years here but I think this was a
little more of an anomaly this quarter. And it'll be an anomaly in the third quarter and sometimes it'll be a little less. But
overall I think it'll be a slight increase to SG&A in each of the next couple of years. Now one thing that will reduce it if
the stock next October is at a price lower than the $117 or $118. But we hope that goes the other way and it's a little
higher expense. So we'll see.
<Q - Stephen V. Tanal>: Sure. Thanks a lot.

Your next question comes from the line of Jason DeRise from UBS.

internationally. And so I was wondering if we can get some color on a few specific markets particularly in Canada and
Mexico. And I guess I'm talking about just top line success and if you can comment at all about how you're dealing
with numbers there.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah, well, internationally and for the most part – Canada first of all has had a great local
economy. It didn't get hit with the financial crisis that we in the U.S. did. Much of its economy – some of its economy
is natural resource based which has been on a boom for the last couple of years...
<Q - Jason A. DeRise>: But there's more competition in Canada, too. And when I look at some of your competitors
there it doesn't sound so rosy. So...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, but there's...
<Q - Jason A. DeRise>: There's got to be something else.

<A - Richard A. Galanti>: In our view there's less – well, there's no direct competition. There's no other warehouse
club operator. Mind you our Warehouse Club business is roughly an 11% gross margin. Other forms of big box
discount ranges anywhere from the very high teens to in the case of home improvement to the low to mid-30%s. But
call it the high teens to low-20%s for general merchandise big box discount. And supermarkets of course are in the
mid-20%s and up. So at 10% or 11% that's a pretty compelling value proposition when you don't have another
warehouse club operator. I think that helps us a little bit.
We don't take a lot of advantage of that. We have a little extra margins. In some countries, while our labor costs – in
every country we view our labor rates, wage rates, are at a significant premium to comparable big box retail. They
frankly are lower in terms of dollars in some countries. And sometimes lower, the top line purchasing power is not as
low. So that helps your percentages there. In some countries like Asia we have a lot more members per warehouse
when we start up, so we have a little higher membership fee, a little higher percentage of membership fees as a percent
of sales.
Again, the only – on a macro basis, the one thing internationally in some of these countries that stands out a little higher
might be occupancy, but we own 80% of our units. So you don't see that in SG&A frankly a lot. You see a little more
depreciation perhaps but you don't see rent charges.
<Q - Jason A. DeRise>: Right.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: And so all those things have tended to help. But by and large the one – in my view the big
factor is going to be no direct warehouse club competitor.
<Q - Jason A. DeRise>: Okay. And then in Mexico, I guess that's one that every monthly sales call has been called out
as one of the strengths, and we haven't seen that many openings from you. You do have a direct competitor there, so
maybe talk about what's working in Mexico.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, it's working very well for us. We have I think 33 units or 34 units. Sam's has over
100 units. They have been more, very much more aggressive over the years. We believe – we know sales-wise that our
units, like the U.S., do more volume per warehouse. Until July of 2012 we owned 50% of a venture and operated it
with a very good partner, Comercial Mexicana down there. They had some financial issues and so for I think five years
leading up to July 2012 over five years we opened a total of two units down there. We have ramped up our activities
and efforts down there. We opened I think one this year but we've got plans for more. And you'll see that come up a
little bit.
We're not going to go crazy. We're not going to go from 30 units to 40 units in a year. But you'll see that 0.4 number if
you will, two units over five years, increase quite a bit and continue in that direction.
<Q - Jason A. DeRise>: And just one more question about some of the new markets. As you thought about Australia
and I guess now Spain, is it more – do you think it's more like the Canadian market where if you keep your margin
structure in terms of your markups the same as the U.S. or any other market you compete in, that you think you just
come in at a wider gap and that's why you picked it, those markets as the next of the evolution? Or is there something
else about where you can source product that you're bringing back to the U.S.? I guess there's some less-known synergy
about shipping to Asia, creates American product and bring product back that you're selling in the U.S.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I like to think we're that smart, sometimes, but I think when we look at all – again, we look
at all countries around the world, where we're going to go. Australia we viewed, much like we did Alaska and Hawaii
25 years ago, where the margins and the markups in those two states were dramatically different than the mainland
here. And Australia also has a very high price structure. As I understand, two retail competitors have upwards of
two-thirds of the market share over there. So we came in with very – with our margins, which were even more dramatic
over there.
But we also look at as is what is the potential? Part of our due diligence, if you will, in addition to looking at various
metrics like population and small business and average household income, is really shopping the towns and going over
and visiting these places. Feet on the ground all the way from our Chairman and CEO to key merchants and operators

and see how vibrant the retail business and how competitive it is. We think that as we've gone in these countries clearly
we are the extreme value proposition in terms of markup.
Again, when we look at Spain we think the economy is a little better than some of the numbers would portray in terms
of unemployment, but we're there for a long-term also and the economy should get better over time. But it's less to do
about what products come from there. It's more to do, I mean, part of our success as an example in Asia and these other
countries is bringing not only Kirkland Signature items but in some cases U.S. sourced goods that aren't there. And we
all think of ourselves sometimes as liking things like Italian leather and cashmere from Europe. Guess what, some of
these other countries like big American stuff at great value and prices and so we've – that's helped us as well.

towards Christmas?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, of course we don't provide any guidance. Nice try. Well the only thing we did say,
certainly for everybody not just us in the U.S., thanks the switch of Thanksgiving a week later, certainly impacted
November reported sales and the November-ish month of our first quarter. The fact that there's five less days between
Thanksgiving and Christmas, less selling days, that's certainly going to be an impact for everybody out there but, you

<Q - Mike D. Otway>: Hey. Good morning, Richard. This is actually Mike Otway in for Scott. Thanks for taking the
questions. Just following up on Chuck's question, and kind of getting your take on the sales climate, aside from the one
less week that you talked about, a number of companies have seen their sales slow kind of post Labor Day and you
guys have been somewhat immune to the slowdown although that did change a little in November. Was that due in part
to the one less week as you just mentioned or is there really – is there anything else going on that you could comment
on?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: There's not a whole lot we see. Not really. We've commented on slower TV sales. It was
very strong a year ago. I think there's little less promotion out there. But that's really – there's not a whole lot beyond
that.
<Q - Mike D. Otway>: Okay.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Our frequency continues to be strong.
<Q - Mike D. Otway>: Okay. Great. And then just following up on that, it sounded like last quarter if my memory
serves correctly that you'd be willing to keep some margin if input prices fell more quickly as you maintained your
competitive pricing in areas such as food. Has anything changed in the competitive landscape over last couple of
months or what you see over the next few months that could mitigate your ability to capture some of that margin if it's
available?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, first of all, separate sales in margin. We don't really see a whole lot of change in the
landscape other than a few retailers opened earlier into Thanksgiving this year. But we don't really see a whole lot out
there different.

Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom from Sterne, Agee.
<Q - Renato Basanta>: Good morning. This is actually Renato Basanta on the line for Chuck. How are you guys?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Good.
<Q - Renato Basanta>: Just a quick follow-up on an earlier question. You guys mentioned no buybacks in the quarter
and haven't had any since 1Q 2013 it looks like. Can you just maybe talk a little bit about the strategy to return cash to
shareholders with regards to the various vehicles that are available to you, whether it be another special dividend or
increasing the ongoing dividend or starting to buy back more shares aggressively going forward?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I mean, again, it's more art form than science here. Historically, I mean, I still view
our outlook and our opportunities going forward positively. First and foremost is to ramp up expansion which we have
done, although we're generating more cash than that. We have historically for now, eight or nine years raised our
dividend every spring I believe. We of course did a big special cash dividend, a little over $3 billion last December.
And in terms stock buyback, I think you'll see all of the above. I don't – there's no, we haven't looked beyond where we
are now and we haven't – we're not sitting around looking at special dividends as an example. I'm sure next spring, the
board will consider what they want to do with the regular dividend. And again, I don't want to be coy but we'll continue
to look at stock buybacks and let you know next quarter what we did or didn't do. But we view all those vehicles as
logical vehicles for us going forward.
<Q - Renato Basanta>: Okay. Fair enough. And then just wondering if you could perhaps provide some perspective
on the U.S. consumer right now? The general retail environment seems to be more promotional this holiday season
while your approach has always kind of been more in terms offering everyday value. So I'm just wondering what you're
seeing out of the consumer in terms of his or her appetite for even more competitive pricing and do you think the
generally more promotional environment is affecting your business at all materially?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I don't think it's affecting – we do not think it's affecting us materially. The fact is, is when
there's a lot of promotions, they work. If some traditional merchants are backed up in inventory, they're going be very
much more promotional. I think as evidenced by our frequency, we still have them coming in and we have them
coming in at surprisingly a continued increase each year-over-year. Now that being said, if they stopped at one of these
promotions first, that's one less thing they may buy at Costco. But we feel very good about our merchandising and our
own marketing – our merchandise marketing activities that relates to the MVMs, some hot buys. We think that we've
got a lot of good things going on. So we're not – again, in talking to the senior merchants, we feel quite good about
coming out of the season with nothing unusual in terms of markdowns and having clean inventories. So I think that's in
my view good evidence that we're not seeing a big impact out there.
<Q - Renato Basanta>: Okay. Then just one more if I may. Can you provide an update and maybe some flavor on the
progress of some of your newer merchandising initiatives whether it be in organics or the upscaling of fresh foods and
cosmetics or improved assortments in apparel? Any color there would be appreciated. Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think you mentioned two or three of the ones that would be at the top of the list. Certainly
we've talked about apparel now for a year, year and a half of having still double digit increases year-over-year, two
years out. Part of that is our own commitment to expanded apparel. Part of that is some brands. Part of that is the
Kirkland Signature. We've got a great Italian wool men's pant that's $49 but actually $39 right now. And we've gone

from 100,000 to 1 million pairs in the last few years. We've got – we're massing that out better. Cosmetics, we've got a
couple units in the L.A. market where we're testing some expanded cosmetics. I would still like to get more brands to
sell us but we're pretty scrappy. We're getting a few things in ourselves but it's still a small business for us.
Ticket programs – whether it's for movies or ski vacations or local restaurants – those continue to grow. So again, I
think where we have been – probably one good thing over the last year or so with some of these nonfood categories like
from apparel to domestics to housewares – those have had some good legs for us.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Exstein from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Michael B. Exstein>: Thank you so much and thank you for the update on e-commerce. Could we sort of shift to
another part of e-commerce? Amazon announced today that they're going to start home delivery of grocery in the Bay
Area. Where are you in sort of thinking about what you do with the grocery business as new threats come into it and
how do you look at that new form of competition? Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, look, we'll keep looking at it. We have no plans currently to deliver to homes
anything other through e-commerce which tend to be nonfood items and very limited food stuff and certainly not fresh
foods. We enjoy watching the landscape as others are getting into those types of businesses. Some of the supermarket
chains, Walmart, Google is doing something in the Bay Area as a test with a number of brick and mortar retailers
including us where they'll deliver through the Google mall. They come in and buy it, we do some help in store at just a
couple locations as a test. But it's small and it's a test. So I think there's going be a lot of changes over time. Getting
overnight delivery or same day delivery is great but ultimately, you've got to pay for it and we'll see. I think there's
probably a market for it but we'll see how big that market is. We don't – we keep doing what we're doing in terms of
value. If things change dramatically out there, we'll figure it out. But there's a long way to go there first.
<Q - Michael B. Exstein>: Has your business in grocery in Seattle where Amazon has been most established been any
different overall than elsewhere in the country?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: No.
<Q - Michael B. Exstein>: Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Peter Benedict from Robert Baird.
<Q - Justin Kleber>: Hey. Good morning, Richard. It's actually Justin Kleber on for Pete. Just want to follow-up on
Michael's question there on the Online business. Clearly you guys have a lot of good momentum here. In terms of just
fulfillment as it relates to online orders, I mean it sounds like you guys aren't interested in delivering to homes, but just
curious where you stand in terms of developing capabilities such as buy online, pickup in store. Is that something we
should expect within the next few years? Or are these types of flexible fulfillment capabilities just not really important
to your core customer?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, first of all, we do – I mean a lot of what online is that we do – it's delivering to home
but it's delivering televisions and swing sets and furniture and some apparel. And, again, a very limited amount of shelf
stable, if you will, food items. But that's – and then we also do office products and things online to small business. But
look, 97.5% of our business is in store. It's continued to grow nicely. People actually do like to go out and shop.
And I think that probably when I've been asked the question before, even on Amazon Fresh up here in Seattle, or some
other type of fresh delivery in other parts of the country, in New York and what have you, my sense is, is probably
that's taking some market share more from what are the other daily or every-other-day alternatives when you're
stopping at the supermarket two-and-a-half, three times a week.

Again, on an incremental basis, is there something that you're going to get that way that you didn't get at Costco? But
we can keep you coming in and you're still getting a lot of key bulk items at our place on the fresh food side as well.
And we know our members, our most loyal members, are still getting some of those things at supermarkets, at other
forms of convenience. And Amazon will be just one of those or other forms of overnight or other delivery.
It's different value. Again, it's convenient – we recognize convenience as a value. I think both Amazon and some of
these others out there, the quality tends to be good. The availability sometimes is good or not. But it's – you're paying
for that convenience. And there's a lot of things that people are still going to buy at our place. And if we can keep you
coming in, then we'll get our share of that.
<Q - Justin Kleber>: Okay. That makes sense. And just a question on traffic, I think you said up 4.5% in the quarter.
It's been pretty consistently healthy. Is there any material difference you guys are seeing between just U.S. frequency
versus the trends internationally? Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It's pretty much the same. It's a little higher in newer markets, but if you asked me what's
most surprising that the U.S. is pretty darn close to the rest of the world. Canada is a little higher than that. And again,
as evidenced by a local comp – a local currency comp in the high singles, mid to high singles. And by the way, some of
the frequency numbers change like as we cannibalize, as we go from – in two years from roughly 9 units to 18 units in
Japan and add 2 or 3 more units in Tokyo, that's going to cannibalize and reduce the frequency of that existing unit.

Your next question comes from the line of Sandra Barker from Montag & Caldwell.
<Q - Sandra M. Barker>: Actually, my question's already been answered. Thank you.

Your final question comes from the line of Budd Bugatch from Raymond James & Associates.
<Q>: Hi, Richard. This is [ph] Justin (1:04:00) on for Budd today. My questions kind of go back to international, and
I'm curious if you could shed some light on what other countries similar to Spain exhibit attractive characteristics that
you may look to get into in the near future?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It'll be a while, but – and if I do, I wouldn't tell you.
<Q>: Okay. Fair enough. So moving onto my follow-up; where do you see the international business going as a percent
of total sales eventually and that exposure to the – in the currency fluctuations as a result?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I think look, it's going to continue to increase. I mean five years ago 80% of our
units, openings were in the U.S., or 75%. This year it will be 50%, 55% will be U.S. Over the next three or four years
probably a shade under 50% or maybe a 40% to 45% perhaps. So I think over time it will continue to increase. I think
the U.S. will still be above 50%. It's now around 70%, low 70s. But that will change over time. And again, the relative
profitability of these other countries tend to be a little higher than the U.S. So the profitability penetration will probably
get there a little earlier.
But in terms of currencies, arguably, we tend to have a currency in the U.S. that on average tends to be stronger over a
long period of times than others. So that will impact us. But as long as it's – we'll let you know what that impact is. I
don't see that being – that will be part of our makeup.
<Q>: Okay. Thanks for the questions.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Okay. Well, thank you.
