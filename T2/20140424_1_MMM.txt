Please turn to slide three and I'll turn the call over to Inge Thulin, 3M's Chairman, President and Chief Executive
Officer.
Inge G. Thulin
Thank you, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.
The first quarter was strong for 3M marked by organic growth in all business groups and across all geographic areas.
We posted record sales and returned record cash to shareholders while also increasing investments in R&D and
commercialization to reinforce our foundation for long-term success.
Let's look here at a few highlights. Earnings per share rose to $1.79, an 11.2% increase year-over-year. Sales were $7.8
billion, the highest first quarter total in 3M history. Organic growth was 4.6%, paced by our Health Care business at
6%. Industrial and Safety and Graphics each grew 5% organically. We saw organic growth each geographic area led by
Asia Pacific and Latin America/Canada at 7% each. Europe/Middle East/Africa grew 4%, followed by the United
States at 3%.
I'm very encouraged by our continued broad-based organic growth which is more evidence that our strategies are
working.
Currency reduced sales by 2% in the quarter which was about 1% worse than our expectation entering the year.
Operating margins were again strong at nearly 22%, up 30 basis points from last year. Four of our five business groups
reported margins greater than 21%.
It remains a good time to be a 3M shareholder. The company returned $2.3 billion to shareholders through cash
dividends and share repurchases. We increased our first quarter dividend by 35% which marked our fifty-sixth
consecutive annual increase.
In summary, the first quarter was a solid start to 2014. This is only possible because of the hard work of our entire 3M
team on a global basis. Because of their efforts, we continue to deliver consistent and strong results today, while at the
same time investing and building for the future.
Now please turn to slide number four. With one quarter behind us, we are reaffirming our earnings and organic growth
outlook for the full year. Earnings per share are expected in the range of $7.30 to $7.55 with organic local currency
sales growth in the plus 3% to plus 6% range. We now anticipate foreign currency translation to reduce full-year sales
by approximately 1%, a slightly bigger headwind than previous expectations.
Our tax rate estimate remains at 28% to 29% with cash flow conversion at 90% to 100%.
David will now take you through the details of the first quarter. David?
David W. Meline
Thank you, Inge. I'll begin by reviewing first quarter sales growth. Please turn to slide number five.
Worldwide organic local currency growth grew – was 4%, 4.6% in the first quarter with volumes up 3.4% and selling
prices up 1.2%. We continue to experience positive selling price changes across our businesses, boosted by world-class
innovation and strong new product flow, both of which are important elements of the 3M business model. In addition,
we have been raising prices in certain developing countries to help offset the impact of currency devaluations.
Foreign exchange impacts reduced worldwide sales by two percentage points in the first quarter, and as Inge
mentioned, this was about one percentage point worse than we expected at the beginning of the year. The most
significant currency headwinds were in Latin America, Canada at negative 12%, as several countries in the area
experienced devaluations. Currency impacts were negative 4% in Asia Pacific and a positive 2% in EMEA. On a total

U.S. dollar basis, sales rose 2.6% versus the first quarter of 2013.
Looking by area, demand accelerated in Asia Pacific in the first quarter with organic local currency growth of 7%.
Growth was led by strong double-digit performance in Japan where demand was elevated leading up to the April
consumption tax increase. China, Hong Kong grew 2% organically in Q1 or 8% excluding electronics. On a business
basis, all five groups within Asia Pacific generated positive organic local currency growth in Q1 led by Health Care and
Safety and Graphics.
Latin America/Canada also grew 7% organically, a nice acceleration versus the fourth quarter. Growth was led by solid
double-digit performances in Brazil and Mexico, our two largest Latin American subsidiaries in terms of sales. All five
businesses posted positive organic growth in Latin America/Canada during the quarter, including double-digit growth
in Health Care. Electronics and Energy also posted solid organic local currency growth in the area.
In Venezuela, we continue to manage through the economic turbulence and position our business for future success.
Sales and profits were down substantially in Venezuela during the quarter. We continue to manage our exposures
carefully and we'll stay on this path until the situation improves. For some time now, we have been actively managing
towards a neutral net monetary asset position in Venezuela. And at this point, it appears that any major event risk is
behind us.
Organic sales growth in EMEA was 4% in the first quarter, continuing the positive trends that we have seen over the
past few quarters. West Europe grew 3% with strong performances in Nordic, Alpine and Iberia regions. Middle
East/Africa also posted strong organic growth in the quarter. On a business basis, growth in EMEA was strongest in
Industrial and in Safety and Graphics.
In the United States, organic local currency growth was 3% in the quarter which was a bit slower than the growth we
saw in the second half of 2013. It does appear that weather negatively impacted certain channels that we serve in the
U.S., particularly in road construction, retail and industrial distribution.
On the positive side, Health Care posted the strongest U.S. growth amongst our five businesses.
Organic local currency growth was nearly 5% across all developing markets and 4.5% in developed markets. And
again, as Inge mentioned, organic growth was positive across all major geographic areas.
Let's turn to slide number six for a discussion on the first quarter income statement. Sales for the quarter were $7.8
billion, up 2.6% in dollar terms. Gross profit rose 3.7% to $3.8 billion and gross margins increased 0.5 percentage
points to 48.5%. SG&A spending increased in line with sales growth and R&D as a percent of sales rose by 20 basis
points to 5.8%.
Operating income increased by just over 4% versus the first quarter of 2013. GAAP operating margins were 21.9%, up
30 basis points year-on-year.
Organic volume growth added 30 basis points to margins and the combination of lower raw material costs and higher
selling prices contributed a positive 110 basis points year-on-year.
An inherent part of 3M's business model is to leverage productivity and other gains to fund strategic investments while
continuing to generate premium returns. This is seen again in our first quarter numbers. We invested the equivalent of
90 basis points of margin on incremental programs around disruptive R&D, business transformation, and ERP and
restructuring. In particular, we invested $40 million on restructuring and other realignment efforts in Q1 across a
number of business units.
Lower year-on-year pension and OPEB expense boosted first quarter margins by 50 basis points while foreign
exchange impacts reduced margins by 50 basis points.
All-in first quarter earnings increased 11% to $1.79 per share. Foreign currency impacts reduced first quarter earnings
per share by $0.04, and the lower tax rate resulted in a $0.04 per share benefit.

As a result of our announced changes in capital structure strategy, average diluted shares outstanding declined by 4%
versus last year's first quarter, which added $0.07 to first quarter earnings per share.
In summary, the first quarter was a good start to the year in 2014. Organic sales growth was broadly positive across
businesses and geographies. Margins were strong overall, and we expect this performance to continue into the future.
Now, let's turn to cash flow. Turn to slide number seven. As a reminder for those who are new to 3M, we announced at
our December 2013 Investor Meeting our plans to manage towards a better optimized capital structure going forward
and to allocate capital accordingly. The strength and stability of our business model and strong free cash flow
capability enables us to enact these changes while continuing to invest in our businesses. Organic growth remains our
first priority, so we will continue to invest in CapEx, R&D and commercialization capability. In addition, we are ready
and able to respond to strategic acquisition opportunities that can strengthen our portfolio.
And at the same time, our plan affords us the opportunity to return significant cash to shareholders. We communicated
our intent to implement these changes to our capital structure over time. For the calendar year 2014 in particular, we
expect to add leverage of $2 billion to $4 billion on the balance sheet.
So now let's discuss our cash flow performance for the first quarter. We generated $1.1 billion of operating cash flow in
the quarter, up $98 million versus last year's first quarter. Higher net income drove the lion's share of the increase.
Capital expenditures were $293 million, a decrease of $31 million versus last year. We continue to expect full-year
CapEx will be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion.
First quarter free cash flow was $799 million, up $129 million year-on-year and we converted 66% of net income to
cash versus 59% in last year's comparable quarter. Note that first quarter is typically our seasonal low with respect to
free cash flow conversion. For the full year 2014, we expect to be in the range of 90% to 100%.
We paid $566 million in cash dividends during the quarter, up substantially over the $440 million paid in 2013. As Inge
mentioned earlier, we increased our first quarter per share dividend by 35%. Gross share repurchases were $1.7 billion
in the first quarter. For 2014, we expect full-year gross share repurchases will be in the range of $4 billion to $5 billion.
Let's now review our first quarter performance on a business-by-business basis. Please go to slide number eight. Our
Industrial business posted strong first quarter results with $2.8 billion in sales and 5% organic local currency growth.
Leading the way this quarter was our 3M Purification business, which drove strong double-digit organic growth. This
business has gained significant traction around the globe as we expand our technology capability and product offerings.
We also generated double-digit organic growth in Automotive OEM, which was more than twice the rate of growth in
global auto production. Our Advanced Materials and Industrial Abrasives businesses also posted nice first quarter
organic growth. Industrial sales grew broadly across all geographic areas during the quarter. Organic local currency
sales growth was 6% in both EMEA and Latin America/Canada, 5% in Asia Pacific and 3% in the U.S.
First quarter operating income was $618 million, up 7% year-on-year. Operating margins increased 80 basis points to
22.3%. Margins were boosted by volume leverage, positive priced raws and good productivity partially offset by
restructuring costs. We also improved margins year-on-year in Ceradyne, a business we acquired in late 2012, which
added 30 basis points to Industrial margins in Q1.
Please turn to slide nine. Safety and Graphics sales were $1.4 billion in the quarter with organic local currency sales
growth of 5%. Our largest business here is Personal Safety, which generated double-digit organic local currency
growth. We also grew in our Roofing Granules and Commercial Solutions businesses. Sales in Traffic Safety and
Security Systems declined slightly on an organic basis, impacted by a slow start to the road construction season.
Safety and Graphics grew organically in all major geographic areas with Asia Pacific up 9%, Latin America/Canada
and EMEA each up 5% and the U.S. up 2%.
Operating income was $318 million in the first quarter and operating margins were a solid 22.3%, although margins
were down year-on-year versus a very strong comp.

Major factors impacting this quarter's margins were higher ERP investment, restructuring and negative currency
impacts.
Please go to slide 10. Our Health Care business once again delivered outstanding results. It was our fastest-growing and
highest margin business group in the first quarter. Sales were $1.4 billion and increased 6% in organic local currency
terms.
All businesses contributed to this growth in the first quarter, led by Health Information Systems, Food Safety and Drug
Delivery Systems.
All geographic areas generated positive organic local currency sales growth, with Latin America/Canada up 12%, Asia
Pacific up 10%, the U.S. up 7% and EMEA up 2% in the quarter.
In developing markets, Health Care grew 10% organically in the first quarter, yet another in a long string of
double-digit performances.
First quarter operating income in Health Care was $427 million and operating margins increased 30 basis points
year-on-year to 31.1%.
Now let's look at Electronics and Energy found on slide 11. First quarter sales in this business were $1.3 billion, up 4%
in organic local currency terms. Electronics-related sales increased 5% on an organic local currency basis with positive
growth in optical films, partially offset by declines in other businesses.
In our Energy-related businesses, sales increased 2% organically, led by renewable energy and telecom.
On a geographic basis, organic local currency sales increased 9% in Latin America/Canada and 7% in Asia Pacific.
EMEA was down slightly and the United States declined 4% year-on-year.
Operating income rose 16% to $227 million and operating margins were 17.3%. Margins in this business continued to
track higher, rising two points year-on-year and 60 basis points sequentially. Volume leverage and improving
productivity were both positive contributors to first quarter margins.
Finally, let's review the Consumer business found on slide number 12. Sales in the Consumer business group were $1.1
billion, with organic local currency growth of 3%. Sales in our Stationery and Office Supply business declined versus
last year's first quarter. Store traffic in the U.S. office retail channel was softer in the quarter, due in part to harsh winter
weather conditions along with continued store consolidations. Our Construction and Home Improvement business,
which serves the DIY retail market space, led Consumer's growth this quarter with high-single-digit organic local
currency sales growth.
Over the years, we have built strong market positions in categories such as Filtrete brand home furnace filters,
Scotch-Brite painter's tape and Command brand mounting and fastening products, which provide a strong foundation
for consistent, strong growth. On a geographic basis, organic local currency growth was 6% in Asia Pacific, 5% in
Latin America/Canada and 1% each in the US and EMEA. Operating income was $228 million with operating margins
of 21.2%. That concludes my first quarter related comments and I'll turn the call back over to Inge.
Inge G. Thulin
Thank you, David. As you can see, the year is off to a good start. We continue to execute well against our long-term
strategic levels, which I would like to update you on. Let's first start with Portfolio Management. In the first quarter, we
realigned and combined certain businesses to increase customer relevance, build scale and generate cost efficiency. In
the Safety and Graphic business group, we merged Commercial Graphics and Building and Commercial Services into a
newly formed Commercial Solutions Division. This brings a comprehensive array of branding, design, protection and
the maintenance solutions under one division, allowing us to present one strong voice to the commercial market
customers.

Earlier this month, we also further realigned our Electronics-related businesses to more effectively position them to
accelerate growth. We are now organized around two large divisions. One is Display Materials and Systems, which
consolidates all of 3M's capabilities in electronic displays. Batteries Electronics Materials Solutions, which aligns our
offerings in semiconductor electronic materials and components. These changes will better align our capabilities with
customers' needs and expand our leadership in this area.
Also in April, 3M acquired Treo Solutions, a leader in the health care data analytics. This will bolster our Health
Information System business by allowing it to supply customers with better solutions at lower costs.
Let's talk about the second lever, investing in innovation. Innovation is the heartbeat of 3M. It drives what we do every
day and allows us to create even greater value for customers. Innovation generates new growth and is the key to our
long track record of generating premium returns throughout the business. In fact, one-third of our revenue in 2013 came
from products created within the last five years, and we are targeting 37% by 2017. And we are expanding our
innovation capabilities globally. We have now built 45 Innovation Centers around the world where customers gain
exposure to the breadth of our technology.
Our international labs are also typically staffed and led by local nationals, and our commitment to innovation helps 3M
recruit some of the best and brightest scientists from all over the globe. It's notable that 47% of our new products
launched in 2013 were led by international labs, up from 37% just a few years ago. The results are strong with more
opportunities still to come.
Now let's talk about the third lever, business transformation. We continue to make progress on implementing our global
ERP system which will lead to a more agile and efficient 3M. To date, we have gone live in five countries with more
scheduled for 2014. Most recently, we launched this in one of our European distribution centers based in Dabrowa,
Poland. We are learning more with each implementation on using that knowledge to guide and refine all future work.
There's one final point I'd like to make before taking your questions. When we last met in January, I talked a bit about
how 3M managed through volatility in developing markets. Given the uncertainties in some areas of the world today,
I'd like to expand a bit upon that discussion. We have a deep history in developing nations. 3M entered Brazil in 1946
and a year later, 1947, in Mexico. With that history comes a wealth of experience and business teams that know how to
be successful in those areas. This is also the model we are using in Central East Europe, Middle East/Africa and APAC.
This is the 3M international model. We enter early, develop connections through our customer base and steadily build
capability. We staff our management teams with local nationals, people who know the country, culture and customs,
and of course, speak the language.
As with any growth opportunity, there are going to be challenges along the way, and developing markets are no
exception. Yet when these challenges arise, we do not abandon our customers or the market. Our leaders know how to
manage through them, knowing from experience that 3M will emerge even stronger, with a more established presence
and more loyal customer base.
Our approach continues to produce strong results, including this year's first quarter. In Brazil, as one example, we grew
11% organically, and in Mexico, 15%. And we see developing countries coming back in terms of growth rate.
Developing markets in total represent 35% of 3M sales today, and we expect that number to keep climbing.
Thank you for your attention, and with that, we are now ready to take your questions.

<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Good morning. Just a broad question, as I look at 3M, you guys delivered another quarter of
some of the best top line growth in the industry. And if you look at the margin expansion, you actually started to get it.
But then if you look at the operating line, the leverage seems to be limited. And I understand it's a function of some of
the discretionary spending that you guys are doing; so two questions. A, what is the level, what is the run rate of
discretionary spending that we should be expecting for the rest of the year?
And second, a broader question, 3M seems to be a combo of an industrial company and a consumer company. But your
operating leverage now behaves a lot more like a consumer company than an industrial company. Do we get some
operating leverage from the industrial side at some point this year? Thank you.
<A - Matthew Ginter>: Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. So in terms of the leverage we get from growth, we saw in the first
quarter I think very typical of what we would expect from the overall business, which is somewhere 35% to 40%
operate leverage on the growth that we got. And what's true is, as you pointed out and as we had planned, we do plan to
reinvest a significant portion of that in some of these key strategic investments through 2014. So we had said in the
beginning of the year that we expect to invest in these investment programs somewhere between $0.10 to $0.20 a share
during the year, and we invested $0.07 a share in the first quarter.
So we still expect to invest at that $0.10 to $0.20 range, probably towards the high end, the way it looks right now. But
what you can expect through the year is that you'll see some moderation of that spending. So, obviously, the business
transformation and the R&D investment is pretty steady through the year. We also invested – we did some restructuring
in the first quarter that we'll look at each quarter and determine whether or not there are projects that we should
undertake. And also, some of the spending was in this European supply chain Center Of Excellence, which we'll lap
that spending here as we move into the second quarter.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: And just on structural, I understand that you need to invest and it's part of the culture, but as I
said, should we see more operating – more top line dropping to the bottom line in the second half of the year? Is that a
reasonable expectation given what you've stated?
<A - Matthew Ginter>: Yeah. If you look at the plan we laid out for the year, what you could foresee is that we will
see some net increase in our margins for the year, which we did see already here in the first quarter. So, I think it's fair
to assume that that will continue as we look through the full year.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Thank you.
<A - Matthew Ginter>: Yep.

Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Thanks and good morning, all,
<A - Matthew Ginter>: Morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Morning, Steve.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: The 50 basis point increase in gross margin and when I look at the gross margin overall,
the highest I think since 2006 or certainly for a long time, and you had peaked in that earlier time period over 50%. I
know we're having the discussion about investments below the gross margin line but is most of that increase on the
pricing versus raw material front? And how do you think about the sustainability? Clearly, you have a lot of pricing
power and you're making up for some inflationary issues but when you sort of look at your material cost position, cost
out and continued pricing efforts, are there other things going on there on the volume leverage, et cetera, where we can
sort of see that number also continue to tick up for some time?

<A - Matthew Ginter>: Sure. So, yeah, so if you – you know you're right, Steve. We were encouraged this quarter by
the improvement in our gross margin which seasonally for us, the first quarter is usually the lowest of the year. So that
was encouraging if we look year-over-year. While it's true it's a combination of several factors, certainly productivity
features in that and you've heard us really focus in these last couple of years around the rejuvenation and taking Lean
Six Sigma to the next level and so we're seeing I think some of that coming through. Certainly, we've been working the
portfolio to focus resources where the best opportunities are and I think that's certainly contributing to the overall gross
margin profitability of the company.
And then finally there's certainly, as you know and as you pointed out, there's a component of price and raw material
that's supporting this. On the pricing side, we had quite strong pricing in the first quarter, down a little bit from the
fourth quarter but nonetheless quite strong at 1.2%. And if you look at that, about half of that was attributable to the
freshness of the product portfolio and really the price/value relationship that our customers ascribe to those products.
And the other half was largely attributable to offsetting the foreign exchange movements, in particular in the emerging
markets. So it was a combination of several factors but obviously it's something that we continue to focus on and seek
to improve.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: That's great. And, Inge, you've talked to us about yet another organizational set of
changes internally that just sound like a continued large transformation going on. Are these latest ones that you've
talked about today, I mean how much – it sounds like it's all channel driven, but are you also going to reap some cost
synergy benefits from this? Are there other elements besides the channel and customer-facing front here that will be –
we can see the benefits from over time?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. You know first of all, if you go back to when we lay out our six new strategies when I
took office a little bit more than two years ago, the first strategy that is calling out, relevance to customers. And this is
the implementation of that. So when you have a strategy, you need to follow through in order to make sure that you're
on the way to obtain your overall objective. So some of the changes that we have done is clearly based on relevance to
customers for us to be able to respond faster based on their needs where you know, as you know, that our technology
platforms are very important.
And we need to be able to respond fast back to them based on solutions we are working with, with them. And in my
mind, as we often looked into the organizational structure maybe for almost 10 years, there was some disconnect in
between our internal organization and the market. So we are addressing that. And, of course, so you drive it first from
relevance to customer to market. But there is also cost benefit, of course, in the organizational structure as you make
those moves because you reduce specifically in the back-office and in the middle management where you can reduce
costs and be more agile, and so forth.
So if you think about it from a speed perspective because we would like to accelerate speed in terms of responsiveness
to customers, we have in some parts of the world that we not have talked about now for a long time, also consolidate
subsidiaries into region in the part of West Europe. And we have done the same in Latin America, et cetera. So if you
think about that, where you now have connection points where we previously, in some cases, had three sizable but not
huge divisions that needed to interact, for instance, in Nordic with four different countries where we today have one to
one.
So you have one huge division totally focused on a market space, in your one geographical area in Nordic. That's
incredible move and shift if you think about speed in order to execute where you went from three Vice Presidents back
in St. Paul and four Managing Directors, Nordic. Now you go one for one. I can tell you that has an incredible impact
on the organization in terms of speed as we move ahead. So look upon it like increased relevance in the front and for
the customers, and for us also to be able to leverage cost in our structure, both in international and in the center of the
organization.

Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you. Inge and David, are you able to break out the weather impact in Q1? And if so,
how much of those are permanent? And how much will be recaptured in future quarters?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, first of all, it's difficult in a way to talk about it because we are a global company. So
some places around the world, the weather was okay. So I think – and if you think about it, there was some impact in
United States and United States is 35% of our business. So it's difficult for us to quantify it, but of course we had some
impact of it in United States, specifically. And it was related to, as David said, was traffic in the stores was down,
which had an impact on our Consumer business, and there was also a delay in some of the construction and specifically
relative to traffic safety and road safety. If you take road safety and traffic safety, I think that will come back. It's a
timing issue so we will get that back as we go. If you go into the combination of lower traffic in the stores the first
quarter, that's maybe gone, but we will compensate that in a different way. But we don't talk much about weather, to be
honest, right? We're a global company and the sun is always shining somewhere and that is what we need to capitalize
on.
<A - David W. Meline>: If I could just add briefly, David. So if you look at the U.S. from a trend growth perspective,
we saw in the second half of last year, we grew around 4.5% during that period, and we've got guidance in place for the
year of 3% to 6% for the U.S. and we grew at 3% in the first quarter. So it feels to us the guidance is still right and that
we'll see some recovery as we move through the year.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: And just lastly, of the two segments that posted year-over-year earnings declines, Safety and
Consumer, do you think they can return to earnings growth in Q2?
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah, we think that we've got an outlook for both of those businesses to grow again with the
average of the company for the year, in the 3% to 6% range. And we think that their margins will operate around the
company average. So that would imply some improvement in Consumer and probably in the Safety and Graphics, that
if you look seasonally, they run a little bit lower in the first quarter typically anyway.

Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays Bank. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Scott.
<A - David W. Meline>: Morning.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Do you guys, when you think about price, and I think 3M has a history of being pretty good on
price, particularly the last five years or so, but is there a trade-off that you see, a clear trade-off between price and
volume? Do you have a sense that you're giving up volume? Or do you have so much pricing power in most of your
businesses that it's fairly immaterial, that it's more of a mix issue? It's just a better product.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. We don't feel at this point in time that we are giving up volume. You have to think about
it in terms of our position in the market and all the new products that we're introducing as many of them are based on
speccing on platforms, et cetera. So I would not say that we at this point in time are giving up anything that we are
aware of. And as you know, our power in terms of pricing is pretty strong. And it's all based on the value of the
solution that we are providing, so I think that's important. So I don't think that's an issue. If it had been, we'd have not
continued to execute based on our strategy in that area.
I think it's more in terms of, you're talking about growth generally speaking, it's maybe in some part of in the
developing world that we will add different type products and solutions that are meeting I would say the price points

and affordability in that part of the world, but that's a different discussion because that's more around the product
portfolio that we're introducing in developing economies. And I think there, we still have huge opportunities. And as
you heard, I talked about now that we have built out our capabilities with 45 Customer Technical Centers around the
world, that's exactly what we can capitalize on. So for us, it's important to make sure that we develop products that are
adding value but also are affordable for that market, but we still have a very high expectation relative to our margins in
the company and we are not giving up on that. So you should earn your right in order to introduce products with lower
margin. You have to find a different way to produce them and make sure that you get the margins that we expect and
that we can pass back to you as a shareholder.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. That's a good answer. And it seemed in this presentation at least, I'm looking at slide
seven, that there's a new emphasis or not a new, I should say but at least an increased emphasis on acquisitions and you
cite the – there's a line here that says multi-billion dollar deals possible. When I think of 3M and your margin profile
and the technology you have, I mean is there stuff available out there realistically that you could buy without having to
pay enormous multiples? When I think of 3M types of assets, the things have been bid up so highly, 15 to 20 times
EBITDA, it would be difficult to do those types of deals, I would imagine. But is it realistic to assume that you can find
things that are interesting, that have the margin structures and the growth structure that you're looking for?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, again, it's coming. But first of all, you're right when you correct yourself. It's not a new
emphasis. We have done acquisitions, quite a number of acquisitions over the years, right. I think the new and very
good thing for all of us is that based on the portfolio management we have put in place, we get a very good profile of
where we should invest first versus second as we move ahead.
I think our biggest acquisition 3M has done over the years is $1 billion or so and in some cases in order for us to be
more relevant, we maybe need to do slightly bigger than that as we move ahead. As you saw, we didn't execute on
acquisitions last year and the reason for that was we couldn't find any that were added value for all of us. But I can tell
you our pipeline is strong. We're working it for each business and let's see what is happening as we move ahead. But in
order for us to build out relevance, in some cases, we have to look upon interesting spaces for us.
<A - David W. Meline>: I guess I would also add, Scott, that I mean it would be quite unusual as you observed that we
would find companies that have the type of profitability and performance that 3M does, but that's very typical. We'll
look at targets, we'll identify how we can create value by bringing them into the portfolio and leverage either
technologies or brands or our global distribution. And when we do those transactions, the litmus test for us is to become
convinced ourselves that we can take a business and turn it into a 3M-like performing business, which we've done very
successfully over the years in a number of different instances. So that's either the challenge or the opportunity,
certainly.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.

<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Good morning guys.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Shannon.
<A - David W. Meline>: Morning.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Hey, just maybe a little bit more on some of the moving parts on managing currency in
the quarter. I mean, first of all, to get to this neutral position in Venezuela, did you have to take a hit to get your
remaining receivable out of there and then the positive price in Asia Pac, which never happens, is that an FX dynamic?

Page 11 of 17
<A - David W. Meline>: So first on Venezuela; yeah, we actually, as I mentioned in the commentary, we did see a
slowdown in sales and income that we generated on the ground in that the availability of currency on imports has been
pretty non-existent since already the fourth quarter, so that caused a slowdown in the business. What's also true for us is
we've been able to maintain as I mentioned here a net neutral monetary asset position and therefore as it relates to both
the local balance sheet as well as the exposure we've got from offshore, we were able to manage through that. And we
don't see that being a risk as we sit here today. And, of course, things can always change, but we feel much better today
than we did last time we were on the call three months ago. And then in Asia Pacific, could you repeat the question?
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Well, price was positive in Asia Pac which is pretty unusual. I didn't know if that was a
price increase related to offsetting some type of FX, or if that's unrelated?
<A - David W. Meline>: We have had some pricing pressure in some of the countries that have experienced
devaluation over the last year. So that would be a portion. And what's also true right now is in a number of our product
areas, the price value relationship of some of the new products we're launching has been very strong. So we were
encouraged by the performance there this quarter.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Just on kind of your current assessment of the global economy, volumes in every region
except the U.S. improved this quarter. U.S. sounded like it was mainly weather-related. Are you encouraged by that?
Do you feel like there's improving momentum? Or is it more a comp thing? Maybe just a little color about what you're
hearing from the businesses globally and how encouraged you might be or not be.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, I think, first of all, of course, encouraged in the way that the growth is – look like steady
for us now. If you look upon our performance here the last couple of quarters, it has improved for us, right? And as you
said, it's going up and down in some parts of the world. I will say that APAC came back slightly. So APAC is, I would
say, in the same position as we have had before. They had good growth in the quarter for us, slightly better than Q1 and
how they ended the year. West Europe grew 3% which is equal to how they ended 2013. So that's a 3% growth. And it
looked like the combination in Europe, what we have talked before about in North and South, it's now very much
equalized, right? So it look like 3% is steady growth there. Central East Europe and Middle East, I would say Middle
East/Africa had a good growth for us. Central East Europe slightly lower in the quarter where you could see that some
business or countries did well there, like Turkey had a higher growth rate than you saw in Russia and Poland.
The United States, personally, I'm not overly concerned, was 3% growth for the quarter. We started slower and came
back stronger in the quarter. And that's related to that – David talked about relative to traffic and stores and delay in
construction specifically on the road side for us. So I think it looks like we're going sideways, slightly up but not much,
right? So I think we need another one or two quarters here to see if it's moving on a high ramp. But as we said, we are
firming our growth rate for the year so we feel – just there you have the answer, encouraged and I look upon it rather
better than it was.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.

<Q - Ajay Kejriwal>: So on Health Care, you are continuing to see very nice growth here in developing markets and I
know in the past, you have talked about new products and penetration and all that. So maybe just help us with where

double-digit growth rate that you're seeing here?

Current Quarter: 8130.667

Page 12 of 17
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, as you saw, Health Care grew 6%, right. And if you separate out, developed was 5% and
developing 10%. And you think about the mix for us, it's like developed is almost 80% and we are 20% in developing,
so already there you have the answer relative to big opportunity in the developing world as we move ahead. Now we
have very sophisticated solutions in our business in Health Care, which is one of the reasons why we are able to
continue to grow in developed world and to very attractive margins. And the pipeline of new products is very strong for
us in Health Care.
That's in hospital consumables with Fastening Systems related to our Dressing business or if it's in Infection Prevention
where we come in with new measurement tools that will increase the time for measuring what they are doing in the
infection area by 50%, we have a very strong pipeline of product going on there. So I would say that think about it like
developed world, we are able to continue our growth in margins due to very good added-value products which is
needed in an environment where there is pressure on costs, and then in the developing world for us is to start to
implement the penetration plans that we now have been working on for quite some time, and in addition, develop
products that will meet the needs from a price perspective in some of the countries there.
They never have a problem with the quality of products, as you assume. When you look upon our Tegaderm products
or Micropore tapes or Ioban products, the problem is never quality. The problem is affordability. And there's different
ways for us to go around that. So we are very – we see very positive on our healthcare business and as you see again
this quarter a very good result. And it's not by accident. This is a business we have built out for many, many years.
There is a lot to come relative to our future in healthcare.
<A - David W. Meline>: I would just add, Ajay, I think another piece of evidence that supports that is not only the
consistent high level of growth but again, for example, this quarter double-digit growth in a number of different
countries: Brazil, Mexico, if you look in Southeast Asia, if you look in China. So if you saw it in one place
concentrated, you might be less confident but as we see it individually across all of these markets, it's very encouraging
as to the opportunity and sustainability of the growth.
<Q - Ajay Kejriwal>: That's good. Maybe a couple of clarifications, on restructuring, you mentioned $40 million
investment in the quarter. Is that included in the $0.07 growth related investment you mentioned? And then if you can
help us with the full year number, what should we be modeling in for restructuring?
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah, so, the answer first of all is yes. Inside of the $0.07 a share, we have $40 million of – it
was a combination of restructuring primarily in some of our operations in Europe as well as the cost year-over-year
increase of this European supply chain, which as I mentioned, we'll lap that increase now as we get into the second
quarter. So that's piece one. Piece two is if you look at the total of the combination of the longer term investments in
R&D and business transformation plus these items of restructuring and repositioning, we expect that – we had said
$0.10 to $0.20 a share for the year. And as I had mentioned earlier, it looks now like we'll be towards the high end of
that $0.20 range with some front loading in the first quarter. So you can think about it declining somewhat as we move
through the year.

<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Just two quick clean-ups for me. First on electronics, you noted China, Hong Kong was kind of
strong ex-electronics but your electronics performance overall actually looked okay, pretty decent, can you just kind of
reconcile those dynamics and a little more color on what's going on in the Electronics part of the business?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. Look upon Electronics specifically relative to APAC in total. So we had 5% growth
there. And that business is type of moving in between countries from time to time. So for China and Japan, specifically,
it was type of opposite the perspective. They had comps that in one case was easy and the other case was tough, so
easier for Japan, tougher for China. So that's the answer. And then this quarter, specifically, much more business went
into Japan in terms of our sales but later are converting around Asia. So that's the answer to that question. So if you
take China for us, base business there was 8% growth which is slightly better than Q4 for us and slightly better
year-on-year. So China was okay.
When you look upon the total Electronic markets, when we look upon semiconductor, data storage, smartphone,
notebook, tablets, TV, et cetera, the market generally speaking went sideways I think in terms of volume; that you had
of course tablets going up and capitalize on notebooks in terms of the volume generally speaking. So for us, we are in
all those devices with different type of levels of penetration, but that business is improving generally speaking. And I
would say if you take the whole business group of Electronic and Energy, you saw in there they had growth and they
have margin expansion of 200 basis points year-on-year. So it's – we're coming around and addressing a lot of issues in
that business and very – I'm personally very encouraged and I think that management team there is doing a super job
for us addressing some of the issues we have had in the past. So I think it's good, we are addressing it and are taking
care of our own destiny. And I'm very pleased to see that happening.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Right. And just a quick one for David then, also you initially guided your tax rate, assuming
the R&D tax extenders and everything came through, it looks like they won't but you've found a way to maintain the
tax rate guidance. What is going on there? Is it some of the restructure in Europe or maybe just a comfort level there
also on that tax guidance at this point?
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah. So yeah, so if you look at the guidance, we maintain the 28% to 29% for the year and
that does continue to presume that we see a renewal sometime before year end of the R&D Tax Credit which is worth
about 40 basis points to us. So we – so both of those we continue to foresee. And then we saw some – first quarter was
a little bit better than the overall full year which was related to – we completed some prior-year audits and we ended up
releasing some reserves that we'd established. So that's the answer to the question.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: All right. Thank you.

<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yes, good morning. Just again a couple clean-ups I guess; so, David, you mentioned that roughly
half the price increase is a function of the currency weakness, particularly in Latin America. So when I think about the
110 bps benefit from priced raws in your margin build and 50 bps from FX pinch, is it fair to say that the impact of
currency net-net is neutral to margins?
<A - David W. Meline>: No. Actually the – we – if it – and then we tried to call it out there. We had a net impact of,
excuse me, of FX in the quarter of 50 basis points net.

<A - Matthew Ginter>: Yeah, Nigel, if you look on the income statement slide with the margin walk, you'll see it right
on there, half a point.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Right. But then the 110 bps on price is in some ways a function of currency in that you get pricing
power.
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah. But the 110 bps – sorry, Nigel, so the 110 bps is both price and raws, right.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yeah.
<A - David W. Meline>: So raw material costs for us were down around 2% year-over-year, so that contributed to the
110 bps. And then as you correctly pointed out, as I said, the portion of price that remains of that 110 bps, it's more or
less 50/50 this quarter. So there is certainly some offset, to be honest, I don't have at top of mind is it precisely a full
offset, I think it's a little less than that.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: No, that's really helpful. And then second part of my question was you talk about raw materials are
down 2%, you've got to say, you obviously take different mix of raw material inputs than most of the companies we
look at, so could you just maybe talk generally speaking about how that raw material index is tracking, particularly as
we go into 2Q? And are we still on track for the roughly $0.10 of benefits from raw mat this year?
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah. So that's right. So starting out, we had guided $0.05 to $0.15 of raw material cost
benefit for the year versus last year. Certainly in the first quarter, we were encouraged by the performance in that area,
and that's a combination of not only the trends on raw material costs themselves but also to the extent that our efforts to
identify alternative formulations to lower our raw material costs and change the composition to the extent that we have
efforts that would actually lower the amount of raw materials in a product, these types of things are included in that
performance and the good news is our sourcing organization continues to do a really good job in that area. So we feel
good about the guidance on raw materials for the year. If anything, if I were to pick a trend, it appears to be trending
towards the high end of that range for the year.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.

<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Deane.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: I was hoping to get a little bit more color on the look forward into the second quarter, maybe
some commentary on how April has played out so far? And David, are there any dynamics we should know about,
especially following up on Jeff's question on tax, a bit of a benefit this year with those releases? Anything unique about
the tax or corporate expense for the second quarter?
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah. Okay. In terms of – the first one was what, again?
<A - Matthew Ginter>: Inter-quarter trends [indiscernible] (1:04:13).
<A - David W. Meline>: Oh yeah. So in terms of the trends on volume and revenue, if you look at the first quarter first
of all, typically March is our strongest month in that quarter, which turned out to be the case for us again this year, and
maybe a little bit stronger, slightly stronger than a typical intra-quarter pattern. If we look at Q2, we feel good about the
overall view that we'll continue to operate. We said 3% to 6% for the year, which is a midpoint of 4.5%, which is
exactly where we operated. If you look at the second half of last year, we ran at 4.5%. First quarter, we now ran at 4.5%
and we feel good about the second quarter continuing at that rate.

Pluses and minuses, we've kind of inferred that we have some level of optimism about the U.S. There are also areas of
uncertainty in certainly places like Japan, which is a very significant business for 3M. We did see a pull-forward, it was
quite clear, a pull-forward of sales into the first quarter as a result of the tax increase. So I would say pluses and
minuses. April started out fine. So we feel good about a stable performance for the company.
In terms of taxes, we had a little over 27% rate in the first quarter, which was closing out of some prior-year audits and
included in that, there was a particular case that we benefited from where we were able to treat as deductible assets,
some assets that had been previously disallowed. So that was a one-time occurrence for us in the first quarter, which
given that rate in the first quarter solidifies the view that for the year we can operate at 28% to 29%. And I don't see
any unusual patterns that we would foresee quarter-by-quarter through the balance of the year.

Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Joe.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: So two quick questions, first on pricing. The currency fluctuations notwithstanding, it still
seems like you're getting 50 basis points to 60 basis points in price and, David, if I'm correct, with your raw mat
guidance, you're now – you think it's probably going to be trending towards another 50 basis points to 60 basis points
on raw mat benefit for the remainder of the year. So is there any reason to believe that you're not going to get at least a
price/cost benefit of one point for the remaining three quarters?
<A - David W. Meline>: What we expect price/cost for the balance of the year, what we had guided originally was on
pricing that we thought would be very modest for the year. Obviously, with the stronger first quarter performance
significantly supported by the fact that we were having to offset foreign exchange, we expect that pricing performance
to decline through the year but nonetheless be positive. And then on the raw materials side, as I've already indicated,
I'm expecting, if we look at that $0.05 to $0.15 range that we set out for the year, I'm expecting that right now as we see
it, will trend towards the high end of that range. So I think from that you can probably get to the specifics that you were
just asking about.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Okay. And just to follow up on that a little bit, you've got 50 basis points to 60 basis points
potentially ex the currency this quarter. You're continuing to invest at a higher rate on R&D. So is there any reason to
believe that pricing should step down for the rest of the year, is there something I'm not thinking about?
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah, no, it's a good question. Yeah. I mean we have a number of actions that are
calendar-year based. And so what we do expect is that we will see some decline through the year, which is why we'd
originally guided that it would be a modest price impact on the core base.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Okay. And then just one question on the buyback; it looks like the gross buyback this quarter
was around $1.7 billion. I think your guidance for the year is $3 billion to $5 billion, so perhaps, one, if you could just
comment on what the net buyback was for the quarter and then also, what would get you to maybe flex the $3 billion to
$5 billion higher in the coming quarters?
<A - David W. Meline>: Sure. So, first of all the net buyback in the first quarter was $1.4 billion against the $1.7
billion gross. And if you've paid attention to the trends over the last couple of years, what's happened is we've
substantially seen a reduction of the outstanding unexercised options, so that's cut about in half over the last several
years. So, that will cause our net to be much closer to gross than it has been in the past. So that's one of the reasons why
we see it much closer this quarter. Secondly, in terms of the overall gross for the year, basically the way I think about

this is, if we go back to the fact that what we said we would do now is we would move our capital structure to be better
optimized going forward.
And so we're starting to allocate the capital to put that in place and that started last year as we drew down cash. This
year, we've said we would increase our leverage by $2 billion to $4 billion and if you look in the first quarter, with the
actions that we took, our leverage went up by about $1 billion against the $2 billion to $4 billion guidance for the year.
So, it's right in line with what we'd indicated we would be doing, and we also did modify the outlook for the year on
gross buyback to $4 billion to $5 billion from $3 billion to $5 billion based on the fact when we add up all the pluses
and minuses, we concluded that that would be the right level for us here in 2014.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

And our last question comes from the line of John Roberts of UBS. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Good morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, John.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Since you're open to looking at multi-billion dollar acquisitions, I don't think you've ever done
a hostile, but we've had this new development of using activists to facilitate big acquisitions. Is that something that
would be too aggressive for someone like 3M to consider?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, I, first of all, thank you for the question. I don't think that's the way you should move
forward when you look upon those type of things. We would like to do strategically important acquisitions that would
add value for everyone involved, including 3M and our shareholders and the customers that was part of that. So I think
that should be done in a very, very careful way as we move ahead. So...
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah, and if I could add, John, our experience – a couple comments there. One is we did
indicate at year-end that as we looked at our own capital deployment and looked at our capability both in terms of our
performance on businesses we've been acquiring in recent years as well as the integration capability that we put in
place to ensure that we will continue to have good performance going forward and given the size of the company and
how we're deploying capital, our conclusion was it would be appropriate for us to not limit the scope of acquisitions to
say $1 billion or less which has been the history of the company. So, hence, we indicated that we would be open to
doing things larger than a billion dollars, because likewise we don't like to surprise people as we take action. So that's
one piece of our thinking.
In terms of the subject of hostile versus non-hostile, what I would tell you is that one of the advantages we have as a
company is typically when we do approach companies with the possibility of acquiring, the reaction is typically very
good because 3M is known to be the kind of company that invests to build businesses and therefore we've found that
generally speaking the reaction is good. And that's our preference, to take that type of approach, frankly. If you think
about the culture of the company, that makes sense to us. We're about building businesses here and that's what we
continue to plan to do.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Okay. And as I look across the portfolio, it seems to me the Electronics and Energy area
might be the one that could benefit most from a major acquisition. It's – maybe the scale might help with the margin
improvement you're trying to achieve there and valuations I would suspect are more reasonable in that space since a lot
of the other competitors have had struggles in that area over the past couple years as well?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, I think all five business groups can benefit from actions in this area and it's ongoing
portfolio management activities that we're working on. So I will not call out one business group over another one
relative to how we can build strength on strength in those business groups because when you look upon our strength in

each of the five business groups, it is very strong. So I think in each individual business group, that will add value by us
working on the portfolio management as we're doing at the time.
