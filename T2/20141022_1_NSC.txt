Please be advised that during this call we may make certain forward-looking statements. These forward-looking
statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and our actual results may differ materially from those
projected.
Please refer to our annual and quarterly reports filed with the SEC for a full discussion of those risks and uncertainties
we view as most important. Additionally, keep in mind that all references to reported results, excluding certain
adjustments that is, non-GAAP numbers have been reconciled on our website in the Investors section.
Now it is my pleasure to introduce Norfolk Southern's Chairman and CEO, Wick Moorman.
Charles Wick Moorman
Thank you, Katie and good morning, everyone. It is my pleasure to welcome you to our third quarter 2014 earnings
conference call. With me today are several members of our senior team, including our President, Jim Squires; our Chief
Marketing Officer, Don Seale; our Chief Operating Officer, Mark Manion; and our Chief Financial Officer, Marta
Stewart.
I'm pleased to report that Norfolk Southern achieved another very good quarter as third quarter financial results set
records across the board. Earnings for the quarter were $1.79 per share, up 17% compared with the $1.53 we earned
during the third quarter last year. These strong results reflect continued high demand in most of our business groups as
overall volumes increased 8% driven by double-digit increases in merchandise and intermodal, offset by a slight
decline in coal.
For the second consecutive quarter, revenue topped $3 billion, up $199 million or 7% versus last year. And Don will
fill you in on the revenue and volume details in a few minutes.
Similar to our second quarter results, our expenses were up only 3%. And our resulting 67.0% operating ratio set a third
quarter record. Now while our financial results were very strong, much like in the second quarter the railroads velocity
and operating metrics were considerably reduced year-over-year as we continue to be challenged by demand in excess
of our forecast for the year. This was particularly significant in terms of our crew base which was sized for lower
volumes.
As all of you know, it takes from seven months to nine months to hire and qualify new transportation employees. And
we are just now starting to see newly qualified conductors marking up in our critical areas. We continue to actively hire
and have taken steps to accelerate our training cycle.
In addition, we've temporarily transferred over 100 train and engine service personnel to our busy Dearborn division
from other parts of the network. We have other special initiatives in place as well to help increase crew availability and
we have a number of important infrastructure projects and new locomotives coming online in the fourth quarter as well.
Mark will go over our service metrics and our initiatives for improvement in more detail with you.
While we have demonstrated our ability to successfully manage overall expenses, the network slowdown and recovery
efforts have translated to some additional operating costs and Marta will go over all of them as well as the rest of the
financials. In spite of these operating challenges, we are excited about delivering another quarter of record results and
we remain optimistic about our prospects going forward.
And on that note, I'll turn the program over the Don, then Mark, and then finally Marta, and then I'll return with some
closing comments before we take your questions. Don?
Donald W. Seale
Thanks Wick, and good morning, everyone. As Wick stated, we're pleased to report that the third quarter of 2014 was
our second consecutive $3 billion quarter with record revenues in both our merchandise and intermodal sectors, which

were partially offset by a weaker coal market.
Revenue growth of $199 million, up 7% versus third quarter of last year was generated by our merchandise business,
which generated $152 million, up 10%, followed by intermodal which was up $62 million or 10% over last year. In
coal, weak global market conditions in the export sector and milder summer weather, which impacted coal demand,
resulted in a decline of $15 million or 2% compared to third quarter of last year.
Volume increases in intermodal and merchandise accounted for $219 million of revenue variance in the quarter. Also
positive year-over-year fuel surcharge revenue partially offset the negative mix effects associated with higher
intermodal volumes and lower coal shipments. Accordingly, total RPU was down 1% in the quarter as a result of this
negative mix effect between and within our business groups, which I'll discuss in more detail as I review each of the
major business groups.
Now turning to the components of growth, total volume increased 8% due to 10% gains in merchandise and intermodal
shipments, which offset a 2% decline in coal. Across our merchandise business very strong performance was led by
increased chemicals, automotive and metals and constructions volumes. In intermodal, for the first time, shipments
exceeded 1 million units in the quarter. A gain of almost 92,000 units, up 10% compared with third quarter 2013 with
strength in both domestic and international markets. And in coal, volume declined by 2% as export shipments
weakened due to continued global over supply and sluggish demand.
Now moving to our individual market segments starting with coal. Coal revenue was down $15 million or 2%
compared with third last year. Coal revenue per unit was flat in the quarter as declines in higher yielding export traffic
offset the positive effects of increased longer haul traffic to our southern utilities. With respect to utility coal, overall
volumes declined by 3% as a result of milder summer temperatures with July in particular posting the lowest average
temperature since 2009.
Lower natural gas prices also impacted coal burn during the quarter. This factor along with a competitive contract loss
resulted in a 14% decline in shipments to our northern utility plants, while volume to southern plants was up 9%.
In the export market, third quarter volumes were down 16% as excess global supply and lower commodity pricing
continued to impact the seaboard and coal market, causing declines in both metallurgical and thermal coal volumes at
our Lamberts Point Terminal. Within our domestic metallurgical markets, volumes were up 8% led by gains in coke
shipments to the steel industry, which more than offset weaker domestic met coal volumes. And finally, industrial coal
volumes increased by 32% due to new business and organic growth with industrial customers as the economy continues
to improve.
Turning to intermodal; intermodal revenue in the quarter increased by $62 million or 10% to $667 million, which is a
new quarterly record. With respect to revenue per unit, positive pricing activity within the domestic intermodal segment
was offset by higher volumes of lower revenue per unit international freight leading to overall flat yield per shipment.
Domestic intermodal volume was up 8%, driven by targeted highway conversions across all business segments, as well
as organic growth with large key accounts across our domestic book of business. On the international side, strong
volume growth of 15% was generated through organic growth with our existing shipping partners, new contract
business, and from new terminal growth.
Moving to our merchandise markets. These five carload business groups also set a new quarterly record with $1.7
billion in revenue, an increase of $152 million or 10% versus third quarter of 2013. Our merchandise markets also
faced negative mix effects as strong volume growth within our metals, construction, and bi-level automotive segments
offset gains in higher revenue per unit agricultural and chemical commodities. As a result, overall merchandise RPU
declined by $7 and was flat for the quarter.
With respect to volumes, growth was led by strong increases in crude by rail and natural gas liquids, which increased
our chemicals volume by 17%. Automotive volumes were up 12% versus last year propelled by significant increases as
we took advantage of the auto manufacturer summer shutdown period in July to reduce finished vehicle inventory
backlogs that were a result of national railcar supply issues incurred earlier in the year.

And growth in frac sand, aggregates and steel increased our metals and construction carloads by a strong 12% and the
excellent 2013 corn crop continue to provide growth opportunities in our agricultural market helping to generate a
volume gain of 6% in the quarter.
Finally paper and forest products volumes were flat in the quarter with double-digit gains in lumber offsetting declines
in kaolin clay and waste shipments.
Now, I'll conclude with our business outlook. We see continued opportunity ahead to generate solid growth across most
of our business units. The exception is coal. So far this year, our utility coal shipments have been higher than expected
due to elevated natural gas prices and the need to replenish stockpiles. But the impact of milder weather and lower
natural gas prices are now reversing some of that positive trend.
On the plus side, we estimate that stockpiles at our utilities remain 19% below December 2013 levels going into the
winter heating season. So the wildcard is what kind of winter demand lies ahead.
In our met and thermal export markets, we continue to see global oversupply and low commodity pricing. And the
weaker Australian dollar which has declined another 6% since September 1 is making Australian coal even more
competitive in the global marketplace.
Turning to intermodal, tightening capacity and rising cost in the trucking industry will drive continued volume growth
in our domestic markets as we take advantage of opportunities for highway conversion and yield improvement. And we
expect continued growth in our international intermodal business through organic growth and new services.
In our merchandise markets, we anticipate continued opportunities in crude oil and natural gas related products, as well
as drilling material such as frac sand and pipe. We also anticipate higher steel volumes to support the energy and
automotive sectors, while housing expansion will help boost volumes in aggregates, lumber and construction materials.
In the automotive sector, volumes are expected to move higher with increased vehicle production and with new models
coming online at several Norfolk Southern-served assembly plants.
Last, in our agricultural markets, expectations for another record corn and soybean harvest in 2014 will lead to
domestic growth, as well as potential export opportunities in the months ahead.
Now let me summarize, we expect revenue and volume growth in our intermodal and merchandise markets, while we
continue to face challenging and uncertain conditions in the coal sector. As we move forward, we remain keenly
focused on improving service to meet the expectations of our customers and to support our ability to price to market at
levels that equal or exceed rail inflation. In turn, we will continue to invest in equipment, locomotives and our network
to provide better service today and in the future for our customers.
Thanks for your attention, and I'll now turn it over to Mark for our operating reports. Mark.
Mark D. Manion
Thank you, Don. Third quarter operations were heavily impacted by very positive traffic growth. While we continue to
target overall operating efficiency, network velocity and service performance have slipped. Initiatives to balance and
effectively apply resources to those segments to the network that are seeing the most growth are stabilizing the
operation, and customers should start to notice improvements in service and service consistency during the fourth
quarter. More importantly, these efforts will position us for further growth going into 2015.
On slide two, our nine-month injury ratio stands at 1.18, down slightly when compared to last year, but we've been
seeing improving trends continuing into the third quarter, which had an injury ratio of 1.09. Train incidents for the first
nine months are flat compared to the full year in 2013 at 2.4 per million train miles. Crossing accidents increased to 4.0
per million train miles for the first nine months compared to 3.6 per million train miles for the full year of 2013.
As I noted on my opening slide, service levels have been impacted by volume increases and particularly traffic
increases across the corridor from Chicago to Philadelphia. Consequently, as you see on slide three, our composite

service performance dropped to 68.6% in the third quarter, well below customer expectations and the record service
level of 2013.
Moving to slide four, as you would expect, train speed and terminal dwell data showed the same trend as the service
composite, reflecting slower network velocity. Train speed averaged 20.9 miles per hour in the third quarter and
terminal dwell was 24.7 hours. Both were impacted by volume as we've discussed, but there were also a number of
track work and PTC projects across parts of the Northern region. These will be completed ahead of seasonal peaks in
grain and intermodal.
We have and we will continue to take additional steps that will bring measurable improvements to network velocity and
service delivery. Some of these initiatives are outlined on slide five. Aligning and positioning T&E forces with volume
growth is our immediate focus. To address crew availability in the short-term, we've offered various temporary
incentives to our current T&E employees. 114 conductors and engineers agreed to transfer temporarily from various
parts of the network to locations on the Northern region where volume growth has outpaced crew availability. In
addition, over 680 employees participated in a vacation buyback program, and we've also offered incentives to T&E
employees who were eligible to retire, but defer retirement until 2015.
As discussed in my remarks regarding second quarter operating results, we stepped up hiring and training in order to
bring T&E forces in line with expected volumes. Currently we have 1,453 new T&E employees in various stages of the
hiring, training, and qualification process. In the third quarter, 206 new conductors were qualified, and most of those
were placed in the high traffic growth areas along the Chicago to Philadelphia Corridor. In the fourth quarter, we
expect that 596 will be qualified.
At the beginning of this year, we had 11,290 T&E employees in active or training status. By the end of this year that
number is expected to increase to 12,006, which is a net increase of 716 T&E employees this year.
Several new infrastructure projects in the Chicago area and upper Midwest have or shortly will be completed, adding
more capacity and more flexibility in our operations in and around the Chicago area. Perhaps the most important of
these is the expansion of the terminal in Bellevue, Ohio. This project, which nearly doubles the capacity of the
terminal, will wrap up in December. We will then begin a phased-in operating plan with full operations at Bellevue
online during the first quarter of 2015. In addition to more capacity, the Bellevue expansion will give us much more
flexibility in routing of trains to and from Chicago and more bypass options during periods of bad weather.
Now while Bellevue is the largest infrastructure project, other infrastructure projects are certainly worthy of noting.
The Englewood Flyover at Chicago completed just this month separates NS operations from metro trains through
Chicago and has significantly improved fluidity of our operation there. The new 51st Street Connection near our
intermodal facility at Chicago will be completed early next year. When completed, the new connection will improve
train operations and reduce time and handling for trains moving in and out of that facility. Our new connection at
Goshen, Indiana, will also be completed after the 1st of the year. It provides a direct link from our terminal at Elkhart to
the Marion, Ohio, branch for more fluid operations and greater flexibility of operations around one of the largest
terminals.
And six new receiving tracks at our Conway Terminal in Pittsburgh will be in service by the end of the year. This new
capacity will improve service in this rapidly growing corridor that includes new crude by rail volume.
Finally, in terms of locomotives, we'll be taking delivery of 50 new EMDs, SD70ACe units beginning this month. In
addition, we recently reached an agreement to purchase 100 SD90MAC units and started taking delivery of those units
in September. We expect to take delivery of 40 of these units by the end of the year. With these, the number of units
available for service has reached historic highs in line with historically high volumes. Together with aligning our T&E
forces for expected demand, these projects for additional capacity and growth in our locomotive fleet gave us a very
strong position, moving into the fourth quarter in 2015.
Moving to the next slide, with volume increase of 8% in the third quarter, crew starts including re-crews increased by
2%. This margin of difference is due in part to improving operating efficiencies, but also reflects efforts to conserve
available crews through train combinations and train annulments. We would still see very positive margin even with a

more robust crew base.
Our current crew base continues to be stretched, which is reflected in higher overtime hours, up 32% for the third
quarter, compared with the same period last year. With hiring and other steps I've outlined, network velocity is
expected to improve as we move into the fourth quarter, and we expect to see that reflected in further improvements in
operating efficiencies particularly reductions in overtime. That trend should continue into 2015, when we expect that
our crew base will be fully aligned with expected volumes, a 1% improvement in carloads per locomotive reflects our
ability to absorb higher volume with existing train operation. And fuel utilization was also favorable, as gallons per
1,000 gross ton-miles declined by 4% compared to the same period last year.
Thank you. And now, Marta, I'll turn it over to you.
Marta R. Stewart
All right. Thank you, Mark, and good morning, everyone. Let's get started with the summary of our operating results on
slide two. Revenue exceeded $3 billion, up $199 million or 7%, driven as Don mentioned by double-digit volume gains
in intermodal and merchandise. Operating expenses increased only $50 million, or 3%, resulting in a third-quarter
record operating ratio of 67%.
Slide three, shows the major components of the $50 million, net increase in railway operating expenses, which you
know we're almost entirely concentrated in the materials and other category.
Now, let's take a closer look at each expense category beginning with materials and other on slide four. This line item
increased by $45 million or 23% as in the second quarter, the largest reason was significantly higher usage of
locomotive materials, which was up almost $20 million.
As Mark discussed, we have all our surge fleet locomotives deployed and total units and services are near historical
high. Also contributing to the rise in this category were higher casualty claims accruals and higher loss and damage
costs. The relative increase in claims accruals was a result of favorable adjustments last year. The increased lading
damage costs were due to two derailments during this quarter, which damaged finished vehicles and totaled $10
million. For the fourth quarter, we continued to expect a high rate of locomotive material usage and we also faced an
unfavorable comparison in casualty claims accruals relative to last year.
Turning to slide five, purchased services and rents were up $9 million or 2%, largely due to higher volume related
activities particularly in the areas of intermodal ops, equipment rents, and joint facilities. Next, depreciation expense for
the quarter rose by $6 million or 3% reflective of our larger capital base. We expect a similar increase in the fourth
quarter.
As shown on slide seven, fuel expense decreased by net of $3 million or 1%. The 2014 third quarter average diesel fuel
price of $2.96 per gallon was the first sub $3 quarterly average in more than three years. This lower price accounted for
a $21 million reduction, while higher consumption increased fuel expense by $16 million. As Mark noted, this is only a
4% consumption increase on an 8% rise in traffic.
Slide eight details the $7 million or 1% decline in compensation and benefit cost. As discussed in prior quarters,
continued favorability in post-retirement medical and pension accruals coupled with slightly lower health and welfare
costs resulted in a $44 million reduction in expense. Partly offsetting this decline were increased pay rates of $16
million, higher incentive compensation of $12 million and $10 million more in over time. With the exception of
incentive comp, we expect these variances to continue at similar levels in the fourth quarter.
Turning to our non-operating items. Other income net was up $2 million on higher property sale and interest expense
on debt was up $7 million related to last year's debt issuances.
Slide 10 depicts our income tax accruals and the effective rates. Total taxes were $333 million, up $67 million largely
due to higher free tax earnings. The effective tax rate was 37.3% compared to 35.6% last year, which had the benefits
from a state tax decrease and tax credit.

Slide 11 displays our net income and EPS comparisons, which were both third quarter record. Net income of $559
million was up $77 million or 16% and diluted earnings per share was $1.79, up $0.26 or 17%.
Wrapping up our financial overview on slide 12, cash from operations for the first nine months totaled $2.3 billion,
covering capital spending and producing nearly $1 billion in free cash flow. We distributed $511 million in dividends
and $166 million in share repurchases.
Thank you. And I'll now turn the program back to Wick.
Charles Wick Moorman
Thank you, Marta. Well, as you've heard, it was another very good quarter for Norfolk Southern. However, as good as
these results are, it's clear that they could have been even better, if we had been able to achieve the network velocity in
line with our performance for the prior two years. And not only did these operating issues have an impact on our
financial performance, more importantly, they kept us from delivering transportation services to our customers at the
level that they have come to expect from our company. For that reason, we are very focused on getting back at the
service metrics that we posted in the prior two years as quickly as we can, and then improving further from there.
Mark outlined some of the steps that we're taking and while it will take a little time to reach our 2012, 2013 velocities,
we're very confident that we're on the right path, and that the infrastructure and resources that we are adding will set the
stage for us to grow volumes and provide even better service in the future.
We have a great team at Norfolk Southern. And I have every confidence in our ability to continue to provide
outstanding service to our customers and outstanding results for our shareholders.
Thanks for your attention. And I'll turn it back to the operator for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We'll now be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first
question comes from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Yeah. Hi, there. Good morning. Wick or Mark, I wanted to talk a little bit further on the service
issues. Is it just as simple as adding locomotives and employees, is it really a resource constraint? I'm sure you're aware
of the other argument that M&A is a solution there. So, can you sort of talk about what leverage you can pull on? How
you sort of see this?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Yeah. Well, I'm sure Wick will talk about the M&A side of it. In priority order, for us, it's a
crew issue. I mean the reality is you need a sufficient number of crews in order to handle your volume. And our volume
just outpaced the crew. So, as I said, we're ramping those up. And we start to turn those crews on, Bill, in a bigger way
in November and December and that will be very helpful.
But we're already seeing improvements from those temporary folks that I spoke of that went to our northern region.
Now in addition to crews and as far as locomotives go, I mean the reality is we've got enough locomotives right now.
But, when you get into a lower velocity situation that eats up your locomotives, so you get to the point where you can
hardly have enough. So, it will be helpful to have these additional locomotives coming on and they already are coming
on. So, that will be good.
Now, another important factor here is these infrastructure projects. As businesses ramped, these projects, and I won't go
through them again, I mentioned them. They will be no one project by itself fixes it. But you combine those projects
particularly with our Bellevue infrastructure project that at this point gives you more capacity.

Page 8 of 23
And that's the sort of thing that from a standpoint of being sustainable and allowing for more growth going forward,
that's what those infrastructure projects get you. So, we're really looking forward to that. And then the last thing, I
would mention is that we've been doing a lot to find some routes around Chicago. And just one for example is we've
got a line that's immediately south of Chicago, we refer to it as our [ph] Streeder (31:36) line, and we're taking a hard
look at – well we're actually starting to use that, in a greater way, for more interchange of traffic, but we're even
looking at increasing our infrastructure on that route in the short term.
So, those are the kind of things that bulk you up to be able to handle more traffic, and operate more effectively than we
currently are. Wick?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well. I will say too that, the problems that we're experiencing, are not unique to
Norfolk Southern, there are lot of issue across the industry, which are well documented, and everyone is talking frankly
about them. That does have some impact on us, certainly the Chicago Gateway, has been congested and erratic over the
past number of months. But all the carriers are trying to address that and I think that collectively, we are all taking the
right steps to address that.
The simple fact about Chicago is that, there is an enormous amount of rail infrastructure, from both the east and the
west that just points that way. That's where, a lot of railroad capacity meets, and we are always going to do a lot of
business through Chicago and there are lots of different opinions about it. But we are looking, bilaterally, and as Mark
mentioned, with other carriers, in terms of thinking about alternative locations, when that's possible? But it's not always
possible, for a number of reasons, and the other thing I will say, is that, we have seen a very positive impact, over the
past two years, in Chicago from CREATE. It has opened up, a lot of real congestion points for us – form of congestion
point and not just create but projects like the Englewood Flyover, which effectively gave us six hours to eight hours
more access to our mainline every day are really important. So every franchise is different, Bill as you know, but when
we look at the issues that we are facing – have been facing and we do the analysis and we've done a lot of analysis, it
comes right back to what Mark would say.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Let me ask one follow-up to this and if I missed this in your prepared remarks, I apologize, but
have you quantified what the service challenges have cost this year or maybe even include weather. Just so we have a
sense for look there is this much embedded in the cost structure this year that if it goes according to plan, won't be there
next year?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Well, in the third quarter, it is difficult, Bill. This is Marta. It is difficult, Bill to kind of tease
it apart from the volumetric increase, but generally speaking, rough numbers you can assume that most of the increase
in overtime which this quarter was $10 million and last quarter was a similar amount. Most of the increase in overtime
is related to that. And I say that the other biggest item would be the increased locomotive materials, because Mark's
folks have had to fix the heavy, bad, older locomotives. And so I would estimate for this quarter, you to take all of the
overtime at $10 million somewhere between half to three-quarters of the $20 million increase in locomotive materials
and that would be about the impact the service had on our expenses.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you for the time.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Thanks, Bill.

Our next question comes from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So in spite of the service issues in the third
quarter, you guys were able to post pretty strong incremental margins, but looking at and granted it's only three weeks,
but if we look at the recent volume data, it suggests that there's been a pretty material slowdown in growth. Is this sort
of a direct result of not having enough crews, and obviously, the outlook for coal isn't positive, but do you expect a
return to growth in automotive and Ag once you get some of these and qualified employees in the network?

<A - Donald W. Seale>: Good morning, Allison. This is Don. We're not seeing a slowdown in our business. What we
are seeing is the lapping of very strong comps in the fourth quarter from last year. As you'll recall, our merchandise
volumes in 2013 in the fourth quarter were up 8%, and our intermodal volumes were up 6%. So we are beginning to
face tougher comps year-over-year.
The second thing I would add thereto is that we are seeing a deceleration in coal volume on the export side, and we're
seeing weaker utility volumes, as I've pointed out, due to natural gas prices dropping and milder weather. We also saw
our intermodal business peak fairly early toward the end of September. And that is predominantly on the international
side with consumer goods coming in for the holiday season. So I wouldn't read too much into the year-over-year
volumes other than the comp and the fact that coal is decelerating somewhat and that we probably have seen our fall
peak even though it was a small fall peak in intermodal.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Okay. And as a follow-up question, on the post-retirement and pension expense for this
year, could you parse out the difference between the two and I know that you've made some changes to the
post-retirement plan. So how do we think about what will persist in terms of a tailwind for next year and what are your
initial expectation for pension expense in 2015?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Okay. Well, I'll take that in two pieces. First of all, with respect to this quarter in the
post-retirement and pension, the bulk of that is post-retirement $31 million and the pension was $8 million. Both of
those were decreasing compared to last year. So, and we've had similar amounts each quarter this year relative to the
prior year. Going forward into next year, of course that's going to be – we'll be able to give you more visibility into that
in January. That's going to be dependent on the interest rate as of the end of the year and where our pension asset stand.
Thinking about it, if we had to look at those items right now, we would probably have about even 2015 expenses in the
areas compared to 2014. So in other words, we're not going to have the big letdown that we had in 2014, but we think
we're going to stay about even.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Okay. And is that basically because the changes that you made in the retiree medical plan
could potentially offset any increase in pension expense?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Well, the change that we made is going forward. So that's – so with regard to post-retirement
medical, the change that we made is a go-forward change. So that would impact 2014 and 2015 the same way, that's
why that's the same. And then the pension on its own, the asset plan, the assets have done very well and unless less
interest rates changed markedly between now and the end of the year, that should stay flat to same.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Okay, great. Thank you so much for the clarification.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Thank you.

Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen & Co. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Yeah, good morning guys. Staying on the service a little bit, with all these new locomotives
coming on, should we start seeing that locomotives increased expense for materials start abating in 4Q? So should that
be a little bit lower than it was in 3Q?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Jason, I wouldn't want to predict, that it's going to come down much in the fourth
quarter, because they really, – we start to see most of this power in the November, December timeframe. But certainly,
as we bring these new locomotives in, and as velocity improves, as Mark says. We're going to have the ability then to
take, hopefully a good number of these older, higher maintenance, less efficient locomotives out, and put them back
into our search fleet, and also put them back into the queue, where we got a lot of them for our rebuild program.
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: And right now, Mark's folks are estimating. They're going to do whatever it takes to keep
locomotives. But as you know, the locomotive material was up $10 million in the second quarter, $20 million in the
third quarter, and they think, they'll be somewhere between those two for the fourth quarter.

<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Fourth quarter. Okay. Thank you. And as it pertains towards, and all the merger talk we have,
and also all the talk about Chicago. Wick, I think you mentioned that, there is only so much you can do with the rails
working together, but what can the railroads do short of a merger to sort of help improve some of the service levels
through either joint projects or joint ventures?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well. I think, everyone is doing a lot of work on that Jason, in line – along the lines
of what we're doing. We're very, – we work together in Chicago, to try and manage the flows through there. We do that
collectively as you know. Every railroad that I'm aware of is looking at additional infrastructure if it's required on their
routes coming into Chicago, certainly that's true in the west as you know. And I think that as we do that, as we make
sure that we're resourced properly, that we're going to be able to handle business and handle more business through
Chicago successfully in the future.
I think what we – this is my opinion. I think what we have seen this year is something of an anomaly and that we had,
as you know, an extraordinarily tough winter. And then we had a really very unusual kind of volume growth through a
single gateway driven by the energy business. And at some point that returns to more normal growth levels and we can
manage through that. So I'm optimistic that as the great projects continue to come online and as we all work together
that Chicago will always be a very, very busy place to operate. It'll occasionally be a tough place to operate.
Collectively we can make Chicago work in the current industry configuration.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Thanks for the commentary Wick. And thanks for the time guys.

Our next question comes from the line of Tom Wadewitz at UBS. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Yeah. Good morning. Wick, I guess, I apologize for asking about this again. I don't know if
you love talking about it, but just to be completely clear on this and you've probably said this in various ways. Do you
think that it would be – are you essentially – do you have a position on rail combinations in terms of you think it's a bad
idea and you think regulators wouldn't approve it? Or are you open to the idea and you think there are pluses and
minuses. What's your kind of clear position on the idea of rail combinations? I know obviously you've talked around it
a bit today.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, Tom, this is something that I have said in a lot of forums and I'll go ahead and
say it briefly. And I'll preface it by saying that different people in the industry have different opinions about this and I
will go ahead and say I have a very high regard and respect for the head of the CP, but this is just a place where I have
a different opinion. I think that a major railroad merger is not a good idea. It's highly problematic for three reasons. The
first is that our history is that putting these big companies together is very difficult and at least historically has led to
significant service problems for some period of time.
The second reason is that while historically a lot of mergers were justified because of significant synergies. If you put
two big carriers together, there aren't that many overlapping routes, there aren't that many redundant facilities. You can
save some money, yes, but it's not necessarily order of magnitude that it used to be.
And then third and most important. I think it would go into the phase of a regulatory environment, which is not
receptive in any way to major combinations. And there are the new rules out there that it has to be pro-competitive, that
is not defined, and it could be defined in ways that are very onerous, and in which you could give up all of the potential
benefits and more in a transaction.
So, I just think they don't make sense at this time, and as I say reasonable people can differ on that, but that's certainly
my opinion.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Okay. Yeah, that's very helpful, I appreciate you giving a very clear response to that, that's
very helpful. I've got a question for Don. The yields in third quarter were weaker than we would have expected. I know
you gave us a lot of detail on why mix is a headwind in various respects. What is your visibility to pricing and to yields

as we go into 2015? Discussions with customers, contracts you've already signed for 2015. Can you give us some
flavor and a sense of how much confidence you might have in stronger pricing, in stronger yields when you look to
2015?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Good morning, Tom. As you well know, the capacity factor in transportation in North
America has tightened significantly. As we've said many times in the past, we price to the marketplace, and we see
increasing opportunities for price improvement ahead.
We have about 15%, right at 15% of our remaining pricing to do on the book for 2014, and we have about 50%, right at
50% of our book of business to be re-priced in 2015. And we will be taking that tighter transportation capacity into our
strategy and you will see that in the results of our price activity. So, we price to the market. The market is tight for
capacity. That enables us to have a more optimistic outlook on pricing ahead.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Should we expect that yield is going to – mix is going to continue to be a headwind in 2015
or some of the mix pressures you saw in third quarter maybe they eased up a bit, so the pricing flowed through a bit
more to the revenue per unit?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Tom, we have so many moving parts with respect to the different business segments. I even
mentioned this morning that in our automotive sector, which was very strong in the third quarter, up 12%. We had a
much higher percentage growth in bi-level traffic, which is the cars – the railcars that transport SUVs and pickup
trucks. The load factor is not as high for SUVs and pickup trucks on a railcar versus passenger cars.
And there is a differential of about 15% in the revenue per unit – revenue per car for those bi-levels versus tri-levels.
That's just an example of how the mix continues to play out. In coal, when our export market is down, that's our highest
revenue per unit business and when our northern utility business goes up, for example, that's lower. So I don't know
what all the combinations are going to be. In 2015 we will just have to see how it works out. But we will continue to
see negative mix, if nothing else, as we grow intermodal at a much faster pace and coal continues to either be flat or
modestly down, which is the ultimate mix effect.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Right. Okay. Thank you for the time. I appreciate it.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Thanks, Tom.

Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Thanks, good morning. I wanted to talk a little bit about the service metrics and little bit
more about the timing I guess of potential improvements and maybe understanding a little bit better the sequential
deterioration at least in the velocity metrics in the terminal below that we see publicly. It seems like we're sort of
ending the third quarter, beginning the fourth quarter at a low-water mark. Just want to get a rough sense if you think
Mark from your perspective that this is sort of November, December, as you get those new crews onboard, you start to
be able to turn those metrics a little bit more constructively and during the quarter if there was something specifically
other than just a confluence of volumes that was causing that sequential deterioration?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Yeah. I think we've seen the trough on this, and in fact, the public metrics do lag a little bit
and we are seeing improvement that's going on more recently. And something that we track is specifically where our
velocity is at very – in various parts of our system and the reality is our eastern region, our western region, that is
two-thirds of our system has been operating rather well from a velocity standpoint, and the problems have been pretty
localized to that East-West gateway between Chicago and Jersey are really Philly.
So we see much better fluidity in that area at this point, still very heavy. I mean we've still got all the business up there,
because as far as the volumes go, that area has continued to have a lot of traffic, and we see that, I think we see that

sustained. But we will see improvement as we go forward in the quarter. And I think we said that last quarter that we'll
start to see our improvements in the fourth quarter, but as we said before, the people, the resources really come on more
in the November, December timeframe, but we're already starting to see that tick up.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then switching gears, Don, if I could ask you about – a
little bit about the coal side, I just want to understand sort of the yield dynamic, as we think about fourth quarter and
going forward. Obviously you have had some mix issues and export declining a little bit. You had a pop in the second
quarter, which I think was driven by some of the longer haul utility moves, but as you think out to the fourth quarter
with where the seaborne market is, and where the utility demand is coming from. Is this roughly the right way to be
thinking about yield, kind of what we saw in the third quarter? Just want to get a rough sense on the mix potential in the
shorter term, if I could.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Yeah, I think what we saw in the third quarter will be what we are seeing in the fourth quarter
predominantly, sequentially coming from the second to third quarter, you will recall that we had a $43 million increase
in coal overall, which was driven predominantly by a 23% increase into our Southeastern utilities. That tended to
weaken as the summer wore on, and yet we saw milder, milder weather, lower gas prices. So, our Northern utility
business was down, but Southern utility was only up about 9% in the third quarter. That did impact RPU.
As far as export goes, we pretty much see the same type of market condition. Don't see a lot of significant change. It's
weak on thermal and met coal, and we don't expect that to improve in the fourth quarter nor do we see any driver for
improvement in the first quarter for that.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. So this is sort of the run rate in the next couple of quarters, at least on the export
market in your view?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We hope so.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. Thanks very much for the time. I appreciate it.

Our next question comes from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Good morning.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: So, Don, that was helpful in terms of the coal mix and how you think about that going forward.
I want to ask about intermodal mix with the peak you're saying kind of happened already, maybe international growth
going to slow. Does intermodal mix become more positive as domestic starts to grow faster?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We expect that mix to moderate that mix differential between domestic and international.
International has been very strong this year, because of the West Coast ILWU negotiations that shifted business to East
Coast ports. We've also had some organic growth with our international partners and some new businesses through new
terminals and new contract arrangements. We will start to lap those events as we get into 2015, and we will see
domestic growth outpace international growth in my opinion going forward. So we'll see that mix effect start to
moderate.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: It's probably reverse and turn positive, is that fair?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: It will start to turn positive, correct.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay. And then one for Mark. So you gave a lot of numbers around what you're planning with
head count. I'm not sure what it means for net overall head count the way we see it. What kind of head count growth do

you think we should be modeling in fourth quarter and 2015? And given the catch-up in head count, do you think we'll
have head count up more or less than volume growth in 2015?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: I'll take the 2014 question and let Mark address the 2015 question. For 2014, we continue to
think that we're going to end the year about even to where we were last year. So, that would be – last quarter, we talked
about being 900 up from the second quarter. As Mark said, we are up about 400 this quarter, so, think we'd be up
another 500 in the fourth quarter.
<A - Mark D. Manion>: And going into next year, partly in terms of continuing to build our crew base to keep up with
today's business levels, and then partly for more business opportunities that are coming up in 2015, will add another net
500 to 600 people to what we have at the end of the year.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay. So, we should probably think about volume growth still outpacing head count by a good
amount next year?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Oh, yeah. For the first, it's going to take us – well really, we'll be working on it through the
first half. But keeping in mind that once we end the year and turn the corner into 2015, the additional people we have
are going to be very helpful in terms of improving our service product. So, we won't be completely done until we get
into the latter part of the second quarter.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Mark, can I just ask what's the difference between like the 1,900 people you talked about that
you're training versus that 500 number. Is that just attrition, is that the difference?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: I want to make sure I understand the question. I am not sure about the 1,900...
<Q - Scott H. Group>: I thought in your prepared comments, and maybe it's not 1,900 but you gave some...
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Yeah.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: ...a large number of people currently being trained and I know you talked about adding another
500 people, from here. So, is the difference just attrition?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: No. I spoke of – since the beginning of the year, we have started in training or have
produced, a total of 1,700 plus people, and then I further defined, what that – how that looks in the third quarter and
what our net will be by the end of the year?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Yeah. Scott, I think, there are three things that go on there. One is, some of this, we
continue to have attrition in the T&E workforce. So you – that's a number we have to take into account. We have some
very modest attrition even in the training program, not much, but there is some there. And then the other thing is, at any
given time, you're trying to take a snapshot of qualified employees and trainees.
So, when Mark talks about, the total number of people in the pipeline, there are 500 people, who come out, finish their
training in the fourth quarter plus or minus and then there are additional people who are in that bigger number you
mentioned, who are finishing their training later in the first quarter of next year.
So, it's always hard to kind of pin down at any given moment what's going on. But I think the net – the important
message here is that we have a lot of people in the pipeline. We are seeing, starting to see significant increases but
going back to your original question, our T&E staffing, once we get it to the point where we need for it to be, will still
be growing at a rate that's less than our volume growth. We still expect continued efficiencies in terms of train length
and train operations. In the same way that you've seen us produce them over the past couple of years.

<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Yes, good morning, everyone. I know it's been a long call, but I just – Wick, I want
to follow up on that commentary there because it sounds like there's a lot of puts and takes as we look at 2015. So, if
you are adding all these assets and people, you should get better productivity as you just mentioned. Does that suggest
that the sustainability in incremental margins like we've seen this year should extend into 2015?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: I'll let Marta comment on that too. I do think that as we increase – there is no
question, as we increase network velocity even as we add these resources, that it's a more efficient railroad. It's a more
productive railroad and in addition it augments our opportunities for volume growth because of the service component.
So there is a lot of goodness there. In terms of incremental margins, Marta, I think our expectation is they'll remain
very strong. Whether they'll continue quite at the pace that we've seen them this year, we're not sure, but we except to
continue to produce strong incremental margins in the business.
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: I agree to Wick. The only thing I would add to that is just a reminder and you probably
already had this, Brandon, but just a reminder that this year's incremental margin is affected by that postretirement
medical and pension, which Allison asked about. So, if you back that out, we get more closer to a run rate incremental
margin.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Well, completely understood. I think that shines light on a pretty bright outlook
here for the company. And so if I can just ask one follow-up here, I mean you guys have well over $1 billion in cash
right now and I know you have some debt maturities. But it seems like your share repurchase program has really
slowed down, you have a big authorization out there. With that outlook and arguably one of the cheapest valuations
within your sector right now in the marketplace, why not be more aggressive on the share repurchase?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: Well, as you know, Brandon, I mean, we believe in share repurchases, we've been a long
time buyer of our shares, other than the recessionary year 2009, we bought back a significant number of shares since
2006.
But over that time period and continuing into now, we moderate those share repurchases just based on overall market
volatility. And so, all I can say is that we remain share repurchase, we expect to continue to remain that, and we'll just
go into modulate it based on market conditions.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Brandon, let me add to that. As we always discuss, our first priority is capital
expenditures to grow the company. We're in the middle of that process right now. Our second is dividends. We have a
very strong dividend track record, and we will continue to have a strong dividend policy.
And then share repurchases, as Marta said, we stay in the market, but I will also say, it's something that we constantly
reevaluate, and we'll continue to reevaluate it, and certainly the factors that you mentioned are very legitimate factors.
So, going forward, we'll continue to look at that. And if we see a certain point where we think we need to become more
aggressive or change our policy, we're certainly willing to do that, and will.

<Q - Bascome Majors>: Yeah. Thanks for the time. So the fuel surcharge program you introduced in 2008, I believe it
kicks in at $90 WTI and oil has trended below that for most of this month, which would imply that at least fuel prices
could fall further while at least some of your surcharge revenues are staying flat. And I know that's not your only
program in summer based at lower levels but can you give us an update on the fuel surcharge mix and how it trends
among your business groups and how you expect lower fuel prices to impact your revenues on that front going forward

<A - Donald W. Seale>: Good morning. This is Don. As you indicated, we have many different fuel surcharge
formulas that have been negotiated with numerous customers in contracts and other instruments. So we do not have one
fuel surcharge program. Our carload business generally is based off of West Texas Intermediate crude oil while our
intermodal business is based on on-highway diesel fuel. So we don't even have the same standards for all the business
because there are different characteristics of the business itself. So we have a 60-day lag generally on our carload
business, a weekly lag on our intermodal business, that will continue to move up and down with crude oil prices, diesel
prices, crack spreads, all of the things that impact fuel all the time. So, I can't give you a specific outlook for that
because frankly I can't tell you where the forward curve will wind up for West Texas Intermediate crude or on-highway
diesel for next year.
<Q - Bascome Majors>: If oil were to stay in the low $80 range, is there a significant portion in your business where
surcharges would be locked in at or not fall further?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: I just can't give you color on that because we have so many different formulas that have been
negotiated with customers.
<Q - Bascome Majors>: All right. Well thank you for the time.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: You're welcome.

Our next question is from the line of John Larkin with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Thanks gentlemen for taking my questions.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Thank you John.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Just wanted to talk a little bit more about the application of incremental crews and incremental
locomotives to solve the service issues that you've been grappling with here the last couple of quarters. It seems to me
that as things play out here into 2015 that you're going to have enough resources to bring your velocity up, and your
terminal dwell down, which effectively will create more capacity.
Now, you said earlier that the new locomotives will be here and that will give you the opportunity to push to the more
costly, less efficient older units into the reserve fleet. How do you handle the crew situation at that point, if in fact you
do rebound to previous velocity in terminal dwell numbers?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Well that would be a good thing. As far as the crew base goes, we're planning like I said on
that 500 or 600 net add people next year. But, as velocity comes – as velocity goes up, it lessens the need for crews. So,
we can always throttle and add back some if we need too.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Okay. And then Marta, you answered a question earlier regarding the cost of the congestion.
And I was just wondering if there was a revenue component to that also if in fact service had gotten to the point in
some parts of the network where customers have gone a different direction with their transportation needs until you can
get the service back up to where it needs to be.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: This is Don. On the top line side of our business, car utilization and available capacity to
move more volume is probably the larger concern with respect to current velocity. Obviously, we're having some
pressure points with certain customers, we're working through those. But my larger concern is utilization of equipment
and capacity of the fleets in general.
<Q - John G. Larkin>: Is it reasonable to assume that revenue growth might have been a point or two higher if you
would not have those equipment availability problems?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We would have had some higher revenue in the automotive sector. Some areas like that, but
I'd like to, maybe showcase that question and just point out that sequentially from the second quarter to the third

quarter, the second quarter was our all time high top line revenue. We only missed that by $19 million in the third
quarter with coal being the swing of $58 million between the second quarter and the third quarter. We were up $43
million in coal in the second quarter. We were down $15 million in the third quarter. So, sequentially we came close to
meeting an all time record with coal swings of $58 million quarter-to-quarter.

Our next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Justin Long>: Thanks. And I wanted to ask my first question on pricing. As you've have implemented some of
the rate increases in intermodal that you talked about last quarter, have shippers been pretty receptive given the
tightness in capacity or are you getting any pushback on pricing up in this type of service environment?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We're always sensitive to the timing of pricing, but capacity and tight capacity are the two
things that are driving price improvement in today's marketplace. So the price increases that we took in and our
domestic rail controlled containers, in June and September have stock and we continue to assess that market going
forward for additional price opportunity.
<Q - Justin Long>: Okay. Great. And as a follow-up on coal. I wanted to ask about domestic coal into 2015 and I
know it's tough, but let's just assume normal weather patterns and based on the stockpile levels that you referenced in
recent conversations with customers, do you think domestic coal is flat or down again in 2015, or is there a chance you
could see some improvement.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Let's segment the market with respect to export with the Australian currency differential
expanding and the benchmark met coal price of $119 a ton and a thermal index to Europe at about $72 a ton, if those
two indices continue to be that low, U.S. producers will be very pressured to have any growth in export in 2015. The
wildcard, as I mentioned on our utility call, will be what kind of weather we have during the winter. We are 19% below
stockpiles as of December 2013 right now. And if we get anything like last year's winter, we will see some increase in
demand for utility coal during the winter and coming out of the winter, because I suspect natural gas prices will rise as
they did last year, and electricity demand will increase. So those are export, we don't see any significant driver in the
near term. Utility would be the upcoming winter and what kind of weather we get.
<Q - Justin Long>: Okay. Fair enough. I'll leave it at that. Thanks for the time.

Our next question comes from the line of Walter Spracklin with RBC. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Yeah. Thanks very much. Most of my questions have been answered. I'm just going to
follow up on one and that is on your buyback. I know, Wick, you were saying about reevaluating constantly the
buyback and certainly it's trended well below what we thought you would do when you announced your last program.
So, I see $1.5 billion in cash on the balance sheet, but also about $550 million of debt repaid. In that reevaluation
aspect, what has caused you a little bit of concern about buying back your shares at these levels and if you do
reevaluate, do we go to – what is the flex-up that we could see, is it incremental or could you see a significant increase
in your buyback next year?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, I don't know that I'd comment on what we would see in terms of any magnitude
of a change. I'd certainly think though that you know as we went into the year, we were looking at all of the factors

around share price and as they have moved – and as factors have changed, valuations have changed. We'll take a look
and see if our program needs to be evaluated again as I mentioned. I think the important message is that, this is
something obviously that we actively discuss and that we look at where our markets are and we'll come to an opinion
on what we need to go forward in 2015.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay. Just to slip in another one, I guess on the crude by rail, we've heard the other
companies talk about the factors and spreads and drivers in their specific origination markets that might – that the
current volatility and the energy prices would cause. Don, what are you hearing from your customers in terms of their
propensity to relax some of their shipments on crew that you either originate or carry by interchange? What's your
thought going forward on that market?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We're not receiving any input from our customers that the short-term Brent crude spreads that
have come very close or within $3 a barrel, right now are impacting their plans to continue to take Bakken and Western
Canadian crude. We are being told that most of them have arrangements that go beyond short-term fluctuations in the
market, and their expectations are that the breadth in WTI spread will increase over the next several months.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: And barring that increase we might see some action.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We're not getting that indication. At this point, our crude oil for example, in the third quarter
was up over 12,000 cars over the third quarter of 2013. We're now handling 30,000 cars a quarter, which is what the
third quarter represented. So, we're seeing our crude oil business both from Western Canada and from the Bakken, the
Williston Basin, continue to show some robust dynamics.
<Q - Walter Spracklin>: Okay. That's all my questions. Thank you very much.

Your next question is from the line of Rob Salmon of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Hey, good morning. Mark, you did a really good job in terms of laying out the expectations
with regard to overall locomotives and crew that are coming on and how that should play out with regard to service
performance. If I could burrow in a little bit more in terms of your intermodal service performance, it looks like that's
taken a little bit of a harsher leg down in kind of the start of the fourth quarter relative to where we had been in the
third. Could you talk a little bit about the dynamics and how you see that side of the segment kind of improving
throughout the fourth quarter? I realize a lot of this traffic is coming on that Chicago and to kind of the New England
area which is more heavily congested right now?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Yes, I'd be glad to. And that fits right up with the comment I made about the fluidity on that
East-West Corridor opening up so nicely here more recently and along with that while our intermodal terminals still
have a lot of business, they're heavy, they are in a very – what I'll call, a very orderly fashion. So they're able to process
well in the intermodal terminals and our main lines, which as I've said before is our heaviest capacity main lines we've
got on the system. They are open for business. So, I see that moving in a positive direction for our intermodal business
as we go into the rest of the fourth quarter.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Okay. That's helpful, and I guess given the lower kind of overall fuel prices, obviously that
does cage a little bit of the value proposition for the intermodal side of the business, Don. If the intermodal velocity
improvements are constrained, would that cage at all your optimism for the growth outlook for intermodal as you look
out into 2015 at kind of current WTI levels? Or are the trucking capacity constraints such that you think you will be
able to materially outgrow GDP even if the velocity is constrained near-term.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: The latter is the case. Trucking and motor carrier capacity will be tight in 2015. We don't
foresee fuel prices at current levels changing that dynamic or changing the economic model. So we expect our domestic
intermodal business to continue to show significant growth.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Perfect. Thanks so much for the time, guys.

Our next question is from the line of Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Thomas Kim>: Good morning. I just had a couple of questions on the coal side. In prior calls, you talked about
export coal freight rates effectively bottoming out, I was wondering Don, if maybe you could just give us a little bit of
color around the third quarter export coal freight rate versus the second – the prior quarter and then may be
year-on-year.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: No change second to third quarter and we anticipate no change third to fourth quarter, and for
that matter based on what we're seeing, first quarter as well.
<Q - Thomas Kim>: Okay. Thanks, and then just with regard to the utility coal mix. Can you talk a little bit more
about how the sourcing has shifted may be Q-on-Q, like could you give us a breakdown of how much coal is coming
from the App versus Illinois Basin and so on?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Yeah, we're still about 34% of our originating coal coming out of Central App, 28% coming
out of Northern App, 19% from the Illinois Basin, and 16% from the PRB. The largest change as you know
year-over-year that we described in the second quarter is the Illinois Basin, now exceeding the originations that we
handle from PRB.
<Q - Thomas Kim>: Thank you.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Welcome.

Our next question is from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your questions.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Great. Good afternoon, I guess by now. Just wanted to follow up on the efficiencies and I
guess this might sound odd just given your operating ratio being at the 67%. But looking at – you talked about having
more locomotives on the fleet now. If we go back a decade, you still haven't hit peak volume. So kind of surprising,
you've got more locomotives. I just want to understand, over the past years have we lost some of those efficiency gains.
Does it take a whole new operating plan or anything that has to shift in order to get the velocity and everything back up
or is this just little bit by little bit? Just looking at – with some of the other carriers we've seen making major changes to
improve performance. I just want to understand how we – we've gotten to this point of decreasing efficiency yet having
more on the network. Should we take some of that off in terms of locomotives and crew and get that efficiency back
up?
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Well, obviously, a big add on these locomotives these days is working our way out of a
difficult situation with the velocity issue. So, we should see that improve as we go into next year like we've already
talked about.
But in addition to that, we've got to keep in mind that there has been a significant mix change over time, and with the –
with our intermodal business growing the way it has, that adds locomotives to the fleet. And just looking at
productivity in a little broader way, also keep in mind that we are three years in a real concerted way working on
various things from a productivity standpoint that has had the effect of lowering our overall cost structure. And that's
why we see a more modest expense increase with all these other things going on.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: But just to understand that, wouldn't there more, I guess, unit trains if you're running more
intermodal and especially given the Crescent and Heartland Corridor build outs, say you've got kind of more point to
point. I guess I'm just trying to understand have you put too much onto create too much congestion, and that's causing
that velocity given the volumes. I'm just trying to understand versus 10 years ago, where you had more volumes and

now you've got more locomotives and more infrastructure on the network today. I'm just trying to understand is there
something that needs to be overhauled in the operating plan, or is it just continuing to add more assets?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, I think – let me add to what Mark said. If you go back 10 years, the railroad and the
operations look very different than they do today in terms of our mix of business. And we have added substantially
more intermodal business. It's a big – much bigger part of our franchise, and intermodal trains are dispatched with
higher horsepower for trailing ton, and that's had a significant impact on our locomotive requirements.
The second thing that has happened to us is that our unit trains have grown significantly and particularly with the crude
oil, but even before that with real emphasis on unit trains in ag, automotive and grain, and all of that traffic is great
traffic, and it's very profitable and we want it and that's the way the customers want to ship it; but it has in some ways
also impacted our requirements for locomotives.
Unit train movements in and of themselves require more locomotives for volume growth, than just putting volume on
the existing merchandise networks. So we – listen, we tune our operating plan every year. We have a significant
number as Mark mentioned of operating efficiencies and plans for even more, and we'll continue to achieve even more.
But as I think I said earlier, Ken, every franchise – every railroad franchise is different. And we do a lot of analysis on
our franchise to ensure that we don't have too many locomotives, but that we don't have too few.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Great, and Wick, if I can just revisit your answer to Tom's question on the M&A side. You
talked about history of putting them together was difficult and the mergers didn't justify or might not have as many
synergy opportunities, and then the regulatory environment. What was your reaction though, when you heard this news
that you said no way, right away, do you think, hey, we've got to sit down with the board and sit and look at
opportunities because if CSX is taken off the board, do we need to think about how we line up. Because yesterday
obviously on Hunter's [Hunter Harrison, CEO, Canadian Pacific Railway] call, you kind of went over why the
regulatory issue might not be as big, but it's kind of finding a partner and gaining efficiency. So just trying to
understand what was your and perhaps the board's kind of view in terms of, if it does move forward, how do you think
the industry changes or does it not and that's just a one-off?
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: Well, I think without going into specifics, listen we're always thinking and always
have about the industry structure and ways that it might change, and we review that with the board every year. As we
go forward, if there are changes in the structure and as I said earlier, people have different views of what the potential
is, what the likelihood of a transaction being approved is, we will evaluate it with our board and see if there are actions
that we need to take, and that's what we have always done. That's what we will always do. But I will say something I
was – Jim Squires reminded me of, and that is that we may not agree or I may not agree with Hunter on everything, but
there is something that Hunter and I agree on wholeheartedly, as does everyone else in this business, is that we don't
really have to mergers to have a very bright future here at Norfolk Southern and as an industry.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Wonderful. Appreciate the time and insight. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein Investments. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking the question. Don, could you comment a
little bit about how historically you've seen tighter truck capacity or looser truck capacity actually impact rates in the
merchandise segment, obviously, excluding the coal and the intermodal business? Just trying to think what percentage
move in truck rates is turned into what type of base pricing kind of in your experience?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Well, certainly as the trucking market tightens, it has a positive halo effect on intermodal
pricing opportunity, as well as the carload pricing opportunity. In our merchandise business, anything that moves in a
box car from paper products to consumer products, to manufactured components, a lot of that business is directly
competitive or driven by trucking capacity, and that gives us an opportunity.

So – and other components like automotive parts and vehicles, steel traffic, so there is a range of commodities that
tighter truckload capacity and when I say truckload capacity, I'm talking about everything from dry van to flat beds, to
covered bulk trucking, that gives us an opportunity. And I would add not just trucking, when we look at the barge
industry right now, it is essentially sold out. And agricultural commodities and with the crop being as large as it is, we
expect barge to continue to face that type of capacity constraints. All of those are pointing to a market that's more
favorable for improving yields in our book of business.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: But I guess as you think about how to dimension that, and how you've seen it kind of
play out in the past, is there anything you can share as far as orders of magnitude in terms of how impactful the changes
in the trucking market are?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: I can't really put a number behind it or a past trend. I'll just say that we see it as a positive
opportunity in the marketplace.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Okay. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up. You mentioned that the export rates
had held in flat sort of sequentially. But it does look like the rate per ton is still down a little bit sequentially. Is that just
then mix in the underlying domestic because the overall length of haul doesn't look like it's changing all that much. So,
I'm just wondering is there any pressure on you guys to start thinking about pricing in that domestic market given the
challenges and competition with lower price gas?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: No, there are no pressure points that change from the second quarter to the third quarter. It's
all relative to mix. We saw our Southern utility's long haul traffic start to moderate in terms of its year-over-year
increase because of milder summer weather and lower natural gas prices. And also within the export market, we saw a
relative larger decline in tonnage over our Lamberts Point peer versus our Baltimore tonnage which is shorter haul.

Our next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Thank you very much and good evening, everyone. Thank you for taking my question. Well,
first of all, congratulations on a challenging quarter. I'd like to ask about two items which I think are more temporary in
terms of weighing on earnings. Marta, you hit the first regarding the cost of congestion. You talked about the $10
million and overtime, you talked about the effect of locomotive maintenance. What you didn't discuss is maybe what
the effect of this congestion slower train speed might be having on insurance and claims. I know you did note the $15
million increase in personal injury reserve. What do you believe, Wick or Don, the impact of this congestion is having
on your claims expense, and do you believe this is more of a transitory thing and when fluidity gets better, we
hopefully see that begin to come down? And how would you ballpark the impact of that financially?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: We don't believe that the service is having any impact on our claims expense. I think what I
was talking about there was the year-over-year, last year in the third and fourth quarters we had favorable claims
experience, and so the comp this year. So we have a comparative increase, but the cost themselves have not increased
because of the service.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: But your personal injury rates up above the last couple of years' level and it's up above the
nine month level. What would you tribute that to?
<A - Marta R. Stewart>: That is in the serious injury area that would be impacting expenses in any significant way,
but I'll have Mark elaborate.

<A - Mark D. Manion>: Yeah. As far as our – the injury rates this year, we had some higher injuries, actually January,
February, second quarter was improved and now third quarter is improved as well, and we've got a strong start on
fourth quarter. So, that's actually going in the right direction.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: All right. And then let me switch to Don. Don, it seems like a lot of shorter term items are
depressing the yield. I know you mentioned coal may stick around for a while, but others are more mix related. But
your revenue per car was up almost 1% last quarter, is down almost 1% this quarter. What do you think the underlying
rate of core price increases are relative to kind of what the reported rev per car we are seeing is? And when do you
think we start to see a number that's a little closer to what your core pricing is actually doing?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: We see our core pricing continuing to exceed rail inflation right now. We think it will
continue to get better. The all-inclusive less fuel index which is in a lot of our contracts in the third quarter only
generated about 0.8% in terms of year-over-year increase. That is slated to increase in the fourth quarter up to about
1.8% and for 2015 is projected to be running about 2.5%, 2.6%. So we'll see the escalators in our base contracts and our
re-pricing activity which I've discussed relative to a much tighter transportation capacity market. Those two in
combination you will continue to see improvement in our overall revenue per unit and also our core price.

Our next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Yeah. Thanks. [indiscernible] (93:34) the operating ratio, [indiscernible] (93:37) their
strategic paths that would enable handling demand surges while maintaining high service or is this just inevitable
nature of dealing with high demand. For example, changes to work rules or single man crews that might enable
handling a little more adeptly.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: I think that's a great question. One of the things that we certainly are doing right now
as going back and looking through a lot of our processes and a lot of our practices to see – to take the lessons learned.
And clearly one thing that we're very – I think very thoughtful about is adding some more what I would describe as
resiliency to our network. And that can come in the way – shape of a slightly different not radically different way in
terms of how we think about our crew base particularly in critical areas. It can come in the form of making – having a
somewhat bigger search fleet of locomotives and it certainly comes in the form of doing something, which as many of
you know, we've systematically done. We just think about continuing to look at pinch points on the network.
So, I think that we'll take these learnings, and we'll make some changes that will give us that additional resiliency.
Certainly, work rules are something we're always focused on. There's another round of labor negotiations that kicks off
here soon. And we'll see if there are things that can be done there as well. But I think that we can do a lot in the shorter
term to give ourselves the ability to handle situations a little better. But I'll go back to what I said. I think we had a
somewhat extraordinary set of circumstances this year with the very unusual weather followed immediately by
significant surge in traffic beyond what we expected. But we'll learn from that.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Great. Thanks. Just as a quick follow up on service issues. Do you believe that highway
conversions was constrained or slowed due to the service issues or just trucking capacity offset most of these decisions?
<A - Donald W. Seale>: I think the overall intermodal network, we saw growth that we would have seen. I think,
equipment availability would have been a little higher in the third quarter, which could have generated on the margin
higher volumes and higher revenue in intermodal and automotive. I will add automotive to that. I don't think it was
material. Going forward, we don't see in the fourth quarter and on into 2015, we do not see a lot of excess trucking
capacity that can take any diverted traffic from rail, not that we expect that. So as our service continues to improve, that
really shouldn't be a major concern going forward.

<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Good. Thank you. High quality problem to have.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: Yes. Thanks.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Cleo Zagrean with Macquarie. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: Good morning and thank you. Could you please comment a little more on same store pricing
trends in the quarter, perhaps with some detail into re-pricing for new business and how you see the balance of price
and volume begin to shape for 2015? Thank you.
<A - Donald W. Seale>: As we've indicated, we are seeing our core pricing coming in excess of rail inflation. We
expect that to pick up as we continue to re-price into 2015. As I mentioned, we still have about 15% of our 2014 book
to re-price and about 50% of our business next year in 2015 to re-price and our prices will reflect the tighter capacity in
the transportation market as we complete that.
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: Thank you. And as my follow-up, we heard yesterday on the Canadian Pacific merger
conference call, their view that the national network is about to hit some limits to capacity and efficiency, absent
merger which they see as the main solution. Would you agree that absent mergers, the national network is coming up
with some significant challenges? And maybe as part of your response if you could help us with some quantification of
impact of your infrastructure projects into next year's results and into the longer term as much as you like to comment.
Thank you.
<A - Mark D. Manion>: Well, I'm not really of the opinion that we're in any imminent danger of hitting significant
capacity problems across the industry that will impact our ability to grow for the longer term. I think if you just look at
Norfolk Southern and the things that we're doing in terms of everything that Mark mentioned, the Bellevue expansion.
A lot of work in our Chicago-Philadelphia Corridor and a lot of work in other places to streamline the network, to add
capacity in critical areas.
I think that we have a very solid program as we have had for years and we'll continue to have to strategically augment
our capacity as we see volume growth. When we get into a period as I've said several times of unusual volume growth
that was difficult for us to predict, we may get a little bit behind the curve as we have, but we are responding to that.
We have a lot of work underway and once that work is in place, we expect our velocities to go right back up as we've
said. So, I think that – and I think every rail carrier looks at it that way. So, I think we have the ability to continue to
invest, continue to add infrastructure and continue to grow the business without the need for our merger.
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: Thank you. So to clarify you do not see any structural thresholds or limits to growth for the
industry given the current makeup of the players.
<A - Charles Wick Moorman>: No, I don't. I think that we can all respond as individual carriers and working together
to handle what we think is, as I said before, a very bright future in terms of increased volume on the railroads.
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. At this time, I will turn the floor back to management for closing comments.
Charles Wick Moorman
Well, thank you very much everyone for your patience and for the very good questions. We appreciate them and we
look forward to talking to you again at the end of the next quarter.
