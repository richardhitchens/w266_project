MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, and welcome to today's Colgate-Palmolive Company First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. Today's
call is being recorded and is being simulcast live at www.colgate.com. Just a reminder, there may be a slight delay
before the question-and-answer session begins due to the web simulcast.
At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Senior Vice President of Investor
Relations, Ms. Bina Thompson. Please go ahead.
Bina H. Thompson
Thank you, Melissa. Good morning, everybody, and welcome to our First Quarter 2013 Earnings Release Conference
Call. With me this morning are Ian Cook, Chairman, President and CEO; Dennis Hickey, CFO; Victoria Dolan,
Corporate Controller; and Elaine Paik, Treasurer.

This conference call will include forward-looking statements, and these statements are made on the basis of our views
and assumptions as of this time and are not guarantees of future performance. Actual events or results may differ
materially from these statements. So for information about certain factors that could cause such differences, investors
should consult our most recent annual report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and
available on our website, including the information set forth under the captions Risk Factors and Cautionary Statement
on Forward-Looking Statements.
This conference call will also include a discussion of non-GAAP financial measures, which differ from our results
prepared in accordance with GAAP. We will discuss organic sales growth, excluding foreign exchange, acquisitions
and divestitures. We will also discuss gross profit, gross profit margin, SG&A, operating profit, net income and
earnings per share, excluding the impact of certain items described in the press release. And a full reconciliation with
the corresponding GAAP measures is included in the press release and is posted in the For Investors section of our
website at www.colgatepalmolive.com.
We're very pleased with the way the year has started out, continuing the momentum with which we finished 2012. Our
organic sales growth was robust, up 6%, and even more satisfying considering the strong organic sales growth of 6.5%
in the year-ago quarter. Our worldwide market shares are up across all oral care categories. An improvement in gross
margin has allowed us to support new and existing products with increased advertising while still delivering a healthy
bottom line.
Macroeconomic challenges continue to present themselves, particularly in the more developed parts of the world, and
of course, more recently, in Venezuela. But despite that, our business is strong both from a P&L and a balance sheet
standpoint, with excellent cash generation.
Our global growth and efficiency program is on track. Just this quarter, we announced several initiatives. First, in
Europe, we are creating an oral care center of excellence by moving our Consumer Innovation Center, our Category
Management group, and our Consumer Insights group all to Basel, Switzerland, where they will be combined with our
Professional Affairs and Technology group already based there. As you know, Basel has been the headquarters for our
GABA business, so this newly formed organization will be able to benefit from GABA's long-standing expertise in the
areas of professional affairs and technology.
Also announced this quarter is further progress in the area of Colgate's business services. Applying our learnings from
our existing center in Warsaw, we will be establishing a global center in Mumbai and a regional center in Mexico City.
And we will be migrating additional financial functions to all three locations.
As you know, another element of our global growth and efficiency program is to expand our commercial hubs. Just this
quarter, we announced our intention to hub Romania with Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and the Baltic
countries to create the Central Europe East hub. The hub's center will remain in Warsaw, Poland. And this hubbing will
allow us to be more efficient, drive smarter and faster decision making, directing capabilities on the ground while
improving our cost structure. And of course, as we generate savings from these projects, we can provide funds for
reinvestment to sustain our growth opportunities around the world and especially in the fast growth emerging markets.
So let's turn to North America. We're very pleased with the strong results in North America. The strong organic sales
growth of 5.5% was a good balance of 3.5% volume growth and 2% pricing, because as you know, pricing excellence
is a key focus for us around the world. We told you about a number of new product launches last quarter which have
contributed to the strong results and which helps drive our oral care shares referenced in the press release.
Our shares are also up in body wash and in fabric conditioners. And as you know, in the U.S., we only sell fabric
conditioner in Hispanic markets, but it has now reached a national share of 16.3% on a year-to-date basis, up almost 1.5
points from the year-ago period. We're very excited about a significant launch in this quarter of Colgate Total
mouthwash, our second entry in the U.S. in the mouthwash category after Colgate Optic White mouthwash. This is a
very exciting opportunity to offer a complete regimen solution under the Colgate Total brand.
The new mouthwash offers a number of benefits: 12-hour protection even after eating and drinking; kills 99% of
germs; fights formation of plaque and gingivitis; and has no burn of alcohol. Trade reception has been very

encouraging, and the products will be supported by a very robust integrated marketing campaign with both in- and
out-of-store activities.
Our off-shelf displays are at record levels. And along with Colgate Total toothpaste and toothbrushes, the complete
regimen is being backed by a compelling new claim – improve your mouth health in just two weeks. You may already
be aware that we've engaged Kelly Ripa to be our new spokesperson for the Colgate Total brand. Kelly has extremely
high appeal among consumers, and our ad with Kelly as the face of Colgate, which aired in February, tested extremely
well. She will be an integral part of our launch plan for Colgate Total mouthwash as well.
In other categories, we will be launching spring and summer seasonal hand soaps under the Softsoap brand in both
foam and liquid. Consumers enjoy decorating their homes with these fun designs, which provide everyday specialness
and variety. New product activity will, of course, continue as we go through the year.
Turning then to Europe and South Pacific, we're also pleased with the modest growth in this region, given the
extremely challenging macroeconomic conditions across Europe. Countries such as Greece, Spain and Portugal are
experiencing negative GDP growth and high unemployment, but we do see a few bright spots, Germany and the U.K.,
for example, where GDP is growing. Given this environment, it is critical that we provide the consumer with
value-added products that meet their needs, and this has indeed been happening.
A number of new products were referenced in the press release across categories which contributed to our good results
in the first quarter. Our regional market shares are solid. Our leading toothpaste share of over 33% and manual
toothbrush share of over 22%, both on a year-to-date basis, are even with the year-ago period. Market shares in battery
toothbrushes and mouthwash are up year-over-year. Market shares are also up in underarm protection and in fabric
softener, where we reached a record 26.4% on a year-to-date basis.
More new products will be launched in the second quarter. In toothpaste, we will be launching a number of new
products across sub brands. In the whitening category, we are launching Colgate Max White One Luminous, a
toothpaste with smart foam, which whitens teeth all around. Under the Max Fresh brand, we are launching Colgate
Max Fresh ACTICLEAN, which penetrates between teeth for an intense brush of clean.
We told you in the fourth quarter about our first-ever launch in the rechargeable electric toothbrush market. Colgate Pro
Clinical was introduced in the UK in September of last year. This quarter, we've launched in the Nordic countries and
in Germany under the Elmex brand, and we're quite encouraged by our results so far, with good support in both the
trade and the professionals.
GABA continues to perform well, especially in Italy, where sales of GABA products are up double digit
year-over-year. To help continue our strong results, we're launching two new products under the Elmex brand, Elmex
Sensitive Professional mouth rinse with effective and lasting relief for tooth sensitivity, and Elmex Erosion toothbrush,
which provides superior clean while still being gentle on tooth enamel.
In personal care, we are launching new body wash products under both the Palmolive and the Sanex brands –
Palmolive Mediterranean Moments, which nourishes your skin and delights your senses; and Sanex [indiscernible]
(09:28) that helps restore the skin's natural moisturizing level. As you know, Home Care is an important business for us
in Europe, and we will introduce new products in this category as well. One interesting one leverages the consumer
preference for natural and traditional ingredients – Ajax authentic cleaners with freshness of Aleppo soap and sweet
almond oil. So a lot of activity to support this [indiscernible] (09:53).
Now let's turn to Latin America. We're particularly pleased with the strong organic sales growth in Latin America,
given the challenges we have been facing in Venezuela. Market shares are strong across the region. In addition to
increases in manual toothbrushes and mouthwash, our shares are up year-over-year in both underarm protection and bar
soaps. In bar soaps, we are at a record year-to-date share of over 32%, up almost 1.5 points year-over-year, and we are
now the market leader in nine countries in the region. Both our Palmolive and Protex brands have contributed to this
strong result.

In the first quarter, we did a re-launch of Colgate Total in Brazil and Mexico, and we'll roll this out to other countries in
the region in the balance of the year. Part of this includes a compelling new marketing campaign based on the fact that
Colgate Total 12 continuously protects you from bacteria for up to 12 hours. And we'll have more innovation in oral
care in the third quarter.
In the second quarter, we have some exciting activity across Personal and Home Care. In Mexico, we just introduced
two new underarm bundles. The first is for men – Mennen Speed Stick Neutro Power, which provides protection that
doesn't interfere with a man's fragrance. And for women, we've launched Lady Speed Stick Pro Five in One, which
offers five benefits for complete protection – dry, fresh, soft, no irritation, and no white residue. Our share of the
Mexican underarm market is approaching 20% and increased 120 basis points on a year-to-date basis.
In Brazil, we are launching Palmolive Naturals Body Cleansing Luminous Sensation soap, with hydrating Argan oil
and oil complex to help soften skin. Our bar soap share in Brazil increased 110 basis points on a year-to-date basis,
which put us behind the market leader by less than a point. This new product should help further boost our market
share. Also, in Mexico, we launched Axion Oats and Vitamin E dishwashing liquid, which combines the proven
performance of Axion with the natural ingredients of oats and vitamin E. Our market-leading shares in dish category is
almost 50%, up 490 basis points year-to-date.
Turning then to Greater Asia, Africa. This part of the world continues to exhibit strong top-line momentum with
organic sales growth of 10%, the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit organic sales growth. Macroeconomic
environment across the region is for the most part quite buoyant, and our categories are growing mid to high single
digits. Market shares are strong around the region.
In addition to the countries referenced in the press release, our toothpaste shares are up in Russia, South Africa and
Turkey. In fact, in Turkey, with a year-to-date share of over 30%, we have now taken market leadership for the first
time. Shares are strong on toothbrushes as well. In India our market shares, almost 41% is up 320 basis points
year-over-year, further widening our gap with the nearest competitor. In Russia our year-to-date toothbrush share is
now over 50%, up 160 basis points as a result of successful new product launches. And in Turkey our year-to-date
toothbrush share is up 130 basis points, 29.3%.
Our mouthwash business continues to grow nicely as well. In Russia our market share is up strongly to almost 26%,
driven by the launch of both Colgate [ph] Plax Tea (13:32) and Colgate Optic White. In China, our mouthwash share is
over 33%, up 250 basis points year-over-year, again driven by successful new product activity. And we'll continue our
new product activity in the second quarter. Colgate Total Pro Gum Health toothpaste, introduced into the Indian market
in the first quarter, where our market share is up 110 basis points over 53%, will be launched in China. While the Optic
White toothpaste, which has drive share in Thailand, is now being launched in India and Vietnam.
And in the toothbrush category, we will continue the rollout of Colgate SlimSoft charcoal toothbrush across Asia. The
tapered toothbrush segment is the fasted growing segment in that category. Charcoal resonates very well with the Asian
consumer and is widely used in consumer goods throughout the region for its renowned antibacterial properties.
So turning to Hill's. As expected, Hill's organic sales growth in the quarter was very modest. And as we told you on our
last conference call, our expectation is that this business should return to volume growth in the second half of the year.
Our confidence is buoyed by the excellent early performance of three initiatives here in the U.S.; a complete relaunch
of our Science Diet line, the launch of our Naturals product, and the introduction of Hill's Prescription Diet metabolic.
Sales of our new Science Diet are tracking well and acceptance and shelving by the two largest U.S. pet retailers are
excellent.
We supported this relaunch with media starting at the end of February on national TV, and that media support is
continuing in the second quarter supplemented with digital media. In addition, we will be implementing a sampling
program along with a Vets Know Best tour capitalizing on our strong veterinary endorsement. And as a result, we have
seen an increase in consumption at both PetSmart and Petco in recent weeks versus year ago. The new Ideal Balance is
performance well and we've achieved 100% distribution of all items in the superstores. The transition to the natural
shelf is taking place and should be completed by the end of this quarter. As you would expect, this also is being

supported by a fully integrated marketing campaign with TV, digital media, and high-impact displays in-store.
Hill's Prescription Diet Metabolic is meeting with success as well, both here in the U.S. and in Canada. And in addition,
we launched it as Metabolics in Japan where it exceeded budget [indiscernible] (16:09). This complete line of great
tasting dry food, wet food, and treats ensures safe, easy and healthy weight loss without making the pet parent feel like
they are depriving their pet. Weight problems in dogs and cats are common here and overseas. Social media has been
playing a clear role in driving awareness of the product as well as brand recommendations. Many veterinary clinics
have been advertising it on their websites and Facebook pages with photographs of before and after examples. So these
launches do bode well for continued strength in the business, particularly as they roll out in other markets.
So in summary, we are pleased with how we have started off the year. Our organic sales continue to be strong, and our
market shares are healthy around the world. Our clearly enunciated strategies are being well executed by Colgate
people around the world. But in addition, our global growth and efficiency program is on track. So while we are
mindful of the difficult economies in some countries, we think we have the right plans in place coupled with the strict
financial discipline to continue to deliver solid results as we go through the year.
So Melissa, that's the end of my prepared remarks. And I'd like to open it up now for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Alice Longley from Buckingham Research.
<Q - Alice Beebe Longley>: Hi, good morning. My question is about the impact of the devaluation of the bolivar on
Latin American margins, and then overall on your bottom line. So if you could just tell us how many cents you took off
the bottom line aside from the onetime charges? We know what those are. But the effect on the bottom line, aside from
that in terms cents, and then also margins in Latin America. Thank you.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Well, thanks for the question, Alice. I think we framed early on the impact of the devaluation, as
you say. There is the onetime charge from the re-measurement of the balance sheet, and then we have said that the
ongoing quarterly impact of the devaluation on the impact on EPS would be between $0.05 and $0.07 a quarter, and
that has been the impact in the first quarter. Now, when we focus on gross margin, why don't I perhaps take this
opportunity to run through our gross profit reconciliation and put it in the context of the full year?
So for the first quarter, prior year gross profit of 58.2%, and we benefited this year from 60 basis points of pricing. No
benefit from restructuring thus far. You will remember we expect the restructuring benefits this year to come in the
second half. Funding the growth continued to be very, very strong, 140 basis points of benefit, the beginning of exactly
the same curve that we enjoyed last year in 2012, a material price negative of 180 basis points.
Now if you break down that material price negative, within that, there is 120 basis points of negative that has to do with
the impact of the devaluation in Venezuela. You pick up 20 basis points essentially of mix, and we end up with the
58.6% margin, gross margin that we have this quarter, up 40 basis points. And to put that in a year context, we came in
the year saying that we thought our gross margin might expand between 50 and 100 basis points, but we said very
clearly in CAGNY after the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency that we now expected in 2013 our gross margin to
expand between 30 basis points and 70 basis points. And so that 40 basis point gain benefit in the first quarter is exactly
within that range.

<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: In your emerging markets, business has held up well despite comments from a number of
companies that emerging markets are slowing, not just in household products, but across CPG in general. Are you
seeing any consumer spending pressure in emerging markets? And particularly in Latin America, given concerns seem
to be cropping up there over a Brazil slowdown and issues spreading potentially out of Venezuela and Argentina. Can
you talk about Latin America specifically? And then why do you think your business has held up better than peers in
emerging markets so far?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah, Dara, well, we continue to be quite pleased and bullish on the emerging markets, and in our
categories, the data we have seen in the first quarter would support that. If one focuses on Latin America, category
growth rates continue to be in the high single digits. And if you talk about Brazil, our business in Brazil was up 17% on
an organic sales basis. If you go around the other emerging markets, the category growth rates are increasing very, very
nicely, and we see in the greater China region our organic sales up just under 10%. In Russia, you see us low double
digits in terms of growth. The Latin American number you have already seen, and I have mentioned Brazil, and even
South Africa was up double digits on an organic basis.
For sentiment, I'm just back from Southeast Asia, and when you look at the data and you talk to consumers, one gets
the same optimism and confidence in the future that I got the last time I was in that part of the world. Our market
shares, likewise, in these emerging markets continue to be quite strong. Brazil, our toothpaste share now up just under
72%, our market share in Russia approaching 33%; the nearest competitor is flat at 15%. That 33% is up to point.
China, we're at about 35% market share, and our nearest competitor is down under 18%. We're up a point, they're down
2.5 points. So I think both in terms of the consumer, their consumption, and our ability to grow and then on top of that
our continued share progress, we feel good about those emerging markets.
Operator
We'll now take a question from John Faucher from JPMorgan.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Thanks. In terms of looking at the pricing results, a little bit of a dichotomy here. But I really
wanted to take a look at the North American results where the pricing came in better despite the fact that volume really
sort of accelerated against the difficult comps. So I'm wondering, a lot of companies – it seems like we're seeing no
elasticity as pricing growth decelerates a little bit. You're not getting the volume pickup. Can you talk about changes in
pricing and where you're seeing elasticity net out in your different categories and regions? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Well, John, I thought you had changed companies. Good to hear you haven't. The – to your
pricing question, I think as Bina said, we have and we continue on a journey to make pricing a core competency of our
company so that we can best understand the sensitivities, the elasticities and how we manage pricing in the mix of all
the marketing variables that we are managing around the world. And we put a lot of pricing model attention to where
we take pricing, what specific variants, what SKUs in those variants, how we take that pricing to try and minimize the
impact on volume. And I think we're very, very pleased with what we have been able to accomplish, particularly, as
you say, in North America, where we have managed to take price without prejudicing the volume growth at the top
line. And clearly, that is both an objective and hopefully a capability that we can continue to build in the out years.
Operator
Our next question will come from Javier Escalante from Consumer Edge Research.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: Hi, good morning, everyone. I wanted to touch upon sales. I would have expected volumes to
pick up a little bit more given that you are launching three new lines. Basically, is it an issue that is because this volume
mix that the price points are lower and that's why we're seeing the declining volumes? And what gives you the
confidence that they are going – that volumes are going to accelerate, given that you have very strong competition in
the natural segment? Thank you.

<A - Ian M. Cook>: Thanks, Javier, for the question. I think the answer, and we appreciate everybody's exuberance
and enthusiasm that the volume pick up would come sooner. But the answer, I think, is the same as the answer that
certainly I gave most recently at CAGNY, but I think many of us have been giving over the last several months. The
two big initiatives that we have are the relaunch of Science Diet with the more natural profile. As Bina said in her
prepared remarks, that product is now fully in distribution. Media started at the very, very end of February, so
essentially, March. And the sampling and trial program for that business is really commencing now.
To the heart of your question, is our response directly to and within the natural segment. And that is captured by the
Hill's Ideal Balance line. Again, as Bina said, we have completed distribution and the two major retailers – remember,
we have a limited distribution profile for this business, are PetSmart and Petco. And their shelf set adjustments are
basically going in place right now, and the media on the Ideal Balance line basically started right now, as is the
sampling program and the consultants in-store behind the product.
As we said at CAGNY, A, our consumer testing, both the pet parents and the pets love the product. We know the
packaging and advertising engages and communicates and the support we are getting from the retailers, the pet stores
and the vets behind these two significant initiatives is very strong. That's what gives us the confidence. And to repeat
what Bina said, we remain convinced that this business will return to volume growth in the second half of this year.
Operator
And now we'll go to Chris Ferrara with Bank of America for the next question.
<Q - Christopher Ferrara>: Hey, thanks. Guys, can we talk about that 17% number you just threw out there on
Brazil? That was pretty big, I guess. Ian, could you maybe break out what the drivers of that were, especially as you
lapped the full first quarter of Luminous in Brazil and Mexico? And then as sort of a follow-on, can you just talk about
the pricing environment in Brazil? Because we've been hearing some stuff. Obviously, there's a change in tax structure.
The government's been increasingly concerned about inflation. So just any color on that would be great as well. Thank
you.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah. Again, and I think we have articulated this many, many times on these calls, our focus is on
innovation-led growth. To the extent that we can make that premium innovation-led growth that the consumer will
accept, we do. And that most certainly applies to Brazil in terms of a line extension on the back of the Optic White
product, continued innovation in oral care and across our other businesses. And you're right, Chris, that is after dealing
with the removal of a tax on product, which lowered pricing to both retailers and to consumers and created a little bit of
temporary disruption in the marketplace for a couple of weeks.
But it is really engaging with our consumers through marketing, where we are using increasingly marketing mix
modeling to decide how we best engage with those consumers and deploy our funds accordingly, and it is innovation
behind the full portfolio of products that we have in Brazil. And then of course, the on the ground execution by a very
experienced management team in Brazil, not just with the modern trade, but all the way through the down trade in that
large and complex country.
Operator
Ali Dibadj, from Bernstein, has our next question.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, guys. Just had a quick follow-up on pricing and then a real question, on pricing, it looks like
the ratio between your reported pricing as opposed to the mix element, which is in your volume obviously from
innovation and stuff. But from a pricing, the ratio between that and currency in Latin America has almost always been
quite close, but past couple of quarters have not been that close. And I want to just understand a little bit more, kind of
continuing on this theme of pricing. Is that really all of Venezuela or are you seeing things from competition or retailers
or consumers or some of this macro fear that kind of put that ratio out of whack? That's kind of a clarification.

But the real question to me is, I think you're a good company to ask this, because you've essentially trounced all your
peers in terms of top-line growth. But we're also noticing for you and others that it's just getting tougher to grow, so
more expensive to grow. And I'm trying to understand how much of that is short-term, so macro issues in the U.S.,
macro issues in Europe, versus long-term kind of secular drivers related to these categories or related to a tougher
competitive environment that will be with us for quite some time? So how do you guys think about this, both internally
and because from the data externally, it does look like the ROI is getting tougher for everybody.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Well, thanks for the one question, Ali. Starting with your clarification, it is exclusively
Venezuela. The rest has to do with difference in timing of when we choose to take pricing in Latin America or in any
other emerging market, so nothing structural or fundamental there. I would challenge the secular notion and I would
challenge this inevitable creep of cost of doing business theory. I would start by saying you will know well that our
return on invested capital is fairly elevated, certainly, compared to our peer group and to the S&P 500.
But I guess our philosophy starts with the consumer, as it should do with all packaged goods companies. And the
theory that, as marketers, we are paid to create innovation the consumers feel they get a value paying for and, from our
point of view, we seek to make that value a premium for a premium benefit. We adjust access to our products by sizing
and the pricing related to sizing, but we don't, and we have never subscribed to the notion that price promotion is a way
of sustainably growing business. We respond to it where we need to, but we have always put a very large premium on
innovation and engaging with consumers around that innovation.
What we have been doing over several years is recognize the fact that you can engage with consumers very well and
build brand equity very well at the retail level. And using our marketing mix modeling, we are deploying a lot of
in-store techniques that maybe we weren't deploying 10 years ago. And some of that funding comes from broader
commercial spending, which you don't see captured in the below-the-line advertising. So we are putting increased
money in that space as well. And the affordability comes from the benefit of premiumization, our sharp focus on
funding the growth and the choice we made in the fourth quarter of last year to reorganize with our global growth and
efficiency program to make sure, in perhaps a medium-term choppy world, we were generating adequate funding to
make sure we could sustain the topline growth of the company, which on this call we would reaffirm for this year as
being between 6% and 7% from an organic point of view.
So it's essentially a focus on premiumization that the consumer values and a relentless focus on funding the growth and
now our global growth and efficiency program to provide the funding that drives topline and also bottom line.

Our next question comes from Wendy Nicholson from Citi Research.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Hi. Two small questions, I think. But number one, Bina, you called out the customer
development initiative in Hill's, and I understand what that is because you had all the new product activity going on.
But in Asia specifically, what is that? Why is it accounted for in SG&A as opposed to gross margin? And is that a
function of more competition? And then just a housekeeping item. With the relaunch of Total in Brazil and Mexico,
can you just remind us how big Total is as a percentage of your oral care portfolio? And when you relaunch Total, how
meaningful can it be in terms of incremental market share? I think you relaunched Total in Europe maybe a year or two
ago. So, is that a big deal? Or maybe you can frame that. Thank you.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah, the issue on customer development in SG&A is increase sales capability on the ground in
emerging markets, most especially in Asia, a choice made to make sure we can continue to build world-class
distribution in those countries and not simply have the product present, but to make sure that we have the product
visible and organized on the shelf in the way we would want our brands to be presented. And as it regards Total, we
don't give that level of segment detail, but it is a big business, and there is concerted effort behind Total here in the U.S.
as a complete equity as we bring the mouthwash to the marketplace in the second quarter.

Our next question will come from Joe Lachky from Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Joseph B. Lachky>: Hi, thanks. I guess I wanted to kind of take a step back, Ian, and get your opinion on how
you see the vision for you company evolving over the long-term. And I guess you've got really strong execution in your
current markets. And I guess in the near-term I see a strong runway, penetration, market share opportunities, riding
category growth in your current markets. But how long can you ride that trend within your current markets? I guess, the
fear being you reach saturation in those markets or there's a slowdown in developing market growth rates.
And then the second part of that is, then, what's the next step beyond that? And this may be like a 10 year, 15 year type
vision. But how do you see the product portfolio evolving? Are there any new markets to enter? How do you keep that
growth going in the long-term?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Thanks, Joe. I guess this sort of saturation notion is kind of overblown from a theory point of
view. We still have lots of growth opportunity in our existing oral care businesses, penetration in some markets, per
capita consumption in other markets, and we intend to mind that vigorously, certainly for the next decade and more.
Around that, we have the opportunity to expand existing businesses that we have that maybe pretty nascent as
categories in some of these emerging markets; think liquid body cleansing, think underarm that we can bring to these
markets at the right time with the distribution prowess we have in these markets and continue to expand our portfolio
quite, quite meaningfully.
So I think when you get below this sort of 20,000 foot theory of it and get into the planning detail of actually making a
vision concrete and agreeing what it is we should focus on and get done, we still think there is enormous growth. And
remember, if you take a 25-year view and take category definitions that are oral care, personal care, pet nutrition and
home care, within personal care, we got into the underarm business by acquiring Mennen. We got into the liquid skin
cleansing business in the U.S. by acquiring Softsoap. We expanded our footprint in body cleansing in Europe by
acquiring Sanex.
So even within the category definitions we have, once we've taken every one of them global, there is still the
opportunity to broaden our representation in segments of categories in which we do business. Oral care, by bringing
Total to the U.S., we've just established a global position in mouthwash, and we're just beginning that journey on
powered toothbrushes. So there is still we think a very bright future for the categories that we have today, well beyond
the timeframe you mention, Joe.

And our next question will come from Jason Gere with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Jason M. Gere>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Jason.
<Q - Jason M. Gere>: I guess just going back, and I got the context of your two pillars of growth hitting the 6% to 7%
organic sales and obviously returning back to 10% EPS growth. So as you see the next wave of restructuring cost
savings, how do you ensure that you have the right level of reinvestment in there to meet both objectives? So, I guess
I'm talking a little bit more about the advertising side and just as this quarter, you hit that 11% level, which I think is
closer to the highs that you've had. Can you just maybe walk through whether some of the factors, as you look at that
reinvestment rate of the savings that should be coming through and helping you over the next couple of years? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Thanks, Jason. Well, clearly, we take a very strategic view on how we choose to reinvest that
money. Frankly, we did that before we embarked upon the program, and we will be making together as a management
team with the involvement with our board some choices in terms of where and what the significant aspects of strategic
investment will be. When you bring it down to the notion of advertizing investment, yes, we have taken it up absolutely

and as a ratio in the first quarter, and we said we stand by the fact that we plan to do that in 2013. I repeat the point,
because I think it's important to register it, that with the capabilities available to companies like ours today, both
analytically and in-store technique wise, we are quite consciously doing more and more at the store level to engage
with consumers, because the ability to do that in a very effective return on investment and executional way is
significantly greater than it was five years, 10 years ago.
And so the investment choices we make when you just talk about advertising will be, yes, in the traditional advertising
engagement areas, which you will see below the line, but also in the so-called gross to net trade spending which kind of
comes off the top line but is nonetheless investment funding that we deploy to grow the business. And I think you can
rest assured, at least I hope you can rest assured, that as a group here, we will be doing the right thing in terms of global
growth and efficiency plus our ongoing funding the growth programs to make sure that we fund the growth while
delivering a return.

And we'll now go to Bill Chappell from SunTrust Bank.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Bill.
<Q - William B. Chappell, Jr.>: Thank you, good morning. Can you just talk a little bit more about just what you're
seeing in, especially Western Europe in terms of consumer trends? Has it just stayed – are we bouncing still along the
bottom? Are you seeing any signs of hope or any maybe uptick as we move to the back half of the year?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: We're seeing wild exuberance, Bill. No, I would say certainly the way we have planned this year
and the way we have thought about our strategic planning over the next five years, we are still assuming low growth in
Europe. We think that's the prudent thing to do. Low single digit category growth in our case.
You do, if you want to sort of then go to the next level of detail, you do see some buoyancy or greater buoyancy,
obviously, I think, in northern Europe compared to southern Europe. We were quite pleased that our southern European
businesses basically performed at the same level that they did in the fourth quarter of last year, and we did not see a
further deterioration. But I would say that we're talking about a low growth environment, certainly for the next strategic
cycle. If we are proven wrong and there's greater buoyancy, then that will be – that would be terrific. But we're not
planning on it.

Our next question will come from Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Joe.
<Q - Joseph Altobello>: Hey, thanks, good morning. I just want to go back to North America for a second, because I
thought it was particularly impressive, this quarter you guys seemed to hit the trifecta, if you will. The volumes are up
very nicely, pricing was very strong and you also had pretty good margin expansion. I think you mentioned earlier to a
question that pricing is becoming a core competency for you. But if you look at volumes, your tier stacked volumes in
North America were as high as I've seen them in quite some time. So if you could give us a little more color on what
drove the volumes? Was that pantry loading or trade load? And what drove the margins as well? Thank you.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Well, I think a few things to say. Number one, and Bina already referenced it, we saw some nice
share growth across a broad array of categories, which means we were growing faster than the rate of category growth.
That was one thing. Secondly, the timing of promotional events that we had in the first quarter of this year was
different than the first quarter of last year, which you may recall was really the expansion of Optic White. And thirdly,
we have begun to build distribution of the Total mouthwash that we referenced in our remarks. And as far as the second
quarter is concerned, I'm pleased to say that we have started off maintaining the pace that we had in the first quarter. So

And Ian Gordon with S&P Capital IQ has our next question.
<Q - Ian J. Gordon>: Hi. I wanted ask about your EPS guidance. I know it's early. You only have one quarter under
your belt, but you did come in at the high end of the 5.5% to 6.5% growth target for the year. Currency looks to be a
little bit more benign for the rest of the year, based on today's rates, so the comparisons look – balance a tad bit easier.
Hill's should ramp and you have the restructuring savings starting to flow through. So what's the missing piece and why
shouldn't we expect something maybe a little bit north of that 6.5% dollar growth?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Well, Ian, I think you have to go back to pre-Venezuela and coming into this year. When we came
into this year, we talked about EPS growth double digit on a dollar basis. And many people at the time, frankly, Ian,
even with the restructuring savings, which are relatively modest this year, built-in, people felt there was too much
optimism on the top-line and questioned our ability to deliver that. When the Venezuelan devaluation occurred, I think
we were quickly very clear [ph] politically (51:46) about the impact. Obviously, the one-time balance sheet revaluation
you know well. And we said that the EPS impact would be between $0.05 and $0.07 a quarter. And we kind of
reaffirmed the math this quarter, in saying that that would translate to a narrow range of 5.5% to 6.5% increase and we
stand by that for the year.

And now we'll go to Bill Schmitz from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Hi. Good morning, Ian.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Bill.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: So I have four clarification questions and one real question. Just kidding. So Latin
American margins, do you think they bottom this quarter? And the reason I ask that is I think the expense of inventory
that was flowing through in dollars probably goes away. So is there any reason to believe that this isn't kind of as bad
as it gets in terms of Latin America margins?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: I think the answer to that, Bill, you know we have been through these things many, many times
before – devals, price controls and the like. And I think it would be fair to say that our expectation is that we would
begin to rebuild margin going forward. Yes. Oh. I apologize for that. I didn't realize I was being paid by the word there
so...

And our next question will come from Michael Steib from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Michael Steib>: Good morning. Just a small point for me, Ian, why was pricing negative in Asia?

<Q - Linda Bolton-Weiser>: Hi. We – it's our understanding that you may have another major mass toothpaste
innovation, new product breakthrough type thing coming. Do you want to give some more information about that? Our
understanding is dentists may start to be educated on it this summer. And so when would be the launch, potential
launch, of that? Would it be late this year or next year?
And then just a clarification on your interest expense line, it had become interest income, net income two quarters ago,
in the fourth quarter. Going forward, will that now revert to being interest expense? And would $5 million to $10
million per quarter be a good rough estimate for that, of interest expense? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: The answer to your second question is yes. The answer to your first question is we are always
actively pursuing, as I mentioned earlier in talking about the innovation point, innovation that brings real benefit to
consumers and adds value. And on the assumption we do meet with these professionals in the middle of the year, we'll

And Lauren Lieberman from Barclays has our next question.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hi, Lauren.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Hello. Wondered if you could talk a little bit about Europe, just in terms of margins,
actually, because the margin performance is obviously great. And so you just continue getting really good cost savings
there or leverage on no volume growth. So, talk about where these savings are coming from and even before you've
really gotten going on this latest restructuring program. Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Well, the benefits come from a more benign commodity environment. The benefits come from
our traditional funding the growth savings programs and obviously the continued introduction of innovation, which we
seek to be premium, which is therefore accretive to margin. And as you rightly suggest, Lauren, and as Bina mentioned
very clearly I think in her prepared remarks, and as we suggested we might, a lot of the structural work that we will be
doing around the world has begun in Europe for obvious reasons.

<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: Morning. A question on Venezuela. Can you help us understand what the new
mechanism, the option mechanism, how it's likely to work and what you know about it at this point?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: We are – we continue to work with the government in Venezuela to get approval for CADIVI
funds for the importation of product and have started the year quite nicely, in fact, in that regard. The new auction
market mechanism that is replacing SITME whilst we will work with it, we understand so far that the tranches of
opportunity in that market are basically about $2 million. So whilst we'll look at it, I think in the main, we will be
staying with the CADIVI process.

<Q - Jon R. Andersen>: Hey. Just a quick one, Ian, on the advertising spend. It was up both absolutely and as a
percent of sales in the quarter, so you're presumably approaching about 11% of sales. Is that a level where you see
some plateauing going on and potentially some leverage going forward? And the incremental spend that you are doing
there, if you could you just talk a little bit about the focus. Is it more oriented towards new products in developed
markets or more investment behind your emerging markets? Thanks.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yes is the answer, Jon. It really is all of the above. I mentioned earlier the increasing focus we
have on marketing mix modeling in terms of both our engagement marketing with traditional consumers and indeed,
our trial and awareness generating advertising for new products in the developed countries, as you would expect. We
are moving some of that investment into digital in terms of it being a strong engagement vehicle. In the emerging
markets, more traditional vehicles continue to remain most – both affordable and effective.
And again, as I mentioned earlier, as we think about the advertising going forward, don't forget that we are also putting
a focus on what we call commercial spend, which is this trade spending, which is allowing us to do programs at retail
which are not just engaging and persuasive to consumers, but also help to build our brand equity and loyalty over time.
So we're managing all of those things. We do this not on a ratio basis, I have to say, Jon. We do it from the ground up,
market by market against what activities we have in countries as we get into each planning cycle. So the ratio is an
output. And the split between the traditional advertising and what we do on trade spending is an output of that planning
rather than a set ratio going into the planning.

And our final question will come from Mark Astrachan from Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: Yeah. Thanks, and good afternoon, everybody.
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Hey, Mark.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: I'm trying to get a sense of operating margin progression. So it was up a lot in all
segments, not including LatAm and pet nutrition. And I think in LatAm, the margins are still down excluding
Venezuela currency-related devaluation. So is there something inherently different on a cost front, whether wages,
inflation or spending, that makes LatAm different from the others? And then also, how should we think about the
progression in those markets like Europe or North America, where margins improved nicely?
<A - Ian M. Cook>: Yeah. Well, as you know, we don't talk about operating margins going forward, Mark. But I can
say from a gross margin point of view, we stand by that 30 to 70 basis points and the EPS that we have guided to that
drives from that. And Latin America, I mentioned on the margin roll-forward that within the walk-through on gross
margin, there was a negative of 120 basis points year-on-year for the world based on Venezuela and, therefore, Latin
America. And that said, we still increased our gross margin by 40 basis points. So the Latin American gross margin is
entirely to do with Venezuela. Entirely. And it is our thrust geography by geography, as you know, to expand our gross
margin around the world and then to make choices as to how we invest the funds that flow from that. So given that the
Venezuela impact on the world was 120 basis points, you can imagine the impact in Latin America.
