Thank you, Amy, and thank you for joining the call today. There are two topics I will cover in my opening remarks.
First, my perspective on the quarter and second, I will address a few key questions that come up frequently when we
meet. And then Kimberly will take you through the details of the quarter.
To start, the second quarter results were not where I want to see them. Kimberly will provide more detail. But to
summarize, our revenue was $2.2 billion, down 3% year-on-year in constant dollars. And operating margin was at
8.5%, down 100 basis points year-on-year. Active Representatives were down 6%. While we continue to make
progress, it is slower than I would like to see. Our financial performance is not yet benefiting significantly from the
actions we've taken as part of our turnaround journey.
We also continue to be negatively impacted by economic headwinds in several key market. From a geographic
perspective, North America, while declining in revenue, is making good progress on cost management and landed
where we expected. EMEA performed slightly better than we anticipated, and Latin America was below our
expectations. While we anticipated soft performance in Mexico, Brazil came in lower than we expected. This was the
result of two issues.
First, we underestimated the degree of impact from the World Cup, as we had lower engagement from the field and
consumers. Second, we experienced some demand forecasting issues in the quarter, primarily related to our new
innovation launches. The good news is, is that we have great products in the pipeline. The bad news is that we still need
to improve demand forecasting. These issues are actively being addressed by the Brazilian management team.
In the quarter, we continued to take actions to improve our cost base. As an example, while North America was down
20% in revenue, we essentially achieved breakeven in the quarter. Getting the cost structure right-sized to the business
was a top priority for the North American team. We now have a much more manageable cost basis with still more work
ahead. But I'm pleased with their progress.
And as you saw in our recent announcement, we have also taken significant actions to reduce costs of corporate
overhead. Along with the cost reductions, we've taken complexity out of the system and clarified roles and
responsibilities across the market, regional and global corporate teams. Having this clarity simplifies how we work
together. It will also help us to ensure that cost doesn't creep back into the system.
To sum things up, the second quarter was another tough one. In our earlier calls, we indicated that the first half of the
year would be challenging. As we move to the second half, we expect to show improved performance. This is based on
our expectation for continued progress and Representative engagement, particularly in a few key markets like Russia
and Mexico.
As we enter into the second half of 2014, I thought it would be helpful to give perspective on our progress and address
some of the key questions that you've raised in our meetings. One of the questions that comes up on my calls with you
and during my visit with investors is, how am I feeling about the progress we are making? And specifically, how do I
feel good about our progress, or why do I feel good about our progress?
Let me start by sharing with you the approach or process we take to evaluate and deliver improved performance in our
top markets. For every market, we ask the same three questions. First, do we have the right management team in place?
Second, are we executing well against the critical processes? And third, are we driving Representative engagement?
We have been systematically addressing these three areas across our top 12 markets, which represents about 80% of
our revenue.
Before giving you an example, let me provide you with more insight into what is included in each of these questions.
To start, in terms of management, it's broader than just the General Manager. It includes the head of Sales, the head of
Marketing and leaders of a few key functions. On execution of critical processes, I'm referring to field management,
commercial marketing and product supply. And finally, with respect to Representative engagement, I'm looking
broadly at more than just the number of Representatives. I look at recruiting, activation, retention and overall
satisfaction.

I thought it would be helpful to go back in time and look at the path we followed in the UK. I will go into more detail
here to illustrate the process we follow in a given market.
In late 2012, the UK was declining mid-single digits and had been for a couple of years. We were losing
Representatives and saw a shrinking average order. We made a change in management, putting in place a new GM and
new head of Sales, both of whom have strong direct selling and leadership experience within Avon. They brought
together a very seasoned management team with a good mix of Avon and external perspective.
The UK team needed the better part of two quarters to fully diagnose this situation, looking at both internal and
external factors. This gave them a clear picture into the root causes of their performance issues; to identify what they
needed to do to stop the decline and ultimately get back on a path to growth. They developed a strategic action plan and
determined that the single most important thing was to improve execution. They needed a clear plan, operational
discipline and accountability. While sales was the primary focus, plans were integrated across marketing and supply
chain as well.
The General Manager and her team tackled this in a very systematic way. They brought discipline back into the field.
This started with clear roles and training for their area sales managers, who were provided with very specific steps to
build their areas' business. Based on insights from their diagnosis, the team knew the key was to improve contact and
tracking for new Representatives.
Face-to-face contact was shown to be the most effective, followed by phone and SMS contact, so they adjusted all
three. The UK company call center reached out to many new Representatives after they placed their first quarter and
third order. And they found that those contacted after placing their first order showed a 12 percentage point increase in
placing a second order versus those who are not contacted. Representatives contacted after their third order placed a
fourth order at a 30 percentage point higher rate than those who were not contacted. Those orders were also £30 higher,
on average, than those Representatives who were not contacted.
The UK team also improved the data flow to the field. They implemented an online data base and technology so their
Sales Leaders and Representatives are now able to access data and gain better visibility to the potential in their
territory. This enables them to pursue and meet specific customers in their area. The results were more territory
appointments and importantly, improved productivity and satisfaction of new Representatives.
The commercial marketing team also worked closely with the field to engage both Representatives and consumers. The
UK strengthened processes that enable them to consistently execute each campaign. And the UK team is among the
best in Avon, with their 360 degree surround-sound launches of their biggest innovations. For example, they have
strong uptake with both the AF33 and ANEW Defense skincare launches by activating Representatives and consumers
through tailor-created field engagement, sampling, PR and digital advertising. Importantly, this is an example that the
right management team plus strong execution is necessary to drive Representative engagement.
The UK is steadily improving Representative engagement by it making easier for her to earn and do business with
Avon. This has been re-instilled in their culture. The team takes great pride in improving the Representative experience,
and it's paying off. This quarter, they have stopped decline in revenue. They have a lot more work to do, but they've
made tremendous progress. It's important to note that the UK was not a quick fix. It has taken the UK team more than
18 months to get the business back on solid footing.
The good news is that as they strengthen Representative engagement, they are better prepared to invest in the brand and
bring in new Representatives and customers. I'm confident that they are on track to get this business back to a
competitive position.
The UK is a helpful example for two reasons. First, it provides a view into the type of progress I'm seeing. And second,
it highlights the sequence for attacking and fixing our more challenging markets.
First, it starts with having the right management team in place. This is particularly important for Avon, as it is a very
management-intensive business. Second, we need strong execution of fundamental processes around field management
and commercial marketing. And third, when we execute well, we drive Representative engagement by ensuring that

Representatives have a positive interaction with Avon. I know that you've heard me say this many times, but when she
is successful, Avon is successful. And we are clear on the systematic approach required to help her succeed.
Let me now anticipate the obvious question: what do I see as I look at our top 12 markets through a similar lens of
these three areas; management team, execution and Representative engagement? I feel good that we've made a lot of
progress in the area of management and talent. We are improving in execution but clearly not where we need to be, and
we have mixed performance on our Representative engagement across our markets.
To be more specific on talent, we conducted a thorough assessment of our management teams in our top-12 markets.
We now have more than 75% of the markets with strong leaders in the critical management team role. And we've done
this with a good mix of direct selling expertise, what I call the best of Avon, and external hires where we had gaps. And
about two-thirds of our critical roles are filled with leaders who have direct selling experience.
While we have good teams in place in our key markets, I would note that a number of these individuals are relatively
new in their roles. So we know that there's a bit of a learning curve for them. As we saw in the UK and other markets,
this will take time. But I'm confident we're headed in the right direction.
As it relates to improving execution in field management and commercial marketing, we are making solid progress in
commercial marketing. We've improved our product offerings across our base business, while strengthening new
product introductions in our core categories: Fragrance, Color and Skincare.
We're integrating Fashion & Home as part of our Beauty with a big "B" strategy to provide incremental earnings to the
Representatives in a way that enhances our brand. There's still an area of opportunity in pricing execution, but all
regions are making headway in building capabilities. And we are seeing some progress.
If I had to place a figure on where we stand on execution, it would naturally be lower than the 75% figure I gave you
for the management team. I would estimate that as of today, we are consistently executing well in about half of our
top-12 markets. And we know where the issues are in the others.
To me, the area where we must continue to improve is execution in the field. This is my number- one concern globally
and a crucial focus for us. Field execution is a key driver in Representative engagement and, ultimately, the number of
Active Representatives. Active Representatives remains a critical KPI for Avon. The Representative is at the heart of
our company. However, it is not just about the number of Representatives we have but their engagement with Avon as
well.
You are all aware that we are not where we need to be with Active Representatives. And hopefully, by detailing the
approach we take to underperforming markets, it explains why Representative engagement and the metrics you see
quarterly are, in my opinion, critical but a lagging indicator of our progress. So what are we doing to improve
Representative engagement? It begins with an understanding of the key drivers of engagement and then fixing what's
not working.
We've implemented a Representative Engagement Survey in our top markets that identifies the key issues by type of
Representative. The issues generally fall into two major buckets; ease of doing business with Avon and the potential
earnings opportunity. For each top market, we've accessed strength and challenge areas. And the markets have put
plans in place to address the issues, some similar to what I mentioned in the UK. For example, in some of our markets,
we identified service challenges and specifically the returns policy as a key issue impacting Representative retention.
So we implemented a simplified returns and credit policy to enable them to spend more time growing their business.
Representative earnings opportunity was also a factor in some markets. In Eastern Europe, we introduced a new sales
leadership model to enhance sales leader progression by creating smaller steps for title progression. We provided
individual plans to each candidate to help them reach the next title and offer improved bonus programs. The early
results are positive, and we continue to roll out this program to other markets.
We also know it is not a one-size-fits-all approach. From our surveys and from our work with Representatives, we can
segment our approach to better serve the different needs of our Representative base. So we've begun implementing
different motivators for different groups of Representatives. Both Turkey and Argentina have been successful with their

segmentation strategies. I visited both of these markets recently and was really impressed by how the teams are using
insights into their Representative base to segment and drive better engagement.
Across all of our markets, we are taking a systematic approach to better understand our Representatives and what they
need to succeed. Having this level of consistency and discipline will improve Representative engagement. While this
has not yet translated into improved financial results, we are doing the necessary things to get this back to a healthy and
growing Active Representative base.
So to answer your questions, yes, I see progress. We know what the issues are, and we know what we need to do to fix
them. And we're taking a very systematic and disciplined approach market by market.
The second question I would like to address is about the U.S. I'm often asked, are there secular problems in the U.S.?
And are we adequately addressing the issues? Would we be better off exiting the U.S. market? Let me start by saying
the U.S. is a very important market for us. It's a large and important beauty market. We see a number of our direct
selling competitors doing well in this market. And while we have a long road ahead to get this business back to where it
needs to be, in 2015, I anticipate that the North American business will return to profitability and no longer be dilutive
to Avon's operating margin.
How are we getting there? The U.S. is following a similar path to stabilization as we deployed in the UK.
Unfortunately, the U.S. is starting from a far more challenged position. And so it will take time as we fix the things
most critical to our Representatives. We now have a terrific management team in place, a team who has strong direct
selling capabilities, excellent leadership skills and also team members who bring in external perspectives. The team is
working day and night to improve execution and, most importantly, execution in the field. The team has diagnosed and
is fixing all aspects of Representative engagement step by step.
Frankly, there's a lot to tackle here, as we need to improve all aspects of the Representative experience in the U.S.
We've had trouble bringing in and activating new recruits. We have had challenges with our service to our
Representatives, and we have had retention issues. It's very important to fix the issues rather than simply recruit more
Representatives into a system that's not working well. You should expect to see a continued decline of Active
Representatives while we improve the Representative experience.
Over time, this decline will slow and then stabilize as we move through the turnaround plan.
The North American team has already executed on many of the programs we shared at CAGNY (Consumer Analyst
Group of New York). They are making good progress on the size of line reduction and have significantly improved
internal pricing capabilities. They launched the improved recruiting kit to make the earnings more attractive, improve
support for new Representatives and enhance the online recruiting vehicle. Similar to the UK, the team is bringing a
disciplined approach to the field. They've changed the goals and compensation approach with district sales managers
and have weekly calls in place to review four critical KPIs with each division to strengthen ownership and
accountability.
To further accelerate our work here, we recently appointed a Chief Representative Officer for North America, an Avon
veteran of 30-plus years, who is working with senior management and the field to fix the critical aspects of recruiting,
earnings and overall engagement. As I mentioned earlier, the team has also executed well in improving the cost base.
SG&A is $45 million lower this quarter than last year, bringing the spend more in line with the size of the business.
There is more work ahead and strong plans in place to further reduce spend, especially in supply chain.
We know that we need to modernize Avon's business and improve access to our product and our company. To that end,
we are launching an upgraded Avon.com shopping site for U.S. Representatives and consumers in September. We will
be introducing this to our sales leaders and district sales managers in August. This will provide Representatives with
another way to earn, by attracting new customers who can order online. Representatives will benefit from this, as this
gives them two ways to sell and two ways to earn.
I know the future for Avon is modernizing direct selling or, better said, social selling.

The Beauty space is ripe for personal connections and recommendations from friends. We have to make it easy for our
Representatives to do business with us. We are embracing technology so we can modernize and bring in new
consumers and Representatives. And digital technology, whether it be online recruiting, online ordering, social media,
mobile apps for training and placing orders, is the enabler of our future.
The third question I would like to address is a recurring question about our goals. Are they the right ones? And am I
confident we'll meet them? Let me start by saying I believe that we have the right goals of mid single-digit revenue
growth and low double-digit operating margin. As you are aware, we looked at the companies in the beauty industry,
other direct selling companies and Avon's historic growth and margins in order to establish our objectives.
Having said that, I also acknowledge that we are somewhat behind where we thought we'd be at this point. Some of the
issues in the U.S. were deeper than anticipated, and we've had a greater influx of macro issues. We still think these are
the right goals and they are doable by 2016. But the degree of difficulty is greater today than when we set the goals in
late 2012.
We will know a lot more about how we are tracking against our goals over the next six months, as we improve
execution in our key markets and drive improved Representative engagement. We will also have deeper insights into
our progress in North America, which will also have an impact on the timing of reaching our goals. We will be in a
better place as we close out the year to provide more information on how we are tracking.
I'll now hand it over to Kimberly for her review of the quarter.
Sherilyn S. McCoy
Thank you, Sheri. The second quarter was tough, and we clearly still have challenges that we need to address. We are
taking steps to turn around the business, and we're making good progress on costs. But the sales recovery's taking us
longer than we anticipated.
With that said, let me take you through the details of the quarter. In Q2, constant dollar revenue declined 3%. On a
reported basis, revenue was down 13%, negatively impacted by foreign exchange. Units declined 6%, driven by
continued weakness in North America. Active Representatives were down 6%, mainly driven by the continued
weakness in North America. But we also saw declines in the other regions as well. Q2 price mix was up 3%, with
increases in most regions, led by North America, due to higher pricing in the U.S. Inflationary pricing in Latin America
also contributed.
Adjusted gross margin declined 30 basis points to 63%, due to the negative impact of foreign exchange; largely in Latin
America as well as in EMEA. Productivity initiatives in supply chain and pricing benefits partially offset this negative
impact. Adjusted operating margin was down 100 basis points to 8.5% in the quarter, primarily due to foreign exchange
and de-leverage, given the weaker revenue.
The adjusted operating margin included about a 40 basis point benefit for a tax VAT credit in Brazil. The adjusted
effective tax rate was 42.7% compared to 34.9% a year ago, which was higher than expected, due to an adjustment in
the carrying value of our differed tax balances and out-of-period adjustments and the country mix of earnings.
In the past, I've indicated that you should expect our tax rate to be in the mid-to-high 30%s, excluding discrete items.
And we expect that to remain the case. This high rate is largely due to our overseas earnings not being designated as
currently invested abroad, which automatically results in a higher rate. In addition to the base rate of mid-to-high 30%s,
the country mix of earnings can impact our rate in any given quarter. We are also faced to the situation where as our
business performance remains challenged in some countries, this could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets,
which can result in a higher tax rate as well.
As a result of these issues, it is very difficult for us to provide you with more specific guidance about our effective tax
rate. And it could remain volatile through this turnaround, but we're evaluating how we can reduce the tax rate for the
future

Adjusted EPS was $0.20 per share compared to $0.29 a year ago.
Turning to Latin America. Q2 revenue rose 1% in constant dollars, which was disappointing, due to a
weaker-than-expected result, primarily in Brazil. The region's growth was favorably impacted by a one-point benefit
from a VAT credit in Brazil, and we are likely to have more benefits from tax credits in quarter three. As I discussed
last quarter, we adapted SICAD II for Venezuela at the end of quarter one. But we only update our constant dollar
exchange rates on an annual basis. So we won't see the impact on our constant dollar results until Q1 2015.
Had we used the SICAD II rate to translate Venezuela results into constant dollars, the region's constant dollar revenue
would've been down 2% from the prior year. Price mix in Latin America was up 4%, primarily due to inflationary
pricing in Venezuela and Argentina. Active Representatives were down 6% and units were down 3%, primarily due to
the declines in Mexico and Venezuela.
Brazil constant dollar revenue was up 3%, including approximately two points from the VAT credit recognized in
quarter two. Fashion & Home was up 2%, and Beauty was flat in constant dollars. As Sheri indicated, we experienced
some demand forecasting issues in Brazil related to our new product launches, which are being addressed by continuing
to improve our internal capabilities and processes. And we're also working at more flexibility to our supply chain.
In addition, as the quarter progressed, we saw lower activity as a result of disruption from the World Cup. For the
second half, the team in Brazil has put programs in place to engage the Representative base and is supporting these
with field activation.
In addition, they have a strong innovation plan. For example, today we're launching Luxe, our high end Color line that
has been successful in Russia and other markets within EMEA. Brazil is launching this with a strong 360-degree
program, including PR, field incentive programs and advertising. While we are focused on internal execution in Brazil,
we're also keeping an eye on external factors, given the changing economic and political environment.
Turning to Mexico. Revenue was down 12% in constant dollars, driven by a decline in Active Representatives. While
we have made progress in improved pricing and mature merchandising, the field management process continues to
remain a priority. In an effort to improve recruitment, we have launched a new campaign called Beautiful Stories which
shares stories from successful Representatives.
Taking a chapter from the UK example Sheri cited, we are increasing our contact with these Representatives to help
train and engage them in the business. And we are working to bring back former Representatives as well as focusing
our intentions on Representatives at risk of leaving the business. We are pleased that we've announced a new General
Manager for North Latin America,, which includes Mexico. He will start on September 1 and comes to us from the
CPG world, with many years of experience running businesses in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America.
To the point Sheri made earlier about the importance of a strong management team, his experience is complemented by
strong sales and commercial marketing leaders with many years of direct sales selling experience. Latin America
adjusted operating margin was 11.3%, down 210 basis points, which included 80 basis point benefit associated with tax
credits. Operating margin declined due to the negative impact of currency and inflationary cost increases. As we look
forward, improvement in Latin America performance is key to achieving our expected second-half improvement, led
by Brazil and Mexico.
Moving to EMEA. Revenue was flat in constant dollars, with improvements in average order growth, offsetting a
decline in Active Representatives. The French market is now closed, and this negatively impacted the region's growth
by approximately one point in Q2. Sequentially, we made progress in Russia in quarter two, although the business was
still down 4% in constant dollars. This was driven by a decline in Active Representatives, partially offset by average
order improvement.
We started to see some improvement in Russia because of the changes we had made to our brochure to make it more
relevant and to ensure focus on unit drivers. This is now helping to generate Representative engagement. In addition,
we need effective field incentives. We have also rolled out an advanced sales leadership model in Russia, which now
has more smaller steps to make it easier for sales leaders to achieve higher levels.

Turning to the UK, we are pleased that we saw growth in this market for the first time since quarter four 2010. Constant
dollar revenue was up 1% in quarter two, driven by improvement in average order, which was partially offset by a
decline in Active Representatives. We expect to see continued progress in this market, due to the plans that Sheri
outlined earlier.
Adjusted operating margin in EMEA was 14%, down 190 basis points. The decrease was primarily due to the
continued unfavorable impact of foreign exchange. Looking forward, we are encouraged by signs that we see in EMEA
and feel good about actions the team has been taking to fix recent issues around pricing, unit drivers and Representative
engagement. We expect constant dollar revenue improvement in this region in the second half, assuming the economic
and political situation does not deteriorate. However, we expect to see a continued negative impact on the currency on
EMEA operating margin in the second half.
Turning to North America. I am pleased that once again this quarter, we were able to offset the impact of declining
sales with cost reduction measures. This region reported a 20% constant dollar revenue decline, similar to quarter one
results. A 19% decline in Active Representatives was the key driver. Units were down 29% as a result of a decline in
Active Representatives as well as higher pricing.
Constant dollar Beauty sales declined 20%, and Fashion & Home declined 19%. Adjusted North America operating
profit was essentially breakeven, with a 160 basis point improvement in operating margin versus prior year. Gross
margin also improved due to better price mix. More specifically, SG&A went down $45 million versus the prior year,
due to head count reduction.
In addition to head count, another example of cost reduction is in the area of brochures, where we made significant
progress in reducing expenses this quarter. We have worked aggressively to improve the efficiency across all areas of
how we manage the brochure process. This includes being more disciplined when assessing quantity we are printing
and optimizing brochure distribution.
We have also reduced the number of unproductive fliers, which is something Pablo has spoken about at CAGNY. And
we have negotiated better rates on our paper purchases. While we are pleased with the cost savings achieved, we still
have a lot of work to do and remain aggressive in our efforts to align the cost structure with size of the business. We
expect Active Representatives to continue to decline before we see the improvement in the Representative experience
that Sheri discussed.
In Asia-Pacific, revenue declined 9% on a constant dollar basis. Active Representatives declined 8%, while units were
down 5%. Adjusted operating margin was 0.9%, down 540 basis points. This was due to the impact of lower revenue
on our fixed cost as well as lower gross margins, due to unfavorable currency and unfavorable price mix in the
Philippines. Asia-Pacific overall remains challenging, and we expect results to remain soft in the near term.
Now I'll take you through three adjustments we made to our GAAP results in the quarter. As a result of the adoption of
SICAD II foreign exchange rate to re-measure the results of Venezuela business, we recorded an $18 million charge
from using the U.S. historic dollar cost basis of non-monetary assets, such as inventory.
During the quarter, we also recorded CTI restructuring charges within operating profit of approximately $51 million
pre-tax. This was largely due to employee costs related to the elimination of approximately 600 positions, primarily in
corporate functions in North America. This brings the total number of head count reductions related to our $400 million
savings initiative to approximately 3,700.
Also, in a continued effort to better manage future pension obligations, we offered former employees who are vested
and participate in the U.S. pension plan a payment that would fully settle our obligations to those participants. As a
result of this initiative, we recorded a settlement charge of $24 million pre-tax.
Moving on to cash flow. Net cash used by operating activities was $7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2014,
compared with net cash provided of $70 million for the same period in 2013, unfavorably impacted by lower earnings.
The overall net cash used during the six months ended June 30, 2014 was $330 million, which is comparable with the
same period in 2013.

Our net debt for Q2 was $1.9 billon, which is up $240 million from year-end 2013, primarily due to lower cash
balances, partly due to Venezuela. In Q2, we also continued to make progress on working capital, which operationally
improved eight days compared with a year ago. Accounts payable improved 13 days operationally, as we continued to
focus on renegotiating payment terms with our vendors. However, inventory was five days worse operationally.
Working capital and inventory, in particular in Latin America, remain a key area of focus for us as we work to improve
cash flow. And as I've indicated in the past, improving our forecasting ability is key to being able to better manage our
inventory levels.
Looking ahead in the second half, we continue to anticipate constant dollar sales and margin growth. The sales growth
will be driven by easier comparisons and expected improvements in some of our key markets, including Russia and
Mexico. We are also continuing to address our cost structure in order to offset headwinds and improve margins. For the
full year, we still expect to make progress towards our margin goal, but top line is likely to be a challenge.
I believe that we have set the right financial goals for Avon. However, stabilizing the business has clearly been more
challenging than anticipated. Nonetheless, we are continuing to take the necessary steps to improve our financial
performance.
With that, I'll hand it back to Sheri.
Sherilyn S. McCoy
Thank you, Kimberly. And just to summarize before we open the line to questions, as anticipated, the second quarter
was tough. As we move to the second half, we do expect to show improved performance. The goals we set for
ourselves are the right ones.
We're committed to fixing the U.S. business. We're beginning to see improvements in execution, and the team is
working aggressively to return the U.S. business to profitability in 2015. We are a taking market-by-market systematic
approach to improve our performance, with an immediate focus on the top 12 markets. And finally, improving
Representative engagement is the top priority of the organization. We know the issues, we know what we need to fix
and we've now largely got the teams in place to execute. Thank you.
We can now open for questions.

their questions. [Operator Instructions]Your first question comes from Bill Schmitz. Please state your affiliation, then
pose your question.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Good morning. It's Deutsche Bank. Hey, you guys, I read through the 10-Q, and it looked like
there was about 300 basis points of margin hit from currency in the quarter. How do you think that sort of progresses
going forward, assuming the spot rates hold? And then another part or a different question. On the Avon.com website,
can you just explain a little more how it's going to work and how you're going to roll out to the Reps in the U.S.?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: So Kimberly will take the question on basis points, Bill, and then I'll come back and talk
about the Avon.com rollout.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yeah. So we definitely had impact from translation as well as transaction in quarter two.
And I would expect that to be less going forward in quarter three and quarter four. But with that said, we do also have
uncertainty of what happens with Russia and the impact on some of the currencies. But the way we're looking at it now,
we would expect that to be probably 100 basis points less, give or take, going forward.

<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: And Bill, for Avon.com, we're really excited about this. As I said, we will be launching this
in September in the U.S. And we are reviewing it with our sales leaders and our district sales managers in August at the
conference. Importantly, we've actually brought a number of our Representatives in to help us with how to design this
and talk about it. The whole premise is, it allows Representatives and consumers to go online. The Representative can
send her customer there, and she gets a benefit from that. So she will get a commission from that. The customer can go
right online, and the Representative will get that benefit.
At the same time, what we know is, as we look at the people that come online, about two-thirds of them are attached to
Representatives in the data that we have. And another third come on and order directly from Avon. And so one of the
things that we think is important is to continue to modernize our business, make sure we get the brand out there, the
name out there. And we will enable our Representatives to earn more, and that's why we talk about two ways to sell,
two ways to earn. She will earn, whether it's face-to-face contact or whether the person comes online and orders
directly from her. So it's a benefit for our Representative and it's a benefit for Avon. And it's something that we're very
excited about rolling out in the U.S., and then we'll follow in other markets in next year.

And your next question will come from Wendy Nicholson. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: ...group. Two questions, if I can. Just quickly, with the Brazil issues, the execution issues
in the June quarter, have those been largely resolved? Or do you see any hang-over issue or impact of that in the third
quarter? And then just on the U.S., specifically, there was a lot of talk at CAGNY about some of the initiatives and
issues and Cinco de Mayo and focusing on a Hispanic community and all that kind of stuff. Did any of those things
start to gain traction or take hold in the June quarter? Or are we looking for positive signs of improvement just too
quickly? Thanks.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Sure. Thanks, Wendy. First of all, on the Brazil service issues, the team has been working
very aggressively on this. It was really related primarily to our new product launches. And like I said, our Mega Effects
Mascara, for example, oversold three times. So there was no way for us to be able to, well we didn't forecast it right
because we had not anticipated the pick-up. And so that's something that we're going back and looking at. For the
longer term, we have big launches like that. How do we get a better sense of what the demand will be?
Certainly, we do product testing, so we know the product, how it works. What we have to get better at is understanding
when we activate the Representatives, getting a better sense of how many units is each Representative is going to take.
When we promote it, how does that end up in terms of volume? So that's an area where the team has done some
short-term things to fix it to make sure we're addressing it. Longer term, we just have to get better on these big launches
to make sure we have a systematic process in place to test that.
The other piece that we struggled with, frankly, was we weren't able to activate our supply chain as quickly. And so we
didn't have all the components that we needed to be able to do that. And so the team has actually put [indiscernible]
(42:12) where they have better contingency plans so that we have raw materials and we have the right molds and we
have fall-back and contingency plans if we over-sell. And so obviously, if you over-sell three times, it's going to be
difficult. But we're getting better at that, and the team has short-term actions in place and then longer-term, looking at
these bigger launches to make sure we understand it more holistically.
As it relates to the U.S. Hispanic initiative, we do have work in place. It's early days. One of the things that Pablo has
done is he's actually created two different Hispanic regions. It's about 13 divisions that we have that are focused –
actually two divisions with 13 different districts, focused on Hispanic. We have one in the east and one in the west.

Your next question comes from Chris Ferrara. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Chris Ferrara>: Hi. It's Wells Fargo. I guess, can you talk about what triggered the write-down of the deferred
tax assets? And what does that mean about the long-term prospects of profitability, I guess, where that happened?
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: So, yeah, I don't want to get too, too technical – and this one could get way down into the
weeds of it. But obviously, we have to continuously be valuing our deferred tax asset based on the usability. And as I
said in my script is that when we have some challenges in profitabilities in some counties, that can impact the deferred
tax asset. So – and that's what we saw here in this quarter. And there is potential for us to have some additional charges
against these deferred tax assets. I will point out that these are non-cash charges that are taking place.
<Q - Chris Ferrara>: Great. And just a quick follow-up. Sheri, you said that half of the top-12 markets are executing
well. To put you on the spot, I guess which of those six, just for the purpose of tracking and just understanding better,
which markets besides the UK, I guess, would you hold out as executing well?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah. I don't want to go into giving a report card on the different markets. What I would
say is that they're in different places. Certainly, even Brazil, who had a challenge this quarter, for the last several
quarters has done a very good job and had solid performance and has been executing well. We had a specific issue as it
relates to supply chain here. So there are areas where we're going to continue to see challenges. What I would say is I
feel confident that we have the right management teams, and they're beginning to show good traction. I don't want to
get into a situation where I'm saying, this one's working well and this one's not at this point in time.
<Q - Chris Ferrara>: Got it. Thanks.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Thanks.

Your next question comes from Lauren Lieberman. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Lauren R. Lieberman>: Thank you. It's Barclays. Unfortunately my question might fall into the bucket of asking
for a report card, but I hope not. I was just curious. You specifically mentioned Mexico expected to get better from
here, along with Russia. I feel like Russia, it was clear to me why, with some of the changes in leadership, structure
incentives, things like that. I was curious on the rationale for Mexico. I know you said pricing is better. But beyond
that, I wasn't really comfortable with why things improved from here in this year, in particular.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah. And so one of the things that we've been focused on in Mexico first was making sure
that we had the right pricing and the right products from a consumer engagement piece, which is, as you recall, back in
third quarter of last year, we had that issue. We've corrected that, and we had the right price points and the right
merchandising approach for the market. The area that we've struggled with, frankly, has been around the
Representative engagement. And the Representative engagement piece is a combination of making sure we're bringing
people and the same time, making sure that we're not losing people out the other side.
The team has put advertising on air back in the June timeframe, and it continues through the second half to actually talk
about the Avon proposition and bring people into the business. We've put a lot more focus on new Representative
support, where we have people working closely with the Representatives as they come in. And at the same time, we

have targeted efforts to people who we feel might be in jeopardy of leaving the business to make sure we're
incentivizing them and looking at a reinstatement plan for people who have left and bringing them back. So the focus is
to continue to show improvement as it relates to the Representative piece. That's critically important for us as we exit
the year. And so that's really where we have a lot of energy and focus from the management team. And the team there
has been working on that diligently for the last six months, seeing good improvement, bringing people in. What we
need to do is to make sure that we're getting them up and running. So that's our area of focus.
<Q - Lauren R. Lieberman>: Great. And then just following on that because you mentioned advertising on air in
Mexico, where else have you stepped up on advertising because that was something that's surprised me this quarter was
advertising being up so much?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Some of it was in Latin America, and we had a little bit in Asia-Pacific and Australia. But
if we look at our year-to-date advertising versus prior year, we're basically flat versus prior year – or slightly down –
sorry – slightly down versus prior year. As we look at the advertising piece, it really relates to where our new product
launches are, even as Kimberly mentioned Luxe in Brazil. We will support that with advertising. And so you will see
ups and downs as it relates to our new product launches because we're timing it – our advertising is timed to that.
<Q - Lauren R. Lieberman>: Okay. Thank you so much.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Thanks.

Your next question comes from Ali Dibadj. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, guys. I'm from Bernstein. So I have two questions. One is – and Sheri, I very much
appreciated the deep dive and the UK example and the kind of three questions that you asked in every region, so
management, execution and Rep engagement. I'm wondering if you could address some of the questions not there, so
the bigger questions that I'm assuming you ask. Things about business structure, things about brand equity, things about
sales model, i.e., are you a direct seller or are you a beauty company? Those types of bigger questions, perhaps,
because the other ones are much more granular. And it leads to my second question. And we've heard a couple times
from you guys, it's taking a little bit longer than we anticipated. But I'm still struggling understanding why. So what's
driving that? Thanks.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Okay. So, Ali, just a question around beauty and channel. I see the essence of our company,
we are a beauty company. But we also have a very special and unique distribution channel, and they're intertwined. I
mean our Representative is at the heart of the business. She actually is the ambassador for our brand.
If you look at media spend, we should be thinking about our 6 million Representatives and how they drive our business
because they are really the ones that activate it. And so I see it as both. And we need to make sure that we are
supporting and serving our Representatives. But we're also a very strong beauty business, and that's why people come
to Avon and that's why people know Avon. And I think as I talk about the importance of getting the right management
team, execution and then getting Representative engagement, that leads to brand health and brand energy. And so that's
critically important for us.
As it relates to your second question of just...
<A - Amy Low Chasen>: Timing.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Oh, timing. Second question as it relates to timing and why it's taking so long. It really has
to do with getting the right management team in place and making sure that they understand and diagnose the issues,
making sure they have the right people in place as it relates to execution – and that's around the commercial marketing
side and the field side. The field is critically important because that's really drive Representative engagement, but they
also need great products to sell. We need to be energized each campaign, and that level of discipline is critically
important. It has to happen on the ground; it has to be driven by the General Manger, the head of Sales, the head of

Marketing in those different countries.
And it's taken us some time to get those people in place. And as I said, we have about 75% from our management team
perspective. And we're about halfway there on execution. And frankly, I'd love to see it faster. And I know the teams in
the markets would love to see it faster. The teams are working hard to do the right things to turn this business around,
and we are very confident we'll do it. But it's taken us longer than we'd like. Did I answer your...
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: So sort of. It's very helpful context. But you're saying it's taking faster than you think. So I guess
that a turnaround takes a while. But I'm trying to understand, what is that you guys anticipated happening faster that's
not? Is it finding the right talent? I mean what is it that you're surprised by this taking longer than you think right, like
your perspect...
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Well I think it does take time to get the talent in place and get the team operating as a team.
The other thing that I would comment on that surprised us relative to the timeframe from the goals, is I do think U.S.
was more challenged than I anticipated when we set the goals. And the second thing I would say is we anticipated we'd
have some macro issues. We didn't anticipate the level that we've had. And so those are the two things relative to the
timing piece. But it is a process, and it is a turnaround. And we're confident we're going to do it, and we're making
great progress from my perspective.

And your next question comes from Olivia Tong. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Olivia Tong>: Thanks. Good morning. It's Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Just first quickly, you did tell what
the impact of translating a SICAD II would've been on sales, but what about on EPS? And then just following up. On
the U.S., you're several quarters in now and you've made great progress on cost. But it's still not clear how you're going
to stabilize the revenue base.
So can you talk through some of the steps that still need to be taken and what changes you're making in your approach,
particularly when I think about somewhere like Brazil, where you've had some forecasting issues, and supply chain
issues? And that's one of the areas where you have one of your newest plants. So I'm particularly surprised that that's an
issue in Brazil. And if the U.S. gets sort of back to a little bit of improvement or less declines in sales. Can you satisfy
that demand if that's happens? Thanks.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Sure. So I'll talk first about the U.S. market. The key to driving revenue is to bring in more
Representatives and have them engaged and activated with the business. That's the number one thing that we need to
do. We have been very focused on the cost side. Pablo and his team have now been extremely focused on the field, and
we've made changes in the field in terms of how we compensate. So the district sales manager have four critical KPIs.
They get compensated by campaign if they hit those KPIs, and they don't get the same level of bonus if they don't hit it.
So we've looked at that from that standpoint, and the KPIs have to do with bringing new Representatives in, helping
people place a second order, making sure that we're keeping people and not losing people. So it's very specific on that.
At the same time, we are fixing the brochure. We've made a lot of changes there and changes in pricing to get people
excited about buying Avon products. So that helps us from a Representative perspective.
The overall service challenge and you reference to Brazil, Brazil's issue specifically was more around – we just actually
did better on some of our new products than we anticipated and we weren't prepared for that. As it relates to the U.S.,
we have the capability to supply. In fact, one of our challenges is in some cases, we probably have an opportunity to fill
up our plant. So that is less of an issue relative to what we saw in Brazil.
And I'll turn it Kimberly now for the SICAD question.
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yeah. If we look at it, overall, it's not that material on profit at the end of the day. So now, I
see SICAD's II rate is about 1% of profitability for the group.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: Hey, good morning. It's Stifel. Just following up on the Venezuela question. Could you
talk about your expectation for that country's contribution revenue growth in the back half of the year?
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: So again, if you look at Venezuela, especially on the SICAD II basis, it really becomes
pretty small for the overall group. What we do expect in Venezuela, I would expect inflation to continue to impact the
numbers there. It has been a challenge, I will say, with regards to overall being able to get the raw materials and the
imports necessary. But with that said, I think we secured what we need for the second half of the year. But again,
especially if you look at Venezuela now at a new exchange rate, it's really not that material for the group at all.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: But are you using the old exchange rate to measure currency-neutral growth through the
back half of this year, and then it will revert to SICAD II beginning next year?
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yes, that's correct. That's correct.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: So that contribution in terms of price increasing that you saw in the second-quarter, first
quarter, should continue to the back half of the year before it normalizes into next year. Is that right?
<A - Kimberly A. Ross>: Yes, that is correct. So you will continue to see the inflationary pricing impacting the
constant dollar through the second half of this year from Venezuela. I think from next year, it becomes immaterial.
Yeah. I think one of the questions is volume relative, just to make sure we can supply, given the issues in the country.
So that would be the one area that we have to stay close to and watch.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then just one other question on Brazil. Could you talk about
how you're planning to combat Natura entering Fashion & Home?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Well, we have a great line-up in Fashion & Home. And certainly, we're entering the
holiday season, and that's an area of focus for us. One of the things we will continue to do is make sure that we have
relevant products at the right price point, positioned as a beauty offering. So we will continue to do that. I believe that
we'll continue to do it through the brochure. I'm not sure that Natura's going directly through the brochure at this point
in time. So that is also a difference versus what we do today.

<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: BMO Capital. Good morning. I have a question. I just want to make sure I understand
what you said about the U.K., that this was the first sales increase since some time in 2010. Is that correct?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah. Fourth quarter 2010.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: Okay. So my question is, if it took four years to turn the U.K., why would we expect
faster progress in other markets? Is it because you're already two years into the process? Or these other markets are less
challenged than the U.K. was four years ago? You give a little perspective on that.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah. No, good question. So Connie, as I look at it, it took about 18 months to turn the
U.K. We brought a new management team in, and I think the management team really has done a terrific job. As I
mentioned, we have strong direct selling expertise; also, a view of the external environment. And so as I look at that,

we've watched their progress. It took them time to diagnose the issue and put the plan in place. But it's taking them 18
months to get to where it needs to be.
As I look at that and make that analogy relative to some of our other markets, different markets are in different places.
So if I compare on one hand to the U.S., I've said the U.S. is more challenged and we've been suffering for a lot longer
period of time. And I think 18 months would be great if we got it done in 18 months. My sense is it's going to take
longer. It's hard to put a quarter on when we're going to have that fixed, but it would be more challenging in 18 months.
On the other hand, if I look at a situation in, say, Russia where we had a blip, we know what we're doing there. We're
getting back on track. It's less of a challenge. So I think we have to look at that through the lens of where we're starting
from. The point I wanted to make and the reason I wanted to provide that example is I wanted to share with you the
importance of sequencing and that it starts with having the right people in the right job and collectively having the
management team, then the discipline of execution.
And we really, really need to be disciplined in the field, and that's where we're focusing and that will drive
Representative engagement. Once we do that, then we can start looking at new things and bringing new things into the
business. But we need to make sure that we have that fundamental capability in place. And so it will range with some
markets getting there faster, and some might take a little bit longer.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: Okay. And my follow-up question is on Avon.com. It seems to me that in the past, the
website was supposed to allow the Reps to make commission, even if they weren't directly involved with the sale or the
choices that consumers made. So what's different about what you're rolling out now?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah. So one of the things we've seen is we've been back and forth in terms of how we
handle the website. So in some cases, we've said, you have to be attached to a Representative. Other places, we allowed
people to come in and we weren't consistent. The one learning that I had is that we did not really communicate this to
the Representatives in a way that shows them and enables them to earn from it.
And so bringing in our top sales leaders, we've done focus groups, we've done webinars. They've actually helped us
with how we can communicate to the Representatives because in some cases, people were concerned about channel
conflict. And now what we're saying to them is, if you have five customers that you sell to face-to-face, you're going to
get a commission from that. If you have five people that live far away, some of your family members and they want to
order from you, they can come on to your website and you can still get a commission. So you're going to earn more
money because you are able to touch more customers. And explaining that to them and helping them go through that
and learning from them in terms of what works and what doesn't work will help them drive their earnings opportunity.
At the same time, it enables us to do a lot more with social media, digital advertising and really modernize our business
and hopefully bring in new Representatives and perhaps younger Representatives who may want to only participate just
online and not do face-to-face. So that's how we're looking at it for the long term.
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Steve R. Powers>: Yes. Hi. It's UBS. Hey, Sheri just going back again to the three critical success factors that
you mentioned at the start of the call, management, processes, Representative engagement. I think those items makes
sense, but how do you measure and assess them?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yes.

<Q - Steve R. Powers>: I understand that you don't want to provide a scorecard market by market, but I'm more
interested in sort of the basic thought process. I think you said leadership was right in about 75% of your markets.
Processes are right at about half. I'm not sure what your grade was on Representative engagement, if you can provide
that, that'd be great. But again, more, just how are you measuring those items? And what benchmarks, whether internal
or external, you're really using to arrive at those numbers?
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Right. So as we talked about from the management perspective, we actually did a thorough
assessment of the management team. So we looked at four critical positions in those top-12 countries, and we used an
outside group to help us with learning agility of the leaders. We did 360-degree feedback. We did interviews with the
broader management team, and we had help. We have external assessment, internal assessment and then our human
resources team put together an overall perspective on each market.
So we can see what the performance and the capability of the individual but we can also look at how they operate as a
team. So that allowed us to look at the top 12 markets and go through it person by person, frankly. And we have coding
to be able to understand how they perform or what their potential is. So that allowed us to get to that 75% number.
And then as we went through execution piece, we looked at it relative to two critical processes. It was the commercial
marketing piece of it as well as the field management. I will admit that that's a little bit more subjective. But what we
looked was consistency of performance, how they are performing based on what they said they were going to be able to
do relative to attracting Representatives, retaining Representatives in the case of field management.
In commercial marketing, we've been looking at their average order, how they were able to actually deal with pricing
capabilities. And so those were the criteria that we used from that standpoint and looked at it on a consistency basis.
And then on Rep engagement, we look at it really in terms of were they showing trends relative to improving the Rep
engagement? Were they going backwards or were they flat? And so that's where I said we really had mixed result.
So hopefully, that gives you a perspective. So it was a combination of internal assessment with some help of some
external assessment, particularly on the talent side.
<Q - Steve R. Powers>: Okay. That does help. Thanks. And I know you don't want to give specific guidance, but I was
wondering if you could just help us further dimension the kind of improved performance that you expect to see in the
second half. Should we expect it more in terms of improved revenue performance, more on the margin? And maybe
you could just help frame those moving parts, at least broadly, qualitatively by business segment. That'd be great.
Thanks.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Yeah. So as we said, we expect growth in the second half, both in the top line as well as in
the bottom line. For the full year, we expect to have margin improvement, but I think the top line will remain
challenging. We're not going to break out the amount of it or I'm not going to break out by region. But clearly, what we
need to see is some improvement coming through in Latin America, particularly led by Mexico and Brazil.
<Q - Steve R. Powers>: Thank you.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante. Please state your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: Thank you. Consumer Edge Research. My question has to do with if you can reconcile three
issues. One, the margin progress is slow. Then you've these very tough macro environment, particularly in Latin
America. And then the fact that some of the findings that you mentioned in the UK requires spending. One is more
face-to-face time with the Reps; the other is compensation. So how all that goes together with the fact that you are
maintaining your margin goal of double digits by 2016? How that comes together? Because it seems very difficult.

<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: I think a couple of things. I mean first of all, if we start with, for example, the UK,
spending more face-to-face time with the Representatives, be it the UK, the U.S. or any other markets, I think Pablo
would tell you that in the U.S., we think it's important also to have that more contact points with the Representatives
does not necessarily mean you need to spend more money. It means, in some cases, that we just need to have more
efficient or effective programs in place and more outreach programs. It does not necessarily equate to more money.
The macro environment, obviously, we've had some hiccups with macro environment. It's not just Avon. Obviously, it's
impacting everyone. We'll see how that plays out. These things tend to be dynamic. They don't necessarily even occur
in the same place.
But with that said, we're also taking the steps to make sure that we have the right product in the portfolio during a time
like that. And also, we're focusing on making sure that we get our pricing right, and that's not always something that we
can react to immediately. But is it something, as we've been improving our pricing capabilities, that we make sure that
we're pricing in some of the changes that are impacting us like foreign exchange going forward. And additionally, with
regards to margin, we're continuing to focus on cost and getting additional cost out of the business. But with that said,
we obviously need to get the top line going, also.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: But my follow-up – this is my follow-up then is, in the case of the U.S. particularly, you
eliminated a layer of management or reduced it, which is the district sales managers, who were the ones doing the face
time with the Reps. And we see what happened. So what you need to do to restore the U.S. to at least stabilize it?
Wouldn't it require rehiring some of the people that you just laid off and that in, itself, is an investment? Thank you.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: So we still have 800 district sales managers in the U.S. who are very important to our
business. We also have a significantly larger number of sales leaders in the leadership program. And by the way, they
do most of the recruiting. And so when we're talking about face-to-face, it's important for the district sales managers to
help with the recruiting and to support the sales leaders. But the sales leaders are also doing a lot of the recruiting.
What we need to do in the U.S. is make sure that we are spending the time – first of all, making it easy for her to come
online is she's signing up to do business with us. That the sales leaders and the district sales managers have the tools to
actually spend time and energy with the new Representatives instead of dealing with other issues. So making sure that
we're taking more challenging things of their plates so that they can help the new Representatives be successful because
we know if they make it through the first six campaigns, we have a much more likelihood of success for the future. So
it's more around making sure we're activating the field, supporting them. And we have plenty of people to help bring in
new Representatives. Thanks.

Your final question will come from the line of Linda Bolton Weiser. Please state your affiliation, then pose your
question.
<Q - Linda Bolton Weiser>: Hi. B. Riley. Could you perhaps update us on the progress to-date of the $400 million
cost-cutting program. Maybe you could give us how much in cost reduction this year to-date, and then also cumulative
to-date for the whole program. And then with regard to your comments on still targeting organic sales growth in second
half – I know you don't want to get into giving a lot of guidance. But is it safe to assume that the growth would be
stronger in fourth quarter, and do you think that there will be growth in the third quarter or that it'll be down in the third
quarter and then some growth in the fourth quarter? Thank you.
<A - Sherilyn S. McCoy>: So I know you'd love me to give you more color on quarter-by-quarter. Unfortunately,
we're not going to give more on that at the moment. And then if I talk about the cost savings, so in total, what we've
taken in restructuring charges so far is $210 million to $220 million in charges that we've taken with related charges – I
mean savings of about $250 million to $260 million on a run rate basis. And then there're other savings that we've
achieved that don't require restructuring charges, so be it some of the things that we've talked about with regards to
sourcing and indirect costs that we have been reducing down some of the costs there. And so there's an additional

not. So – and we will update you as we go with regards to the total amount.
