Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Third-quarter earnings per
share from continuing operations was $1.49. This is an increase of $0.12 sequentially and is $0.20 higher when
compared to the same quarter last year, and represents increases of 9% and 16% respectively.
Third quarter revenue of $12.6 billion increased 4.9% sequentially. Pre-tax operating income increased 7.1%
sequentially, while pre-tax operating margins improved 45 basis points to 22.2%.
Sequential highlights by product group were as follows. Reservoir Characterization revenue of $3.2 billion increased
2.9% while margin improved by 29 basis points to 30%. This growth was driven by a very strong performance in
Testing Services, improved WesternGeco Q-Marine utilization, and an increase in SIS software sales. These increases
were offset in part by lower multiclient sales.
Drilling Group revenue of $4.8 billion increased 3.6%, and margins improved by 60 basis points to 21.7%. These
increases were largely attributable to robust drilling and measurement activity in offshore North America, Latin
America and Russia, and strong IPM activity in Mexico. The second quarter acquisition of Saxon also contributed to
the revenue growth.
Production Group revenue of $4.7 billion increased 8.1%. This growth was led by Well Services, largely as a result of
the rebound from the spring break-up in Canada and a strong performance on U.S. land. An increase in Completion
product sales in Latin America and the Middle East and Asia, and expanding Artificial Lift sales in North America also
contributed to the growth. Margin expanded by 158 basis points to 18.3% primarily as a result of the rebound from the
Canadian spring break-up as well as from improved efficiency and recovery of logistical costs in Well Services.
Now, turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate was 22.1% in the third quarter compared to 21.7% in
the previous quarter.
During the quarter, we generated $3.1 billion of cash flow from operations. For the first nine months of this year, we
have generated $7.3 billion of cash flow from operations. This compares to $6.6 billion for the same nine months of
2013.
As we mentioned, starting last quarter, we began to report SPM investment separately in our cash flow statement,
similar to the way we report CapEx and multiclient. While this change has no impact on our free cash flow, it does
result in an increase in the amount of cash flow from operations that we report. The 2013 cash flow from operations
figures has been restated to reflect this change.
Net debt decreased $221 million during the quarter to $5.8 billion. Significant liquidity events during the quarter
included $1.5 billion of stock repurchases, $519 million of dividend payments, and $980 million of CapEx, excluding
multiclient and SPM. During the quarter, we repurchased 13.9 million shares at an average price of $108.41.
CapEx excluding multiclient and SPM is still expected to be approximately $3.8 billion in 2014 as compared to the
$3.9 billion we spent in 2013.
And now I will turn the conference call over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard
Thank you, Simon, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results set a new record for Schlumberger, driven by
North America and further backed by robust international performance. In the international markets, growth was led by
Latin America and Europe, CIS and Africa, in spite of headwinds in Russia and Libya, while Middle East and Asia
proved highly resilient in the face of a significant slowdown in Northern Iraq.

Third quarter revenue grew 5% sequentially and 9% year-on-year while pre-tax operating income increased 7%
sequentially and 12% year-on-year. Several factors contributed to this performance including continued market
penetration of new technologies that helped further drive our international margins as well as margin gains in North
America from operational efficiency and market share improvements.
Overall, our performance demonstrated the advantage of size and the benefit of a broad technology offering and
operational footprint while providing further proof of our leadership in technology, reliability, efficiency and
integration.
In terms of our financial performance, we generated more than $1.8 billion in free cash flow in the third quarter,
bringing the year-to-date total up to $3.7 billion. This represents a 29% increase over the comparable period in 2013,
and a conversion of 93% of our third quarter earnings into free cash flow.
Based on our improved ability to generate free cash, we continued our active stock buyback program during the
quarter, buying back $1.5 billion of stock, which puts us firmly on track to complete our $10 billion buyback program
within the stated two-and-a-half year period.
Looking at the operating areas, our North American results set the new record with revenue up 9% sequentially and
18% year-over-year, while margins increased by 137 basis points to reach 19.4%. This is in spite of headwinds from
heavy rainfall in the Permian Basin that limited land activity in the U.S., loop currents that slowed offshore activity in
the Gulf of Mexico, and very low multiclient seismic sales.
In Canada, activity rebounded well after the spring break-up in the second quarter, and this together with a further
increase in land activity in the U.S. helped generate record land revenue representing a 9% increase sequentially. Much
of this increase came from hydraulic fracturing operations where stage counts were higher, where we also obtained
improved cost recovery from our customers and where we saw strong performance from our supply chain and
distribution organization following the challenges we experienced in Q2.
Offshore revenue improved by 12% sequentially driven by strong activity in Eastern Canada and by market share gains
in drilling services in the Gulf of Mexico. North America also benefited from further growth and expansion of our
Artificial Lift business, and I will return to this growth initiative later in the call.
Our international business posted strong results again in the third quarter with a 3% sequential increase in revenue and
with pre-tax operating margin expanding 55 basis points to 24.6%, which is the highest level seen in five years in spite
of the geopolitical headwinds experienced in Russia, Northern Iraq and Libya.
Compared to the third quarter of last year, international revenue was up 5% on the back of strong growth in key
markets in Latin America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Australia, and with strong
incremental margins at 50%.
In terms of pricing, the international market remains highly competitive for basic services and we see no sign of any
general pricing inflection. However, we continue to be able to drive effective pricing through sale of new and unique
technology together with continued growth in integration and performance-based contracts. This combination puts us in
a very strong competitive position, which we continue to leverage to drive market share gains and expand operating
margins.
Within the international areas, revenue in Latin America was up by a strong 10% sequentially, with margins increasing
to 21.9%, and with all GeoMarkets recording growth. Compared to the third quarter last year, Latin America revenue
was up 5% driven by Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador, with moderate growth in Mexico and lower
revenues in Brazil.
Pre-tax operating income also increased year-over-year, driven by strong activity throughout our broad and diverse
contracts portfolio, as well as through careful cost and resource management.
In Argentina, strong sequential growth was driven by rig-based activity for development of both conventional and
unconventional resources. Customers are now seeing clear results from applying our industry-leading shale workflows

and technologies in terms of both increased production and greater efficiency. In Mexico, revenue grew on higher IPM
project work on land, resolution of the social issues related to our project in the south in addition to stronger deepwater
activity.
As the energy reform continues to move ahead, we won a significant multi-year contract to build and manage the
National Data Repository, and to prepare data rooms that will be needed for the country's first public oil tenders next
year.
In Venezuela, activity increased further in the third quarter, supported by strong uptake of new technology, while
payments continue to be made in line with the signed agreements.
In Europe, CIS and Africa, revenue grew 1% sequentially while margins improved by 132 basis points to 23.4%, as
exploration activity strengthened in Angola and new projects started in other parts of Sub-Saharan Africa. Compared to
the same quarter last year, revenue grew by 4% and margins were up by 103 basis points.
Activity in Russia benefited from a strong summer season, particularly offshore Sakhalin and in the Arctic, but growth
was tempered by the impact of international sanctions. Earlier in the third quarter, we announced the likely effects of
sanctions on our results in Russia, and this ultimately translated into a $0.02 impact coming from restructuring costs to
remain in compliance and some impact from activity and a weaker ruble.
In other parts of the Europe, CIS and Africa area, activity was mixed in the North Sea with increased software sales in
the UK, but lower activity in Norway as peak seismic and drilling activity ended. In North Africa, significant
operational delays were experienced in Algeria and activity slowed in Tunisia ahead of the November election.
Operations in Libya continues to be challenging with a very complex security situation and with activity remaining at
the minimal level. We are currently carefully evaluating our operational structure in the country and will resize
resources in accordance with the 2015 activity outlook. On the positive side, however, we remain active offshore, and
we continue to have a constructive view on the long-term potential of the country.
In the Middle East and Asia area, revenue was essentially flat with the previous quarter, with margins stable at 27.6%
as growth in Saudi Arabia and Oman offset lower revenue in Iraq and India, and with activity in Asia largely
unchanged from the second quarter. Year-on-year revenue increased by 6% and margins grew by 149 basis points.
In the Middle East, activity growth was strongest in Saudi Arabia with new rigs mobilizing, exploration activity
strengthening and development drilling increasing. We have added resources to match the additional work in the
country and we expect to see further increases in activity as more drilling rigs are added and rigless activity continue to
expand. We also saw solid growth in Oman with strong Artificial Lift product sales and market share gains in drilling
services.
Elsewhere in the Middle East, activity was lower in India on lower product sales and the effects of the monsoon season.
Activity was also lower in Northern Iraq as unrest in the area increased and forced a complete shutdown of our
operations for part of the third quarter. The security situation has improved more recently and rigs are slowly returning
to work.
In Southern Iraq, there was no security impact on operations in the third quarter, but activity remains lower compared
to the same quarter last year as new contract awards continue to be delayed. With government approvals and new
contract awards still pending, we do not expect any significant improvement in activity in the near-term.
Southeast Asia revenue was also flat for the second quarter as activity slowdowns in Australia and lack of exploration
success in Malaysia and Thailand were offset by stronger activity in Vietnam, marine seismic work in Brunei, and
improved product sales in other Asian GeoMarkets. China saw sequential growth in shale gas development on land,
together with continuing strong activity offshore in Bohai Bay. Elsewhere in China, activity continue to be slow and we
did not see further growth until our customers' spending plans become clearer.
I would now like to update you on the progress we have made in our Artificial Lift business since we outline our
growth strategy for this market in New York in June. First, in addition to our existing basin coverage in North America

established through an active M&A program over the past year, we have in the third quarter completed several new
acquisitions to further expand our operational footprint in Canada.
Second, in line with our goal of optimizing cost efficiency and reliability, we have injected additional supply chain,
engineering and manufacturing capabilities to our rod lift organization to drive additional value from design, quality
assurance, sourcing and distribution.
Third, in order to address the growing market for life-of-well lift solutions in the unconventional market, we have
combined all Schlumberger Artificial Lift technologies in North America into a single organization that will cover ESP,
PCP, gas lift, and rod lift systems. This has given us one customer-facing organization with a complete technical
portfolio capable of recognizing business opportunities throughout the entire spectrum of the Artificial Lift market.
Integration of the various components of this organization is progressing very well with our ultimate goal being to offer
our customers a complete range of industry-leading technology together with best-in-class local service. We remain on
track to sell more than 7,000 pump jacks and installing over 5,000 PCPs in 2014 in North America. And through the
careful execution of our growth strategy over the past year, we have now firmly assumed a leadership position in the
global Artificial Lift market.
I would also like to give you a progress report of the transformation program we outlined in New York, where we are
already starting to change the way we manage our people, our assets and our inventory to further improve our financial
performance.
In Southeast Asia, we concluded the successful piloting of a centralized asset management and maintenance facility for
our Wireline product line, reducing the downhole tool fleet by more than 30% compared to the previous level required
to service the region. The surplus of assets that this initiative created have already been redeployed to capture new
business opportunities and support growth in other regions. And our Wireline product line is in the process of
expanding this model to other areas.
We have also extended the coverage of our regional distribution centers to new areas in South America, resulting in an
average 10% reduction in spares on hand versus 2013 for the product lines currently involved.
Worldwide coverage for spares distribution will be achieved in the coming months with the creation of a third
distribution center in Rotterdam.
Implementation of revised job execution and competency assurance processes also continues, and is already showing
notable reliability improvements. In Wireline, the systematic deployment on new standard road constructions has
already in 2013 produced a 30% reduction in customer nonproductive time compared to last year.
Turning now to the economic environment, the outlook for global GDP growth softened somewhat during the third
quarter on weaker data from Europe and China also leading to a slight downwards revision of the absolute oil demand
outlook.
Given the strength of the U.S. economy and the ongoing efforts to stimulate and manage growth in Europe and China,
we continue to believe that the slow but steady recovery in the world economy is still intact, and that the overall oil
demand situation is largely unchanged.
While market sentiments are currently driven by fear of short-term oversupply due to the continued growth in North
America production, we still see the supply situation as relatively well balanced given the continued challenges in the
non-NAM, non-OPEC production base, lack of growth in OPEC sustainable production capacity maintaining tightness
in OPEC spare capacity, and with the continued geopolitical risks in several key producers.
We therefore expect Brent to recover and stabilize when and at a level that is deemed appropriate by the main oil
producers. The key to the overall oil market is still that the global oil demand is currently set to increase by 1.1 million
barrels per day in 2015, which will require growth in E&P investments.

Where the growth in E&P investments will take place will be a function of what level the oil price stabilizes at, and
where a lower oil price will likely lead to more the investment taking place in lower operating cost environments.
For natural gas, markets remained comfortably supplied although we see upward pricing trends in Asia-Pacific and
Europe as winter approaches. Based on this macro setting, which continues to include a mix of economic and
geopolitical headwinds and tailwinds, we maintained a long-term view that we outlined in June in New York believing
in continued solid demand for our products, services and expertise.
We also firmly believe that opportunities exist for differentiated growth through new technology and greater integration
and that the transformational impact of our reliability and efficiency programs will further support and accelerate our
financial outperformance.
That concludes my remarks. Thank you. We will now open up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Your
line is open.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Yeah. Thank you very much, and excellent execution. I have a few questions on various
technologies, but I think that I'm going to leave that for now. Probably on everybody's mind right now is the oil balance
and the tipping point in oil and where we stand, the volatility has been tremendous. I think everybody's confused about
what level of CapEx will be required given what's going on. And you opened Pandora's Box about talking about spare
capacity and how you see it. So I wonder whether you could just expand a little bit about what gives you confidence?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I think if you look at what the sentiments in the market are today, it is obviously driven
by the fear of oversupply. But if we go back to the status of the global economy, yes, there was a downward revision in
GDP growth outlook, but this was only slightly. We are still looking at 2.7% and 3.2% growth in GDP in 2014 and
2015. And this is only 0.2% down for both years. So like I said, the overall slow but steady recovery in the global
economy, we believe is still intact.
Now, if you then look at the demand side, there was a corresponding downward revision of the oil demand for both
2014 and 2015, but the key here is to look at the absolute demand because the IEA for 2014 changed both the 2013
actual demand and the updated 2014 demand. So if you look at the 2014 absolute demand, it is still at the February
level and only 0.2 million barrels a day down from the July peak. And the 2015 absolute demand is now 93.5 million
barrels, which is still 1.1 million barrels a day up. So based on this, we see the demand side of the oil market also has
more or less unchanged.
So then what's left is to look at the real supply situation, and we don't think that has changed dramatically in terms of
fundamental supply capacity since Q2 as well. And that's because there is lack of growth in OPEC sustainable
production capacity. And actually if you look at the IEA report, the OPEC sustainable production capacity is actually
down 800,000 barrels a day in September of 2014 versus last year. There is also continued weakness in non-NAM
non-OPEC production, and there is still geopolitical risk related to both Libya and Iraq. So based on this, we see the
overall supply picture as more or less unchanged as well versus Q2.
So with the growth in demand for next year, we believe that there has to be increased spending levels. And where this
spending is going to take place, I think, is going to be a function of where the oil price stabilizes. At a lower oil price,
we believe that more these investments will take place in lower operating cost environments. And if the oil price
stabilizes back at the levels we saw earlier this year, then we might continue with a similar picture next year that as we
had this year. So that's our overall view.

<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: So to summarize, Paal, you believe that the spare capacity in the global system today is going
down for the next two years?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I would say, at least it's not going up. So far this year it's been flat. When more
production is offered into the market, it is at the expense of the spare capacity.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Bill Herbert with Simmons & Co. Your line is open.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Thanks. Good morning. Paal, I was hoping you could frame, in light of your macro
outlook, perceived international opportunities and threats or headwinds and tailwinds, if you will? And how that, at
least conceptually, coalesces into an outlook for next year? I mean, the market of late seems to have been unduly
focused on the prominent threats. And then moreover, also if you could comment on margins as well, I was struck by
how resilient your Eastern Hemisphere margins were in light of the dislocations that unfolded in the third quarter?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Okay. Well, if I first start off with the second part of your question, I mean, we are very
pleased with the performance of our international business including Latin America. So year-to-date, international
revenue is up by 5%, which is outgrowing the growth in E&P spend in the international market. And our operating
income is up 15% with incremental margins of 66%. So today our margin stands internationally at 24.6%, which is the
highest level we've seen since the 2008 pre-financial crisis peak.
And I think it's important to note this as well that about 80% of our global operating income growth so far in 2014 is
actually generated in the international market on a relatively low growth in E&P spend. So if you look at what
happened in 2014, like you say, there was a good mix of tailwinds and headwinds. And if you look at the tailwinds this
year, in terms of geographies, it's been Argentina, Ecuador, Sub-Saharan Africa, Saudi and UAE. In terms of the type
of basins, it's been land and conventional offshore that's been driving the growth. And in terms of customer groups, it's
been independents and NOCs.
Now, if you look at the flip side for the headwinds, geographically it's been Brazil, Mexico, Libya, Russia, Iraq and
China. In terms of the basins, it's been deepwater and exploration, and in particular seismic. And also in customer
groups, it's been the IOCs going from solid growth to flat spending in 2014. Now, these headwinds will make up
around $1.1 billion of full-year revenue reduction for us versus 2013. So looking at our full-year revenue growth for
2014 in the international market, it's going to be around 5%, and that includes absorbing all these significant
headwinds. And we have managed this growth at the same time as we have expanded margins by about 200 basis
points and, as I mentioned, very strong incrementals. So it really demonstrates the strength and the earnings growth
resilience we have in our international business.
Now, if you look at 2015, we expect that we will continue to see a mix of headwinds and tailwinds in the international
market. The tailwinds may not be as strong depending on where the E&P spend levels off, but several of the headwinds
will largely diminish as well. Brazil and Mexico are likely to be tailwinds next year, and deepwater exploration as well
as Libya, Iraq, China, should also be less of a drag than what we saw this year. So that really leaves Russia and Asia as
the main headwinds that we're going to be facing, and the overall balance will become clearer in these two regions in
Q4. So still we expect to see strong earnings growth from our international business also in 2015.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Very good. Thank you, sir.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thanks.

<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Good morning, guys. Let me move to North America if I could. Your market share gains you
mentioned in the Gulf of Mexico and the 12% revenue growth were impressive considering that we've all been reading
and hearing about loop currents and weather, and you guys had warned about weather. Can you talk to us a little bit
about your mix, your customer mix, and the other things that are allowing you to do so well in the Gulf of Mexico?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I think, again, Jim, we have a broad portfolio, we have a good balance in the Gulf of
Mexico between characterization drilling and production. Our offshore business in North America also includes a very
strong position offshore Eastern Canada, which was also quite strong in Q3. But we were impacted by the loop
currents. But at the same time, we have a sizable business, and while some rigs were shut down for this, there were a
number of rigs continuing to operate without any impact. So when you have a certain size on some of these events, it's
easier to absorb them as you go forward.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Impressive. And my follow-up if I could, I agree with you completely on the outlook for
spending and the need to maintain current production. But, clearly, U.S. independent spend-off off cash flow, and so
that puts the U.S. activity probably most at risk. I guess my question is, is there a risk that pressure pumping pricing in
a slower market should crashes again like it did a couple of years ago, or have we had enough capital discipline in the
industry that that's not likely to happen?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, it's a good question. I think it's going to be a function of activity, of course, right? So like
you say, we agree that the 2015 activity, it's too early to say what's going to happen. But it is clearly going to be a
function of the level of free cash flow for the E&Ps which was already negative in general at a WTI of $90. And the
key going forward is going to be the continued borrowing capacity. So there's really two scenarios here that we end up
with a lower WTI, further cost inflation in the E&P value chain and reduced borrowing capacity, and this will likely
have an impact on the spending growth rates.
On the flip side, if we see a recovery of the WTI and also we see a limited cost inflation in the E&P value chain, I think
these are the factors that would support further spending growth. But looking at pressure pumping pricing, it's going to
be a function of the activity levels and how much horsepower capacity has been ordered in the past couple of quarters.
And I believe that there's a fair bit already on order. So if the spending growth is impacted, I think it can quickly put
pressure on frac pricing including both sand and transportation as well.

Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of James West with ISI Group. Your line is open.
<Q - James West>: Hey. Good morning, Paal.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<Q - James West>: In the release and your remarks, I was struck by how many times you highlighted strength in
deepwater activity and strong exploration activity, particularly in deepwater drilling. It seems like there's a big debate
in the market right now about deepwater. How do you see that activity evolving over the next year or two?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: For deepwater?
<Q - James West>: Yes.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I think if you look at first the deepwater rig supply, it was at a record high in Q3. At the
same time, the number of stacked rigs continue to increase and there's a further 10-year rigs plan for delivery in Q4. So
I think it's very clear that we are in an oversupply situation of deepwater rigs at this stage.
Now, if you look at deepwater drilling, which is really where we make most of our revenue, this year we expect to see a
6% decline in drilling rig activity for deepwater. Now, this decline is mainly driven by Brazil, which is down over 30%
and partially offset by the Gulf of Mexico and West Africa. So when you exclude Brazil, deepwater drilling is actually
up about 3% versus 2013. So looking forward to 2015, we see flattish deepwater drilling activity in 2015, generally

supported by lower rig rates. So we have weathered, I think, a fairly significant deepwater decline this year, and we
expect it to be more or less flattish going forward into next year.
<Q - James West>: Okay. One follow-up if I may. A lot of the commentary was around deepwater exploratory wells.
Has your number or percentage of wells that you're working on in deepwater on the exploration side, has that
decreased? Is it steady? Is it increasing?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, if you look at the overall exploration market and the exploration spend, we expect now
that the 2014 exploration spend will be down 4% to 5% versus last year. And this spend reduction is mainly led by
seismic, which will be down more than 20% while the exploration drilling is only slightly down. So I would say that
the market is down overall, but the main driver for the reduction in exploration spend is predominately seismic.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita with UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Thanks. Good morning, guys, and nice to see that big $1.5 billion buyback.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Thanks. So as a follow-up to one of the earlier questions on pressure pumping and just the
thoughts about North America and obviously its influx, I do believe that Schlumberger was considering building
incremental newbuild capacity for 2015 as the market – given the market dynamics. How do you feel on that now? Is
that on hold? Are you still thinking that the market – what are your thoughts?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, we have a fairly sizeable pressure pumping business, which is including both North
America and international. So we have made some orders for new pumps. We still have some pumps left in the idle
asset program. But we made some orders for new pumps, but at a level that it doesn't really worry me. These new
pumps will be distributed in between North America and international, and we've had fairly significant growth, both in
Argentina and Saudi Arabia over the past six months to 12 months. So the orders that we have made is generally what
we want to have on order in terms of long lead items to make sure that we can cover the business in any eventuality.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Okay. That's fair enough. And then if you think – I mean, I know obviously the Middle East is
very strong, particularly the Saudis, but just in theoretically, where do you think Brent needs to be before the Saudis
would start to – and the Middle East overall, excluding Iraq, of course, where do you think Brent would need to be for
them to begin to slow their drilling activities, where they start to become uncomfortable? I know obviously they're
drilling both for gas and for oil.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I'm not going to make any predictions at what level the Saudis would change what
they're doing. We have a very strong business in Saudi Arabia. Growth has been very strong this year. And as of now
we continue to expect solid growth in Saudi Arabia next year as well.

Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Michael LaMotte with Guggenheim. Your line is open.
<Q - Michael LaMotte>: Thanks, and good morning. Paal, you mentioned the potential for inflation in frac value
chain in U.S. onshore. And I was just curious, given that most of that is now being driven by sand and the
transportation and distribution related to sand, how is that impacting the market for highway and broadband?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I think there's no real impact from these things in particular to broadband and highway. I
think the escalating cost of transportation and sand at this stage, I think, is something that all the players are looking to
pass onto the customers. I think there's going to be a limit to how much of these additional cost escalations that our
customers are prepared to take given their free cash flow situation and also given the drop in oil prices. But there's no

relative impact on these cost escalations on either broadband or highway.
<Q - Michael LaMotte>: Well, I was thinking more from a marketing standpoint if the sand availability would
actually push customers to look for productivity improving alternatives such as highway and Brent proppant?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Okay. Fair enough. So, yes, we do use less sand in highway in particular. So that is obviously a
selling point. But it's more a function of what the philosophy of the customer is, do they want to go with a slickwater
frac, which generally now has a lot higher volume of proppant, or do they go to more of a cross-linked or highway type
of frac in which case the proppant volume is significantly less.
<Q - Michael LaMotte>: And are you seeing a shift in trend, one versus the other materially over the last couple of
quarters?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Not materially. Highway continues to do very well, and I'm actually very pleased with how
broadband is going. Broadband at this stage of its introduction is growing significantly faster than what highway did
back in 2011, 2012. And we are now continuing to engage in broadband, I would say, presentations and broadband
sales and information at the sea level of our customers. So we engage at that level to establish a very clear
understanding of what this technology brings, and also to try to agree on pilot programs and evaluation of these pilot
programs over a period of time.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead with RBC. Your line is open.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hey. Good morning.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hey. So, Paal, thanks for all this color. I wanted to follow-up in particular on two things. You
mentioned cost recovery dynamics that have been underway, I think, in the North American market. Do you feel that
you're at a point now where you'll be able to get some net margin accretion going forward, or is it still just offsets to the
cost inflation?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: So I still think we're generally looking – in terms of price increases with our customers, we are
generally looking to recover the cost inflation that we're seeing. Like we said before, we believe that the main way of
driving margins in the North America pressure pumping business will be through efficiency and through introduction
of new technologies that increases production or lowers costs or improves efficiencies. So the main focus that we have
now is to pass on the cost inflation that we have from our supply chain to our customers. And like I said, given the state
of the free cash flow and where the oil price is, I think the appetite from our customers will be lower in terms of how
much of the further cost increases they are willing to take.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Right. And then the second dynamic was in terms of the Libya – I'm assuming Russia and Libya,
Iraq challenges that occurred internally across the third quarter that resulted in that announcement that the earnings
would be impacted by $0.02 or $0.03 and the commentary you made about it being a $0.02 impact in particular, what
kind of lingering effects do you expect from those – from Russia and maybe Libya going out into the fourth quarter?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, if you look at Q4 as a whole, this year we expect a sequential growth in earnings per
share probably around $0.05 to $0.07, that's our target. This is somewhat lower than the sequential increases we
normally see in Q4. And there's really two primary reasons for that. One, as you allude to, we expect to see continued
impact from the situations in Libya, Iraq and Russia, and in particular the ruble effect in Russia is potentially going to
be higher in Q4 than what we saw in Q3. The second main factor is the cost focus that our customers have which is
likely going to lead to lower levels of year-end sales including both software products, but in particular multiclient. Still
the base business should continue to be solid, driven by both North America, Latin America and the Middle East, but
somewhat lower sequential growth in earnings per share in Q4 this year than what we normally see.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Sanchez with Howard Weil. Your line is open.
<Q - William D. Sanchez>: Thank you. Paal, I wanted to come back and get your thoughts on Libya. I think one of the
things that's been a surprise to many is how much supply growth we've seen in that region at a time when it seems like
you and others are really contracting in the area and there's very little service activity going on. Just given your macro
thoughts so far during the call, what do you view in terms of sustainability of Libyan production here given this
ramp-down in activity? And I guess what's the trigger point for you to make a decision on whether or not you start to
cut head count there, and is that strictly going to be just on the land side, or is that going to be offshore as well?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, that's a good question. So in terms of our resource base, that's something that we
continue to look at in any country that we're in. Offshore, we are currently operating on one rig. There might be another
couple of rigs added in the next couple of quarters. But that's not a significant part of the head count that is related to
the offshore activity. The main head count is focused on the land business, and the land business is, as I said, at the
minimal level. So we are currently looking at what the outlook for 2015 is.
Q3 of 2014 is about 50% down in activity in Libya compared to what we saw in Q3 of last year. And that low activity,
in our mind, if it's not changed, would obviously have an impact on the sustainable production capacity of Libya going
forward. So the fact that Libya, which I think in OPEC now is listed as about, I think about 900,000 barrels a day of
sustainable capacity. The fact that they go from 200,000 barrels a day to 900,000 a day over a period of time is not
surprising. I think the key here is how sustainable is that when the level of work is currently very low. I think it will
take some time before it is impacted, but obviously the key to maintain that production capacity is to continuously
invest into it.
<Q - William D. Sanchez>: Fair enough. My follow-up would be, you mentioned Brazil now as a tailwind for next
year. Just curious, I know there's a Wireline Services contract that's pending I guess. Can you talk about timing on that?
And would that be incremental to Schlumberger, or is that strictly just a re-tender here of an existing contract?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, for Brazil, the two main contracts that have been out for tender recently has been the
Wireline Services, one, and the directional drilling LWD contract. We maintained the market share we had in both
contracts. We had the largest lots in Wireline, and the middle lots in drilling and measurement, which we see as good
because it basically prevents us from having any significant mobilization or demobilization costs which are always key
to the profitability of these type of contracts. And both of those contracts we got quite reasonable price increases while
we maintained our market share. So activity wise and market share wise, no change for us, but the pricing and really no
additional cost of mobilizing or demobilizing. So I would say that these contracts are incremental to Schlumberger in
2015. I expect the contracts to be finalized over the next couple of quarters.

<Q - Jeff Tillery>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: Talking about the exploration oriented results for you all, obviously seismic is down. But in the
release, in several times, success in Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa specifically, has been a tailwind for margins. Just
given the customer degree of exploration success this year, how does that impact your view of, say, the next 12 months
to 15 months just specifically in terms of how it could impact the ECA region?

<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Okay. That's a good question. So I agree with you, the exploration success, both in 2013 and
2014 has been relatively poor, which I think is part of the reason why a number of customers are taking a step back and
reevaluating their prospects and then how they're going to go about doing this. So like I said, we see exploration spend
this year being down 4% to 5% driven by seismic. But looking towards 2015, we expect exploration spend to be flattish
to only slightly down. And, again, this is going to be driven by seismic. So we continue to see good exploration drilling
activity. And the main thing impacting exploration spend is still going to be seismic next year.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: And the success you're having in kind of bucking the overall trends, how much of the kind of
integration that you all discussed back in June is the driving force in that?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I think the impact of the whole range of transformational efforts that we're doing as well
as new technology and as well as our integration capabilities, all of these elements are key factors that allows us to
produce, I would say, outstanding results in particular in the international market. And we expect that strength to
continue to grow and expand going forward as we further implement these transformational programs.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: All right. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jud Bailey with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - Jud E. Bailey>: Thank you. Good morning. Paal, I wanted to ask you about a specific region if I could, well, the
North Sea and Norway. In Norway, you've had Statoil who's starting to scale back activity, and now you add onto that
you've got a little bit lower commodity prices. I'd be curious to know how you see that market playing out, maybe over
the next one year to two years with commodity prices as a headwind and is Statoil kind of suffering through some cost
overruns?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah, in terms of what the commodity price is going to be, I think it's too early to say what
level it's going to be at in 2015. Obviously, there's been a sharp drop over the past two weeks to four weeks. How this is
going to evolve, I think, is still highly uncertain and I still believe that there's going to be some kind of recovery
happening.
Now, relating to the North Sea, we still see low-single-digit growth in activity for our North Sea GeoMarket in 2015.
And you kind of can break that down into three. Firstly, in Norway, we expect to see lower exploration activity and flat
development activity. In the UK, we actually expect to see somewhat higher exploration activity next year and still flat
development activity. And in addition to this, other than North Sea GeoMarket, we continue to manage some of the
remote activities. And there is a strong remote activity next year. We have a project in the Canaries, we have a project
in Cyprus, and we also have a project in Mauritania that we manage out of the North Sea. So overall for that business
unit and the assets and the resources we have in the North Sea, we see still some growth in 2015.
<Q - Jud E. Bailey>: Thank you for the color. And my follow-up is, you noted all the various headwinds and tailwinds
internationally for 2015. It looks like – you've alluded to this, Latin America is poised to finally show a nice recovery.
Knowing what you know today, do you think could – will Latin America be your best growth market in 2015 versus
even the Middle East and Asia?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I think it's still too early to say. But if you look at the trends that we saw in Q3, we are
clearly seeing the recovery of Latin America with good growth in pretty much every GeoMarket. So I'm quite
optimistic about what Latin America can do next year. And one thing is the revenue growth, the other thing is the
pre-tax operating income growth. And I would say for next year, I'm quite optimistic at this stage still on Latin America
in terms of growing earnings and similarly also for Europe, Africa, as well as the Middle East. So those will still, I
think, be the three main drivers of earnings growth in the international market next year.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Handler with Jefferies. Your line is open.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<Q - Brad Handler>: I would like to come back to your Artificial Lift initiatives. Maybe as a grounding for us, can
you ballpark the revenue contribution that you've acquired just in terms of framing for us your starting point from
growth for growth?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I can, but I won't.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Fair enough. I guess, I'm not too surprised at that. Okay. The...
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: If you want to try to make some interpretation, we gave you some numbers on installations of
pump jacks and PCPs. It might not be easily transferable to revenue. But, I mean, it's a – we've had a big program, we
bought a number of smaller companies. And it has a reasonable contribution to North America and also to our overall
Artificial Lift position. But I'm not going to break out and give you a specific revenue number.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Okay. That's fine. I guess, I'd have – and just to keep the follow-up in the same vein, in an
environment where the – if there is a somewhat lower commodity price, what is your sense of the impact on Artificial
Lift, or the production side of the business, maybe a little bit more broadly presumably in the North American market?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, for the overall production business, in the event that activity is down in North America,
any part of the business might have challenges and pressure on pricing. I think, again, where you'll see it the fastest and
the most will likely be in pressure pumping.
In terms of Artificial Lift, we have not seen the same uptick in pricing when activity is very high. And I don't expect to
see the same kind of pressure there as well. But any flattening of growth or reduction in activity will likely have an
impact on pricing in any product line, but I think it's way too early to say, even for North America, whether we will be
in that situation in 2015.

Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Scott Gruber with Citi. Your line is open.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Yes. Good morning. Another scenario, if crude prices stay low, your project management
businesses, both drilling and production should be real key differentiators. How big are those businesses as a
percentage of revenue now? And given the contract backlog, what's the growth outlook for 2015?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yeah. So again, we're not breaking out these numbers, right? Other than that, we've given
some indication of how much our integration-related businesses stuff. Not all project management or production
management. There is – that's any type of integration. But I agree with you. In a more challenging environment, the
ability to take on projects and provide more integration to drive value will be a competitive strength.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: And I believe that there's some flex in how you proceed with your internal transformation
given market dynamics. So if we paint a scenario where upstream CapEx flattens and the expectation is it stays flat for

a few years, can you provide some color on what changes you make to your program and how quickly you think you
can achieve some of your targets realizing that some of them are partially dependent upon customer acceptance of new
tools? But how quickly do you think you can accelerate some of those changes?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, we have some discussion as to what we can accelerate in terms of the implementation,
but some of these things are also based on the overall schedule that you've laid out and things that we have to develop
in order to roll them out. But yes, there is some flexibility of accelerating investment and implementation in terms of
part of the transformation. And these are things we are actually looking at now.
We laid out our financial targets for 2017 in June in New York, and they were predicated on a set of macro and
industry assumptions. And if these assumptions end up being too optimistic, we will see what we can do internally to
still be within the ranges that we've given, or at least close to them, even if the macro assumptions are below. I can't
promise that we will do it, but that's obviously going to be the ambition. So new technology introductions, new
technology sales, and acceleration of transformation programs is going to be key drivers that potentially will allow us
to do that.
