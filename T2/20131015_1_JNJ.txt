MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, and welcome to the Johnson & Johnson Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] This call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator
Instructions]
I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.
Louise Mehrotra
Good morning, and welcome. I'm Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson, and it
is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the third quarter of 2013. Joining me on the call today are
Dominic Caruso, Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer; and Michel Orsinger, Worldwide Chairman,
DePuy Synthes Companies.
A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available to a broader audience via webcast
accessible through the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. I'll begin by briefly reviewing
highlights of the third quarter for the corporation, and highlights for our three business segments. Following my
remarks, Michel will provide an update on our DePuy Synthes business and the progress made on our near-term
priority of successfully integrating Synthes. Please note the presentation that accompanies Michel's remarks is available
on our website. Next, Dominic will provide some additional commentary on the financial results and guidance for
2013. We will then open the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately 90 minutes.

Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is a schedule of sales for key products and/or
businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website as is the
press release.
Before I get into the results, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review may be considered
forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2012 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's
actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today. The company
does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or
developments. The 10-K is available through the company and online.
During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business
performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for GAAP results. Tables
reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the press release and on the
Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com.
Now I would like to review our results for the third quarter of 2013. If you would refer to your copy of the press
release, let's begin with the schedule titled Supplementary Sales Data by geographic area. Worldwide sales to
customers were $17.6 billion for the third quarter of 2013, up 3.1% as compared to the third quarter of 2012. On an
operational basis, sales were up 4.7% and currency had a negative impact of 1.6%.
In the U.S., sales were up 1.7%. In regions outside the U.S. our operational growth was 7.1% while the effect of
currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 2.9 points. Europe grew 8.4% on an operational
basis while the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., grew by 8% operationally. Asia Pacific, Africa region grew
5.1% operationally. The success of new product launches made strong contributions to the results in all regions.
If you'll now turn to the consolidated statement of earnings. Net earnings were $3 billion, consistent with the 2012
results. Earnings per share were $1.04 versus $1.05 a year ago. Please direct your attention to the box section of the
schedule where we have provided earnings adjusted to exclude special items. As a reference in the accompanying table
reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2013 third quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude the after-tax special items of
$937 million primarily related to an increase in the accrual for litigation expenses, in-process research and
development, and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Synthes.
Third quarter 2012 net earnings included after-tax special items of approximately $553 million as shown in the
reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Excluding these special items for both periods, net earnings for the
current quarter were $3.9 billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.36, representing increases of 11.3% and 8.8%
respectively as compared to the same period in 2012.
I would now like to make some additional comments relative to the components leading to earnings before we move on
to the segment highlights. For the third quarter of 2013, cost of goods sold at 30.4% was down 240 basis points from
the same period last year. In the third quarter of 2012, we recorded an inventory step-up charge related to the Synthes
acquisition. Excluding the inventory step-up charge, which was treated as a special item, cost of goods sold decreased
150 basis points versus the same period last year.
Positive mix, strong volume growth in our Pharmaceutical business and cost improvement initiatives across many of
the businesses was partially offset by the impact of the medical device excise tax. Third quarter selling, marketing and
administrative expenses were 30.2% of sales or 40 basis points lower than our 2012 results due to cost containment
initiatives across many of the businesses.
Our investment in research and development as a percent to sales was 11.6%, up 30 basis points due to increased
spending in the Pharmaceuticals business. Interest expense net of interest income of $87 million was down $33 million
versus the third quarter of 2012 due to a lower average debt level. Other expense net of other income of $943 million in
the third quarter of 2013 compared to other income net of other expense of $19 million in the same period last year.
Excluding special items, other income net of other expense of $43 million was $132 million less than 2012 due
primarily to the impact of 2012 gains on divestitures. Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 18.9% in the

third quarter of 2013 compared to 22.2% in the same period last year. Dominic will provide commentary on taxes in his
remarks.
Turning now to business segment highlights, please refer to the supplementary sales schedule highlighting key products
or businesses for the third quarter of 2013. I'll begin with the Consumer segment. Worldwide Consumer segment sales
for the third quarter of 2013 of $3.6 billion increased 0.8% as compared to the same period last year. On an operational
basis, sales increased 2% while the impact of currency was negative 1.2%. U.S. sales were up 0.9% while international
sales grew 2.6% on an operational basis. Excluding the impact of divestitures net of acquisitions, operational growth
was approximately 2.5%.
Baby Care products increased on an operational basis by 2.6% when compared to the third quarter of 2012 due
primarily to the impact of the Elsker products acquired earlier this year. Sales in the Oral Care business decreased 3%
operationally. Excluding the impact of the divestiture of manual toothbrushes in North America, operational sales were
essentially flat. For the third quarter of 2013, sales for OTC pharmaceuticals increased 6.5% on an operational basis
compared to the same period in 2012. U.S. sales were up 17.9% driven by strong growth in analgesics and other key
brands as we continue to make progress in returning a reliable supply of products to the marketplace. International sales
were up 2% operationally.
Our Skin Care business grew 2.7% on an operational basis in the third quarter of 2013. Strong results for AVEENO
were partially offset by the impact of divestitures. Excluding divestitures, operational growth was approximately 4%.
Women's Health grew 2.5% on an operational basis due to growth in international women's sanitary protection
products. Women's Care other sales decreased 6.9% on an operational basis impacted by competitive pressures as well
as divestitures.
That completes our review of the Consumer segment and I'll now review highlights for the Pharmaceutical segment.
Worldwide net sales for the third quarter of $7 billion increased 9.9% versus the same period last year. On an
operational basis, sales increased 10.9% with a negative currency impact of 1 point. Sales in the U.S. increased 7.9%
while sales outside the U.S. increased on an operational basis by 14%.
Now reviewing sales for major therapeutic areas. Immunology products grew 13.4% operationally with sales in the
U.S. up 3% and sales outside the U.S. up 47.7% operationally. Earlier this year, the company made certain supply chain
changes for REMICADE resulting in sales to distributors previously recorded as U.S. export sales now being recorded
as international sales. Adjusting for this impact, the U.S. immunology growth was approximately 8% and operational
growth outside the U.S. was approximately 28%. In the U.S., REMICADE excluding export sales was up 7.8%;
SIMPONI was up 19.4%, and STELARA was up 23.9%. Results were driven by market growth across the major
products, complemented by increased market share for both STELARA and SIMPONI. With the strength of our
portfolio, we continue to be the U.S. market leader in immunology.
REMICADE outside the U.S., adjusted for the supply chain change just mentioned, was up approximately 15%
operationally due to strong growth in Canada and the emerging markets. STELARA made significant contributions to
growth outside the U.S. due to market share gains and market growth across the major regions, while SIMPONI's
strong growth was due to increased shipments to our distribution partner complemented by additional country launches
and strong growth in other markets.
Sales of infectious disease products increased 2.4% on an operational basis. INCIVO, a treatment for hepatitis C, grew
5.3% on an operational basis reflecting launches in additional countries partially offset by lower sales in Europe,
impacted by a combination of patient warehousing, patient enrollment in clinical trials, and seasonality and treatment
patterns impacting new patient starts in the summer months.
Continued momentum in market share growth in the major markets for PREZISTA made notable contributions to the
results. Results outside the U.S. were impacted by the timing of tender business. Strong growth for the combined sales
of COMPLERA and EDURANT also contributed to the results. Marrow science product sales declined 1.9%
operationally with U.S. sales down 11.4% impacted by generic competition primarily for CONCERTA. The
long-acting, injectable anti-psychotics RISPERDAL CONSTA and INVEGA SUSTENNA or XEPLION achieved

operational growth of over 15% due to an increase in combined market share.
Sales of oncology products increased 57% on an operational basis due to the strong results for ZYTIGA and
VELCADE. ZYTIGA is approved to treat both chemo-refractory and chemo-naïve metastatic castration-resistant
prostate cancer. In the quarter, ZYTIGA achieved operational sales growth of over 70% with U.S. sales growing 50%
due to very strong market growth of nearly 25% and increased market share in the combined metastatic
castrate-resistant prostate market. ZYTIGA has captured 33% of that market and is up approximately 2.5 points
sequentially. ZYTIGA sales outside the U.S. nearly doubled on an operational basis versus third quarter of 2012 and on
a sequential basis, sales were up over 15%. Additional country rollouts and the expansion of the label to chemo-naïve
patients drove the strong results. ZYTIGA is approved in more than 80 countries.
VELCADE is a treatment for multiple myeloma. Sales increased 26.3% on an operational basis. Strong performance in
patient share in the front line setting and the launch of the subcutaneous version continue to drive sales growth.
Other oncology increased primarily due to DOXIL/CAELYX. Regarding DOXIL/CAELYX, ensuring a sufficient
supply for physicians and their patients remains our urgent priority. We have begun to encounter supply outages of
DOXIL in the U.S. due to issues at our third-party manufacturer. We continue to take the steps needed for the
long-term transition to new suppliers, which we are accelerating wherever possible.
The FDA has approved the generic doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome injection, which is currently available for
patients. In Europe, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use or CHMP has approved manufacturing of
CAELYX from an alternate supplier. We anticipate receiving CAELYX from this manufacturer by the end of the year.
Other Pharmaceutical products increased 5.9% on an operational basis with strong results for XARELTO and
INVOKANA; partially offset by lower sales for EPREX and PARIET, primarily related to generic competition.
XARELTO more than tripled compared with the same quarter last year and grew nearly 30% on a sequential basis
reaching nearly 40% of the new-to-brand scripts in cardiology in September. Surpassing warfarin by over 8 points and
widening the lead by 3 points versus the last quarter. Total prescription exit share in the broader anticoagulant market
grew approximately 1.5 points on a sequential basis to nearly 10%.
In the U.S., INVOKANA achieved 17% new-to-brand share with endocrinologists within the defined market of Type 2
diabetes excluding insulin and Metformin. At 17%, INVOKANA is the number one branded non-insulin product NBRx
in that market.
In addition to the number of approvals and filings that Dominic will highlight in his remarks, during the quarter
ibrutinib was granted priority review by the FDA for the use in the treatment of previously treated patients with chronic
lymphocytic leukemia or CLL and small lymphocytic lymphoma or SLL and for its use in the treatment of previously
treated patients with mantle cell lymphoma or MCL. A late February PDUFA date has been assigned.
We announced the simultaneous submission of a Biologic License Application to FDA and a Marketing Authorization
Application to the European Medicine Agency or EMA for siltuximab, an experimental product for the treatment of
patients with multi-centric Castleman's disease. The resubmission to the FDA Complete Response for the use of
XARELTO to reduce the risk of secondary cardiovascular events and stent thrombosis in patients with acute coronary
syndrome was filed with a PDUFA date of mid-February next year.
In October, a Marketing Authorization Application was submitted to the EMA seeking approval for a once-daily single
tablet fixed dose antiretroviral combination product containing darunavir, a protease inhibitor developed by Janssen
with cobicistat, a pharmacokinetic enhancer developed by Gilead Sciences for use in combination with other HIV-1
medicines.
That completes review of the Pharmaceutical segment. I'll now review the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segments
results.
Worldwide Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment sales of $6.9 billion declined 2% versus the same period last
year. On an operational basis, sales increased 0.3% with a negative currency impact of 2.3 points. Sales in the U.S.
declined 4.2% while sales outside the U.S. increased on an operational basis by 4.2%. Adjusted for divestitures and

exits from certain businesses underlying growth was approximately 1%, reflecting continued market and pricing
pressure. I will provide more commentary on these factors in the franchise reviews.
Starting with Cardiovascular Care, sales were up 4.2% operationally, with the U.S. up 0.5% and sales outside the U.S.
up 6.6% operationally, driven by Biosense Webster, our electrophysiology business with worldwide operational growth
of over 11% in the quarter. The success of a number of catheter launches made strong contributions to the results.
Diabetes Care sales declined 11.3% on an operational basis in the third quarter of 2013 with the U.S. business down
27.7% due to the impact of lower price primarily related to competitive bidding. The business outside the U.S. was up
6.5% operationally with strong sales in the emerging markets partially offset by lower sales in some of the developed
markets. The success of the launch of Animas Vibe in certain international countries has contributed to growth in the
quarter.
The Diagnostics business declined 8% on an operational basis. Excluding the impact of the divestiture of the Therakos
business, operational sales were down approximately 2.5% due to the exit from certain donor-screening contracts and
lower capital placements. Infection prevention decreased 0.5% on an operational basis with sales in the U.S. down
7.1% due to soft capital equipment sales reflecting a lower level of trade-ins. Outside the U.S., operational growth of
4.3% was driven by both consumables and capital item sales. Orthopedic sales were up 1.1% on an operational basis
when compared to the same period in 2012, with the U.S. down 0.8% and sales outside the U.S. up 3.4%.
Operationally, hips were up 6% worldwide driven by 7% growth in the U.S. due to strong results in primary stem
platform sales, partially offset by continued pricing pressure. Hips outside the U.S. were up 4% on an operational basis
driven mainly by heads and acetabular products. Knees worldwide increased 3% on an operational basis with similar
results both in and outside the U.S. Growth in the U.S. was due to the successful launch of ATTUNE Fixed Bearing
Knee, as well as strong sales of revision platforms, partially offset by lower sales of rotating platforms and pricing
pressure. The launch of ATTUNE drove the results outside the U.S.
Trauma was up 1% on an operational basis with the U.S. flat and outside the U.S. up 2% operationally. Low-cost
competition impacted the results in the U.S. while the timing of tender business negatively impacted the results outside
the U.S. Worldwide spine was down 2% on an operational basis with the U.S. down approximately 10%, impacted by
pricing pressure, the continued softness in the market, as well as the disruption in the commercial sales organization as
we integrate the businesses. Outside the U.S., sales were up approximately 9% operationally with strong growth in
Latin America and Asia Pacific.
Specialty Surgery operational growth was 6.7% in the third quarter of 2013. U.S. sales were up 4.2% and sales outside
the U.S. up 9.2% on an operational basis. Strong sales of biosurgical products and international sales of energy
products were the major contributors to growth, complemented by sales growth for new products for both Mentor and
Acclarent. These gains were partially offset by lower sales of HARMONIC products in the U.S. due to competitive
pressures.
Surgical Care worldwide sales were up 1.4% on an operational basis, with U.S. down 2.5% and sales outside the U.S.
up 3.9% operationally. U.S. sales were impacted by lower sales of Women's Health and urology products. Outside the
U.S., suture sales and strong demand for endocutter products with the ECHELON FLEX Powered ENDOPATH Stapler
were the important drivers of growth.
Rounding out the review of the Medical Devices & Diagnostics segment, our Vision Care business achieved
operational sales growth of 3.9% in the third quarter, with U.S. up 1.9% and sales outside the U.S. up 4.9%
operationally. Growth was driven by daily lenses and astigmatism lenses.
That completes highlights for the Medical Devices & Diagnostics segment and concludes the segment highlights for
Johnson & Johnson's third quarter of 2013.
It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Michel Orsinger. Michel?

Michel Orsinger
Thank you, Louise, and good morning, everyone. I look forward to providing you with an update on the integration of
DePuy and Synthes, the value we are seeing in the combination of these two companies and our strategy for leading
and shaping the industry. Having now worked with Johnson & Johnson prior to the Synthes acquisition and now as a
J&J leader, I've had ample opportunity to get to know the enterprise and discover its richness, breadth, resources and
capabilities. I am very impressed by the values expressed in our cradle and the ability of a large global organization to
nourish and live by such values in an increasingly complex world. And I have a lot of respect for the people in Johnson
& Johnson.
Before I start my presentation, I'd like to give my perspective on the DePuy Synthes third quarter results that Louise
presented. While I'm not entirely satisfied with our results, we have had some important wins. Joint Reconstruction,
especially in the U.S., is performing very well and we believe we grew market share in hips. Furthermore, we generated
double-digit growth in emerging markets, with the best results coming from China, Russia and Brazil.
Our performance in trauma and U.S. spine was lower than expected. Trauma results were due mostly to a biannual
tender that did not repeat this year and pressure from lower-priced competition, which we are managing by leveraging
sales force coverage, segmenting the market and introducing new product configurations. U.S. spine results were due to
integration disruptions, which we are addressing. Overall, we are pleased to maintain our strong market leadership
positions.
I'm very confident about the future. DePuy and Synthes, two of the most successful and respected companies in
orthopedics and neuro, joined together at the right time to actively participate in and shape the changing healthcare
environment. I'm convinced that we are all well positioned to expand our leadership in the industry and I'm excited by
the opportunities in front of us.
As a combined organization, we are better suited to optimize our offerings. For patients and surgeons, there is the
potential for exciting medical innovations that leverage the product development capabilities from both organizations,
as well as from the larger J&J enterprise.
For providers, our scale and unparalleled product portfolio, which spans many platforms, opens new possibilities to
consolidate supplies. In emerging markets, the same benefits will enable us to continue accelerating growth.
In addition, our larger experienced sales force, leadership in professional education and collaboration with the AO and
the values-driven combined talent from both organizations offer competitive differentiation in the industry.
DePuy Synthes participates in a market that has very strong fundamentals. At $44 billion, the market is large and
diverse. There is plenty of opportunity to address unmet orthopedic and neuro needs. We believe that as the global
population ages, demand for the types of products we offer will increase, and many emerging markets are investing in
their healthcare systems to provide more and better care for their citizens.
As you look over our planning horizon, emerging market growth is projected to increase roughly four times the rate of
developed markets. As healthcare systems around the world face the reality of cost containment and providers
participate more in decision-making with clinicians, DePuy Synthes, as part of J&J, is primed to offer new value-added
solutions and help transform healthcare delivery. Against the backdrop of these market dynamics, we are expecting the
worldwide ortho neural market to grow between 2% and 4% compounded annually by 2017.
Our first year at DePuy Synthes has been exciting and rewarding. As you can imagine, combining two organizations of
this size and complexity is a significant undertaking. Our employees are doing a great job, and I'm pleased to say the
integration is on track. Our primary goal during the integration was to minimize customer disruption. Based on
feedback from customers, we believe we have achieved this in all but one platform. As we combine two different sales
forces with two different sales models in U.S. spine, we have experienced some disruptions in that business and we
continue to take corrective measures.

In other parts of the business, I'm particularly encouraged to see synergies being realized by cross-selling initiatives we
envisioned from the onset, as well as revenue and cost synergies. Initially, having very much focused on commercial
integration, we are now spending more time on internal systems and processes, including IT, HR, supply chain, and
quality. This work remains a priority, as a successful integration is one of the foundational elements of our future.
We have combined terrific talent from both organizations and supplemented our team with new capabilities to help
address the changes in our markets. We achieved a high retention rate of our global DePuy Synthes staff during
integration. And we are engaging in a new innovation agenda. Our strategy is focused on four growth drivers. We'll
continue to transform our business and drive growth through continuous innovation, focus on emerging markets,
excellent execution and cultivation of talent and an engaged organization.
For the rest of today's discussion, I will focus on our approach to innovation and our emerging markets strategy. In
today's dynamic healthcare environment, our customers are looking for new solutions that improve clinical outcomes,
increase patient satisfaction, and do this at reduced cost. As a result, we are redefining innovation in three ways. First,
we remain committed to product innovation. Second, we are introducing programs and services that complement our
products. Third, we are developing new business models.
As these three approaches converge and especially as we add the Johnson & Johnson scale and breadth to the mix, we
are able to add value and collaborate on a more strategic level versus being a product provider. Starting with product
innovation, we developed our ATTUNE knee system specifically to address patient satisfaction and an unmet patient
need, improving the instability some patients experience with existing knee replacement.
ATTUNE also was developed to address provider interest in outcomes and efficiency of healthcare delivery. To date,
27 publications document the science behind the design, thereby addressing our stakeholders' need for evidence. The
ATTUNE knee system launch is off to a very successful start, with positive feedback from patients, surgeons, and
physical therapists. Following commercialization in North America, launches are underway in 13 European and Asia
Pacific countries.
In addition to developing new products, we have started to complement our product offering with value-added
programs and services. Let me describe one such program we are piloting.
DePuy partnered with colleagues in Janssen to create a program to help hospitals reduce the length of stay for joint
replacement patients while enhancing quality of care and patient satisfaction. The result is a patient care pathway
program called Care4Today Orthopedic Solutions that integrates patient education, a changed management program for
hospitals, and home recovery supports. The first impressive results from the pilot show reduced patient length of stay
and excellent patient and staff feedback.
The third pillar of innovation is new business models. We are piloting many different cross-selling arrangements across
DePuy Synthes and J&J that leverage our considerable product portfolio. For example, in the U.S., Joint Recon
distributors are selling power tools, and they are in the community and rural hospitals selling trauma. Trauma is selling
Joint Recon and Sports Medicine products in academic centers. Sports medicine is selling trauma products in
community and rural hospitals and ambulatory surgery centers. Across Johnson & Johnson, Ethicon is selling and
marketing CMF's Tissue Matrix product as part of its hernia portfolio.
We formed a strategic account management group that is leveraging our broader offerings to become one point of
contact for all our customers' orthopedic and neuro needs. As providers seek to reduce vendors, the team is steadily
gaining traction in identifying and winning accounts that would benefit most from our comprehensive portfolio.
Taking collaboration one step further, we are in active discussions with large institutions to jointly define value, based
on their specific needs, set new standards and pilot entirely new approaches to delivering healthcare. The combination
of DePuy and Synthes and even the broader efforts across MD&D and J&J place us in a very unique position to
accomplish these goals.
Now I'd like to move to another significant source of future growth: emerging markets. These countries represent a
small part of our revenue at this point, yet we anticipate close to 40% of our projected growth in years to come from

these countries. Today I'll focus on China, where DePuy Synthes has a strong foundation. Our three-pronged strategy
there is based on helping patients gain access to care.
First, the premium segment remains vital to our business and will continue to provide innovations for the urban
customer segment. While doing so, we'll continue to refine core products to match different anatomical and surgeon
preferences.
Our second strategy is to develop value segment products, which are simple, easy to use, and more affordable options
for under-served patients in more rural areas. We are adapting existing premium products that still maintain our high
quality standards. One example is our REACH knee instruments, a simplified instrument set for the Sigma Fixed
Bearing Knee. We are planning the launch of this affordable option in China and India this year.
Our other differentiating approach to the fast-growing value segment is to become a local supplier in China for trauma.
Products that are manufactured and have undergone clinical trials in China are considered local and give us access to a
whole new market segment with attractive reimbursement.
A few years ago we took the strategic decision to build a plant in Suzhou, which helps us to maintain our
manufacturing standards and also invested in clinical trials for trauma products. In fact, we have breaking news on this
front. Just this past Saturday, we received our product license for domestic manufacture for four classes of trauma
products. We will launch these locally manufactured and approved products next year, giving us a significant
advantage in addressing the value segment.
Finally, as the demand for healthcare in the region grows, more surgeons need training. Considering our broad-based
product portfolio, we are exploring expansion of our collaboration with the AO Foundation into new clinical areas
beyond trauma in Asia Pacific. With DePuy Synthes's support, the AO offered its first ever neurotrauma course in
Beijing and Shanghai. And in November, the AO will offer its first ever joint reconstruction course in China.
In conclusion, we are making tremendous progress positioning our business for long-term profitable growth. We
recognize the unique opportunity to address the needs of our customers and form strategic alliances. We're redefining
innovation, accelerating growth in emerging markets and developing new capabilities and leadership skills in our
organization. I look forward to sharing our progress as our transformation continues. We have only just begun to realize
the power of this great combination.
Thank you. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Dominic Caruso.
Dominic J. Caruso
Thank you, Michel, and good morning, everyone. I must say we are very fortunate to have Michel leading our DePuy
Synthes business with his level of energy, strong leadership and clear vision for the world's largest orthopedics
business. And I very much enjoy working with Michel as a member of our Management Committee. Now I'd like to
turn to our third quarter results, review some achievements during the quarter and provide an update on our guidance
for 2013.
I will begin with a brief comment about what we are seeing in the overall healthcare market. At this time, we are still
seeing utilization rates that are essentially flat year-over-year, supporting a continued stable environment, which is
similar to what we saw in the second quarter. At Johnson & Johnson, the level of consistently solid and sustainable
performance we deliver is due to the breadth of our business and the extraordinary achievements and dedication of our
people around the world.
Our third quarter results reflect the progress we are making in achieving our near-term priorities of delivering strong
business results, returning a reliable supply of OTC products to the marketplace, successfully integrating Synthes and
building on the strong momentum in the Pharmaceutical segment. Our innovative products are clearly making a
meaningful difference in the treatment of patients.

We have also continued to make advancements in the implementation of our longer-term strategic growth drivers, of
creating value through innovation as evidenced by the productivity of our pipeline and the success of our newly
launched products, focusing on excellence and execution, leading with purpose and by increasing our global reach with
greater local focus; which is reflected by our double-digit operational growth this year in the BRIC countries.
Let's now review some of the highlights of the Q3 results. We are pleased to report strong third quarter results with
sales of $17.6 billion, representing an increase of nearly 5% on an operational basis versus the third quarter of 2012.
And earnings per share, excluding special items, of $1.36 or a nearly 9% increase over the prior year.
As you can see, we've recorded special items in the quarter of approximately $900 million on an after-tax basis that
consisted largely of charges related to an increase in our accrual for various litigation matters, charges for in-process
research and development and continued integration and transaction costs associated with the Synthes acquisition.
Together these special items negatively impacted our third quarter results by $0.32 per share. We have consistently
treated these types of matters as special items. And excluding these special items, our adjusted earnings per share was
$1.36, which exceeded the mean of the analyst estimates as reported by First Call of $1.32.
Now let's look at sales performance in some important business developments by segment. In Pharmaceuticals, we
reported operational sales growth in the quarter of approximately 11%, fueled by sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA,
REMICADE, SIMPONI, STELARA, VELCADE and PREZISTA. And new products including XARELTO,
INVOKANA and ZYTIGA, which has well exceeded $1 billion in global sales this year, also recorded very strong
sales in the quarter, contributing to that segment's continued growth.
Other developments of note in the Pharmaceuticals segment included the successful completion of the acquisition of
Aragon Pharmaceuticals, which we initially announced in June. This acquisition increases our leadership position in the
field of prostate cancer and strengthens our pipeline with a potentially best-in-class compound that is just advanced into
Phase III development, that if approved, would complement ZYTIGA and broaden the range of patients that could
potentially be treated.
Several important positive regulatory decisions were also made on some of our key products including the FDA's
approval of SIMPONI ARIA, the IV version of SIMPONI for the treatment of moderately to severely active
rheumatoid arthritis and STELARA for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis.
In Japan, the Ministry of Health approved simeprevir, which will be marketed as SOVRIAD for the treatment of
genotype-1 chronic hepatitis C virus infection and XEPLION, the first once-monthly atypical antipsychotic for the
treatment of schizophrenia approved in that country.
In Europe, the European Commission approved VELCADE as the first therapeutic option in a combination approach
for adults with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are deemed eligible for high-dose chemotherapy with
hematological stem cell transplantation; STELARA, for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adult patients with
response to previous non-biological drug therapy when that has been inadequate; and also SIMPONI, for the treatment
of adult patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis who have had inadequate response to conventional
therapy or who are intolerant to such therapies. Also in Europe, the CHMP granted a positive opinion on INVOKANA
for the treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes.
We also increased our leadership presence in the hepatitis C market just last week with the acquisition of a Phase II
compound for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C from an affiliate of GlaxoSmithKline. Under the terms of the deal,
we acquired all rights to develop and commercialize that product.
In our MD&D segment, sales were essentially flat versus the prior year on an operational basis, reflecting the continued
market and pricing pressures, as well as divestitures already described by Louise. Of note, however, was double-digit
operational growth that we saw in the BRIC markets.
Biosense Webster's electrophysiology products and our Cardiovascular Care business continues to deliver strong
growth, as did Joint Reconstruction products in the Orthopedics business, international sales in the Surgical Care
business, and continued good performance in the Specialty Surgery business. Our Consumer business saw an

operational sales increase of 2%. Positive contributors to the operational results were analgesic brands Motrin and
Tylenol, Aveeno skin care products, and international sales of baby care products.
I want to comment that as we continue to return a reliable supply of high quality OTC products to the shelves, we are
seeing strong uptake in the market. And as you can see, our U.S. OTC business posted strong nearly 18% growth in the
quarter.
Now let me provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2013. Let me begin with a
discussion of cash and interest income and expense. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $10 billion
of net cash. This consists of approximately $25 billion of cash and marketable securities and $15 billion of debt.
We continued to generate strong cash flows from operations which in this quarter were essentially offset by the
finalization and related cash settlement of the accelerated share repurchase program that was initiated in conjunction
with the acquisition of Synthes. With that program now completed, we have resumed our normal share repurchases
related to employee compensation programs.
For purposes of your models, assuming no major acquisitions, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of
between $350 million and $400 million, slightly lower than our previous guidance.
Turning to other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as
gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation, and divestitures,
asset sales, or write-offs. This account is difficult to forecast, but at this late stage of the year, we would be comfortable
with your models for 2013 reflecting other income and expense as a net gain, excluding any special items, ranging from
approximately $500 million to $600 million, which is lower than our previous guidance.
And now a word on taxes. For the third quarter of 2013, the company's effective tax rate excluding special items was
19.3%. We suggest that you model our effective tax rate for the full year 2013 at approximately between 19% and
19.5%, which is a tightening of the previous range. As always, we will continue to pursue opportunities in this area to
improve upon this rate during the remainder of the year.
Now turning to sales and earnings, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting operational sales growth on a
constant currency basis of between approximately 6% and 7% for the year, which is consistent with our previous
guidance. This would result in estimated sales for 2013 on a constant currency basis of approximately $71.3 to $71.9
billion. While we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, to give you an idea of the potential impact, if
currency exchange rates for the remainder of 2013 were to stay where they were as of last week, that our sales growth
rate would be negatively impacted by approximately 1.5% for the year.
Thus, under this scenario, we would expect reported sales growth to be between approximately 4.5% and 5.5% for the
year, for an expected level of reported sales of approximately between $70.3 and $70.9 billion, which is higher than our
prior guidance, mostly due to the strengthening of the Euro versus the U.S. dollar.
Turning now to earnings, considering the strength we see in our operating results, which will more than offset the
expected lower level of other income level guidance I mentioned earlier, we suggest that you consider full-year 2013
EPS estimates, excluding the impact of special items, of between $5.44 and $5.49 per share at constant currency rates.
We are not predicting the impact of currency movements. However, to give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS
if currency exchange rates for the balance of 2013 were to remain where they were as of the end of last week, then our
reported earnings per share, excluding special items, would see no impact related to currency fluctuations.
Therefore, we suggest that you model our reported earnings per share, excluding special items, in the range between
$5.44 and $5.49 per share or a growth rate of between 7% and 8% which at the midpoint is higher than our previous
guidance.
Overall, as you update your models for the guidance I just provided, you should see pre-tax operating margins will
continue to show improvement over the prior year, and we now expect that improvement will be greater than 100 basis
points. This will more than offset the expected lower level of other income as per our updated guidance. We feel

confident we can achieve an even better improvement than we expected at the beginning of the year given the strength
of our operating performance while we continue to invest in growth for the future.
And finally, a word on the impact of foreign currency transactions related to the devaluation of the yen, which may be
helpful for you as you update your models. As you know, the yen devalued by approximately 25% versus the U.S.
dollar and the euro this year. The impact of the yen devaluation on 2013 results has not been significant because of our
policy of advanced hedging of foreign currency transactions in a manner that provides certainty in our planning related
to currency swings during the year.
However, we expect the impact of the devaluation of the yen to be a significant headwind in 2014. We estimate this
headwind to negatively impact gross margin in 2014 by approximately 60 basis points. Of course, as we complete our
planning for 2014, we will look for ways to mitigate this impact as much as possible.
Now back to you, Louise, for the question-and-answer session.

Thank you, Dominic. Felicia, could you please give the instructions for the Q&A session.
Q&A

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Dodds with Citi Corp (sic) [Citigroup]
(48:20).
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Morning, Matt.
<Q - Matthew J. Dodds>: Morning. Dominic, first for you. If you look at the geographic results, Europe is growing a
lot faster than the U.S. I assume Pharma is a big part of it, but do you think you're also gaining share in Europe in
MD&D? And then broadly for Europe, what do you think about the environment for Europe in Q3 versus Q2? That's
for you Dominic.
And then Michel, for you, in U.S. spine, I thought the integration started in the fourth quarter of last year. Why does the
hit seem like it's getting worse as we're moving through 2013, and when do you think that kind of all sorts out?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Right. Hi, Matt. Good morning. You're right, we do see strong growth in Europe. It is
primarily driven by the Pharmaceutical business as, obviously, we've launched some exciting new products in the
Pharma business. In MD&D, we continue to see government austerity pressures, and quite frankly, a reduction of
overall volumes in those businesses. However, we seem to be making pretty good progress in the Ethicon Surgical Care
business and even in our diabetes and the DePuy legacy business in Europe as well
<A - Michel Orsinger>: Good morning, Matt. Indeed, related to our U.S. spine performance, we have and continue to
go through some disruptions, while we are very excited about our international business growing at plus 9%.
Now related to the U.S. changes, as you can imagine, combining two sales forces from two different companies is a
major task. We are combining different selling models, distributor base versus a direct selling model. Two salespeople
are calling on the same account, on the same hospitals, requiring realignment of territories. The sales force having to
deal short term with the complexity of two different systems, processes, it all takes time.
Just as one example, sales consultants ordering products need to do this from two different legacy ordering systems,
which need to be harmonized through IT. And that obviously can lead to some frustrations by the sales force. But
having said so, we are taking clear measures, ongoing measures at very different levels, related primarily to ensure we
can provide a better support to the sales force, make their job easier. But at the same time, also provide enhanced and

harmonized compensation and benefit packages.
We are in the final stage of realigning our territories. And I think people – customers but also our sales people – do
recognize that we, having the opportunity to combine two product bags, have one of the most attractive product
offering, especially leveraging the strength of legacy Synthes in the cervical area, leveraging the strengths of legacy
DePuy in the lumbar area. So time will help to stabilize the sales force and to create this stronger spine company also in
the U.S.
<Q - Matthew J. Dodds>: Okay. Thanks, Michel. Thanks, Dominic.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: You're welcome.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Next question, please.
Operator
And your next question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Mike.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Great. Thank you. Thanks for taking the questions this morning. Since we have Michel.
Michel, just one comment you made that stuck with me. You talked about lower-priced competition in trauma, and it
wasn't clear if you were talking in the U.S, if you were talking emerging markets. So could you expand on that?
Thanks.
<A - Michel Orsinger>: The lower-priced competition we have been observing is primarily located in the U.S. We
have seen some smaller companies trying to offer very specific product segments in specific institutions. So we are
clearly taking corrective measures by working on major initiatives related to segmentation; customer segmentation,
channel segmentation and products. We are going to counteract by also cross-selling and to certainly elevating our
agenda with our customers, leveraging our breadth and size of our portfolio through contracts and also establishing
more strategic relationships. We see ourselves clearly as a total solution provider, which includes products and services
primarily supported and provided by our well-educated sales force.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Okay. Thank you, Michel.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Maybe if I can just follow up with maybe one item here. Dominic, if I look at the breadth
of J&J, everybody looks at it right now and says the Pharma business looks fantastic. You've got some product
launches that are driving very strong growth, and you've obviously got more that are coming shortly. So I think
everybody is very comfortable with the performance of the Pharma business and the outlook of the next, let's call it,
two, three years at a minimum.
The challenges are on the other sides of the business with MD&D, Consumer. Let me spend just a minute on
Consumer. If we stripped out McNeil and looked at the rest of the portfolio, the rest of the portfolio has basically been
growing zero to 1% the last several quarters. It doesn't seem like it's really picked up, even as the economy has gotten a
little bit better. So can you just talk a little bit about the strategy for the balance of the Consumer business? And is there
any potential for growth to reaccelerate for the broader portfolio?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure, Mike. Well, let's see, the Consumer business has had, as you know, some challenges
related to the overall economic slowdown. And yes, you did comment and we do see some pick-up in overall economic
activity but certainly not to the level that we all hope it would be at. So there are still some carryover elements of
trading down, if you will, to store brands and the like. And what's incumbent upon our business then is to create the
innovations that consumers will want and purchase and remain loyal to.
You see that in certain pockets of our business more than others, quite frankly. So, for example, in Skin Care, the
Aveeno products are doing extremely well. You see new advertising campaigns, et cetera. And Aveeno alone is up

16% year-over-year. In other elements of the business, we've pruned our portfolio, quite frankly. We've had the impact
of divestitures that have shown – that have made the difficulty in comparing the progress year-over-year. But we're
poised to continue to capture market share through innovation, which has been our stronghold in the Consumer
business, in addition obviously to focusing on the return of the OTC business.
And just to mention one other thing about Consumer, you know our emerging markets in the Consumer business
continue to do well despite some slowdown in some of these emerging markets. We're confident that that Consumer
business will continue to do well and show growth as those consumers begin to purchase more personal care products
in the future. So we're happy with the progress to date. I think we still have a little bit ways to go with some innovation,
but we've been very fortunate with the level of innovation we've been able to deliver thus far. And I'm confident we'll
see more coming in the near term.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Thanks, Dominic.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Thank you. Next question, please.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Kristen Stewart with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Dominic, I know you had mentioned with the
completion of the ASR program that you're going to be resuming your normal share repurchase, just to offset the
employee stock issuance. I was just wondering if you could take a step back and maybe give us some of your broader
thoughts on just capital allocation at this point? I guess why not do a more significant stock purchase given your net
cash balance?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Right, Kristen. Thanks for the question. Well, we've consistently addressed this question in
a way that I think investors have come to understand our approach to capital allocation, which is first and foremost
we're going to generate strong cash flows. After that, we're very proud of having a 51-year history of increasing our
dividend, and so we have a priority towards allocating capital to our dividend, which has proven to be the most
enduring return of capital that we've looked at over long periods of time compared to other companies in the industry.
And then we would like to continue to increase our presence in the global healthcare market by doing smart
acquisitions at the right time with the right value for shareholders, which in the end continues to give us the ability to
generate even stronger cash flows for the long term.
And then finally, in order of priority, we look at share repurchases primarily as an offset to any dilution we might incur.
For example, in the Synthes transaction, we completely offset that dilution of the employee stock purchases. We also
obviously continue to offset that dilution. So that's the order in which we think of capital allocation. To the extent we're
opportunistic at times to buy back stock, we'll always entertain that possibility. But that's been our approach, and we
think it's served us well and will continue to serve us well and our shareholders for the longer term.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. And then just thinking about just Synthes and some of the assumptions that you
guys had at the time of acquisition, I know the growth forecast is a little bit softer now relative to back then. I think
trauma and spine were expected to grow somewhere between 5% and 7%. I think today in the slides you guys had
showed now globally Orthopedics closer to the 2% to 4%. How do you guys just think about, I guess, some of the cost
synergies that you had originally targeted? How are those tracking? And are there greater opportunities on the cost side
to maybe offset maybe a little bit lower sales growth contribution from the acquisition?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Right. Thanks, Kristen. Let me just address that and then ask Michel if he'd like to add
anything. You're absolutely right. The major difference between the time of the acquisition and now is the growth rate
primarily in trauma. Trauma, as you know, was growing at that point 6%, 7%, and you saw from Michel's discussion
what we expect the growth rate to be going forward. So that's a major change in assumptions. We think that in order to
answer that challenge, we'll have to do two things. Michel talked about the first being making sure that we have a
comprehensive offering with the breadth of our portfolio, et cetera; and secondly we will have to look at cost.

However, remember that the major purpose of this acquisition was not to drive out cost synergies. It was to, as Michel
mentioned, No. 1, preserve and then enhance the experience with our customers. But given the realities of the
marketplace we will look, in fact, at what's an appropriate level of cost structure should the lower level of market
growth remain for extended periods of time.
But Michel, anything else to add to that?
<A - Michel Orsinger>: Indeed, Dominic. The emphasis we have is on growth. But considering the new market
environment over the last two years, it's a relative growth to the market, which our people feel accountable to. Related
to cost synergies, we see nevertheless attractive opportunities to further realize. And within our integration efforts, I
must say that at least the internally-defined growth and cost synergies are on target.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Thanks, Michel.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Thank you. Next question, please.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen with Wells Fargo.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning.
<Q - Larry H. Biegelsen>: Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. One for Dominic and one for
Michel. Starting with Dominic, you gave some color on the call on your BRIC market growth, but I don't think you
gave it for overall J&J. I think it was 19% in the second quarter. Can you give us that number for the third quarter? And
just the near-term outlook, Dominic, there given the issues in China and if you could just talk about kind of any impact
in China across the three segments from the recent news? Thanks.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Right. Well, we did see an overall slower level of market growth in China most recently.
But let me just give you an idea of year-to-date through nine months if you exclude Synthes from the numbers, because
obviously they impact the comparison to last year, we have double-digit growth across the BRIC markets, over 10%
somewhere near 11%, 12% combined in the BRIC markets. So I think that's pretty healthy growth considering the
relative slowdown that we've most recently seen. We still believe the BRIC markets will be a major contributor of our
growth going forward across all three of our major segments, MD&D, Consumer, and Pharma as well.
<Q - Larry H. Biegelsen>: Thanks for that. And then, Michel, I'm sure people would love to hear your reaction to the
Stryker-Mako deal. And just lastly, it seems like the large joint market improved in the third quarter based on the two
companies that have reported so far in the U.S. Would you agree with that and kind of, if so, why? Thanks.
<A - Michel Orsinger>: Thank you for the question. First of all related to robotics, I think it's important to put it first
into context, the question into context of enabling technologies. There are many ways to improve the surgical processes
and such enablers are computer-aided surgery, patient-specific instrumentation, sensors. And enabling technology in
today's environment, in my opinion, must consider in a balanced way, outcomes, efficiency and cost. So robotics in its
current stage based on my information has not yet been proven that it is the best solution to address all of these criteria
in a holistic way.
It has theoretical incremental improvement in surgical accuracy but with increased significant surgical time and capital
costs. Longer-term robotic technology could have a role in facilitating less invasive patient-customized implant and
procedure solutions. So we continue to monitor this technology with great interest. Our focus is currently on procedure
and episode of care efficiency. For example, through our TRUMATCH and Care4Today, where we think there are
much more fundamental advantages to be gained.
Related to your second question, I can confirm your statement. We also believe that joint in the third quarter has at least
maintained momentum if not picked up. We see an overall very attractive performance from DePuy Synthes recon with

Your next question comes from the line of Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Morning, Tony.
<Q - C. Anthony Butler>: Good morning, Louise, and thank you very much for your time. Two questions, Dominic
the first, well, maybe both for you. One is around free cash flow or cash flow from operations, however you wish to
address it. Correct me if I'm wrong, I believe in the second quarter you mentioned that the second half of this year cash
flow from operations would be greater. If I'm incorrect, I apologize for that, but the most important question is,
regardless of how you view it, do you have a view at which point cash flow growth can actually be something similar
to the net income growth you've actually been demonstrating quarter in, quarter out, just based upon at least Pharma
and to some degree the turnaround in Consumer?
And the second more product-specific question is around abiraterone and clearly very strong sequential growth. Is all
that growth coming from the pre-chemo market or can you comment – or are you able to provide any split about
whether the growth is X for pre-chemo and Y for post-chemo? Thanks very much.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure, Tony. Well, let's see, let's talk about free cash flow, and just for purposes of
definition, that's cash flow from operations less capital expenditures. That's the way we look at free cash flow, and that
has consistently been very strong at Johnson & Johnson, and this year is no exception to that. Last year, we reported
free cash flow in excess of $12 billion. We expect that this year's free cash flow will be greater than that. And with
respect to the relationship of free cash flow to earnings, many of the special charges that we've talked about are in fact
non-cash special charges right now.
So if you look at our earnings in comparison to free cash flow, what you'll find is that generally speaking, Johnson &
Johnson has always delivered free cash flow in the aggregate that's somewhere in the neighborhood of 95% to 105% or
just about equal to the net earnings that the company generates on an annual basis. So that has to do with our ability to
manage receivables, inventory, and appropriately invest in capital. So very strong cash flow indeed, and that's a credit
to all the men and women that operate and run our businesses throughout the world where they do pay attention to the
level of free cash flow that's generated, because that of course is the fuel for us to invest further in our business.
With respect to abiraterone or ZYTIGA pre-chemo versus chemo, Louise was able to look that up for us. Let me just
turn it over to Louise for that answer.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Okay. So, Tony, the split of sales in the U.S. is roughly 55% naïve and 45% refractory in the
quarter. And if you look at the market growth, the market growth in the quarter was 24.5% for that total market.
Refractory grew about 26.5% and naïve about 23.5%. We actually grew share also in the total market, growing to 33%
up from 30.6%, and the refractory market you see a slight dip at that 55% from 55.4% because of the new competition,
but you see nice growth in the naïve market, 24.6% up from 21%.

Your next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a couple questions for Dominic. First,
Dominic, one of the areas that J&J is not currently participating in is structural heart. There's a lot of interest in it. Just
broadly speaking, do you guys feel that expectations are over-hyped, that there are assets to be had that are of interest?
Or what's the general level of interest on the part of J&J in that space?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Well, Tony, the structural heart or cardiovascular devices in general are of interest to
Johnson & Johnson with the exception of the stent market, which you know we've – Bruce, which we've exited. So we
do view structural heart as an attractive market. It is true, however, that whenever we look at acquisitions, we look to
acquire assets at a price that we believe will generate value for our shareholders. So to the extent that valuations are a
bit inflated, we'd rather wait and approach that market when valuations come in our view better in line, Bruce. So that's
the way we'll look at it. It's of interest to us, but we'll watch valuations carefully before acting.
<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: And my follow-on is about XARELTO. What's your view of the prospects for maintaining
leadership in that category in the U.S.? And secondly, how do you scale the ACS opportunity within the overall
opportunity in the U.S.? Thanks so much.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Well, Bruce, the main strategy with XARELTO has been and continues to work well for us.
And that is that the breadth of clinical indications and support for the product is really unparalleled in the marketplace,
in addition to the convenience of the once-daily dosage. So we've seen steady growth in XARELTO new-to-brand
share, in particular with cardiologists and even with primary care physicians, primarily because of the breadth of the
clinical data, despite the fact that there's been much competition entering the marketplace. But that competition just
doesn't have the breadth of clinical data that we have with XARELTO.
So that's been our strategy. I credit our cardiovascular therapeutic area team for developing that strategy, and it's
working really well. So I expect we'll continue to be leaders in this marketplace. ACS just adds to the total package of
clinical data, which our experience is that that gives physicians, cardiologists, et cetera, just more confidence in the
utilization of that compound, given the fact that it's been extensively studied, and we'll look forward to see what the
FDA's response is with respect to our new submission for ACS. But we think that will add to the breadth of good
clinical data, which has been, I think the main driver of the growth of the product.
<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: Thank you.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: You're welcome.

Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Morning, Jami.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. Good morning. Just two questions for you, Dominic. The first is on simeprevir. I know
that goes before a panel, I believe next week. I'm just wondering how we should think it will be used. Do you expect it
to be used as part of oral regimen beginning in 2014 with Gilead's sofo [sofosbuvir]? Or do you expect to choose to be
limited to peg/riba?
And my second question is more of a strategy question, and I think dovetails with some of the earlier questions on this
call. And that is clearly Pharma has been the key driver of growth for the past couple of years now. And just wondering
what your plans are to unleash that value, which clearly I think has been hidden by the continued underperformance by
MD&D and Consumer. Clearly the market is paying up for independent assets showing the type of growth that we're
seeing in your Pharma business. And just wondering how you're thinking about that now? I know we've discussed this
repeatedly in the past, but I think this continues to be the case. Thanks.

<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure, Jami. Well, with simeprevir, it would be premature to comment too much before the
panel meeting because obviously the utilization of the compound will be somewhat dependent on the label that
eventually is granted by the FDA. We do think it's a very potent protease inhibitor. And as you know, we studied the
compound in addition to the single indication that we're now waiting for FDA approval on. We studied it in
combination with other compounds including Gilead's compound and others, both NS5As and NUCs.
Our strategy has been to develop a very – the most potent protease inhibitor and combine it with other compounds in
the marketplace. And now I'm pleased to remind you that we've just acquired our own NS5A, with our acquisition of
the compound from GlaxoSmithKline. So obviously, we'll now develop a combination of our own. But to comment any
further about the actual utilization would be premature before the label and the outcome.
With respect to unlocking value. You know, you're right, we have talked about this many times. You've also heard us
describe our approach to healthcare as a comprehensive approach, having a broad base in healthcare. We believe that,
that is the best strategy for the long term to deliver both innovation and breadth of business and solutions to the
healthcare marketplace.
We believe we're best positioned by having a combined set of businesses that we currently have. And we think that
investors and others that follow us very closely understand the composition of our business and can certainly do a very
fair sum of the parts analysis by looking at the combination of each of the businesses and the appropriate growth rates
and above market, quite frankly, multiple that we think businesses like our Pharma business deserve.
So it's all readily available and easily done and we think the long-term strategy is one that's sound. And we continue to
subscribe to having a broad base of healthcare businesses to be most competitive in the marketplace for the long term.

Your next question comes from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Morning, Rick.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Good morning, everybody. Dominic, just a review. Gross margins, we're almost back at the 70%
gross margin level we saw throughout much of J&J's last decade. And I assume that the third quarter gross margin
performance was driven by the excellent Pharma results, which seem pretty sustainable. Knowing how focused you are
personally on driving efficiency throughout the organization broadly, Dominic, can we assume that, that kind of gross
margin performance we saw in the past, we're closer to that 70% level on a sustainable basis, perhaps closer at hand
than maybe we've appreciated? And maybe you could expand on your comments on the positive mix cost improvement
in the third quarter specifically?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure. Well, the comparison to last year's third quarter, just to be clear, last year's third
quarter included the step-up in inventory values from the acquisition of Synthes. So you see a 2.5 – or 250 basis point
improvement year-over-year and about 100 basis points is due to the non-repeat of the step-up in inventory values as
that's now flushed out of the system. But the rest of it, 150 basis points is primarily due to the mix of the business with
Pharma driving most of the growth. Pharma is in fact the highest gross margin business for us.
But in addition to that, we've seen good cost containment and cost efficiencies in our MD&D business. And of course,
as we continue to remediate under the consent decree, we will obviously, over time, show improvements in gross
margin from current levels to future in our Consumer business.
Having said that, our supply chain strategy is a long-term strategy. We've been at it now for a couple years and it
includes re-siting and redistributing where the products are manufactured. That takes time, Rick, to implement. But
we're obviously off to a good start and we expect that we'll continue to generate cost efficiencies within the supply
chain over an appropriate level of time, given the regulatory requirements et cetera, for re-siting products. So we're off

to a good start. We're very proud of it and thanks for pointing it out.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Great. Just a follow-up, a quick one for you and Michel. I was at NASS last week and several
CEOs suggested that maybe they were seeing some stronger procedure growth in the second half as folks do more
procedures ahead of 2014 January 1 deductible resets and constantly changing insurance coverage. Do you think you're
seeing any benefit, Michel? Dominic, feel free to chime in. And maybe talk a little bit, Michel, about the ATTUNE
impact. I assume as with all these kind of launches, it takes off gradually. Are you where you hope to be? And just
where are we in the ATTUNE launch?
<A - Michel Orsinger>: Okay. First of all related to spine, my takeaway from NASS was, in general, stakeholders are
expecting more and more evidence. We might see some uplift in the fourth quarter from a market point of view, people
who have been delaying and made use of their co-payment earlier might finally decide to go for surgeries.
ATTUNE, we are on track related to ATTUNE. Very important to us are the clinical outcomes, which are very good.
Surgeons' acceptance to try the product are also very good. So we are in the midst of launching not only now in the
U.S. but expanding into Europe and eventually Asia Pacific. The key question, in my opinion, will be how much of our
volume goes into current customers versus how much we give to new customers to convert. And this is a balance our
sales force needs to tackle. But so far, we are very confident that ATTUNE will have a good impact worldwide within
the next two to three years.

Your next question comes from the line of Derrick Sung with Sanford Bernstein.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Morning.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. One for Michel and then one for Dominic.
First, Michel, one of the longer-term concerns that investors have had about their ortho markets has been the potential
for a sort of generic or value segment offering to really penetrate and destroy pricing in the marketplace. The comments
that you made on trauma are the first that I think that we've really heard that maybe this is having some sort of a
near-term impact now. And I just wanted to get your comments on your view of whether or not you think the value – a
value segment offering is something that's here to stay in the U.S.? And if there's potential that it might spread from
trauma to hips to knees to spine and what the impact of that might be on the markets long term?
<A - Michel Orsinger>: Thank you. Certainly, the healthcare landscape is changing big time, and as mentioned before,
all stakeholders are looking for continuing to improve patient outcome but also to increase patient satisfaction and do
that at reduced cost. While the landscape is changing, we see emerging decision-makers like the providers, i.e., the
CEOs of the hospital, of groups. And having had the opportunity to meet many of them over the last few months, there
is a demand for value creation, there is a demand for transforming the healthcare delivery system, and there is a
demand to collaborate with larger companies.
Scale in the sense of DePuy Synthes, but also leveraging other opportunities within MD&D and within even other
Johnson & Johnson portfolios will give us the opportunity to work at a much higher strategic level with providers. And
yes, provide more cost-effective procedures, products, but also services to ensure that this kind of more total-oriented
solution and not just products on – not just focused on products will provide a relevant add-on solution to every single
stakeholder. So we are confident that now, being part of J&J, but combining those two companies, we can leverage
breadth of the portfolio, scale, and this is what matters more than ever before to the healthcare providers and payors, by
the way.

<Q - Derrick Sung>: But do you, Michel, feel that the value segment in the U.S. is here to stay in ortho? And does it
continue to grow from here?
<A - Michel Orsinger>: It depends how you define value segment. We define it as providing healthcare in a more
effective way. And this is not just focused on the product. This is not just focused on the price. You have to look at the
whole continuum. The patient goes through a process. We are developing new programs and services to educate the
patient, working with providers and clinicians to have protocols with standardized procedures, but eventually also
accompany the patients and their families in the rehab post-operatively. And this is what we see as a better value
offering, a more relevant offering, and not just focused on pricing and – yeah, on pricing and discounting.
The discussions will continue, obviously, to deal on pricing, but we have now, being part of a larger company, DePuy
Synthes and J&J, the unique opportunity to again leverage size and scale and create, beyond product innovation,
service and program innovation, which will create value. So in that sense, the value segment is becoming more holistic,
more complex, but representing a great opportunity for us
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Okay. Thank you, Michel. Understood. And Dominic, just quickly, I was wondering if you could
comment on the progress of the Ortho Clinical Diagnostics divestiture and where you are there? And I appreciate that
you may not be able to give us direct answer on the actual status, but more importantly, when you think about the
proceeds that might be generated from that transaction in the future, do those come – flow straight through back to
shareholders? Do they get re-invested? Can you give us a sense for what you might do there? Thank you.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure, Derrick. Well, with respect to the strategic – the evaluation of strategic options for
Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, we said it would take a 12- to 24-month period. We announced that in January. We're
progressing well. It's on track. We're moving through the process. Things are moving along well. So we're progressing
as planned. It's premature to give you any more insight into that. And then, obviously, whenever we do finally complete
the analysis and make a decision, that I think it would be premature to comment prior to that what we would do with
the proceeds. But when we're ready to talk about it, obviously we'll update investors at that time.

Your next question comes from the line of Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Swann.
<A - Danielle Antalffy>: Morning, Danielle
<Q - Danielle Antalffy>: Good morning, everybody. Thanks so much for taking the question. Dominic, I wanted to
ask about – understanding that you can't provide specific 2014 guidance, but over the last few quarters Pharma has
been a big driver of the top line, and I suspect bottom line outperformance. You know, as we come up on
anniversarying that strong performance, potential competition for recent new product launches or ramping competition
there, how do we think about where the next leg of growth is going to come for J&J overall in the near to medium
term?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure. Well, each of the businesses have substantial innovations that they're launching plans
for 2014 and beyond to launch substantial innovations across every one of our businesses. Pharma, you're right, has
experienced substantial growth as a result of new product launches, but those product launches are just beginning.
They've taken hold now, and we think they'll continue to do well. And then new products, as you've seen us develop
our strategy of continuing to in-license new products and launching those into the marketplace successfully, I think
you'll continue to see us do that. So I think each one of our businesses has a set of innovations that we plan to launch,
and each of the businesses should contribute to the growth going forward.
<Q - Danielle Antalffy>: Okay. Great. Thanks. And then within the Medical Device business in particular, one of your
competitors has recently talked more about sort of viewing the device business more holistically, providing full

change as it relates to that and where J&J stands with that? Any perspective there would be helpful. Thanks so much.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure, Danielle. Well, Michel talked at great length about that with respect to the
Orthopedics business, and I'd like to ask Michel to comment further because he's involved across the broad spectrum of
Johnson & Johnson's Medical Device businesses as well. But we see it as an important characteristic in the
marketplace, and one in which scale and breadth and the power of Johnson & Johnson should serve us well. Certainly,
there's very few companies that can match our scale and breadth in dealing with a comprehensive offering to hospitals.
But Michel has been there on the front lines with hospital CEOs and talking about the breadth and scale of Johnson &
Johnson even beyond orthopedics. So I'm sure, Michel, you can add a few comments as well.
<A - Michel Orsinger>: Yes, indeed. The key goal in our discussions with key partners is how we could provide value
in form of more holistic solutions. So far, the industry has been very much focused on surgeons and patients, obviously,
delivering good clinical outcomes. Now the healthcare delivery system needs to find new ways to do so in a more
cost-effective way. Hence, we are driving now not only a strong R&D pipeline, but a pipeline of new programs and
services, collaborating together with the partners. We don't have all the answers today, but we understand more and
more their needs. So elevating our relationship to a more strategic partnership with the providers in providing more
holistic solutions.
And maybe one word, a key advantage we have beside our already really relevant critical size within DePuy and
Synthes, talking about MD&D, more and more we find new ways to collaborate. For example, with global surgery,
who offer complementary products for one and the same procedure. So a procedure-based approach gives us also
opportunity to combine co-solutions from different pockets of the industry.

Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Hi. Good morning. Two questions. First, Dominic, number of selling days, any change in the
number of selling days this quarter? And then I wanted to just follow up quickly on a pricing question.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Yeah, I don't think – Glenn, good morning. I don't think the number of selling days is very
significant this quarter versus last. I wouldn't attribute any of the change to selling days.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Okay. And then second on pricing, you called out pricing several times on the device side,
particularly knees and hips as well as spine. So, one, can you tell me has pricing gotten worse or is it just the same type
of pressure? And then, Louise, sometimes you give us pricing in knees, hips, and spine. I wonder if you can do that for
us?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure. Let me just give you the overall. We expected at the beginning of the year that we
would – pricing would be a headwind for us this year of about 50 basis points in operating margin. We still think that's
the case now that we're nine months through the year. Pricing is in fact an overall headwind for the business in total.
And, Louise, specifically for these Orthopedics segments?
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: So this is U.S. only. So price in hips is down about 3% in the quarter. We have a positive mix
about 1.5%, so a net of negative 1.5% price mix for the hips in U.S. And as far as knees, price down about 1.5%, mix
up about 1%. Thank you.

And your last question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins with Bank of America.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Hi, Bob.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: Hey. Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just two quick questions. One, Dominic, I
just wanted to confirm something I heard earlier. You said in Q2 that BRIC growth for J&J was 19%, and I think you
said in Q3 it was 11%, 12%. Is that correct?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Well, no, Bob. I didn't say that. I think the person asking the question was stating
comments about the growth in the second quarter. I commented on year-to-date through nine months, the BRIC growth,
excluding Synthes, because that's very important to exclude Synthes in the analysis.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: Right.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Is 11% to 12% overall for Johnson & Johnson in the BRIC markets excluding Synthes.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: Okay. And then so it sounds like things are a little slower in Q3, which is I guess not
surprising. Was there any one division where that was more pronounced than another?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Well, a little slower overall, but I don't know that I'd point to any one particular division
versus another. I mean, there's dynamics in the China marketplace each and every quarter. So I would just say on an
overall basis greater than 10% growth is – we're pretty happy with that growth. I think we'll do – it will continue to be a
major driver of growth for us, but what we're seeing is double digit growth in the BRIC marketplaces but a little lower
than what everyone else has previously commented on as an expectation for BRIC growth of maybe mid-teens. We see
it's a little bit slower than that now.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: Okay. And then lastly for Michel, the comments on the hip market and your comments that
you feel like you're taking share and have been taking share the last couple quarters, I was just wondering, is that a
general comment because especially around Q3 because you don't see the rest of the market growing at the same rate as
