Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob?
Robert H. Benmosche
Good morning, everyone, and thank you, Liz, and I'm on slide 3. And clearly as you can see another – and let me
underline the word -- another strong quarter for AIG. We continue to show consistency and we show very strong across
the board earnings and fundamentals for all of our businesses.
And so two things that I know that you're focusing on that are not in the strong numbers, and that is what's going on
with the ILFC, so let me deal with that right up front. We're continuing to negotiate with the consortium. And keep in
mind, we don't have a buyer but we have a group that is buying ILFC. And so, this is a very complicated transaction
first on the nature of the transaction and who are the people that we're negotiating with and expecting to sell to.
So we are continuing that dialogue. We're continuing those discussions. We did not receive the money on time. And
now, both sides are working on whether we, and how we continue to do this. But we are focused on an IPO at this stage
of the game so that if they can come together and the money comes in, then we will proceed. If not, we are preparing
ourselves for later this year, for an IPO, where we hope to be able to do a deconsolidating trade with ILFC.
We also were named a SIFI during the quarter, which allows us to now deal with the AIG Bank. We had retained the
bank, but not because we wanted to keep the bank as a business. It's less than $1 billion, so we felt it was time to close
it. But we kept it such that we would be able to continue having the Federal Reserve in and getting started early with
the Federal Reserve. So that we're well prepared for when the SIFI designation comes in.
It has come in. But we are not under CCAR until late next year possibly for it or even the first quarter of 2015. So we're
still being regulated as a savings and loan holding company. And that's how it's proceeding. Although the auditing and
the efforts working with the Federal Reserve is about getting ready for our SIFI period of time when we're regulated by
those rules and regulations.
We were also named a G-SIFI again by being regulated by the Federal Reserve. We're assuming that will be the lead in
this effort as we think about global regulation. And we're going to continue to operate that way, looking at the Fed as
the lead regulator, working with the others. And hopefully that will simplify this very complex regulatory world that
we're now facing as a company.
As a result of the strong results of this quarter and quite frankly all the preceding quarters, we had recommended to the
board of directors, and after a review with the rating agencies, who were required to give us their green flag if you will
on capital management, the board has approved a $0.10 dividend per share as you saw. And also allowing us to begin
to buy back shares with an authorization of $1 billion.
In addition to that we said that those are priorities, but capital management on debt is also important. You saw we
reduced our debt. And in fact we've reduced our expense – interest expense by about half the dividend that we're going
to be paying out. So we got about a $300 million savings in interest. And we're talking about if the dividend continues
at the rate we're talking about, you're talking about $600 million basically for the year.
And we're continuing to see strong dividends from our subsidiaries with $1.3 billion of dividends and no repayments
[ph] of substance to the (05:20) insurance company. Our parent liquidity, absent the bank lines, which is on top of this,
we have almost $11 billion in cash. So we are really very strong both from a cash and capital point of view as well as
operating results.
Peter is going to talk about in just a minute the Property Casualty business. It is continuing its strong turnaround. You
can see that in the accident year losses, the ability to get rate where it makes sense. We're still growing the top line in a
very strong way. And you could see that our reserve is continuing to be maintained at roughly the levels we think is
necessary. The only exception, Peter will talk about this, is the add to the reserve for Storm Sandy, which as you know,

was a very serious storm and a very complicated storm to deal with.
On the Mortgage Guaranty front, we've talked about reentering that business. We've said that we are now on our way
with our new approach to risk selection. We think we've got a very good, well thought-out state-of-the-art process and
in fact, that's in the numbers that you see now as it's emerging, because about half of our earned premiums are coming
from our performance premium risk selection capability.
You will also see new business coming in, so while we have is strong risk selection model, we're continuing to show
strong growth. And of course in the legacy book, we're still seeing modest decline in our delinquency rates.
AIG Life and Retirement, again a very strong performer over time and for the quarter. Variable annuity sales continue
to be strong as others struggle with what to do with that business. Our mutual funds also are very positive. Assets under
management continue to grow, which is a key measure as you think about this business because you earn fees on assets
under management. And so it's really a very simple method to say that if those are going down dramatically, eventually
your fees will start to go down. Here, we're seeing good growth and good net flows from our businesses.
A lot of questions about low interest rate, isn't that a problem, isn't that a problem. It must be a problem, oh I'm sure it's
a problem. We have said to you quarter after quarter after quarter -- I guess that sounds like I'm repeating myself and I
apologize, but I do that once in a while. Clearly, the way that Jay's organization is dealing with this and the way the
investment department is dealing with it, we felt that it was within the realm of being able to manage it without severe
problems. And as you can see, again, this quarter, looking at our crediting rates, Jay and his team has done an
outstanding job of keeping our spreads pretty much what we need them to be.
And so in addition to that of course, when you have low interest rates putting some pressure on us, you also get the
opportunity with a well-designed book, you have the earnings benefiting from investment income during this quarter to
offset some of that drag.
So bottom line is we're having another great quarter. We're continuing to see strong fundamentals and we're optimistic
about our future.
So what I'm going to do now is turn it over to David, who will take you through the details of the quarter. David?
David L. Herzog
Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone. As Bob mentioned, we delivered another strong operating quarter and
we, importantly, continued to execute on our capital management objectives. With respect to ILFC, I would add that we
continue to think of ILFC as a non-core asset. It remains as a held-for-sale asset, given our intent and our plan to
monetize it through either a sale or an IPO, as Bob referenced.
On the operating front, we saw solid premium growth and positive pricing in our Property Casualty business, along
with continued improvement in the accident year loss ratio. Peter will talk about that in a moment. Life and Retirement
continued to actively manage spread and it also benefited from strong investment returns.
On the capital management front, we continue to optimize our capital structure. And through the first half of the year,
we've retired a little over $5.5 billion in debt, including $2.9 billion in face amount of debt and hybrids that we've either
tendered for, called, or repurchased. Of the total debt that we have retired year-to-date, approximately $1.2 billion of
that was associated with the direct investment book.
Going forward, we will opportunistically execute on our share repurchases as well as debt capital management. As Bob
mentioned, we reinstituted a dividend and have a further share buyback authorization, both of which point to our
positive view of future profitability and capital generation.
Turning to slide four, second quarter operating earnings per share were $1.12, up 17% from a year ago. Operating
ROE, which excludes AOCI from equity, was about 7.4% for the quarter on a basis consistent with our long-term
aspirational goals, which also excludes the deferred tax asset from equity. As we tax effect our operating earnings,

operating ROE was about 150 basis points higher.
Net income for the quarter was $2.7 billion and includes net realized capital gains and the related Dec. and loss
recognition effects on those gains, certain legacy legal settlement gains of roughly $260 million net of tax and a
deferred income tax valuation allowance release of approximately $700 million associated with our capital loss carry
forwards. Inception to date, we've been able to recognize a little over 50% of the deferred tax asset on our capital loss
carry forwards.
Book value per share excluding AOCI was $61.25, up almost 11% from a year ago. Reported book value per share
declined during the quarter to just over $66, reflecting the impact from the recent rise in interest rates. Operating results
begin on slide five. Each of our insurance operating businesses reported operating income improvements over a year
ago, driven by favorable fundamentals. And again, Peter and Jay will go into further detail.
The Direct Investment book and Global Capital Markets benefited from positive marks in the quarter. The Direct
Investment book earnings were driven by positive non-agency RMBS marks, reflecting housing price appreciation,
prepayments on the underlying collateral and spread tightening.
Global Capital Markets also benefited from amortizations and market appreciation on the underlying covered securities
in the legacy multi-sector CDS portfolio. This appreciation reduces the liability we carry on the related CEFs. Interest
expense for the prior year declined, reflecting the interest savings from our liability management actions we've
completed thus far. The corporate expenses, including the impact incurred during the quarter for continued
infrastructure build-out, were modestly higher than our expected run rate of about $225 million a quarter. There is
roughly $20 million or so of corporate expenses related to our datacenter consolidation that winds down going into
2014.
Operating results for the quarter included higher compensation expense related to share based legacy programs that are
tied to changes in AIG stock price. AIG stock price improved about $6 a share, which translates into about $100
million of total compensation expense for the company.
The effective operating tax rate was almost 32%, slightly higher than our expected run rate, reflecting certain discrete
items in the quarter. We continue to expect that the operating tax rate will be roughly in the 31% range for the second
half of 2013. And as you may recall we will not be paying any U.S. income taxes for some time given our NOLs,
which we expect could provide annual liquidity to the parent of approximately $1 billion in 2014 and beyond.
Our capital position remains solid and on slide six, you can see the current debt levels reflect the nearly $950 million in
liability management actions completed in the quarter.
During the quarter we called our -- $750 million of our 6.45% hybrids. We called them at par. And we purchased
nearly $200 million of debt in the open market. Annualized interest savings from the debt we retired this quarter is a
little over $60 million. And as Bob referenced the total savings for the annual activities that we will have completed
either through scheduled maturities, the active debt capital management completed for the full year will be about $300
million.
We received dividends from our insurance subsidiaries of $1.3 billion in the quarter or $2.7 billion year-to-date as
shown on slide seven. We continue to expect $4 billion to $5 billion in annual dividends and distributions from our
insurance subsidiaries, parent company cash, and unencumbered securities of approximately $11 billion at the end of
the quarter, reflect these distributions and liability management that I referenced earlier.
This parental liquidity includes about $5.4 billion related to the Direct Investment book and Capital – Global Capital
Markets, which is currently allocated towards future maturities and liabilities and also contingent liquidity stress needs.
Nearly 80% of the Direct Investment book's debt matures by the end of 2018.
And at this time I'd like to turn the call over to Peter to comment further on our Proper Casualty business. Peter?

Peter D. Hancock
Thank you, David. Morning, everybody. AIG Property Casualty results in the second quarter reflect continued progress
towards achieving our goals. Our second quarter results were driven by continued underwriting improvements and
better than expected alternative investment returns.
Turning to slide eight, net premiums written grew 4%, excluding the effect of movements in the yen and the accounting
changes for the excess of loss reinsurance premiums. Price increases and organic growth initiatives both contributed to
this growth. We continue to expect modest net premium growth for the remainder of 2013 as we continue to write
profitable new business.
Our accident year loss ratio as adjusted, of 61.9% for the quarter improved by 2.9 points from the second quarter of
2012 and was slightly better than trend. The improvement is due to business mix shift, continued enhanced risk
selection, loss mitigation initiatives, and positive pricing. Importantly, we see no signs that the trend is changing.
Operating income was nearly $1.1 billion and included catastrophe losses of $316 million from flooding in Europe and
the Americas, as well as U.S. tornadoes and hailstorms. Net unfavorable prior-year reserve development for the quarter
totaled $154 million net of premium adjustments, largely from additional losses on Storm Sandy of $142 million. These
losses resulted from higher severities on a small number of existing large and complex commercial claim notifications.
The increased severity was driven by a number of factors including the extensive damage caused to properties in the
downtown Manhattan metropolitan area.
On a year-to-date basis, net prior year development was favorable by $40 million if you exclude development related to
Storm Sandy and was unfavorable by $102 million including it. Turning to slide nine, Commercial's net premium
written on a reported basis grew by 5.5% from a year ago or 3.6% excluding foreign exchange and the accounting
change for excess of loss reinsurance.
We saw growth in Property, Financial Lines and Specialty which all benefited from improved retentions, new business
and pricing. In the U.S., we saw rate increases of 7.3% for the quarter, led by U.S. Casualty with 9.4%. Property and
Financial Lines in the U.S. reported positive rate of 5.7% and 6.8%, respectively.
The market remains modestly more competitive outside of the U.S., but we continue to be encouraged by Casualty
pricing in the U.S. where rate is most needed. Our efforts to optimize mix, enhance risk selection, claims handling
improvements and increased pricing have lowered the accident year loss ratio for Commercial to 62.2%, down over 5
points from the year-ago quarter.
Turning to slide 10, Consumer net premiums written grew about 5% excluding foreign exchange and the excess of loss
reinsurance accounting change. Accident & Health experienced growth outside the U.S., particularly in individual
A&H in Asia Pacific, as well as in direct marketing.
Net premiums written for our Direct Marketing business grew 5% for the second quarter of 2012, and accounted for
16% of total Consumer net premiums written. Consumer acquisition ratios increased a little over 2 points from last
year, and reflected our investment in the profitable direct marketing channel and other channels. The bulk of these costs
are non-deferrable under U.S. GAAP accounting rules. Personal Lines benefited from improved margins related to our
Japanese auto business and should continue to improve through the remainder of the year.
Slide 11 illustrates our investment portfolio mix. Second quarter net investment increased 14%, reflecting strong
performance of equity partnership investments and fair value increases associated with PICC Property Casualty shares
that were purchased during the second quarter and for which we elected the fair value option.
As a result of our strong alternative investment returns and the PICC gain, net investment income was about $150
million above our expected return. We made $792 million in dividend payments to AIG parent in the second quarter
and look forward to contributing our planned dividends to the holding company during the remainder of the year.
The second quarter marked continued progress towards increasing the intrinsic value of AIG Property Casualty. Our
shift to high value business, combined with underwriting and claims practice improvements, exemplified how our focus

on balancing growth, profitability and risk is helping to produce better margins. We maintain our commitment to
capital efficiency and optimizing our risk profile.
As part of our continuing legal entity and capital restructuring efforts, we recently announced the planned merger of
AIU and Fuji Fire and Marine companies in Japan. We expect synergies from merging these large companies -- will
result in improved customer service, greater management efficiency, as well as to provide us with greater capital
flexibility and expense savings. In closing, I'm satisfied with our positive momentum, and I'm confident that the
progress we made this quarter will continue.
Turning to slide 12, our Mortgage Guaranty business reported operating income of $73 million, which represented
another quarter of improved profitability and growth in new business. Delinquency counts continued to fall and in the
second quarter, half of earned premiums related to high quality business written off to 2008. Mortgage Guaranty results
for the quarter also benefited from $49 million of income associated with commutation, settlements and reserve
releases.
We believe UGC is well positioned to take advantage of the mortgage insurance market. The quality of the business
written since 2008, improvements in home pricing, and increasing home sales should drive future profitability and
allow UGC to capitalize on its unique underwriting approach, risk-based pricing, and strong capital position.
Now, I'd like to turn it over to Jay.
Jay Wintrob
Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to begin on slide 13, where you can see that AIG Life and
Retirement delivered solid results this quarter, with operating income of $1.2 billion, up 23% from a year ago. This
increase reflects growth in variable annuity fee income, effective spread management, and higher investment returns.
Premiums and deposits grew 24% from a year ago, largely due to individual variable annuity sales, which exceeded $2
billion in the quarter.
Net investment income increased 5% from the year-ago period, driven primarily by higher returns in our alternative
investment portfolio. Now this was partially offset by an $84 million fair value loss we reported on our investment in
PICC group shares this quarter, which we now hold at slightly above cost.
We continued our strategy of actively managing spreads in our interest-sensitive businesses. Our strong results this
quarter enabled us to provide additional liquidity to AIG Parent, and as David mentioned, Life and Retirement paid
$545 million in distributions to AIG in the quarter, and $1.9 billion during the first half of the year. We're on track to
meet our expected dividend payments for the full year.
Assets under management grew 10% from a year ago driven by increases across our business lines with strong account
value growth in individual variable annuities and group retirement, as well as additional institutional assets
accumulated through our stable value wrap business. Net flows increased substantially from the prior quarter and the
year-ago period, reflecting robust sales of variable annuities and retail mutual funds.
With the recent rise in interest rates, we saw the unrealized gain position in our general account partially erode,
dampening the increase in AUM in the quarter. Rising interest rates however, have a positive impact on sales and
earnings in our interest-sensitive businesses in particular, which I'll elaborate on later in my comments.
To provide additional insight into the diversity of our businesses, this quarter on page 13 we added disclosure on our
assets under management by product line. Our scale and highly diverse business mix provide a strong platform for
growth and enable us to perform well in various market environments.
Slide 14 further illustrates the diversity of our businesses based on earnings contribution. The solid performance this
quarter reflects favorable trends across both the retail and institutional segments. The growth of our Retirement Income
Solutions business is a good example of our ability to be opportunistic while maintaining our pricing and risk
management discipline.

After significant de-risking of living benefit features beginning back in 2010, we continue to benefit from strong
demand for our variable annuity product, and remain comfortable with the current trajectory of our sales run rate. At
quarter end, our variable annuity account value, including both fixed and separate accounts was $32 billion in our
retail, or individual variable annuity, business and $52 billion in our group variable annuity business.
Because of our large presence in qualified plans in the group business, 69% of our total variable annuity AUM provide
only a guaranteed minimum death benefit with no guaranteed lifetime benefits. And in addition, 77% of our GMDB by
account value is in the lower risk return of premium, or rollups that revert to return of premium at age 70.
Of our $22 billion of variable annuities with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits, 59% are in benefits with strong
de-risking features such as VIX indexing of fees, volatility control fund requirements, and required minimum
allocations to fixed accounts. So the combination of a relatively small legacy block and enhanced risk control in our
current features has allowed us to capitalize on opportunities when competitors have chosen or been forced to pull back
from the market.
Now in addition, this quarter we introduced a new suite of fixed index annuities with living benefits to further diversify
and enhance our guaranteed income offerings. In our interest-sensitive businesses in both the retail and institutional
segments, we continued our strategy of active spread management to enhance profitability.
And with the recent rise in interest rates, we are seeing an acceleration in sales of our fixed annuities, which we re-price
weekly. And we're encouraged by these initial indications as it remains our view that a moderately rising rate
environment will be positive for our operating fundamentals.
Slides 15 and 16 depict our investment portfolio composition, returns, and yields. Overall base yields improved slightly
in the quarter, benefiting from mortgage loan prepayments and increased accretion income, principally from structured
securities. These were partially offset by the impact of investment purchases made at yields lower than the weighted
average yield of the existing portfolio.
Our total or reported yield reflects strong alternative investment returns, partially offset by the fair value loss in PICC
group shares, which I mentioned earlier. Net spreads benefited from our active spread management actions, principally
the lowering of renewal crediting rates, and maintaining disciplined new business pricing.
At the end of the second quarter, approximately 74% of our fixed annuity and Universal Life account values were at
minimum guaranteed crediting rates and we remain focused on managing spreads actively.
To sum up, we're pleased with our solid earnings and distributions to parent through the first half of the year. We'll
remain focused on executing our growth strategies by leveraging our strong relationships with distribution partners to
increase profitable sales of our broad product portfolio across all channels while continuing to look for opportunities to
grow our businesses where we can achieve the most attractive risk-adjusted returns.
And now, I'll turn it back to Liz to open up the Q&A.

<Q - Joshua D. Shanker>: Sorry, hello. Yes, thank you. Good morning, everyone. As the capital return story unfolds
and you get dividends from your subs, maybe ILFC closes, I'm wondering in the conversations you've had with the
rating agencies, what kind of mix of debt -- of retirement versus share repurchase are you thinking to keep in good
stead with them?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: We have not had that level of conversation. We go to the rating agencies when we have
something specific to say we want to do, but as overarching, we continue to focus on. We've taken care of the dividend,
doesn't mean we might want to increase that but our focus is on debt and share buybacks. But David, do you want to
comment?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Yes, thanks, Bob, and good morning, Josh. As we think about our capital management, we've
discussed in the past a targeted capital structure and we're nearing that optimal mix of debt and capital. We still do have
some expensive hybrids out that are of interest to us but that'll occur over time. We have taken an approach with the
agencies with the other various stakeholders with respect to our capital management that we first raise the deployable
capital, get it to the holding company; we then run through a rigorous set of internal stress tests and analytics. And then
we consider the best way to deploy the capital. So we do not get out in front of ourselves with respect to spending it
before we get it.
<Q - Joshua D. Shanker>: Understandable. And Peter, can you talk a little bit about where you are on Sandy in terms
of approaching the full limit of your – I guess your deductible for the reinsurance?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: We haven't disclosed the attachment point on the reinsurance, but suffice it to say that we
don't expect to pierce it, but on the other hand we're not too far from it when you actually look at what we expect the
ultimate to be. But in terms of where we are in terms of the remaining tail, we're about 50% settled and about a third
paid, cash out the door, on the Sandy claims. But there's still a number of repairs underway as we speak. So it'll be
probably another quarter before we really get to a final number.
<Q - Joshua D. Shanker>: Okay, thank you. And congratulations on the good announcements.

And we will take our next question from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill.
<Q - J. Paul Newsome>: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for the call. I was wondering if you could go just in a
little bit more detail into the steps that allowed you to announce the dividend and the repurchase. And I guess I'm
surprised that you were able to do this before the ILFC transaction. So maybe if you could just talk a little bit more
about how that process worked in terms of discussions with the regulators as well as your own thinking. And what's left
that's contingent, if anything, on capital management given the ILFC transaction?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: I'm not sure I understand the last question. You want to know how much more I'm
going to do. I'm not sure I would give you a specific answer, so let me give you a general answer. The way you -- what
we did is, I know you're going to think I'm being trite, but I'm not. The fact is, you first get your fundamentals right,
make sure the company is operating well, make sure all of the buckets of risks have been accounted for. And we have a
very – well, we need to improve our stress-testing, we have to improve the systems, improve the process, improve the
automation, to be much more industrial strength in terms of what we do.
We have a process that we know works well, and so you really need to satisfy yourselves as a management team that
we can afford to do capital management. That's number one.
Number two, we then sit down with the rating agencies and walk them through what we want to do. And they give us
their opinion based upon the information we've provided them and the track record we're showing them. And then we
spend considerable time with our board of directors who want to make sure that we're not being premature in some of
the things we want to do as a management team. And we spend a great deal of time with the board in detail taking them
through our whole capital planning process, taking them through our stress-testing.

For example, our stress testing is basically modeled using a lot of the information from the Federal Reserve. But as I've
said before, when you think about – and I think it's a shame that America doesn't understand the amount of stress
testing that is done at financial institutions to make sure – forget about being too big to fail, they can't fail because of
what they are required to maintain on their books.
So for AIG, we go through a process that says over the planning period of 2013 and 2014, what would happen if we
underperformed our profit budget by $23 billion? What happens during that same time if the S&P is down close to
700? What happens if the credit aspect of credit spreads, not interest rate sensitive, but what happens if we have a
period of WorldCom, Enron, and you pick any other periods you want? And so credit spreads widen dramatically,
about 400 basis points. And at the same time, what happens if unemployment doesn't go to 10% – in the 10s% but goes
to 12.5%?
And by the way, if that's not enough, what would happen to AIG if in fact housing prices were to drop 20% from here,
knowing the amount of mortgages we have on our books, plus the mortgage insurance business as well. And by the
way, since you're an insurance company, why don't you throw a Storm Sandy in there and make sure that you've got
enough money to cover that storm at the same time.
That's in English, what a stress test is and I've given it to you at 10,000 feet. And we showed the board that after all of
that, we could maintain our CMA levels, maintain the risk-based capital in this company, at those levels which are
required for our ratings.
I would think if that kind of scenario occurred, the states would be really pleased that we could at least meet our
minimum regulatory requirements and work our way back up. We're not talking about minimums. We're talking about
the CMA levels. And so based upon that, the board said we think it's sound for you to, at this time, proceed with your
dividend and proceed with a $1 billion share buyback.
If ILFC closes or when ILFC closes, the board will look at what we prepare. We will then update our stress test, update
the information, we will share it with the board, we will share it with the rating agencies. And based upon all of that,
the board will make a decision.
And so that's how the process works. I know people are asking, well did the Fed approve it. The Fed does not approve
these things. The Fed oversees what we're doing, and if the Fed felt at any point in time that we're doing something as a
savings and loan holding company, they would go and say, look I think you're being imprudent.
But they don't approve things. Once we get under the CCAR test however, then they will in fact look at our CCAR,
look at the amount of capital we have, and look at the process we have in place to calculate that information.
And based upon the quality of our systems, and we have a runway to get there and we're working hard along that
runway, and that's why we wanted to – actually people said, are you nuts, why would you want to start early? It's
because you want to get prepared so that you have an acceptable process. And it's a repeatable process such that the
Fed is very comfortable that not only do you have numbers that say you're okay, but you have a process that says your
numbers are okay.
And that's all what we're working towards, and that's something at the end of 2014, into early 2015. But for now it's
making sure we live with the first half of what I said, and that is we run the company the right way, and we're being
prudent.
Long-winded answer, I apologize, but I know a lot of you are trying to figure out what happened here, and it's what we
said all along. When we're ready, we will.
<Q - J. Paul Newsome>: That was a terrific answer. Thank you very much. It's very helpful.

<Q - Jay Cohen>: Thank you. A couple of questions. I guess just a follow-up on that last one. So while the Fed didn't
explicitly approve this, you obviously had discussions with them prior to making this announcement.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: We inform the Fed of everything we're doing of any consequence so that they're aware
of any issues we have that they – so they don't read about it in the paper. And so yes, they're our regulator, they're
aware of all of our – they're in many of our meetings, they're in many of my leadership meetings, attending them. So
this is important that you keep your regulator understanding what you're doing and you are very transparent with that
regulator. And so they're aware of not only this but everything else we're doing.
<Q - Jay Cohen>: That's great.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: And by the way Jay, the key is the rating agencies. And that's where – right now that's
where we go. And if the rating agency said we're having some concerns with what you're doing, I can assure you we
would not have done it.
<Q - Jay Cohen>: Exactly. Second question, I know the details of any prior year development will come out in the Q.
But Peter, I'm wondering if you could talk, excluding Sandy, the Sandy development, what you saw? Were there any
particular lines where there was material adverse development?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: No, it's very benign. Everything was immaterial in the context of our results. So I don't know
whether John, you want any particular comments?
<A - John Q. Doyle>: Yes, I certainly agree with the way Peter described it. We had some movement up and down, or
I guess within Casualty, some loss sensitive adjustments that were offset by premium accruals. But outside of that we
had a bit of an adverse development in a construction [ph] de fret (41:23) related claims out of a program that's been in
runoff for a number of years, largely around legal expenses, but inconsequential, immaterial relative to the total.
<Q - Jay Cohen>: That's great. Thank you.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: And we had a slight favorable in Japan Consumer so...
<A - John Q. Doyle>: Right.
<Q - Jay Cohen>: Good. Thanks, guys.

And we will take our next question from Jay Gelb with Barclays.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Thank you. Can you give us a sense of how long you think it would take to complete the $1 billion
buyback authorization?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: I would appreciate giving you all advance notice, but we will continue to do what's
prudent. And we'll continue to evaluate different options and different techniques. And so for now we'll let you know
when we're done. And we'll keep you posted as we buy them back and what the average price per share is.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: In terms of future buybacks on top of this authorization, is there anything – does the sale or IPO of
ILFC need to be complete before we can expect additional buybacks to this authorization?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: What I said on the – when I was asked the other question, we look at our capital. We
look at our results. We look at how we're faring. We do our stress testing. We update our stress testing throughout the
year. And we would continue to do what we think is prudent and for AIG. And so if ILFC were to close, and depending
upon what kind of transaction we do, we would factor that into our thinking.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Okay. And then for Peter, based on the first half result, it still appears that there's 5 to 10 points of
combined ratio improvement that's needed to get to that 90% to 95% calendar year goal by 2015. What's your

confidence level in achieving that?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Well I think that I sort of listed out the various initiatives that have led to the trend in
accident year loss ratio improvement that we've had now for 10 quarters. And I think that there's no sign that any of
those initiatives are sort of experiencing diminishing returns.
So eventually obviously we will experience diminishing returns, but we're making good progress on all of them. The
actuaries take time to recognize initiatives that are emerging in the loss triangles but may not be confirmed with enough
statistical significance yet.
So we have sort of some line of sight into the sort of future momentum. Obviously pricing is outside of our control. But
again as I mentioned where we felt there was the greatest pricing inadequacy in the U.S. Casualty lines, we continue to
have seen quite good pricing trends. And in Europe where the pricing has been a bit softer we already had pretty decent
adequacy.
So I see no change in my level of confidence that we will accomplish that target.
<Q - Jay Cohen>: Great. And then in the meantime does that also mean you have confidence in the adequacy of AIG's
overall Property Casualty reserve position?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Yes.
<Q - Jay Cohen>: All right thank you.
Operator
And we will take our next question from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar>: Hi good morning. The first question is on the PNC business. Your expense ratio picked up a
little bit sequentially. And I think you've talked in the past about expenses being elevated in the near term as you're
investing in the business, but then starting to improve sometime in 2014 and beyond. Are you still comfortable with
that?
And then on the ILFC transaction, I don't think there's a breakup fee. And when you talk about deconsolidating trade,
I'm assuming you're implying over a 50% sale. But I just wanted to make sure that that's correct.
And the last question is on the Fixed Annuity business. We've seen industry sales improve as rates have gone up. Your
sales sequentially were actually down and your surrenders were up. Not sure if that's because the block is aging, or
what's going on there?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Well as I've said before on the expenses, yes we are spending on infrastructure and a number
of analytical resources, data improvements that are integral to our improved risk selection and claims handling. And so
we're seeing benefit in the loss ratio offset by increases in the GOE ratio. And we continue to invest in acquisition
costs. So the overall expense ratio remains elevated. I would expect the GOE ratio to come down as you point out in
that sort of mid-2014 period. And so a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of investments will start to tail off in that period.
The one area though I would point out where there may be slightly more, a delayed expense benefit, is what I
announced in the comments earlier, which is the merger savings between AIU and Fuji Fire and Marine, which is a
very substantial merger integration effort that will take some time to do because – to execute because of the sheer scale
of it. It's, between the two companies, almost 6,000 people. So it's very substantial.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar>: Okay.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Jay, why don't you cover the fixed annuity comment and then turn it over to David
who'll finish up with the question on ILFC.

<A - Jay Wintrob>: Great. Thanks. And Jimmy, I think your presumption is correct. Being the largest in the fixed
annuities, we probably have the biggest book and the block is aging. And that's as expected leading to higher
surrenders, which because the vast majority of those surrenders are from contracts with high guaranteed minimum
interest rates, 3% and above in some cases, that's actually a very good thing from a profitability standpoint. We did see
some interesting competitors come in early in the quarter and increase their sales. We stuck with our pricing discipline
as we always do.
And having said that late in the quarter and through the month of July as I mentioned earlier, we have begun to see an
acceleration in sales of fixed annuities now that rates have spiked up. So the block is behaving as expected. And again
the vast majority of what's surrendering is at high guaranteed minimum interest rates.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: I would just follow up and we've said this I believe on a previous call, and that is that
Jay is – and his team are holding to a very strong discipline. Because when you think about rising interest rates, and I
don't need to – if you look at book values this quarter, you all understand it clearly of what can happen with rising
interest rates. You don't want to have a very tightly priced fixed annuity book sitting at these rates right now.
And if you do see a couple hundred basis points rise, that will be very helpful for AIG and for Jay's business. But if you
have a large block of low interest rate annuities, fixed annuities in that kind of environment, you could see some
extensive disintermediation.
And so a part of our hedging strategy is to make sure we don't have an oversized book at these levels that we have to
worry about rates going up and what happens to that block. So I think right now we see rising interest rates, at least for
the first couple hundred basis points, as a big positive for the company.
<A - David L. Herzog>: And Jimmy, it's David. With respect to your ILFC question, as I said in my remarks, ILFC is
a non-core asset. And we will pursue our plan to dispose of it either through a sale or through an IPO. And with respect
to the sale again – and you had asked about the breakup fee – the deposit is not a breakup fee. But you could – we will
protect our rights to that deposit. So that's all I would say with respect to that.
Then with respect to the 51%, yes that is the level at which we'd deconsolidate it. And we of course would evaluate
market conditions and valuations, et cetera, at the time of an IPO to optimize the value of that monetization for the
benefit of AIG and our stakeholders. So we haven't set any [ph] predetermined (50:25) notion, but we'll optimize the
value.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar>: And then protecting – I don't understand what protecting the rights on the deposit means,
maybe you could just...
<A - David L. Herzog>: Well with just – I'm not going to say any more than that, just we'll protect them. It is not a
breakup fee, which was your question.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar>: Okay.
<A - David L. Herzog>: And we'll move to – we'll pursue our rights under the terms of the contract.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar>: All right. That's what I thought. And maybe if I just ask one more. I think Peter mentioned
that the actuaries were being somewhat conservative in their loss [ph] fix (50:58). So I'm assuming that that's implying
that there's some level of cushion in your reserving. Is that the right read? And if that is the case then how do you
reconcile that with the fact that if you look at the last six quarters, you've had I think four of those quarters where
you've had actually adverse reserve development?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: What he said was – let me be really clear – that until you see the emergence of a pattern
that the actuaries are comfortable with is not a short-term blip, but in fact that's what we call vectors in math, but you
begin to look at it over an extended period of time till you have a clear pattern. Until that emerges, they're not going to
make some early judgments.

The judgments they make are what they believe is the best estimate and the most accurate estimate based on the data
that they're seeing. So they want to see more of an observable period before they make any judgment. So that's what he
said, and so don't misinterpret it.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar>: All right. Thank you.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: And I'd also add that the reserve adjustments that you witnessed in the last 2.5 years have
been largely related to older accident years. And I have been talking about accident year loss ratios and the impact of
new underwriting guidelines and risk selection techniques. So they will take longer to emerge, and so I think they're
really separate issues.

And we will take our next question from Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: Hi good morning. Thanks for having us on the call. And congratulations, a good quarter and
exciting news. So a question on capital returns. When you began this journey you guided to $25 billion to $30 billion of
capital management. So rough math, I think you're somewhere around $9 billion to $14 billion remaining by 2015.
As you're now finally being allowed to act like a normal company, should investors expect measured, regular, and
recurring buybacks like we see at your peers? Or is this something where we should expect this to be very opportunistic
and episodic as we've seen over the past couple of years?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: I'm going to turn it over to David. But I would say that our first – and really we said
dividends, capital management. But our first priority is to find businesses that may be strategic and make sense for AIG
and are not closed blocks but growing block. So we'd like to continue to invest our money in those businesses.
We're going to continue to look at the best way to deploy our capital. With the stock price as you saw last night where
it's at. And you have our book value, and you see what's going on. Obviously as you get closer and closer to book, you
want to think more carefully about what you're doing. If you get over book, you think a lot about what you want to do.
So I think all of that as an overarching concept, which is not new to any of you.
David, why don't you talk about the particulars on our aspirational goals?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Yes. Sure. Thanks, Josh. And just again to recap, we've done a total to-date of about – a little
over $18 billion with the $13 billion of equity we did last year, equity buyback, a little over $3 billion of debt capital
management going after some of the callable, very expensive hybrids, the recent share buyback we just announced on
the authorization, and then the couple of years' worth of the dividend. They sort of add up to $18 billion.
And you're right. It's – so we've got $7 billion to $12 billion to go and I think what the fundamental foundation as we've
said is we raised the deployable capital to the holding company. And a very important part of that is the dividend flows
that both Jay and Peter referred to, is raise the deployable capital.
In addition to that we have the ILFC proceeds that will – that are unencumbered up at the holding company. And I also
referenced in my comments about the tax-sharing payments that in 2014 should be in the $1 billion range. And they
grow from there, and they're annual after that.
So you can see a path and we can see a path to raising the deployable capital. And then that is input to the framework
that Bob laid out in terms of how we and how the board and the various stakeholders think about how we go about
deploying it.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: It could be lumpy.

<A - David L. Herzog>: Yeah it's likely going – again it's going to be opportunistic as we have done in the past. It is
going -- we will be prudent. And I think Bob laid out a very clear framework for how we think about it and how you
should think about it.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: That's helpful. Thank you. If I might switch to Peter, you guys have made a really, relatively
dramatic progress in accident year loss ratios and combined ratios in P&C commercial and it's great to see that playing
out. The question I would ask is as you sort of continue the journey to get to a low 90s combined ratio, the Consumer
lines don't seem to be sort of going the same direction and it looks like maybe there's some noise in the quarter. But just
generally I wonder if you can give us some more color on the relative magnitude of some of the key levers and sort of
how you think about the status of the initiatives on that side of the house.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Sure. So the big noise in the quarter is the yen exchange rate. So there's a very, very big
portion of our Consumer business in Japan, and so you need to strip that out before you even think about it. There's I
think some significant opportunities in Japan to improve profitability as we talked about in terms of both the expenses,
but also as we reinvigorate the brand in Japan.
So outside of Japan, there's another sort of one-off item that came through the loss ratio but not net income, which is in
one very large extended warranty program, where there's an offsetting profit sharing agreement that is not in the – so
it's an issue of geography on the income statement. So that's a one-off adjustment you need to make when you look at
the loss ratio in the second quarter.
And beyond that, I think that the emerging market story is very positive in terms of long-term profitability and growth.
But the start-up costs of that are quite substantial so that adds to the expense ratio. And we've talked many times about
the Direct Marketing business, which we feel has excellent lifetime profitability over customer relationships but has
pretty unfavorable GAAP accounting. So we want to take a measured approach to how much of that we do, but we like
it from a marginal ROE point of view over the lifetime of the customer relationships, based on the persistency that
we've been seeing in that book. And so we'll be doing that in a number of additional countries.
So I think in general, we see continued growth in Consumer. I think we have opportunities to focus more than we do
today. We operate in 90 countries. And so I think that that will bring some efficiency gains and the convergence to
common technology platforms will make it also more efficient.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: Great. Thank you. Keep up the good work.
<A - Elizabeth A. Werner>: Operator, I think that since we're getting close to 9:00, we'll only be able to take one
more question. But please reach out after the call with your additional questions and we will certainly do our best to
follow up as soon as possible.
Operator
Thank you, ma'am. And we will take our final question from Mark Finkelstein with Evercore.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Good morning, everybody. Maybe I'll start with Peter on International Commercial.
The numbers were just a little bit lighter than I had expected, maybe user error. But I guess the way I would frame up
the question is, and I get the point about less need for rate than you have in North America, but are you satisfied with
these margins and do you feel like you need to improve them on a core basis in terms of achieving your overall targets?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: I think that, again, there's a little bit of a foreign exchange element in terms of the top line
there, and there is continued opportunities for streamlining technology and reaping the full benefits of legal entity
consolidation. As you may know, at the end of last year, we consolidated all 25 European countries into one legal entity
and that's starting to give us efficiencies, but on the capital efficiency, that hasn't fully come through. But in general,
the International business has a better ROE because it's shorter tail, less dependent on investment income.
And I'd say that the success of our Property business – Commercial Property business internationally has been very
pleasing. We've seen a good take up rate of our large limit, highly-engineered Property activities, further diversifying

of Asia, 18% growth in the quarter; Middle East and Africa, 19% growth; 27% growth in Latin America. Obviously,
those are smaller parts of our overall Commercial insurance franchise.
And in terms of pricing or rate adequacy, on a major line basis, right, so if you think of it from a Property, Casualty,
Financial Lines and Specialty point of view, all of our major regions outside of the United States in those major lines
cover their cost of capital currently. There are some opportunities for margin improvement. And obviously, there are
some smaller lines that in any given jurisdiction have some profitability challenges that we'll always be dealing with.
There were some cats in the quarter, right, as well, in Argentina; modest amount in Australia; and then the flooding in
Europe as well. So all those events had an impact on the bottom line in the quarter. But we think we're very well
positioned outside of the United States, and inside the United States, but we see good opportunities for profitable
growth all throughout the rest of the world.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Okay. Maybe a question on the DIB. I think every quarter I look at my model and what
you guys produced, and at least for the last four or five, I feel like the DIB has beat my expectations pretty widely in a
lot of cases. And I guess you've got 80% of the maturities coming within 2018, I think you said. Maybe the way to ask
the question is how far do you think we are from that so-called intrinsic value? And is there any framework for how to
think about DIB earnings going forward?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Brian, you want to cover that for us as we close down the call?
<A - Brian T. Schreiber>: Sure. I'd be happy to. And again, the performance of the DIB is not going to be linear.
We've had market conditions that have allowed us to recognize the gains you've seen over the last few quarters. And as
we talk about, we gave some rough ideas of what we think the pull to intrinsic is. At the end of last quarter, we said it
was around $5 billion, a little under $5 billion. We've had approximately $750 million or so of gains, and we've also
sold some assets in the DIB to the operating companies.
So those, the gains and the sales of those assets reduce that future upside. So if you think about it now, at around $4.1
billion, $4.2 billion that's probably where we are, but another way to think about it is if you look at the DIB capital, the
NAV of the DIB, and you look at the composition of the assets, you could think about it as having roughly a 10%
return on that capital over time.
And again, that's probably the simplest way to think about it if you're trying to model. And this will come in again over
time. We could have down quarters. Again a lot of it depends on the markets, but I think from the 2018 period forward,
you're probably looking at six to eight years before you see a bulk of that capital start freeing up and coming through.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you.
<A - Brian T. Schreiber>: Sure.
