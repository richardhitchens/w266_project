Ursula M. Burns
Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. During the first quarter we delivered results in our services business
that aligned with our growth strategy and our expectations. However, we fell short in our document technology
business, which put pressure on our overall results. We'll talk today about the consistent trends that we see in our
business, with services becoming a larger part of our total revenue now at 55%, and fueling our annuity base which is
now 86% of total revenue.

And we'll discuss the consistent trends that we're seeing in the marketplace, which require faster implementation of
business model changes. We remain focused on earnings expansion and generating strong cash flow and we remain
committed to our full year expectations on both.
Here is a closer look at Q1 results. We reported adjusted EPS of $0.27. This includes a $0.02 benefit from the reduction
of a litigation reserve. As a result, earnings were above our guidance. In services we delivered 4% revenue growth
along with a stable segment margin and a 64% increase in the TCV of signings to $3.7 billion. Again the results in our
services business were as expected for the first quarter with signings coming in better than expectations and margins
slightly lower. We're making steady progress on managing the cost base to improve the profitability of the services
business as we continue to ramp for growth – for more growth.
In document technology, revenue was down 9% and segment margin declined 1.7 points. Q1 performance was weaker
than expected due to timing issues with our recent ConnectKey launch of mid-range products as well as continued
tough market conditions.
I'll provide more detail in a moment but want to assure you that we understand the issues and are taking immediate
actions to address them, including plans to reinvest our earnings upside in Q1 to accelerate restructuring activities in
Q2. During Q1, we used $87 million in operating cash. That's in line with normal seasonality and reflects a temporary
increase in inventory.
On the next slide, we'll take a closer look at the income statement. Total revenue of $5.4 billion was down 3%
reflecting growth in services and weaker than expected revenue in document technology. Based on our product backlog
and steady growth in services, I am confident top line results will improve throughout the year. During Q1, lower
revenue put pressure on margin. As a result, operating margin of 7.4% was down 1.1 points from last year.
Here's what contributed to the margin decline in the quarter. First, as with any major product launch, we made
investments, incremental SAG investments in Q1 to support the ConnectKey announcement, invested in sales training,
channel outreach and marketing. We planned for the initial revenue benefit from the launch to offset the incremental
costs. But the revenue ramp got off to a slower start and total Q1 document technology revenue declined more than our
expectations. So the revenue shortfall resulted in SAG at a higher percent of revenue. Some of this will self-correct as
revenue picks up both for ConnectKey and in our production color business. But as I mentioned, we'll implement a
higher level of cost actions in Q2.
Second, services is a larger part of our total revenue. As a result, margin is impacted by higher growth in lower margin
businesses such as IT outsourcing and transactional BPO. In Q1 our adjusted other was $12 million, that's down $67
million due to the litigation reserve reduction and lower restructuring. Equity income of $47 million grew $7 million
driven by profit growth of – at Fuji Xerox and the adjusted tax rate was 22%. This includes a benefit from the Taxpayer
Relief Act. Adjusted EPS of $0.27 was $0.04 higher than 2012. I remain confident that we'll deliver solid earnings
growth in 2013 benefiting from our cost actions, share repurchase, portfolio expansion, and services growth.
On slide 6, we'll review our services segment. The 4% revenue increase in services reflects steady growth in BPO
which was up 3%, ITO which was up 13% and document outsourcing up 1%. And here's a closer look at each of these
areas. Business process outsourcing represents more than 60% of our total services revenue. We're benefiting from
strong growth in transactional processing and state government services. This was partially offset by volume declines
in other areas.
We're quite pleased with the organic growth in BPO and had less contribution from acquisitions in this space. Keep in
mind that in Q1 of last year, BPO increased 13% giving us a tough year-over-year compare. I'm also pleased with the
solid performance in IT outsourcing is the benefit of mega deals that we signed in 2011. In document outsourcing,
growth was lower in the quarter. A slower start to the year than we expected. But signings for new managed print
services and renewals were quite strong and will flow through to improved revenue later in the year.
As a matter of fact, total signings were our good story across the board. They were up 64% year-over-year. Renewals
were particularly strong as well this quarter. The renewal potential and the high success rate is reflected in our 89% win
rate. New business annual recurring revenue was up 8% year-over-year. The pipeline is up 5%, a steady growth even

with strong signings. Segment margins of 9.3% was flat. We offset negative mix and pricing with cost reductions.
In quarter two we have a tough compare from last year's 10.6% margin, but we'll continue to press for efficiency while
never compromising on client satisfaction. So we expect Q2 segment margin around 10%, reflecting strength in BPO
and ITO and a lower margin from document outsourcing. For the full year we continue to expect to be in a 10% to 12%
range with modest year-over-year improvement. So services in summary, revenue metrics trending well and margin
holding ground delivering solid performance as expected.
To turn to slide 7 for a review of our document technology business. In document technology, we expected a revenue
decline of mid-single-digits. During Q1 revenue came in lower at a 9% decline driven by a 12% decline in equipment
sales. In reviewing the results here's where we saw the shortfall on revenue which created pressure on segment margin
and here's why we're confident that the results will improve going forward.
First, lower than expected performance from Europe and some spot weakness in developing markets resulted in lower
post-sale revenue. We continue to have our eyes wide open to the macro trends. That's why we're scaling investments
in higher growth areas not only in outsourcing services but also in color printing and expanding distribution to small
and mid-sized businesses. Install rates are good indicators of our progress in these areas. A4 color MFDs up 16% and
high-end color up 44%.
Second, in February we announced ConnectKey. It's a software system embedded in 16 new Xerox multifunction
printers. Some of which began shipping in Q1 and many that are shipping now in Q2. This is a significant launch for
our mid-range business. As I said, the install ramp started a bit later than expected. It has since picked up and we now
have a healthy backlog that will serve us well during the year.
For the balance of 2013 here's what we'll contribute to revenue improvement. A full launch of ConnectKey; new
high-end color systems, including advanced iGen presses and the addition of Impika inkjet printers and expanded
coverage of SMB through our global imaging distributors and through additional indirect channel partners. These are
all profitable growth drivers to help offset uncertainty related to macro conditions.
Again, focusing on the cost base continues to be a priority. We're making progress in taking cost out of a legacy
infrastructure but we need to accelerate this progress especially in Europe. Considering our expectations for improving
equipment revenue and the competitive price environment, Q2 segment margins will be somewhat lower
year-over-year but sequential improvements from Q1.
Slide 8 is a look at cash flow in the quarter. Cash from operations in Q1 is in line with seasonality. The $87 million use
of cash is a bit weaker than in 2012 but that's largely due to a temporary increase in inventory. Accounts receivable was
less of a cash use in the quarter due to lower reliance on factoring in Q4. In line with our expectations, finance
receivable was less of a source of cash. Also as anticipated, cash contributions to our global pension plan was lower
year-over-year by $34 million and this reflects our expected full year decline of $150 million.
Moving down to investing; we spent $107 million on CapEx and $58 million on dividends, and as we announced in
February, our quarterly dividend will increase by 35% effective with dividends payable in April. Cash from financing
was a much smaller source of cash and last year we went to market in Q1 to prefund a May note. This year we have a
smaller note coming due in May of $400 million. We plan to retire this note in line with our debt reduction guidance.
And as a result, debt of $8.5 billion was lower year-over-year by $1.1 billion and flat to year end. And $4.9 billion of
our debt is associated with our financing business.
We did a nominal amount of share repurchase in Q1 driven by our cash flow timing. We continue to plan on
repurchasing at least $400 million in shares this year, weighted towards the second half in line with cash flow. And we
continue to expect $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion in cash with no change to capital allocation plans.
Let's turn to slide 9 for a wrap up and then we'll take your questions. In summary, I call our performance mixed in the
quarter. Again, I am pleased with services and we're seeing improving trends especially in reducing the cost base,
delivering stable segment margin and growing signings. These results are strategically important to the transformation
of our company, but I'm disappointed in the slow start to the year in the document technology business. I also believe

that we understand the issues in our control and that we're taking the right actions to make progress from here.
Our product innovation brings differentiated value. We're investing in areas of growth like in services, high-end color
and in SMB distribution and we're divesting in lower growth, non-core areas like our North American paper business.
Our pricing is competitive and we continue to take cost actions to maximize profit. Across our entire business we'll
continue to rationalize our portfolio and restructure our cost base to create a leaner and more flexible business model.
So for the full year, we expect total revenue to come in at the low end of our flat to 2% range. Our full year guidance
for earnings, for cash flow and capital allocations remains unchanged. For the second quarter, we expect adjusted EPS
of $0.23 to $0.25. Again, we plan to increase restructuring activities in Q2. Approximately $0.02 of restructuring is
comprehensive in our second quarter guidance.
Expected first half results will keep us on track to meet our full year guidance of adjusted EPS of $1.09 to $1.15. With
improving margins, cost controls and steady growth we'll consistently expand earnings and generate strong cash. We'll
continue to take a balanced approach to our capital allocation, which creates value for our shareholders.
That's a good place for me to end. Before we open it up to questions, let me turn it over to Jim Lesko, Head of Investor
Relations. Jim?
James H. Lesko
Thanks, Ursula. Joining Ursula today is Lynn Blodgett, Head of Xerox Services; and Armando Zagalo de Lima, Head
of our document technology business. Also, let me point out that we have several supplemental slides at the end of our
deck. They provide more financial detail to support today's presentation and compliment our prepared remarks.
For the Q&A, I ask participants to limit yourself to one question, and one follow-on question, so we can get to
everyone. At the end of our Q&A session, I'll turn it back to Ursula for closing comments. Operator, please open the
line for questions now.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] your first question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much. It's a question for Ursula and Lynn. I'm not sure who wants to take it.
But looking at the services business you'd anticipated some improvement and it was obviously flat year-over-year.
You're accelerating restructuring throughout the business I believe. So how do we sort of think about what's going on
underlying in the services business? And how do we think about the growth that you have in terms of signings, if that
might impact your ability to see substantial – or some improvement in margin as we go through the year? Just if you
guys can sort of take that and better frame what you're seeing in services right now.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Thank you, Shannon. I'll take it, and maybe turn it over to Lynn in a little while if I don't get
to all of the points. First of all we're very pleased with the performance of services in the first quarter. Our signings –
our revenue growth at 4% was, as expected without a big contribution from inorganic – from acquisitions. Our margins
were essentially in line with what we expected. We expected a little bit of improvement maybe 10 basis points or so but
we came in strong and our signings renewal rate, new business rate were all very, very, very strong.
The predictions that we have for second quarter, the outlook that we have for second quarter is continued expansion in
margin on a sequential basis. We have a tough compare in quarter two. So it will be down a little year-over-year in
quarter two, sequential expansions, and then throughout the year, continued expansion.
We expect to end the year in the 10% to 12% range, up a little bit on the year-over-year basis. So I think if you look at
our – the underlying of our business, the cost actions that we're taking, the management focus that we have on good

mix of business and new business, and to look for continued acquisitions, you should be fairly confident in how we'll –
how the services business will play out in 2013.
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: The other thing, Shannon, I think is that in our cost restructuring that we talked about last
quarter, we saw the flow-through of that. It was north of $30 million. We did have the run-off of our – we've started to
see the run-off of our student loan business, which is very high margin. It's a very mature contract. And so that had an
impact but our cost restructuring of the fourth quarter offset the discounts that we expected and the run-off. The other
thing that we're doing to – that gives us confidence about the ongoing margins and our ability to grow them is that we
have a – our restructuring and our basic shift of our cost model is we're just kind of getting underway with that. We did
some things in the fourth quarter.
We have a program now called Project Compete, that is our effort to move work, more work to low cost domestic
locations and to low cost offshore locations. And that's underway. And it's going to run through – right now, clear
through 2014 and probably beyond that. So we still have an awful lot of high cost labor in our model. And we're
working to reduce that and I think that's our – probably the main thing that gives me the confidence that we can
increase margins.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Great. And then my second question is just, Ursula, can you talk a bit about what you're
seeing from an economic standpoint? Both perhaps in the enterprise as well as SMB and geographically. Because we've
heard from obviously several companies so far, and it's clearly not a robust market environment out there. But I'm
curious as to what you're seeing in your verticals. And just whatever you can provide to us. Thank you.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Sure. Macro and fiscal uncertainty definitely continued in Q1. And we saw that in our
document technology business primarily. From a geographic perspective, Europe remains weak. And in the first quarter
it had its – some shocks that weakened it even further. We did see a slowdown, a bit of a slowdown in some developing
market economies. We're hoping that, that doesn't stay for a long time but our business model is fairly resilient in the
developing market which is good. We have a very flexible cost base there so we can actually adjust our infrastructure
costs to whatever revenue comes in. U.S. remains stable but weak. I mean, we have not seen a pickup in the U.S.
Sequestration didn't hurt us a whole lot, didn't help us. It made decision making – it continued to keep decision making
slow. So what I would say is overall, we have a status quo weak environment around the globe with, whenever there's a
little bit of shock we see a little bit of a shock in people's outlooks, but nothing too significantly worse than we saw in
the first quarter – in the fourth quarter.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Shannon. Next question
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Barclays.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Hi. How you doing?
<A - James H. Lesko>: Okay.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: I wanted to ask about technology. One of the – I wanted to hash out the yen. You probably get a
profit benefit that's either coming or you saw a little bit but then it also – the last time this happened, I don't know, 12
years, 13 years ago, where the yen weakened quite a bit Canon cut price quite a bit and took a lot of share. And I was
wondering if that has started and what you think the pricing environment will be throughout the year given the weak
yen.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yes. Let me start with the yen and the impact on our business then I'll go into pricing a little
bit. So the yen weakening overall is a positive for us. But as you know, we actually have two hedges there. We – one,
we have currency sharing with Fuji Xerox, and the second is that we hedge. We hedge the yen on a forward basis. We
did – we were fairly aggressive in hedging in the fourth quarter, in the second half of 2012 as we saw the yen
continuing to weak.

Page 6 of 14
So we don't benefit as much from the yen weakening immediately as other – as the yen – as you would expect from the
yen because we do have these two mechanisms to help offset those major moves. The benefit in the first half was less
than – was kind of nominal. It will be more in the second half. It will be probably total around $50 million in the year
back end loaded for us, if the yen stays where it was at the end of the year.
As it weakens further, obviously more benefit, we'll continue to hedge in currency share. So as far as pricing goes, we
have seen a little bit of a move up in pricing aggressiveness. So we generally are, and have been over time, in this 5%
to 10% range. This is primarily in document technology obviously and primarily on equipment, because the wholesale
contracts are locked in for longer periods of time.
And we are seeing activity at the higher end of this 5% to 10% range. And we are being aggressive. I mean, so
especially as we launch ConnectKey which gives us a set of offers that allows us to be aggressive in the marketplace. A
new set of offering, we're matching price as we have to, to win back share that we lost when we didn't have the
products in the second half of 2012. So pricing at the higher end of the 5% to 10% range and we're being aggressive to
make sure that we stay competitive.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Okay. And then could you just elaborate a little more on the government in particular? In the
last question you mentioned some of it, but what is the latest in terms of government as a percent of sales, and what –
and the difference that you're seeing in services in particular between state and local and federal? And how it impacts
your business? And in particular, if you could touch on whether you expect things to get better this quarter in that
vertical, maybe if somehow?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah, so we are not heavily exposed to the federal government. We have a small portion of
our revenue, 5% or so, in federal government, more heavily concentrated in state governments, 20%, 15% – 20% in
state government. What we've seen – and so I'm speaking about state government here and not too much about federal
government because it's kind of de minimis for us, as I said. State government we are seeing some good news
particularly in healthcare. We have a strong position as you know in MMIS around the United States, and California is
our big contract; New Hampshire just went live. We're doing well there, decision making.
So healthcare is a big segment for us. We do well there. And our profitability is improving in that segment actually
very, very well. So I'm bullish about healthcare, government healthcare services. What we are seeing though is that any
new decision, any decision in the government takes a little bit longer, a lot more discussions, a lot more engagement, a
lot more senior level engagement with state officials and by us. So myself, Lynn, our CFO are engaged in these kind of
discussions with state officials. The good news is that they do eventually come and we win our fair share. So slow
reaction time. Slow decision making progress. But our concentration is good. And we are – our major concentration is
in healthcare. We also have a transportation business that clearly government based as well and we do well there. So I
don't know if Lynn wants to say anything else.
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: I just that – I was just wanting to add to the comment about transportation – that we saw
good signings and we manage it separately, but it's as Ursula said, it's part of the, most of them are government entities.
So we saw good signings there and just agree with what Ursula said.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: All right. Thanks a lot.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Next question, please.

Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital.
<Q - Ananda P. Baruah>: Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Two if I could. Did I hear it
correctly that the technology operating margins are expected to be sort of in a 10% to 10.5% range for the June quarter?
I just wanted to get a clarification on that.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yes, you heard that correctly. And we...

<Q - Ananda P. Baruah>: Sorry. Go ahead, Ursula. I apologize.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: You heard that correctly. As you know last year for the full year our operating margins were
north of 11%, which is above the range that we have. And we've guided to somewhere around 10% to 11% margins for
the second quarter – operating margins for the second quarter. So expansion over the first quarter pretty significant,
below last year and in line with what we would expect.
<Q - Ananda P. Baruah>: Got it. It sounds like overall operating margins are expected to be right back on track once
we get to the second – in during the June quarter.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yes.
<Q - Ananda P. Baruah>: You should be back on track there.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yes.
<Q - Ananda P. Baruah>: And then, I guess, my follow up is, will you guys – the strength in signings for the March
quarter, I mean for the March quarter, how is that relative to your expectations and what's best for us to think about
with regards to how, a timing of the signings turning in – sort of converting into revenue? And does it change your – I
guess your revenue run rate in any particular way.
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: Well, I think that first of all we have heard a good news of not having a lot of mega deals is
that smaller deals are easier to ramp and so we expect to see impact from the signings probably a little quicker than – if
we've said many times, if we signed a big Medicaid deal they take a long time to ramp and these deals are typically –
that we've signed in the last quarter, a little bit smaller. So we do expect to see the flow-through on that. It's going to be,
still take some time, so that's why we're predicting that our revenue growth will pick up more in the second half than in
the second quarter.
<Q - Ananda P. Baruah>: And just...
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Ananda. If we could have our next question, please.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi. I have two also. The first is on services and the second is on technology. The first on
services, I'd like to – for you to address if I could Ursula. I think your characterization of the service performance was
generous. The signings were great particularly in BPO. But the margins in revenue continue a string of
disappointments. It wasn't communicated to investors that margins would be flat in the first quarter. Margins would
improve.
And yet once again they came in flattish even with the help of restructuring. You are guiding to margins of I think 10%
in the June quarter. That's down on a year-over-year basis but a tough comp. Your guidance for the year is 10% to 12%
but I think at the low end as I think how you'd characterize it. What are the consequences for continuing at this – to
having a year of if in fact you've – the margins fall short on services, what are the consequences of another year of
disappointment on margins?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: So, Keith, we expect that we'll have margin improvement throughout the year. We'll fall in
the 10% to 12% range. And have margin improvement on a year-over-year basis in 2013. I – my characterization was
just a characterization. I don't know, if generous or not. I think that we came in where we expected in revenue. We
came in ahead of where we expected in signings, in renewal rate. And in mix of business we were fairly solid.
As far as margins for the quarter, what we ended up producing, which was flat on a year-over-year basis, was slightly
lower than we expected. Driven primarily by the fact that we actually had great signings and had some compensation

payouts that we had to make for those great signings but I think that if you look at the business on a go-forward basis
with the signings, with the new business rate that we have with the renewal rate that we have, et cetera, et cetera, that as
the year continues we'll meet the expectations that we laid out. We also did a fair amount of restructuring as Lynn said.
That restructuring did come to the bottom line and allowed us to actually deliver – to deliver the flat margins. I think
that we were fairly well contained in services in this first quarter. And we will be for the rest of the year as well.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: All right. Well, before I ask my second question I just want to stress Ursula, I think clearing
10% this year in services margin is incredibly important for the trajectory of the stock and another year of
disappointments will be just that.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: We would agree with you on that. We expect to be in the range of 10% to 12%. That means
we have to clear 10% to be in the range of 10% to 12%. And Keith, I think you know that we actually manage this and
track it. We have a restructuring program, a signings program, a mix of business program. We're trying to acquire in
the right areas. A little light on acquisitions this quarter. Expect to pick those up as we go along. We don't acquire
willy-nilly. We try to do it in a very disciplined way. And so, I think that the business is actually running pretty much in
line with the way I would expect it to run.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Just a dimension, then my second question on technologies. Is there a way to think about,
with the product introductions it feels like it shifted perhaps some revenues from March to June. Is there any way to
think about that in terms of dimensions? I know you mentioned backlog was up. I just wanted to see if you could
provide any color on, or quantification on how much backlog or how much do you think was perhaps shifted from
March to June in the technology segment because of those product introductions and should we be thinking about any
of that for the June quarter, which might get further shifted to September? Thank you. And that's it for my questions.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Thank you, Keith. I don't – we expect to capture a lot of the miss in the first quarter, in the
second quarter. But it'll continue to flow through in the rest of the year as well. Our backlog was up around 25% which
is significant in the quarter. And we saw in the second quarter, so, so far in April we saw installs up and activity up. So
that backlog is not just sitting on the books. It's being fulfilled in the quarter. So I think that I'm fairly confident that we
will – that we are fulfilling the promise of ConnectKey, which is to move our activity up. One of the things that I want
to actually make sure that is clear. We actually predict this business to be down mid-single-digits, the document
technology business.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Right.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: We are very, very – our eyes are wide open to what's happening in the marketplace, so we're
not delusional about the progress here. We're investing in areas that grow and we're trying to take our cost down in
areas that are not growing and are moving away. We're investing in document outsourcing, we're investing in low end
distribution, we're investing in color across the board and in high-end color in particular.
And as we do that, ConnectKey is one of the key elements there. We were a little slow off the launch of ConnectKey,
even though we invested in SAG. We invested in marketing and we invested in the areas we should. I'm fairly
confident that quarter two – very confident that quarter two will deliver back to the mid-single-digit revenue declines.
And get our ratios better in line and therefore our operating margin better in line. One of the key points here as well is
if you look at gross margin, our gross margin in technology was flat.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Yep.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Which is harder to move. It turns out, it's harder to improve your gross margins than it is to
improve your operating margin in technology, because our operating margin is around investments that we make on an
active basis, if you know what I mean. We just...
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Yep, yep, yep.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: [indiscernible] (33:53) I'm actually feeling pretty good about document technology in quarter
two, I was very disappointed in quarter one.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Shope from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay. Thanks. I have a question on the services segment as well. Last quarter you had mentioned
that some renewals slipped into Q1. Can you talk about how that impacted the renewal rate and how we should, off of
that, think about the new renewal rate heading into Q2 and for the remainder of the year?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah, Lynn will take it.
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: Great. Yeah, we had some deals that moved our renewal universe if you want to think about
it that way, in Q1 was quite large. And we've had very good success rate. We're up about – I think about 40 bps in
terms of renewal rate quarter-over-quarter and that has a dramatic impact. A renewal is as good as a booking or in some
ways better. So we are optimistic that our renewal rate in the second quarter will continue to be within our range and
we think we'll actually have very strong renewals this quarter.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: If you look at the mix of the business, Bill, it's also good for us – we talked about this – I
don't know, if we talked about it in signings, but if you look at our signings number, this is off of renewals and into
signings, but also in renewals; BPO, very, very strong across the board in just about every metric that we have. And
BPO is – has better margins than ITO. BPO for the first quarter and for 2013 should be strong. Document outsourcing
was also very, very good. ITO, we're benefiting from 2011 signings turning into revenue today. So revenue growth is
very good. The mix of business for services is looking good. I mean it's coming out the way that we planned for it to
come out or would like for it to come out on a go-forward basis, so good BPO. Good signings and document
outsourcing, which helps us to offset this low document outsourcing revenue, that's really good. And ITO delivering on
all of the signings we had from 2011, so looking pretty good.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: If I could just one more on services. Can you comment on – you had a big signings quarter. Can
you comment on the average contract length for the services deals you had this quarter? Given that obviously last year
you had a pretty significant shortening of contract length and obviously that has implications down the road for profit.
So could you comment on whether that trend's continued and how you're thinking about that as you look at your
signings pipeline for this year?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Lynn will take it.
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: Yeah, as you have guessed, our average contract term was shorter in the first quarter. Last
year, we were at about four years. This quarter we were closer to three. And that's reflected in the fact that we have a
lot of BPO signings, not much in terms of ITO. ITO tend to be longer contracts. And deals that were a little bit smaller.
So we – but we have a good renewal rate. So we're confident in terms of the long-term growth.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: By the way, the shorter contract length contributes to – if they were longer, the TCV would
be even higher, which is an interesting thing. One of the things that Lynn mentioned he said more contracts. We have
38% more deals signed in this – given us that $3.7 billion. It's actually an amazing thing. And the positive thing in that
as Lynn said, big deals are longer to stand up to shorter deals. And the smaller deals and shorter deals are a little bit
easier to stand up. So we should be able to see the revenue flow through of these starting in the second half.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Bill. Next question, please.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Chris K. Whitmore>: Thanks very much. Ursula, in your prepared remarks it sounded like you're shading the
low end of the expected revenue targets for the year closer to flat versus growth – slight growth. Was the primary
change there related to the outlook for the technology business? And if so, is it largely the pricing dynamic or is it the
revenue timing of the mid-range refresh?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah, so the – we did say lower end of the range and it is all from the document technology
business. And it's a mix of both things that we're seeing. One is, we expect that the revenue from the product refresh
will come in – will start to come in. That's not going to be the biggest – It will contribute a little bit. And the other piece
– the other contribution is from what we're seeing in Europe and the slowdown in DMO that's creating a post-sale – a
usage – lower usage. And that's one that's harder to kind of outrun. In addition, we are light on acquisitions. And
acquisitions – we're going to make acquisitions in second quarter and beyond but the timing of those acquisitions will
make it hard to have the revenue flow through, have a big impact. So three areas, one is acquisitions. Second is some
slow start to the document technology, but not that much there and then page volumes and pricing and that whole mix
environment particularly in Europe and in DMO.
<Q - Chris K. Whitmore>: I wanted to ask specifically around – maybe to get some more color around that post-sale
line. It was a bit weaker than I expected. What were the primary drivers there? Is it primarily straight usage or are you
seeing any kind of changes of pricing around the back end of these deals?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Well, back ended deal pricing specifically, no. But what we're seeing is the mix of three
things coming together that gets to a lower post-sale. One is usage down. What we're selling the mix is lower. Not that
the price of any individual device is lower, but people are buying more lower-end things. So mix a little bit lower
which gets you lower page volumes, lower price per page on lower devices. And we're participating in some segments
– back to the second one, particularly in high-end color, we're participating more in the lower end of high-end color
devices.
And so it's a combination of low economic activity in DMO and in Europe, mix and mix-driven low page volumes and
mix-driven lower price. But we're not seeing a change in the pricing of a deal, if you know, what I mean. If you put an
iGen, we're not seeing a change in the pricing of an iGen deal.
<Q - Chris K. Whitmore>: Got it. Thanks. And then last one for me just finally on the pricing environment. Does the
more competitive pricing environment impact your overall revenue outlook for the year or is it relatively small in the
scheme of things?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah, I think it's relatively small in the scheme of things. Most of it is in document
technology and most of it is in equipment sale, which is like 10% to 15% of our total revenue. So it's not – I mean, it's
something we have to overcome, but it's not going to be a significant mover at all. We will be more concerned or I
know it would be more of an issue if post-sale prices across the board went down, but that's very, very hard to do.
<Q - Chris K. Whitmore>: Got it.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Very hard to do.
<Q - Chris K. Whitmore>: Got it. Thanks a lot.

Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup.
<Q - Jim Suva>: Thank you. And congratulations to you and your team there at Xerox.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Thank you, Jim.
<Q - Jim Suva>: Noticeably the signings numbers were super impressive. But I also want to take a bigger picture look
at this, and the prior quarter was weaker than expected. So maybe if you can, Ursula, for a longer-term strategic CEO
perspective, kind of help us kind of smooth out a little bit to say is there a certain run rate that you want these signings
to come in at to continue to grow your business organically because I imagine there's some rolling off all the time.
Some coming on. And how we should look about that? And then this quarter was it truly kind of off the charts or was
some of that pushed or deferred from the December quarter? And then in lieu of that, with sequester, were there some
actually that didn't close that may close into the June quarter?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: So signings, one of the things that we learned early on came over when we got into document
outsourcing, but even more when we bought ACS and got BPO and ITO in, signings were lumpy, Jim. I mean, there's
not a predictable nature to signings particularly as we participate in the full mix of small to large deals and which we
do. So I – unfortunately I can't give you an 'expect X'. They are lumpy. Do not underestimate or dampen too much the
signings that we did in the first quarter. They were very, very good. Even with the move of some deals, from quarter
four to quarter one, 64% increase is real – is a real increase. The number of deals, just the number of transactions, was
significantly bigger than we would – that would naturally happen. So the quarter was a really good quarter in signings.
No – not just because we moved et cetera. And sequestration, we – we really haven't seen a specific. So we didn't see a
specific line item stop or a specific deal stop.
What sequestration does is it puts a damp rag over everything from a time perspective. So and that's – but we're kind of
used to that now. We didn't see a deal stop because something got defunded, not at all but we did see a lot of fullness in
decision-making. And we expect a good signings again in quarter two, as Lynn said. So we do not expect quarter one,
quarter three – quarter four, quarter one and quarter two to kind of average out to be okay set of quarters. We expect we
have reasonable in quarter four, a little bit light. Very, very good in quarter one, heavy and we'll have a very good
quarter in quarter two in signings as well.
<Q - Jim Suva>: Great. Thank you, and congratulations to you and your team there at Xerox.

Your next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thanks. I just have a question on restructuring and the cost basis. There's been a lot of
mention on things potentially being accelerated. So I just want to kind of frame the question in terms of for Ursula, I
guess between let's say 2012, the end of the year, and the end of this year on a run rate basis, all to 2014, how do you
want to describe it? Can you speak about how much cost you're trying to take out the business? Can you put a dollar
number on that?
And then also, in the event, that the services margins may not come through or the technology business doesn't come
through, can you speak with the flexibility you have to further become aggressive in the cost base? Give me some
examples, maybe four, where you could actually accelerate savings? Many thanks.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Thank you. So in 2012, we took about $150 million of restructuring charges primarily in
document technology and towards the end of the year, as you know, we did a restructuring in services. And in the

quarter, and that flowed through to about $50 million to $60 million worth of savings in the first quarter of the year.
And we expected the savings for the full year to be north of $200 million, or $225 million. For 2013, we expect a
similar level of restructuring in 2013 to 2012. What we've done in quarter two is accelerate some of that restructuring
into the quarter and that will be primarily again in document technology. We're going take a bigger focus on Europe.
Europe is as you know, difficult.
You may not know, but Europe is difficult to restructure in. The paybacks are very long. It's a challenging environment,
but we're going to go after it with full force in quarter two and see what we can do in quarter two in European
restructuring. And the rest of that, a smaller amount of it, will be on the continued restructuring and continued
movement of labor and services that Lynn spoke about. So about the same year-over-year of step-up in quarter two.
That step-up will allow us to continue to meet the first half earnings. And assure that we'll meet the full year earnings
expectations that we laid out and we're going to focus on Europe and document technology.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: So that, I've got that right, Ursula, so that's $150 million of restructuring probably this
year and hopefully like $200 million – that results, let's say, going into 2014 on a full year basis $200 million of
potential savings. Am I understanding that right?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Correct.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Thank you. Good morning. The first question, Ursula is around the services business.
You're entering the fourth year now with the ACS services piece as part of your company. I'm just kind of curious, if
we exclude the document outsourcing, so the 27% or so of services as document outsourcing it would put your
ACS-related services around 40% of total company revenue. Is that kind of how you, Lynn and Tom kind of think
about where you want that mix? Is it kind of over under where you were targeting, say, a few years ago? How should
we think about that mix right now?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yes, it's a great question actually. We expect a little bit more. We expect a little bit higher
mix at this point in BPO and ITO. And the biggest gap that we have is in acquisitions. And that gap, that acquisition
gap, is one that we're working really hard to remedy but the organic growth in services is coming in up actually this
year ahead of where we expected it to be, tail-end of 2012 and first quarter. And what we need to do is another point –
another point or 2 from acquisition revenue would be good.
And as far as the document outsourcing business, it's definitely a lumpy business. It comes and it goes. Right now we
have a lot of signings that will translate into revenue in the tail-end. So I'm actually pretty okay with document
outsourcing. And organic growth in services I'm good with as well.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Okay just as follow-up, so you said the – where you could have a remedy is more on the
acquisition side. Where could those remedies lie? I mean, can you give us a sense of what we could look to over the
next 12 months to 18 months, as far as some of those remedies?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yes, so here's the priorities that we have now. The thing about acquisition is that you have to
find a candidate, that you – which we find a lot of, but we have to actually like the candidate and have a reasonable
value match between the seller and the buyer. You know all this. Here's the focus areas that, we're going to continue on
capabilities. Particularly in what is called outside big data, but I call it in data analytics or whatever to actually enable
more business in our – in situ business – lines of business today. That's one area that you'll see. The second area that

you'll see is we're going to continue to double down and triple down in healthcare. And some of that is big data, but
also in ways to mass markets, pass the market in healthcare.
And the third will be international acquisitions across the board in our services business. Our international operations
are growing, but I want them to grow even faster. And what it allows us to do is get revenue, but also get talent that can
be sitting internationally as well which is something that we need to actually accelerate. So it will be in those three
areas.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Okay. And my second question is around cash flow. Just kind of curious just given you
are kind of entering years two and three or at least the more mature parts of the services cycles that you signed on a few
years ago after you acquired ACS. Can we see a situation where later this year, maybe your total revenue actually could
be flattish even down but that you could have some accretive benefits from some of these services deals where you
could actually see cash flow actually improve more than expected. I mean are we getting close to that positive
inflection point from a cash flow perspective?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah, I think some and some, but I don't think you'll see the revenue come down based on the
signings, right? If you look at the signings and if we operate, when we operate the contracts as they say, I don't think
you'll see revenue coming down. You will – you could see strength in cash based on how effectively we bring those
contracts and all other contract that we have to maturity. So you could have some benefit in cash. I don't think that
you'll see a negative in revenue. Mega deals have – the mega deals that we've signed have a cash – as they mature, they
have a cash benefit, right?
So the most famous mega deal is California, right? And as California is maturing, thank God, and is doing fairly well,
I'm not going to say very well because very well always jinxes me of doing well so as that matures of course cash
becomes easier to get out of the mega deal. But I don't think revenue will be down. I think cash has some opportunity
and yeah.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Good. Thanks, Mark.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Thank you.
<A - James H. Lesko>: I think we'll have our last question, please.

And your final question comes from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - George K. F. Tong>: Good morning, and thanks for the helpful commentary. I wanted to get some color on your
services pipeline. Could you tell us where you're seeing the greatest activity, what you're seeing in terms of mix and
whether you're seeing any mega deals potentially come up?
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: Yeah, we are on – the main areas that we're seeing activity are transportation, healthcare, our
financial services, customer care and in our government space. As Ursula said, we're seeing good growth in
government healthcare and we continue to see a good pipeline there. And we're seeing a few more deals that are larger
in size, but not as many as we've had historically. That's why I think it's important that we demonstrate that we can
execute on the smaller contracts. The number of deals that we did is up significantly. And so I don't think, we should
count on a huge influx of mega deals, but we do believe that we'll have continued strong signings growth through the
year.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: And this – Armando will speak about document outsourcing.
<A - Armando Zagalo de Lima>: Yeah, so mega deals in quarter one were 30% of total, what I think helps the quick
turn around to revenue, so we don't have – we have 70% of our deals that are not mega deals. Industry-wise, I give you
a perspective about 2012. So public sector was our major industry with 18 mega deals in 2012, financial services 16,
manufacturing 10, healthcare 8. Quarter one was a little bit different. Three deals, mega deals in education, three in

manufacturing, and one in healthcare.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: So I think that from the two you'll see that we have – we participate in the broad set of
industries. And we are seeing the benefit of historic mega deals, but today now more just across the board good activity
from many different sized firms and many different sized engagements, and that's actually very good.
<Q - George K. F. Tong>: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then as a follow-up question, what percentage of your
first quarter signings came from renewals that slipped from 2012? And are there any renewals slipping into the second
quarter that could help drive second quarter's bookings growth?
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: Yeah, there's always as Ursula said earlier, that bookings tend to be lumpy, and there are
always things at the end of one quarter that tend to slip to the next. I think that if I had to put a percentage on it, I would
put it about 10%, maybe 15%. And we have deals a couple of deals actually that we expected to close the last day of
the quarter, it didn't close, and we've signed those already. So – but that's kind of normal.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yes.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, George. So that's all the time we have for questions today. Thanks for your interest.
And, Ursula, anything more to wrap-up?
Ursula M. Burns
Thanks, Jim. I'd be remiss, if I didn't mention that Kathy Mikells will join us on May 2nd as our new CFO. She brings
to Xerox extensive financial experience and a broad business acumen in both services and technology. And Kathy plans
to reach out to our investment community almost immediately after she arrives. We covered a lot of ground today. So
let me bring it up couple of levels. Our strategy is consistent services led growth, profitable leadership from document
technology. Cash generating annuity based business model, consistent earnings expansion and financial strength to
invest in building value for Xerox and building value for you. It's up to us to execute effectively and I remain confident
that we will.
