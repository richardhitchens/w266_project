Lawrence E. Page
Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining our call this afternoon. Google had a great quarter, over $14 billion in revenue,
up 19% year-on-year, amazing performance for a company that has yet to celebrate its 15th birthday. We live in a
world of abundant computing, with multiple operating systems and increasing numbers of devices. It is a very different
environment from when Google started. There was essentially one OS and one device category, the PC. These kinds of
changes don't happen that often, once a decade, maybe even less frequently. But the shift from laptop to mobiles from
one screen to multiple screens creates tremendous opportunity for Google.
With more devices, more information and more activity online than ever, the potential to improve people's lives is
immense. Getting you the right information just when you need it, creating the tools to make everyone more effective
at home and at work, and helping you share and remember the moments that matter in life. That's why I'm so excited
about the velocity and execution of our platforms, apps and devices.
First, platforms, with hindsight, Android and Chrome were no-brainers. At the time, they were big bets. The
momentum across these platforms is tremendous. As you saw in our annual I/O developer conference in May, I was
astounded we had over 1 million people tuning in live just to watch our developer keynotes. We've now activated more
than 900 million Android devices worldwide, and we're lighting up over 1.5 million devices every day. That's pretty
amazing given that the first Android phone launched less than five years ago, and apps usage is increasing fast. Over 50
billion apps have been now downloaded from the Google Play store. In fact, we've already paid out more money to
Android developers this year than in the whole of 2012.
I love the ability to access your stuff and play anywhere. Take our new music subscription service, launched in May; it
is an easy, fun way to discover new music with all the songs there, ready to go. You never have to think about the
device you're using. Chrome, even though only four years old, has over 750 million users worldwide and growing.
The next, apps, our goal is to design everything so it's beautifully simple and hassle free. Users shouldn't have to need
to think about our technology. It should just work. This quarter we completely revamped our Maps UI. The map is the
screen, no clutter around the edges. There is more information about our surroundings, so it's easier to explore. And we
have launched a new, improved navigation feature, a notification about incidents before you leave, and updates to save
time if traffic conditions change. Best of all, this new maps experience is now available on almost all devices you'd be
likely to use.
It's the same with Google+. We have done a complete redesign to make use of the entire screen and everything looks
consistent to whatever the device or the platform. In addition, the team massively upgraded the photos experience,
making software design for professionals automatically available to everyone for free. There's no need for wrinkles
anymore. Take a look on +, many of your photos will now be marked enhanced and improved automatically.

Finally, we launched the new communication app called Hangouts. You can talk to the people you care about across all
the major platforms. Video calls from your phone are very cool. Give them a try.
And I'm excited about the progress we have continued to make with search. Our knowledge graph is now available in
29 languages, and we have expanded the range of information available. For example, we just added nutrition data. Ask
Google how many calories there are in a glass of white wine, and you'll find out its 123, or an avocado, 234 calories.
It's good to have the facts if you want to keep healthy. And we launched Google Now on iOS in April.
In the same way, we want to make everything – we want to make advertising super simple for customers. Online
advertising have developed in very specific, device specific ways with separate campaigns for desktop and mobile. This
made arduous work for advertisers and agencies and meant mobile opportunities often got missed. That's why we
launched enhanced campaigns. Advertisers have upgraded 6 million campaigns. That's almost 75% of all their active
campaigns. And Nikesh will talk in a little more detail about the positive reaction from the clients. This is the biggest
ever change to add words, and the velocity and execution has been great, thanks to the hard work of all the teams.
Finally, devices, there is so much excitement around new devices today, and the potential for innovation is tremendous.
You can now buy the HTC One and the Samsung Galaxy S4 or Google Play additions and enjoy the best of Google.
There's a ton of momentum around Chromebooks, which are growing fast and define the more general decline in PC
sales. Finally, I know you're all eagerly anticipating what Motorola is launching soon. Having been a tester for a while,
I'm really excited. We're very optimistic about the opportunities in front of Google today.
The potential for technology to make people's lives better is tremendous, but to achieve that potential, we need to stay
focused. It's why we continue to invest the vast majority of our resources and time in our core products. My job as CEO
is also to think about the future and ensure we continue to bet on new technology that can solve big problems in the
world. Project Loon, which we launched in June, is a great example. Bringing affordable balloon-powered Internet
access to remote areas is an idea that Sergey and I have been thinking about for over a decade. It was great to see that
project literally get off the ground and give people a bit more hope for an improving world.
None of this would happen without great people, and we are so lucky that we have them. I'd like to thank all the
Googlers and Motorolans, who make everything possible. Keep up that velocity and execution. Now, I hand the call
over to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Larry. And good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. So why don't we dive in by reviewing the
details of our overall business financial performance. So here we go. Our gross total consolidated revenue grew 19%
year-over-year to $14.1 billion. The overall business was up 1% quarter-over-quarter. Google's standalone gross
revenue grew 20% year-over-year to $13.1 billion and was up 1% quarter-over-quarter. Our Google Website revenues
was up 18% year-over-year to $8.9 billion was in fact up 3% quarter-over-quarter. Our Google Network revenue grew
7% year-over-year to $3.2 billion and was down 2% quarter-over-quarter. You'll remember the advertising policy
decisions we implemented during Q4 and Q1 to ensure that useful and safe user experience continued to have its
negative impact on network revenue.
Other revenue grew 138% year-over-year to $1 billion, roughly flat quarter-over-quarter. Play Store digital sales of
apps and content drove the year-on-year and quarter-over-quarter growth. And it's worth noting that in Q1, we included
some seasonal hardware sales due to overflow from Q4, which skewed the Q2 comps somewhat.
Finally, please note that without currency fluctuations, Google standalone revenue growth would in fact have been 22%
year-over-year and 3% quarter-over-quarter.
Turning to Motorola Mobility, gross revenue there was $998 million, just shy of $1 billion. And it's clear that we've
made a lot of progress with Motorola in the past year, and we are especially excited about the future of our upcoming
product line-up. So, stay tuned.

At Google, our global aggregate paid click growth was strong at 23% year-over-year, in fact up 4%
quarter-over-quarter. Our aggregate cost-per-click was down 6% year-over-year and down 2% quarter-over-quarter.
And currency fluctuations in this case had a minimal effect in Q2 CPC growth. And yet our monetization metrics
continue to be impacted by the usual factors that we've discussed many times, including geographic mix, channel mix,
property mix, our product and policy changes, as well as FX.
Turning to the geographic performance of Google's standalone business, we continued to see a steady performance in
the U.S. and rest of world. While the UK was negatively impacted by a warm spring, some FX in their case, and a
tough year-over-year comp. In our earnings slides, which you can find on our Investor Relations website, you'll see that
we've broken down our revenue by U.S., UK, and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits of our
hedging program. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.
U.S. revenue was up 18% year-over-year to $5.9 billion. The UK was up 12% year-over-year to $1.3 billion, which
included $24 million of benefit from our hedging program. It is, in fact, worth noting that in fixed FX terms, the UK
grew 15% year-over-year. Non-U.S. revenue, excluding UK accounted for 45% of the total revenue or $5.9 billion, and
it was up 23% year-over-year, which includes $11 million benefits from our hedging program. In fixed FX terms, rest
of world grew a solid 28%.
Coming back to an aggregate level for the total consolidated business, our other cost of revenue was $2.9 billion in Q2,
excluding stock-based compensation and Motorola restructuring. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $4.2
billion, also excluding stock-based compensation and Motorola restructuring. And our non-GAAP operating profit was
$4 billion in Q2, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin for the consolidated business of 28%.
For standalone Google, our traffic acquisition costs were $3 billion, or 25% of total advertising revenue. Other cost of
revenue was $2.1 billion, again excluding $110 million of stock-based compensation. Non-GAAP operating expenses
were $3.8 billion, excluding stock-based compensation of $633 million. And non-GAAP operating profit was $4.2
billion in Q2, resulting in non-GAAP operating margin of 32% for the standalone Google segment.
Please note that a revaluation of our depreciation policy as it relates to our real estate portfolio resulted in an additional
$121 million in Google segment depreciation expenses, about half of which were presented a one-time charge for assets
that are now fully depreciated. With this change in place, depreciation and amortization expense on property, plant and
equipment for standalone Google was $667 million for this quarter. At Motorola Mobility, total non-GAAP operating
expenses, including cost of revenue were $1.2 billion.
Keep in mind; intangible amortization expenses attributed to the standalone Google and Motorola Mobility are in fact
included in these non-GAAP measures. Of the $283 million in intangible amortization expense in the quarter, $153
million was the result of the acquisition of Motorola, of which $116 million was allocated to Google, and $37 million
was allocated to Motorola Mobility. And as a result, the non-GAAP operating loss for Motorola Mobility was $218
million in Q2, and a non-GAAP operating margin for that segment of minus 22%.
Headcount for the consolidated business was down roughly 9,000 people in Q2. Please keep in mind that consolidated
count now excludes Motorola home business. It also reflects the impact of the ongoing Mobility restructuring.
Standalone Google added about 1,400 people during the quarter, and in total the consolidated company ended the
quarter with around 44,800 full-time employees. Our effective tax rate was 24% in Q2. Like in Q1, several one-time
items as well as the continued shift of earnings between domestic and international subsidiaries impacted our tax rate
this quarter, and also please remember that in Q1, we also had a significant lower rate in that case due to the 2012 R&D
credit, which was obviously not applied to our Q2 rate.
Let me now turn to cash management. Other income and expense was $247 million for the quarter, which reflects
realized gains on investments and interest income, offset by the discontinued – the continued impact of our FAS 133
expense on our hedging program. For more detail on OI&E, again please refer to the slides that accompany this call on
our IR website.
We continue to be very pleased with our operating cash flow, which is strong this quarter at $4.7 billion. CapEx for the
quarter was $1.6 billion, and this is versus last quarter at $1.2 billion. I want to remind everybody that the majority of

our CapEx spend is related to data center construction, facilities related purchases and production equipment. CapEx is
just inherently lumpy, and as I mentioned last quarter during my remarks, our infrastructure will continue to be a
strategic area of investment. It's one of the foundations of our future growth.
Our free cash flow, again, very strong, $3.1 billion for the quarter. Larry's comments make it clear that there are just
enormous growth opportunities ahead of us as a company. It's in this period of optimism that we continue to fully fund
strategic growth opportunities with the same confidence and discipline we demonstrated, while growing our Mobile
business, Android, YouTube, Chrome, just to name a few.
And with this, I'll hand it off to Nikesh, who'll cover more details of our business performance in the quarter. And after
his remarks, we'll open up the lines for questions. Nikesh?
Nikesh Arora
Thank you, Patrick. As Patrick mentioned, our businesses has had a strong quarter. We had over $13.1 billion in
Google standalone gross revenue. Overall performance was particularly strong in the auto sector, in Brazil, and as
Patrick mentioned, growth in the UK was hampered because of a particularly warm spring.
Before I talk about trends we're seeing and investments we're making in our business, let me call out the effort of our
marketing team that continues to create great Google moments. In May, they put on our second Annual YouTube
Brandcast event in New York for 1,800 advertisers. The event was a great way to show YouTube's unique ability to
help marketers connect with highly coveted consumers and ultimately build their brands. At Brandcast, Jeffrey
Katzenberg of DreamWorks said, YouTube is a whole new entertainment paradigm, and we think he is right.
Also as Larry mentioned, the team put on another successful Google I/O developer conference, showcasing our
incredible momentum across our platforms to over 6,000 developers in San Francisco with over 1 million people tuning
in from around the world. We continue to be pleased with how our business is evolving, growing and diversifying.
There are three key areas where we continue to make investments. First, our transformation into a marketing platform
that works across the connected world Larry described. Second, our systematic move up the marketing funnel to help
clients more and more with brand-building campaigns. Third, our investment in our non-ads business, such as
enterprise services, hardware and digital content through Google Play.
First, our investments for our constantly connected users, the rapid adoption of new devices means that more people are
spending more time online, connected. In fact, new devices and new connectivity means you're moving to a world
where people are constantly connected with devices with them all the time. As an example, eMarketers say for the time
spent online on mobile devices by U.S. adults grew 273% from 2009 to 2012. From 2011 to 2012 alone, the time spent
connected to mobile devices increased by nearly half an hour a day. This means not only are a lot of new services and
apps available for users, but also a huge opportunity exists for businesses looking to reach mobile users at the right time
and location.
That brings in Enhanced Campaigns, Larry talked about this. Enhanced Campaigns is a big long-term bet that is
designed to help advertisers more easily reach customers across devices with the right message, all within one
campaign. We already migrated 6 million of active campaigns to Enhanced Campaigns over the last many months. Our
goal is to migrate all of our advertisers and campaigns by the end of this month. This effort has been executed at
breakneck speed, and client reaction has been generally positive. We're getting back evidence from clients seeing
improved performance using Enhanced Campaigns. For example, Pizza Hut saw their mobile ROI increase by 20%.
They found that their mobile click-through rate increased by more than 60%, while their cost-per-order on smartphones
has dropped by 17%.
We believe Enhanced Campaigns does set up our clients and our business really well for the long-term. And the move
towards a constantly connected world goes far beyond just direct response and transactional marketing. People are
spending time watching videos, playing games, consuming news. All this creates great new opportunities for brand
marketers to engage users. In fact, powered by a TrueView format, YouTube's mobile revenue in June of this year was

three times what it was at the beginning of the year. And to help advertisers reach viewers across more screens, we've
opened up our TrueView formats to all of our AdMob network across thousands of apps.
Turning our attention to brand marketers, this is a very, very important area for us where we continue to invest broadly.
It's important because the largest global marketers from CPG companies to film studios all conduct large, major brand
advertising campaigns. Of course, that represents significant budgets that have historically been spent on TV. A good
example of this was seen at the Cannes Lions Festival, the Dove Real Beauty Sketches campaign that appeared on
YouTube won the Titanium Grand Prix award, which is considered the festival's highest honor. We worked with
Burberry to launch Burberry Kisses, which allows users to send messages to loved ones sealed with a digital imprint of
their real kiss. This campaign runs on YouTube and our display network across desktop, tablets and mobile.
And last month, we began to integrate our recent acquisition of Wildfire into the DoubleClick platform so that brands
can now manage the broader customer journey across search, display, mobile, social, rich media, and video, again, all
within one platform.
Finally, I want to talk a little bit about our investment in emerging non-ad businesses. We made a bunch of bets that are
now beginning to show promise. We have seen acceleration in new businesses such as hardware, digital content, and
enterprise.
First hardware, we continue to see great momentum across Chromebooks and mobile devices such as our Nexus
program. Around the world, Chromebooks are now in more than 6,600 brick-and-mortar stores, including Walmart and
Staples. That's about a three-time increase this quarter. As Larry said, we've also added two new devices to the Google
Play Store from Samsung and HTC.
On the digital apps and content front, through Google Play, we continue to see tremendous amount of growth in this
area. People from over 190 countries now download apps from Google Play every day; more than 50 billion apps have
been downloaded so far. In the last year, Google Play digital content like music and movies have launched in 21 new
countries, including India, Mexico, Russia, with eight more European countries launching Google Play books this
week. Publishers like Penguin, Random House, Time Inc., movie studios like Disney, and NBC Universal and app
developers like King and Square Enix are creating terrific experiences for our users. We've also collaborated with all
the major record labels to launch a new music subscription service that users seem to be enjoying a lot.
Lastly on the enterprise front, that's another great revenue stream for Google. It comprises productivity apps like Docs
and Gmail as well as our cloud infrastructure. Now more than half of the Fortune 500 companies use a paid enterprise
product from Google and over 5 million businesses use our productivity apps. This means we have close, long-term
relationships with our enterprise customers.
New customers this quarter include some of our world's leading businesses like Federal Express, which has built their
store locator on Google Maps. Snapchat, which runs their application on Google's cloud infrastructure and LinkedIn is
using Google Search Appliance. New Google apps customers include Pearson, Keller Williams Realty and the City of
Boston. And HP is now a Google Apps reseller combining Google's software with HP's hardware for an initiative to
help small businesses called SMB IT in a Box.
To conclude, across our entire business, we're investing with enthusiasm and have tremendous opportunities. We
strongly believe that we're making the right moves for our users and clients and we're extremely optimistic about the
future.
With that, let me hand back to Patrick.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Ross A. Sandler>: Great. Thanks, guys. Nikesh, I just had one kind of high-level question on Enhanced
Campaigns and the transition. So, can you just give us a little bit more color about the ROIs that most of your
customers are seeing? You mentioned a few comments. But are they going up? And do you see a significant
opportunity in providing conversion tracking across different screens? What do you think will happen with search
budgets if and when you can solve that problem? Thanks.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Thank you for the question. I think it's fair to say that over the last nine months, we've had to do
a super Herculean task to take millions and millions of campaigns, as Larry mentioned, 6 million campaigns, where we
had to work with our advertising partners to go and convert them towards Enhanced Campaigns. And we've had some
amazing insights both working with the advertisers as well as our teams. As many advertisers have discovered that they
were not addressing the mobile opportunity appropriately. They discovered new inventory. They discovered better ROI
and better conversion. Of course, we anticipate that conversion analytics will work across every scheme and be able to
be made available to all of our advertisers. So, we believe that as we get more and more – as we get better in terms of
being able to provide more targeting and more comprehensive ad solutions for mobility and across all screens that the
ROI should continue to improve. So, I'm very optimistic in the longer term, because we believe mobility provides more
context to advertisers in terms of where the users are, where they've been, which will allow for more accurate
advertising and advertising which is almost as good as information for them. So, as that begins to happen, we think the
advertising ROI continues to increase, and hopefully that means good things for search budgets.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thank you, Ross, for your question. Jamie, let's go to the next question.
Operator
And we'll go next to Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
<Q - Ben Schachter>: One question for Larry and one for Patrick. Larry, when you think about hardware, are there
other hardware categories beyond just phones and tablets where you believe Google can potentially build meaningful
businesses? And then Patrick, in Q1, we didn't really see the usual uptick in expenses that you kind of see annually. But
then now we do see it in Q2. It sounds like some of that was the accounting issue around depreciation, but can you help
us understand what happened there more? Thanks.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Thanks, Ben, for the question. I think we've been an early innovator in smartphones, and
we've been really excited about starting Android when no one really thought it was going to be interesting. And I think
it's always a mistake to assume that technology will be static. So I think certainly over the long-term, we're going to
have new kinds of devices and voice interacting with computing and the Internet. We're obviously excited about
Google Glass and new ways of interacting with hardware and new types of hardware.
With any technological change, you probably overestimate the short-term and underestimate the long-term. So I think
we're really excited about making those investments and making sure we're positioned to live the future. And that's
why, I love using Glass, because I feel like every time I'm using Glass, I'm living that future. That's really, really
exciting to me.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Why don't I jump on the next question? So on the issue of expenses, look, our expenses in Q2
were completely in line with the objectives we had set for ourselves. In general, we continue to exercise financial
discipline and monitor our product profitability, but it's on that basis that we recognize – the significant opportunities
that are ahead of us. And with the view to the long-term, we continue to invest significantly and intelligently to fuel

these opportunities. The fundamental issue is, as I've said a number of times on previous calls, if you want to hire X
amount of people, you have a target for the quarter or for the year, and they come in sometimes a bit over, sometimes a
bit under. But the real question is, are you still on the right trajectory for the long-term you're shooting for? So that's
really the issue between Q1 and Q2, Ben. So thank you for your question. Why don't we go to the next question, Jamie?
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Great. Two questions, please. First on CPC, Patrick, you mentioned a couple of factors
behind the kind of deflation there. I don't think you ticked off mobile. I don't know if there is any particular reason why
you didn't? Or maybe I missed it? And then in terms of the employee adds, maybe a question for Larry, as you think
about where you've been able to get employees, the ease or the difficulty with which you have been able to hire the
employees that you wanted to hire, could you comment on how that has changed if at all over the last year or two?
Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: So why don't I jump in on the first one. Clearly mobile has some effectiveness, and we've
talked about that in the past. So that's just one of the many factors that are at work. I just gave the list and the property
mix obviously, and the channel mix includes a bunch of mobile shifts as well in there. And that's part of the equation
clearly for sure that drives both sides of the equation. And I just want to remind everybody that it's always kind of
dangerous to just look at CPCs by themselves or just look at paid clicks by themselves. But in fact it's a combination of
the two that gives you the health of the business, and these mixes move all over the place depending on the number of
changes going on in any quarter. But overall, very pleased with the overall performance. On head count, I'll let it to
Larry to jump in.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: So, Mark, I think – I don't think we've seen any significant change in the short-term on
hiring. I think we're really lucky that we have really great people at the company and more great people who want to
work with us. We've been able to buy smart companies too where we get great people. And I don't see any major
changes in how that's been changing. I also think retention for the company has been great. People are excited to work
here. They're excited to work on important things and make the world better. And we're able to hire some of the best
people in the world. And I think that's been continuing, and it's pretty stable.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thank you for your question, Mark. Jamie, let's go to the next question, please.
Operator
And we'll go next to Carlos Kirjner with Sanford Bernstein
<Q - Carlos Kirjner>: Thank you. Two questions, Larry, I think you sometimes say that technology has done only 1%
of what it can do, suggesting that there's a lot of opportunity for Google. If that's the case, why isn't your R&D budget
10%, 20%, or materially higher than today? Or in other words, what limits your ability to spend more to capture these
opportunities? Secondly, Patrick, can you tell us in general what specific financial operating metrics you use to
evaluate the success of Google Fiber as a business? Thank you.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Yeah. That's a really great question, Carlos. I think that's our main job is to figure out how
to obviously invest more to achieve greater outcomes for the world, for the company and so on. And I think those
opportunities are clearly there. You know, we've seen in the past some things like Chrome and Android, and I've talked
about that a lot. I think that execution of Velocity, I've talked about a lot too. It's pretty easy to come up with ideas. It's
pretty hard to make them real and get them to billions of people. And that's what's for me so exciting about being a
company like Google, is that we get to do technological innovation at scale and get it out to – on the scale of the whole
world, to billions of people. But, I wish we could just snap our fingers and accomplish that. But it's actually a lot of
hard work and takes a lot of great people working really hard to make that happen. And we're working every day to

improve our processes, improve our leadership, improve how we're organized and to make that all go faster. And that's
why I come into work excited every day, and I think why everyone else does. But I wish we could snap our fingers and
just do a tremendous amount more instantly, but the reality is it's hard work to scale, and that's what we do.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Carlos, I'll take the second one related to Google Fiber. Just as context for everybody, we have
been on the public record to say that we're running Google Fiber and excited about it, and we always had profitability
as one of the key criteria for this opportunity. And in terms of kind of metrics, they should be just aligned with any
sound business that's in that domain of access, which is a combination. At first actually it was interesting, because the
question was, how successful was going to be the product? And then – meaning how many people would kind of want
to take it. And then the second kind of – so we've been obviously very pleased by our results in Kansas City and now
the announcements of the other two cities we've made since then. And then there's all the regular metrics you can
imagine, which have to do with cost of infrastructures, cost to serve, and then how they flow into our profitability
model. So, there's no real rocket science in the financials of it.
The real kind of magic occurs with the definition of the product, the innovation on the technology that the teams are
pushing and what makes Google Fiber 100 times faster than the next best thing. That's really what we're very focused
on. So, I hope that answers your question.
And let's go to the next question, Jamie.
Operator
And we'll go next to Doug Anmuth with JPMorgan
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just want to ask about the Network sites
deceleration that you saw, 12% growth last quarter and 7% growth this quarter. If you could just talk about some of the
key drivers there and perhaps how much is self-inflicted as you're sort of cleaning up more of the sites and quality and
everything? And then secondly, can you talk about the key drivers that you see in terms of improving conversion rates
for mobile ads? I know you mentioned the conversion analytics, but what else do you think gets mobile ad conversion
up over the next few years? Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Yes. So for the first part, I'll answer the first part of the question, Doug, and then Nikesh will
answer the second part. Clearly the Network deceleration, I mean, that's why we kind of made the comment last quarter
about the DLA and the policies. And it's clearly having an impact as, you know, now we've had a number of partners
that have through Q1 and Q2 have all been notified and have made the changes to their behavior. So these policies are
now coming into compliance. And as a result of it, right, you see the impact. But we really believe that this is a really
good thing for our users and in the long-term will really benefit both the users and Google. So that's the core elements
of what's going on there. And then for the second question, I'll let Nikesh jump in.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Yeah. Thank you, Patrick. I think it's important to understand, as I said, that improving
conversion rates for us requires us to do a lot of things. One is we have to understand the cross device behavior better.
We have to understand the cross device convergent being build. People can start a search in one device and conclude it
in other device. These opportunities did not exist in the past when we were all focused on one screen. In addition to
that, as we talk about mobility, we start to understand the context of the users a lot better. As I said, where are they,
where have they been, what could their search possibly mean when they're searching for – when you're in a car parking
lot and you're searching for other car dealership, that gives us a very different signal than if you're sitting at your desk
and searching for a car. So, all those attributes, all those factors need to go in, into creating better targeting, better
advertising for our end users so that, that actually helps increase ROI for advertisers and hopefully ROI for us in the
longer term.

And we'll go next to Scott Devitt with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Scott W. Devitt>: Hi. I had two questions. First, Larry mentioned some of the new features in the Maps update. I
think also the Gmail tab update seems like it's been pushed to users now. It'd be great to know if you could share the
timeline just for the full rollout in the U.S. and internationally and any implications you foresee the update may have on
those that are relying on marketing as a distribution channel? And then secondly, Larry also spoke about balloon
deployed Internet access. So I was wondering if you could talk about another initiative that seems like it has significant
opportunity long-term, the automated vehicle opportunity when we think of that as a commercial opportunity at scale.
Thanks.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Yeah. Thanks for that question, Scott. I think I'm not sure of the detail of the Gmail rollout.
I've been excited to use it, and I think it's a really great experience. I think, we're doing a lot to improve people's
experience on Gmail. I'm not sure we have a huge number of users on Gmail. It's growing quickly. We're really, really
excited about it. And I'd just say there are some things around the email experience that can be improved, and we're
doing a lot to organize commercial offers and things like that and make sure that you're not getting overwhelmed by
spam and so on. And I think those have been great, very user positive features we've been rolling out. I think in terms
of automated cars, I mean, again, that's a very early stage thing. I think we're very excited about it. I think it has
potential again to have tremendous impact on people's lives and on mobility and so on. And I think there's nothing
that's changed about that. We're super excited about it and working hard. It's a very early stage project, obviously.
And then there's the last part of your question. I mean I think it's hard to predict exactly when these things will be
commercial. My question I always ask is, why aren't you doing it today, so we try to reduce whatever roadblocks that
we can to getting things out as quickly as possible. And I think that way I think there's great opportunity there.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thank you for your question, Scott. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.
Operator
And we'll go next to Anthony DiClemente with Barclays.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Hi. Thanks. I have one for Patrick and one for Larry. Patrick, just wanted to ask about
CapEx. I think you mentioned in your comments that data centers and other network infrastructure was lumpy and
responsible for the doubling of CapEx. I'm just wondering I'm not sure from an accounting perspective what the useful
life is on some of those investments and whether or not the amortization of those assets is part of what's causing a little
bit of the uplift in operating expenses? So would love to hear a little more about CapEx. And then Larry, as Google
continues to invest for future growth, I just wanted to ask how do you as the leader of the company ensure that the
people at Google and your employees keep the kind of small entrepreneurial culture that Google had and was known
for in its earlier days? Thanks a lot for the question.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: So let me jump in, Anthony on the first part, and then I'll let Larry answer the second. We
don't give the details of the different categories of depreciation for our assets. But you can imagine that as we build
these data centers and the computers, clearly data centers have a long lifetime, because if you think of them as land,
electricity, power, building shells, cooling towers, all that technology has much longer useful lives. And then the
computers themselves, the machines, the servers, have a much shorter lifetime. And we track all these by categories,
obviously. And clearly there's a relationship between that and our depreciation rates that have been, between that and
that have been climbing over the last few quarters. But there's nothing magical about it as well. I mean it's just basically
what you'd expect by category.
On the second question, I'll let Larry answer.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Yeah. It's a great question, I think. I think I'm very, very excited to see. I mentioned the
Project Loon or the automated cars. I think a lot of it is making sure that our employees and Google as a company has

permission to do important things. And those things always start with a small group of people. They start with one or
two people, and then 10 people, and so on. And those people can get a lot of things done. So I think probably I measure
the health of the company in that way is, were you able to start up new and important things and make traction on
them? And that's the only way we end up with things like Android and Chrome, those were once those kind of projects.
So, I look at it as kind of a portfolio thing.
There are some number of people that like to work on really crazy things that are going to really change the world and
want to do it with 10 other friends, work hard on them, and kind of make sure we're creating those opportunities and
growing them into things that become Gmail or Android or Chrome, or things like that. And so I kind of look at it
across our portfolio, and I think we're doing quite well. And I'm pretty excited about it.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thank you for your question, Anthony. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.
Operator
And we'll go next to Mark May with Citi.
<Q - Mark A. May>: Thanks for taking my questions. The first one, I'm wondering, there was an expectation I think
starting this quarter that we'd start to see some of the impact of Enhanced Campaigns, and obviously you're seeing great
adoption of that, and that that adoption and the impact that that might have on blended prices might offset these mix
factors that you referenced. I wonder if you could help walk us through why that wasn't the case necessarily in this
quarter? And then secondly, probably for Patrick, I wonder can you help estimate the impact on the network growth in
the quarter from the quality improvement initiatives? And are these issues that might impact future quarters or was this
mainly a first half of this year kind of impact?
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Yes. That's a great question. I mean, I'll just say maybe one sentence and then turn it over to
the other guys. I think it's important to keep in mind that Enhanced Campaigns is the largest change we made in
AdWords ever. And it was done pretty quickly. And so I think we're still in very, very early stages of that. So we
changed a tremendous amount for how our teams operate, how our advertisers operate, how everyone buys those ads,
what the users see. And we've done it pretty well, you know. It's been pretty smooth, which I'm really excited about.
But like I said, that's the early stages of a very, very major change. I think we're very pleased with how that's going,
so...
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Very much so. And so on the second part of your question, Mark, I think, the quality – the
force for quality around our policies, they will take a year to flow through. I mean, once you've kind of reset the bar,
then it actually by the time people will kind of adhere to these new changes, but then you have to actually navigate
through the entire year-over-year effect, which will probably take a couple of more quarters. So and that's just a timing
issue. Having said that, I just want to remind everybody again that the fundamental issue that we see is, it's really
important for us to actually have a great user experience. And Susan and her team's kind of pounded this by making
changes on a constant basis to make sure that at the end of the day there is that smart about, the quality of the user
experience and the quality of the ads because in the end, that's what really drives the benefit in the long-term. So we
have to take some hits in the short-term in order to actually get the right answer in the long-term for our users and our
advertisers. We're always ready to do them. And that's a great example of it. So, we're actually not too worried about it.
We have so many other areas that we've just talked about Enhanced Campaigns, there's PLAs, there's so many other
areas that offers us kind of opportunities that we just got to keep this in balance. Thank you for your question, Mark.
Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.

<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Great. Thank you very much for the question. I just wanted to follow up on Enhanced
Campaigns. I guess one of the questions people are trying to get at is, was there any impact from Enhanced Campaigns
on paid clicks and CPCs in the quarter that you could try and help us calibrate? And then I guess the other question
would be, given obviously it is still new and broad rollout this quarter, how many quarters do you think this needs to be
in place for you to have a good sense of the impact it might have on those metrics? And then, sorry, then my last
question was anything related to the impact on FX related to CPCs? I didn't think I heard that. Thank you.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Hi, Heather. This is Nikesh. Thank you for your question. I think, let me step back and say, first
of all, it is – as Larry mentioned and Patrick mentioned, it is an existential requirement for us to take our advertisers
and move them to a campaign strategy, which allows us to move them across multiple screens. So this wasn't
something that is just a remedy imperative. It's an imperative from a simplicity perspective, from an advertiser return
perspective, and also from the way our teams operate. So, we have spent the last six months migrating over 6 million
campaigns, as I mentioned. And we'd probably be done by the end of this month, which is not too far away. And as you
can imagine that we've been focusing on moving these things across the board. So, we're still looking at the full impact
since the impact is sort of graduated over the last few months.
Now, in terms of what the impact of this should be in the longer term, as I mentioned earlier, the impact in the longer
term should be that we should be able to provide simpler, faster, better ads to our advertisers across multiple screens. In
terms of when you should be able to see effects of these things, obviously there are effects that we see and we monitor
and take a look at. But it's too early for us to go out and start detailing what the impacts of these things are. But of
course in the long-term it should have a positive impact on conversions and as a result all resulting metrics that affect
conversion.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Heather, I'll just jump on your very last question about FX related to CPCs. As I said in my
comments, there's actually a marginal effect. I mean, FX was not a big factor this quarter. I mean it has been a little bit
for the UK as I mentioned. But for the rest of the world, it has not been a major impact for the CPC issue. Thank you
for your questions, Heather. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.
Operator
And we'll go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Justin Post>: Great. Thank you. Patrick, the gross profit growth has been trailing revenue growth. I think it was
about 14% this quarter for about three quarters especially. Can you talk about what's really kind of drove the step-down
last year in 3Q? And is there any way to see that gap close and do you use gross profit as a measure? Or do you look
more at revenue growth? Just some of the drivers of the difference would be really helpful. Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thanks, Justin. Again, a topic that's for financial analysts has been always kind of top of mind.
I just want to kind of reiterate kind of some of the basic messages that have not changed in how we think about this. So
first of all, we care about revenue growth, we care about profitability. We care about both. And as I said before, right,
we're not in a business to lose money, cross-subsidize or any of these things. So regarding margins, we really look at
every incremental profit dollar that creates shareholder value and really focused on these profit dollars rather than the
percentage margins. Many of the new opportunities that we may be exploring whether it'd be hardware, whether it'd be
Play, many of these will have different margins than our core business. But they actually offer great kind of huge
revenue pools, huge margin pools in absolute dollars. And then create much shareholder value and in many cases with
Larry and the product area leads, great synergistic value between the product to create this great experiences.
So, that's basically the mindset that we apply at it, and we track them independently and together and make sure that we
actually deliver continued revenue growth and profit growth. So that's the mindset at which we apply. And don't read in
my comment that we're not focused on our core business. It remains our core business. The core is the core is the core.
And it continues to give us both revenue and oxygen profits to kind of fuel our growth as well. So that's the balanced
answer to your question.

<Q - Justin Post>: If I could follow up...
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Yeah.
<Q - Justin Post>: Is there anything in there that maybe operating right now at negative gross margins that is kind of
in-transitory in nature?
<A - Patrick Pichette>: I wouldn't comment on a specific product by product, but it's clear that if there are timing
issues, if there's a product that actually is in investment mode, right, and at the beginning of its investment curve, you
know that you're actually investing in it for the timing of future profits. We do that too. I mean, you can imagine our
very first customer in Kansas City, right, the P&L for that day was negative. But that's not why we did Kansas City,
right? We did Kansas City because we knew as a city it was going to be very profitable. So there's clearly products that
have, because of their timing, investment moments that actually will show negative, but not because we want them to
be negative, just because of where they are in their investment phase. So that's how we think about it. Thank you for
your question. Jamie, let's go to the next question, please.
Operator
And we'll go next to Brian Pitz with Jefferies.
<Q - Brian J. Pitz>: Thanks. Nikesh, you briefly mentioned PLAs. We continue to see that format in search and
recently we noticed integrated deals and offers into that format. Any additional color on the impact from PLAs in the
quarter? And then Larry, regarding product search I guess more broadly, do you think users will be able to purchase
items without ever leaving the search results page at some point? Thanks so much.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Yeah, thanks, Brian. I'll take the second question first. I think to the extent and obviously we
can streamline your process of doing transactions or fulfilling any task, that's a good thing. I think in the trial we're
doing, in the Bay Area with same day delivery, you can buy things very easily and get them delivered in a couple
hours, which is a pretty great experience. So we definitely look at any ways we can find to really improve our users'
experience. Nikesh, do you want to take over the PLA parts?
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Yeah. As Larry mentioned, we're trying to get the user experience to be better and better. And as
we've talked in the past, things are moving from ten blue links to entity-level search, where people are searching for
specific entities and they expect a response as a specific entity when they do that search. So, if you think about PLA in
that broader context, that when people search for something, they'd like to get that answer. And if it's a product they're
searching for, of course PLA satisfies that requirement. So we are signing up tens of thousands of merchants who want
to share that data with us, who want to make that data visible as part of Google Search. We think this is a good thing.
Then again, as we provide more and more PLA information, obviously it has an impact on people's clicking on those
links. So in the long-term that should have a positive impact on click-throughs on various ad formats. But for now, it's
too early to talk about the impact of those with the overall numbers that we have.

couple more.

relationship that you have between having the Motorola X phone be enough of a success that you make a statement but
not enough of a success that you end up corrupting or impacting your Android partners? So talk about that relationship.

< A – [05HBT5-E Larry Page>: Thanks for the question, Gene. I think nothing about what we said has changed, and
we operate Motorola independently. And you can see the level of work that's gone on there into operating that business.
I think the teams are doing a great job, as we mentioned. I think they're working hard on making great product, and I
think we're really excited about it. I think they're excited about it, and obviously you'll get to try it out pretty soon.
<Q - Gene E. Munster>: Do you feel that the – I mean, the incremental investment, is it going to be, it's been rumored
to be $500 million. Is it something in that range?
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Are you talking about I guess people have been speculating about marketing and so on? I
think that obviously we're operating Motorola independently. We're running it much the same way you would run any
business like that, and I think we're doing things that are normal for that business. So I think probably too much has
been made over those things.

subscription-based businesses in the future? And do you see this in three to five years as something that would be a
meaningfully sized segment that would rival Network in size for example? And for Patrick, since you've had some
questions about Motorola being excited about it is nice, but the business has lost nearly $1 billion on a GAAP basis in
the last three quarters. So can you give us some sort of time scale for achieving returns here? And I know you
mentioned you're just looking for absolute profit dollars, but what's the ultimate aim for Motorola in terms of
contributing to Google's profit base or even just to distribute more widely Google services? Thanks.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Yes. The question about subscription services, I mean, I think like we said, we're really
excited about the Play, music subscription being really well received. I love using it. I think we're always looking for
ways to meet our users' needs better, and obviously subscriptions are one way to do that. So I'm sure over time we'll try
to meet our users' needs better and have more products in that area. I don't have anything to announce at this time there.
On the Motorola question, Patrick, you want to take that?
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Sure. I think the Motorola question has to be put into context of two things. One is, what we
originally paid for Motorola and all the assets we acquired and the benefits we got out of that acquisition, because there
wasn't only a short-term financial play. There were a number of strategic issues. We're very pleased with the divestiture
of the home business, which kind of generated quite a bit of cash over the last – in Q2. So I think that you have to put
this conversation in the context of the entire acquisition, for which we're really pleased. And we also are incredibly
proud of what the team has accomplished in the last year in having now kind of created this great entity under Dennis,
who has now kind of lean and mean with 5,000 employees focused on the future and really pounding away at the next
generation of products. So, I'll leave it to the coming quarters to kind of really demonstrate the kind of new Motorola
that's showing up. And you'll see that in the coming weeks actually.
Larry, any last comments before we close?
Lawrence E. Page
No. I want to thank everyone for spending so much time with us today. And we will see you all next quarter.
