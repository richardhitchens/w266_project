Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Gerald. Gerald?
Gerald L. Hassell
Thanks, Andy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. As you've seen from our release, we achieved good
results this quarter, with pre-tax earnings up 12% year-over-year. We reported earnings of $0.57 per share, with total
revenues of $3.6 billion. We also achieved a 3% fee growth in Investment Management and Investment Services,
which, within the context of what is a persistently slow economic recovery, is decent fee growth.
Investment Management benefited from our continued success in attracting new assets. We recorded our 18th
consecutive quarter of positive long-term flows, with net long-term inflows of $21 billion. Assets under management
was up 14% year-over-year, to a record $1.62 trillion, driven by the continued strong flows into our liability driven
investment strategies.
Investment Services fees were also up, benefiting not only from strong growth in clearing, but also nice growth in asset
servicing. Now, Investment Services business was also helped by the growing contributions from Global Collateral
Services, as usage of our optimization and segregation solutions continue to increase. And in Global Markets, the
enhancements we've made to our electronic foreign exchange platform has helped us attract greater volumes.
Now, during the quarter, the strength and quality of our asset servicing capabilities were recognized in a key market
survey. Among our peer group, we earned a number one overall score in the R&M Global Custody survey of clients
and fund managers. We were also the number one in the exports category, which included investment managers who
rated five or more global custodians. In total, we received 10 number one rankings in our peer group. It's the latest vote
of confidence in our ability to provide the expertise clients need to navigate the challenging times as they struggle to
manage regulatory change, risk and costs.
Now, we were able to achieve the growth in Investment Management and Investment Services fees in spite of some
ongoing sizable challenges. One, the substantial impact of money market fee waivers. And, two, the decline in the
pre-tax income of Corporate Trust, as the revenue from structured debt securitizations has run off faster than the
revenue coming from new business. Year-over-year, our rough estimate is that money market fee waivers and the
runoff in Corporate Trust fees accounted for a drag to our total fee revenue growth of approximately 200 basis points.
On the expense front, total expenses were down, both year-over-year and sequentially, and Todd will cover more on
expenses in a moment. But what I do want to emphasize is that we are taking aggressive action in virtually every
expense category to moderate the growth rate here.
So for example, we're controlling the rate of expense growth in technology by in-sourcing application development,
reducing storage costs, and consolidating platforms. We're reducing our real estate footprint. We're reengineering how
we work, including rationalizing our client coverage teams, making us more efficient and allowing us to reduce costs,
while enhancing the client experience. And, importantly, you will see evidence of all of these moves in our
commitment to aggressive expense management this year.
I should add that, like all large financial institutions, our regulatory control and compliance costs have risen
substantially, and continue to be high, and I have to say, it's critical that we maintain a great control environment. But
now that we are beginning to gain more clarity on the new rules, the rate of related expense growth should begin to
slow and that's encouraging.
On the capital front, our capital story is among the very best in the industry. Our key capital ratios continue to
strengthen. We achieved an excellent return on tangible common equity, at 18%. Now, given the significant levels of
capital that we generate, and our strong capital position, we have the financial flexibility to invest in our businesses and
maintain a high payout ratio, which was more than 80% in the first quarter of 2014. Earlier this month, we announced
another dividend increase of 13%, which followed a 15% increase last year. So the bottom line is, we're executing to
drive shareholder value, we're actively aligning our business model, and we're focused on managing expenses well and

generating strong returns on tangible common equity. With that, let me turn it over to Todd.
Thomas P. Gibbons
Thanks, Gerald, and good morning, everyone. My comments will follow the quarterly earnings review and we'll start
on page two. As Gerald noted, EPS was $0.57. You should note that the $0.57 includes about $0.03 to $0.04 for the
combined benefit of a lower tax rate, and also we had a loan loss provision credit.
Looking at the numbers on a year over-year-basis, total revenue was $3.6 billion. Investment Services fees were up 3%,
and that's driven by strength in asset servicing and our clearing businesses. Investment Management and performance
fees were also up 3%, and that number would be 5% if you excluded the impact of money market fee waivers. FX
revenue was down, driven by the lower volatility we experienced in the quarter. NIR on a fully taxable equivalent basis
was up 2%, and securities gains were down $26 million. Finally, expenses were down 1%.
Turning to page four, where we call out some business metrics that will help explain our underlying performance, you
can see that AUM of $1.62 trillion was up 14% year-over-year, and that's 2% sequentially. That's driven by both
market, as well as net new business.
During the quarter, we had net long-term inflows of $21 billion, and the volatile short-term outflows we've been seeing
was $7 billion. You'll note that we've enhanced our flow disclosure, providing flows by all of the major asset classes
including the index and LDI strategies.
Assets under custody and administration at quarter-end were $27.9 trillion. That's up $1.6 trillion, or 6%
year-over-year. That's primarily reflecting the impact of market, as well as currency impact. Linked quarter AUC/A
was up 1% due to improved market values. We had an estimated $161 billion in new AUC/A wins during the quarter.
As you look down the list, most of our key metrics continue to show growth on a year-over-year basis. Average loans
and deposits in both management and Investment Services were, again, up strongly. The market value of securities on
loans at period end increased. All of our clearing metrics were up with DART volumes particularly strong yet again.
On the flipside, DR programs and average tri-party repo balances were down slightly. In terms of the key external
indicator, markets were up, but most importantly for us, the FX volatility index was down 14%, and that really is what's
driving FX revenue. And the average Fed Funds effective rate was down 7 basis points or nearly 50% from last year,
which had a negative impact on our money market fee waivers and our net interest income.
Looking at fees on page six, asset servicing fees were up 4% year-over-year, and 3% sequentially. The year-over-year
increase reflects higher market values, net new business and organic growth. The sequential increase primarily reflects
organic growth, but it did benefit from higher securities lending revenue and net new business.
Clearing fees were up 7% year-over-year, and flat sequentially. The year-over-year increase was driven by higher
mutual fund fees, higher asset based fees, and an increase in DARTS. All that was partially offset by higher money
market fee waivers. Sequentially, higher clearance revenue was primarily offset by fewer trading days during the
quarter.
Issuer service fees were down 3% both year-over-year and sequentially, both decreases reflect the impact of the
continued net runoff in Corporate Trust.
The year-over-year decrease was partially offset by higher DR revenue, driven by corporate actions. The good news is
we can see the net fee runoff abating in the next 18 months to 24 months as the pace of the structured debt maturities
slows and new business should more than offset that runoff.
When you look at Investment Services you will see that Investment Services fees as a percentage of non-interest
expense were up versus the year ago quarter. This improvement was primarily driven by an increase in Investment
Services fees, with lesser additional expenses.

Investment Management and performance fees were up 3% year-over-year and down 7% sequentially. Excluding
money market fee waivers, Investment Management and performance fees were up 5% year-over-year and down 6%
sequentially. The year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher equity market values and the net impact of new
business. The sequential decrease primarily reflects seasonal lower performance fees, and there were also fewer days in
the first quarter.
When you look at our Investment Management business you'll see a new disclosure that we think provides a better
basis for comparison to other investment managers, that is, it's an adjusted pre-tax operating margin which excludes
intangible amortization, nets out distribution and servicing expense, and also adjusts for fee waivers.
On this basis, our pre-tax operating margin for the quarter is 35%. In FX and other trading revenue was down 16%
year-over-year and down 7% sequentially. If you look at the underlying components, FX revenue of $130 million was
down 13% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially.
Comparisons with both prior periods were impacted by lower volatility. The good news here is we're capturing higher
volumes, driven by enhancements to our electronic FX platform.
Other trading revenue was down $6 million from the year ago quarter and $14 million from the fourth quarter.
Decreases from both periods reflect lower fixed income trading revenue and the impact of mark to market losses on
certain hedges.
Turning to page eight of the earnings review, you'll see that net interest revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was
up $11 million versus the year ago quarter, and it was down $37 million sequentially. The year-over-year increase
resulted from higher deposits, partially offset by lower yields in investment securities. The sequential decrease
primarily reflects lower yields in investment securities, and fewer days in the first quarter. And that was partially offset
by the change in the mix of assets as we reduced cash and interbank investments and increased our securities portfolio.
Net interest margin for the quarter was 1.05% down from 1.11% in the year ago quarter and 1.09% in the fourth
quarter.
Turning to page nine, total non-interest expenses were down 1% year over year and 4% sequentially. Comparisons to
both prior periods were impacted by lower pension expense and higher incentive expense due to the acceleration of the
vesting of long-term stock awards for retirement-eligible employees.
The sequential decline also reflects a decrease in business development expense, as well as lower professional, legal
and other purchased services and risk related expenses.
The year-over-year decrease also resulted in a provision for administrative errors and the cost of generating certain tax
credits both of which were recorded in the year-ago quarter.
On page 10 you can see that at quarter end we had a net unrealized gain on the investment securities portfolio of $676
million. The increase from $309 million at the end of the quarter was primarily driven by the reduction in market
interest rates.
Looking at our loan book on page 11, you can see that the provision for credit losses was a credit of $18 million. This
was driven by the continued improvement in the credit quality of the loan portfolio. That compares to a credit of $24
million in the year ago quarter and a provision of $6 million in the prior quarter.
Turning to our capital story as Gerald mentioned which is a good one, as you can see on page 12 our key ratios
strengthened over the quarter. At March 31 our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio under the standardized
approach on a fully phased-in basis was 11%, that compares to 10.6% at the end of December.
The 40 basis point sequential increase primarily reflects capital generation during the period, and that was partially
offset by some increase in a few of the risk-weighted asset categories.
Our estimated supplementary leverage ratio also improved substantially during the quarter to approximately 4.7%,
primarily reflecting two things: one, there are some changes to the treatment of unfunded commitments and the

methodology to actually calculate average assets as well as the strong capital generation that we'd mentioned earlier.
During the quarter we repurchased 11.6 million shares for $375 million completing our repurchases under the capital
plan for 2013.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 25.1%. It was positively impacted by the change in New York state tax rates
that was enacted on March 31.
A few points to factor into your thinking about our current quarter and beyond. We would expect NII to stay in the
range we saw this quarter, adjusting of course for day count. The quarterly provisions should be in the range of zero to
$15 million. We expect the tax rate to be around 27% for the second quarter. We anticipate gross share repurchases of
up to approximately $430 million. Of course that's subject to market conditions. And we also expect to record a pre-tax
gain of nearly $500 million on our interest in Wing Hang when the sale closes, which is expected to be in the second or
third quarter. Bear in mind; however, that Wing Hang equity income has averaged somewhere between $15 million and
$20 million per quarter and was included in the other income line.
Gerald had mentioned that we are consolidating our space which will lead to a net reduction in New York City of
approximately 700,000 square feet. There are going to be some costs associated with this consolidation as we
reposition our staff, but we expect gains to more than offset these costs when we sell the One Wall Street Building and
move to a more efficient space. That sale and the gain could take place in the second or third quarter. So as Gerald
indicated, you'll see evidence of these actions this year.
So wrapping up, we're taking action to control expenses relative to our revenues, and we want you to see it in our
results. We're going to provide you with more details on this at our Investor Day that we plan to be hosting in the fall.
With that, let me hand it back to Gerald.
Gerald L. Hassell
Thanks, Todd, and I think we can open it up to questions, Wendy.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator instructions] Our first question today is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi. Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Good morning.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: A couple of questions. One on expenses, one on capital. On the expense side, Todd, you
went through the outlook for the improvement in expenses associated with the space that you're getting rid of. Could
you give us a sense as to what that's going to be on a run rate basis? I know you can't size exactly what the gain is going
to be, but maybe you can help us on the run rate, expense ratio side.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: It's actually hard for us to put an exact number on that because we haven't decided where
we're actually going to be located. We haven't signed a lease on a new property, or what are some of the costs
associated with that. We do know there will be improvement, but Betsy, it's a little early to actually specify a number.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. Maybe a little bigger picture on the expenses then. Gerald, you mentioned during your
prepared remarks that expectations are that expense growth could slow down here with regulatory expenses slowing
down. Did you suggest there that regulatory expenses could actually start to fall, slowing the overall growth rate or just
the regulatory expense growth would be slower?

<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Just slower. They're not going to fall, that's for sure, because we're still building out risk
compliance, a variety of data aggregation models, risk analytics models et cetera, that the regulators are asking for. So
we don't see the expenses declining, but we see the rate of growth slowing, as some of these things have already been
embedded in our run rate.
A good example is in our broker-dealer services tri-party area. At the shareholders meeting, we gave a number that,
over the last two years, we've incurred about $73 million of additional expense in that business, associated with
regulatory compliance and satisfying tri-party reform. That's in our run rate today. So that's a good example where the
rate of growth will slow, but it won't decline.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. So for...
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Betsy, let me add something there. The rate of growth in the risk, and kind of what we call
the center or the shared services, has been 2 times to 3 times the rate of growth in the businesses, and we're trying to
bring that more in line.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay, so if we're thinking about just operating leverage generally, and the kind of operating
leverage you're looking to manage towards, maybe you could give us a sense of what kind of range you're anticipating
all the actions that you're doing is going to end up driving, in terms of operating leverage.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah. Betsy, as we try to make clear, operating leverage is going to be driven both by the
expense control that we implement, as well as the revenue mix. So, when we see fee waivers, for example, increase,
we're seeing a loss revenue with no additional expenses, and when it gets replaced by increases in either the Investment
Management or Investment Services traditional fees, there are typically expenses that come with that. So I want to
make it clear that revenue mix is absolutely essential to what actually happens to operating leverage.
That being said, we are controlling nominal expenses. So we are getting our hands around a number of things, both in
the center, slowing the growth rate, even flattening it. For example, our capital budget is flat. We're getting more out of
the tech spend that we currently have, and we can expand on that conversation a bit. But if all things hold constant, yes,
you will see, in other words, if the revenue mix stays as it is, and the market stays as it is, you'll see positive operating
leverage, even at relatively low growth rates.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. That's great. Just one quick separate question. You went through the capital ratios that
all look good going up, obviously. What was the reason that the TC to TA came down?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: The tangible common equity total assets?
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Right. Right. It was just like a 20 bps decline Q-on-Q.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: It's not much of a change, if there is any change. The balance sheet might have averaged a
little bit larger, but I don't think there was much of a change in TC.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Yeah. NO, I mean it was 20 bps, just wondering. Okay, and then, on SLR, up nicely in the
quarter, what other action – I mean your SLR assumes that your deposits to Fed are not taken out, or they are taken
out? They're not in the denominator, is that right?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: No, they are in the denominator.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Cash is not removed from the denominator.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Right, okay. So you're assuming that and I know it's not the final rule yet, but we're assuming
that it's going to be in the final rule. So from here, is it just normal course to get up to the 5%? Is there anything special
that you feel like you need to do? I know, at one point, we were talking about potentially having to charge for deposits,
but it doesn't seem like that's in the run rate, given how high you've gotten this up to now.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: I think that we can actually get over the hurdle pretty quickly. I think the one thing we've
made clear is it doesn't make sense to get there just by holding additional capital. So we can look at the deposit base

and deposits that have less value to – less value under the SLR or even the liquidity coverage ratio, we can certainly
push those types of balances off the balance sheet.
But we're still looking, at some point we'll be able to deconsolidate some of the assets from our asset manager. So there
are a number of ways that we can get there, and we obviously have more room to issue preferred stock if we thought it
was appropriate to bolster our Tier 1 leverage, which would be a lot less expensive than holding common.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay, great. Thank you.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Glenn Schorr with ISI Group.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hi, thanks. One quick one on the Investment Management side. I heard your comments and
disclosure on the 25% versus 35% margin in Investment Management. Are you able to break down which is due to the
distribution adjustments versus the money market fee waivers because I think it's fair and interesting, just curious on
the breakdown.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, my recollection, Glenn, is about 200 basis points of it is related to fee waivers. And
you can calculate – we disclose intangible amortization, so you can calculate that, and then the remainder would be the
impact of the distribution fees. Some show as a gross up and some show as a net to the revenue.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Got it. Okay, that's cool. I could do that. And then, I don't know if you could talk more a little
bit about the lending growth inside Investment Services. I think it was up 18% year-on-year. Just curious what's driving
that.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah, Glenn, sure. That's associated with, in some ways, with our collateral services area,
where we provide some level of secured financing to the broker dealer community as part of the optimization and
segregation, but it's also around collateral services around that area. So it's a program where they're good, safe loans,
highly collateralized to some of our largest clients around the world.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Glenn, this has come a little bit slower than we had hoped for, but we're actually starting
to see it pick up and we're seeing that trend even in the second quarter.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah. And a little bit of it is, quote, term funding, so it's having the dealers rely on less
short-term wholesale funding. So we're seeing 6 months, 9 months, some cases, one year maturities on these loans. So
that helps our clients who have less reliance on wholesale short-term funding, and it's a good earning asset for us.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. Last one. Non-interest bearing deposit growth was up 16% year-on-year. If you look at
your foreign deposits, you have like $100 billion. Curious, what's driving the growth? And, more importantly, what's in
the eurozone as they contemplate the negative deposit rates? Just curious on how we should expect the balance sheet to
react.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, good question. So there are a fair amount of European as well as U.S. deposits, and
the actual average deposits is about flat to slightly down. Free deposits are actually up, but interest-bearing deposits are
slightly down on a quarter-over-quarter basis.
If the eurozone were to go to negative rates, that would actually present the opportunity for us to charge for deposits,
and we are giving that a very serious consideration. In the two non eurozone, European countries that did go to negative
rates, we did pass that through to depositors.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: And no client pushback? I guess where I'm going with it is, one route is charging for deposits.
Sometimes, with large customers, that's a bit of an issue. Is it possible to the run a mismatch and move your assets
outside the zone? Or is that not something anybody wants to take on, in terms of the mismatch?

<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Well, typically, you'll have the interest rate parity that comes with the hedging of that type
of a transaction, as long as you're assuming you're not taking the FX risk. There is some opportunity to do some of that
with the hedging, but again, managing your liquidity and also the liquidity coverage ratio targets that the regulators are
establishing will have to be taken into consideration when you do that, Glenn.

Operator
Thank you. As a reminder, we do ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question. The
next question is from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody. It's a question on the Investment Management
business, I guess if we look at the growth in assets and the fee rate, quarter-over-quarter it seems like it saw a pretty
decent decline and understandably some of that is money market fee waivers although it didn't seem like the dollar
amount was that different sequentially so I guess the day count accounts for the rest of it. But can you guys just kind of
walk us through the expectations for the fee rate in the Investment Management business ex performance fees in the
coming quarters? And to tie into that, maybe just to address what kind of fees are you guys getting on the LDI
mandates? Because that obviously seems to be a big driver.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Curtis
<A - Curtis Y. Arledge>: Hey, Alex, Curtis Arledge here. So on a year-over-year basis, and I'll talk about sequentially
as well. The biggest drag as Todd mentioned was the fee waiver impact. Very significant decline year-over-year in
short rates, and that has absolutely dampened revenue growth. So revenue growth of 3% would have been north of 5%.
Actually as Investment Management a little more than 200 basis points, just the fee waiver impact.
We also are comparing the first quarter of 2014 to what was a very strong first quarter of 2013 on the fee side. We
actually have fees, when we own less than 20% of an investment boutique, our share of their performance fees and
carrier interest actually runs through that fee line and it can be somewhat volatile. We had a fairly strong first quarter in
2013, so if you just look at a normalized rate that probably is another 100 basis points to 200 basis points of fee growth.
So we're actually pretty happy with fee growth generally given the mix of assets that we have and the market
performance overall. Very nice performance on the new business front.
The sequential story is really not that different, so fee waivers have smaller impact as you said. The days, actually was
a pretty meaningful impact. And then again, the volatility in our management fee-line from performance fees that are
earned at the boutiques where we have less than 20% stake also contributed to that volatility. It's small but nonetheless
it's still directionally the same as the year-over-year results.
LDI, obviously a business that we are doing extraordinarily well in, and not just the LDI business inside in the U.K.,
but their ability to leverage that into other growth in active fixed income in absolute return products. So it's a
springboard for many other businesses.
LDI by itself is a business that does have lower fees but on a giant volume of assets, and then I also would want to
make sure that everybody understands that while the management fees might be low there also is a meaningful
opportunity in a number of those mandates that are on performance fees. And so when you see our fourth quarter
performance fees, a meaningful portion of that is actually coming from LDI related mandates, where we are given an
opportunity in our performance fee if we are able to outperform a client's benchmark.
So it's a great business for us overall and again helping drive not just revenues in LDI but other revenues, as well.

<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Got it. Thanks. That's a lot of color. And just to follow up on expenses I guess Todd bigger
picture, seasonally first quarter I guess tends to be a little lighter, some of the merit increases, things like that I think
kick in for you guys in the second half of year. So maybe just taking a step back, how should we think about the
expense growth for the current base because it does seem like that's one of the lower kind of core expense numbers
we've seen from you guys in a while. So kind of $2.7 billion, $2.8 billion run rate quarterly, is that a sustainable
number or what kind of growth should we think about from or for this base?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, in the second half you're right, typically July 1 is where a merit increase pulls
through, but we're looking to – I think we're looking to keep most of the expense lines as flat as we can. I think you'll
see a little bit higher software amortization. It's going to be a little bit more noise than anything. The first quarter you've
got to remember is also impacted by the acceleration of retirement eligible employees on their deferred comp. So that
should reverse itself in the second quarter.
<Q - Alexander Blostein>: Got it. Thanks, guys.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Thank you.

Thank you. The next question is from Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Good morning.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: So my sense is you've been working on a benchmarking analysis of your Asset
Management segment margins versus your peers. I guess adjusting for fee waivers you said they're in the mid 30%
range which I think seems a bit low for a firm of your scale on $1.6 trillion in assets under management. So I'm
wondering if you're able at this point to communicate whether you think there's a good structural reason for that or if
you see there is maybe a meaningful opportunity to improve margins in the business. I think with the revenue yield on
LDI, indexing cash are pretty low and those are probably 65% of the total. But maybe what are the contribution
margins in those businesses? And could that be enough to offset the revenue yields?
<A - Curtis Y. Arledge>: Hey Luke, this is Curtis. We obviously have spent a lot of time on understanding the
industry framework, and working with clients across a lot of different channels thinking about what it means for our
margins. I do think as Todd walked through earlier, the intangible amortization, the distribution – netting of distribution
costs and fee waivers get us into that mid-30% range. I also would highlight that as we've talked about in previous
earnings calls over the past year or so, really last 9 months or so, most impactful, we've also been investing in our
business. And so I would say that's probably in the 1% to 2% range on margins, just in terms of how we think about it.
When we look, the biggest structural thing that we talk about a lot has been the fee waiver impact and the contribution
margins there are well north of what our overall margin is. So it would be nice to not have fee waivers, obviously that
would help a great deal.
And then the other structural thing that we've also talked about is that if you look at our business and you commented
on it somewhat in your question, we are a predominantly focused on institutional clients' management firm. And it's
why we have been, over the past 9 months or so, really making pretty meaningful investments in two ways to expand,
to reach more individuals as investors.
We do that in two ways. One, directly through direct contact with individuals through our wealth management business
here in the U.S. Great business, 7th largest in the U.S. but great room, also great opportunity for us to expand it and
we've been growing in markets where we've had little presence and even in some cases no presence. That has actually
gone quite well. We've talked about expanding that sales force by about 50% about a year ago and we're about 60% of
the way through that expansion. Starting to see revenues from having done that, really quite excited about it.

It's bringing the great offerings, investment offerings we have around our firm plus also the power of being a private
bank, and I would highlight the award that we note in our earnings release where we were named the top private bank.
Our wealth management team is doing an exceptional job in expanding their reach. It's going to be fantastic. The other
way we're expanding to individual investors, the second method is through intermediaries, where we work with
advisers. And there's been some coverage of this in what's going on with us.
I would highlight, this is not a startup effort on our part. In fact, BNY Mellon and Dreyfus was one of the original
creators of the mutual fund industry, and BNY Mellon has both a U.S. presence through Dreyfus but also has a global
presence. We have about $156 billion in long-term mutual fund assets which would make us one of the – just on a retail
basis, one of the largest 100 asset managers in the world, just from a retail asset base. So we already have a pretty
significant presence here.
But it isn't anywhere close to what we think it should be. So we've also been investing there. And I think that when you
look at firms who have margins higher than ours, they're able to take their investment offerings and get them through
client channels that are not just institutional, but also reach individuals, as well. And so that's why we've been doing
that.
We do a lot of work and Luke, you and I talk about a study that we used MacKenzie, we think MacKenzie's
benchmarking study is one of the best in the marketplace and we are actually right at or slightly above peers who look
like us. So that's sort of a long-winded answer to your marketing question.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: Okay, just to follow up on that, I guess I'm not, in terms of the investments you're making
in the retail business, I'm not clear whether you think that's a higher margin business or that's more about having an
underutilized retail platform that you're going to scale up. And then I guess along with that, how do you rate the
strength of the Dreyfus brand especially in the wirehouse distribution channel? And are you considering a rebranding
campaign? Or do you think that's the brand that you really want to build on?
<A - Curtis Y. Arledge>: So the first question is I think there is a underutilized potential. I think the contribution
margins of taking investment capabilities that we already have today, that we are offering in some ways to the retail
channels, and directly through Wealth Management also, but expanding that will be a pretty meaningful contribution
margin. We don't have to expand our investment capabilities all that much, and can reach a much broader universe of
clients. And again this is a market where we are already very present, and we just want to get bigger in it because we
think there is great opportunity with what we have.
On the Dreyfus branding side, I mean, I definitely think that part, it isn't just about covering clients. You also have to
have the right products. We've launched a number of products and have actually seen some very early success. I would
tell you we're already seeing benefits. If you look at our line in the earnings release today, we've had $2 billion of
inflows in alternatives, as an example. And that has actually come through what would traditionally be called retail
channels.
The new products we've launched have been everything from long short funds for both Newton and the Boston
Company to multimanager liquid alt strategies that are managed by EACM, which is our hedge fund investment firm.
And we also launched a, we'll use the term smart beta product as well. So it's giving us the ability to reach more clients
with more products. And again, benefiting from the great position we already have in those channels. The Dreyfus
brand I think will grow with our expansion here. And any changes around branding, those are certainly things we talk
about. Gerald, if you want to comment.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah, I'd just add one more comment, Luke, and that is that we're not totally relying on the
Dreyfus brand. And so the other boutique brands which have strong names in their own right are being put on the
various channels and various platforms around the world. And so pick a name, a Newton, a Walter Scott, the Boston
Company, Standish all have branding – name recognition in their category space and placing those more aggressively
on third party platforms is part of the goal here, and I think they have good names in order to attract assets.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, and maybe the last point on this question is we actually have a BNY Mellon fund
family outside the U.S. It's quite large and actually inside the U.S. it's about $18 billion of assets. It's been primarily

used as the way that our wealth management business has managed mutual funds. But so Dreyfus has about –
long-term assets is about $66 billion. The wealth management in the U.S. BNY Mellon family is right around $18
billion and then there's north of $70 billion outside the U.S. So the BNY Mellon brand globally actually is in pretty
good condition.
And then I would also tell you one of the places that we are very excited about is the ability to connect with our
brethren in the Pershing organization who are reaching the RIA and independent broker-dealer network, that have
substantially more clients and is actually a very difficult client channel to reach unless you have the ability to partner
with our firm with Pershing and all the relationships they have with those clients.
So a lot of great opportunity here. We're very excited about it. It will obviously take some time. We've been making
investments in it. We went a little over a year ago actually, had our board and management team here approve this
investment, and very excited about the progress we're making already. The team is working very hard and coming
together. And you may have seen we've made some senior hires recently and those people are very important to helping
build the brand that we'll market.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: Very helpful. Thank you very much.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Hi. Thanks, good morning.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Good morning, Ken.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Todd, I was wondering or I'm sorry just for anyone who it's most relevant, the new business
wins on the custody side have kind of been running at sub-$200 million for a couple of quarters now. I was just
wondering if you could give us a flavor for the business pipeline on the asset servicing side, whether it's a market effect
or whether it is changes to the marketplace and how your pipeline is looking.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Tim, why don't you take that?
<A - Timothy Francis Keaney>: Sure. Hey, Ken, Tim Keaney. We look at it, Ken, both on an asset basis and revenue.
I would say it's actually been pretty consistent particularly on the revenue side for the last six quarters or so. I think it's
reflecting something we've talked about on the last few quarterly calls, a real shift in non-AUC/A types of business,
things like our transfer agency business, our sub transfer agency our sub accounting business and middle office
outsourcing which now is about a third of our pipeline and has been consistently so now for the last several quarters as
insurance companies and asset managers look to outsource.
So I wouldn't be overly concerned about that sub-$200 million number. I feel pretty good about the consistency of the
revenue and it's a sign of the mix. And on the overall point on the sales pipeline it's about $2 trillion that's been not
quite a high watermark but a very, very, very strong pipeline both in asset servicing and I would also – Brian Shea is
saying Pershing.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Okay. Secondly, just Todd, to your point on the NII front, I'm just wondering, you saw a
decent decline in your earning asset yields and I hear your points about keeping duration short, but can you just talk to
us how you're balancing the rate environment with the longer term asset sensitivity? And where your kind of new
investments are versus your rolling-off rate?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah. We're probably going to see a little more in the loan book, so that's one of the things
that you've seen pick up as we've seen a little bit of a decline in cash at central banks, as well as in interbank
placements. So that's rolling into the secured loan book that we've talked about, and it's offset some of the slight spread

tightening that we've seen just generally from narrower spreads.
We are taking a hard look at the investment securities book now, and given the new regulations that are meant to go
into effect next year, we will probably need to reposition that book a bit. And there are certain types of assets that will
become more attractive to us, such as commercial mortgage backed securities, we'll probably hold a little less of certain
high-quality asset-backed securities.
We'll have to think about what we might want to do with munis for example because of how they get treated. To date,
we've actually built up a bit of a short-term treasury portfolio, as well, just to be defensive in case interest rates ever
actually went south, or the interest on excess reserves were to go south in the short term. We don't think that's going to
happen but it's a defensive position with very little risk. So we're actually, Ken, in the middle of analyzing exactly what
we're ultimately going to look like.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Okay. And do you – I mean it's tough to have an answer today but is that something that
we'll hear about do you think in a quarter or two? Or is that something that will evolve over the next year or so? How
do we get the sense of what the net effect of that might be from an income statement perspective?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Right now, we're thinking it's probably neutral. So I'll give you that much guidance, but
this is one of the reasons that we targeted the late fall to hold an investors conference. We need to give clarity around
this, also around the capital implications, the balance sheet and so forth, and some of our other strategies. So it fits
pretty neatly into that timing.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Okay, and then just last two quick cleanups together. Do you have the accretion number
this quarter? And also, was there anything notable in the nice reduction you saw in other expense?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: The accretion and the – there are really two things that are helping, or actually negatively
impacting the net interest margin. One is the accretion, and both on a year-over-year and sequential basis, it's about $5
million. And the other is the amortization of the premium, and on a year-over-year basis, that was about $11 million. So
that's about a $16 million impact. A little less sequentially.
And so that's what's driving some of that number. I don't expect that to change too much. So the accretion should be
kind of in that ballpark, as we see these securities just continue to burn off over time.
Nothing particularly notable in the other side. We did have a litigation recovery, or release from our provision, of about
$12 million. So that's one of the beneficiaries, but other than that, everything was pretty well controlled in the other
category.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Okay, great. Thanks a lot, guys.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Cynthia Mayer>: Hi. Thanks a lot. So a question on the Corporate Trust, you mentioned the runoff, the higher
margin securitizations over the next 12 months to 18 months. I was just wondering if you could give us a sense of the
magnitude of the revenue associated with that? I saw for instance issuer services was down about $8 million
sequentially. Is that typical of the kind of step-down we could expect? Or do you expect it to occur evenly? Any color
would be great.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Sure. Cynthia, in terms of fee revenue, what we've explained or we've disclosed is that we
expect about half of 1% of our total revenue to step down as kind of a net runoff impact. So somewhere in the vicinity
of $50 million to $75 million a year. And within Issuer Services, there are really two businesses now. There's
Depositary Receipts and there's Corporate Trust. And so, Depositary Receipts actually did a little better, and Corporate
Trust was the difference. So it's pretty consistent with the guidance that we've previously given.

<Q - Cynthia Mayer>: Okay, so you expect that, basically, to bottom out after 18 months, and then be steady?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah. A lot of these securitizations were in the ballpark of 10 years or so. And so a lot of
them were constructed back in 2006 and 2007, so we'll get to that end-point. I think the other thing to note is, there's
not a lot of reduction in expenses that comes with these. You still have to do the same servicing, even though it's just on
a smaller base.
<A - Curtis Y. Arledge>: I will point out, we are getting more than our fair share of the new issuance market, and
we're seeing some CLO pickup, activity in the CLO space. We're a bit encouraged that the housing market will see
some recovery and securities coming out of that. So I think we're a bit more optimistic about seeing some new business
come on to, hopefully, shorten that timeframe, but it really depends on the market's recovering and new securities being
issued.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: So the proposals that are currently coming out of the Senate are looking for a private
solution, at least in terms of the securitization market, which will present opportunities for us in our Corporate Trust
function. Again, who knows when that's going to actually be passed, but it's at least good to see some indication of
what the future might look like.
<Q - Cynthia Mayer>: Okay. And then just a small one on SEC lending. I know it's not a big business for you, but it
looks like the market value of securities on loan was up quite a bit sequentially. What's behind that? How do you see
that business? Is it ever going to recuperate to past levels, do you think?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah, Cynthia, it was a very nice pickup. Securities out on loan picked up during the quarter,
and we're taking some action on our own part to put some securities out in the marketplace, and satisfy client demand.
So we're optimistic we'll see that the rate of growth there will continue to improve. Spreads are very low, but the
volumes are up. So we'll take it.
<Q - Cynthia Mayer>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.
<Q - Geoffrey Elliott>: Hello there. A quick question on the assets under custody growth, which seems to be lagging
to some of the peer groups. So I guess the question I have is, if your customers are very satisfied, you mentioned the
global custody survey where you came out well. Why isn't that translating into stronger growth in assets under custody?
And do you want to change that?
<A - Curtis Y. Arledge>: Well, two things. I think we are pretty much in line with most of our peers. Quarter to
quarter, it's also a bit episodic. You can have some lumpy new business come in and convert. So that's another issue.
We're also trying to be somewhat price-disciplined in certain client categories. And so we're trying not to chase the
lowest price on every piece of business, and so we're trying to impose some discipline on ourselves in the marketplace.
We feel reasonably good about the growth in assets under custody and the mix of business that we have.
<Q - Geoffrey Elliott>: And you mentioned the need for price discipline and not chasing every piece of business.
What are the areas where you think competition is particularly intense at the moment?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Tim, why don't you take that one?
<A - Timothy Francis Keaney>: Sure. Jeff, it's Tim Keaney. As we've said it's a consistent theme now, we do have
pricing power in smaller and, I would say, middle market clients, where we have been very consistently repricing in the
asset servicing business, and continue to do so with pretty high retention rates. It's the exact opposite with the minority
of your largest clients, where there's a couple of things happening there. They're being really tough on, I would say,
core custody. But I would say on the flipside, they're very open to doing more business with fewer providers, and it's
much more about share of wallet and gaining share of wallet, which is why I think Gerald referenced a couple of key

points that I hope weren't overlooked. The progress that we're making on the investments we've made on building out
our collateral capabilities, and continuing to invest in our electronic platforms in foreign exchange. Those are paying
off. So it's about doing more with the largest clients, but it is still very tough price competition at the high end of the
market.

Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Robert Lee with KBW.
<Q - Robert Lee>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: God morning.
<Q - Robert Lee>: I have a question really focusing on asset servicing. I'm understanding that your underlying mix is,
I believe, skewed towards fixed income and cash, you don't necessarily get the full benefit of the market lift. But we've
had, I guess, pretty strong past year with kind of, at least equity market tailwinds, and it does seem like business
activity has been reasonably active and I think that the 4% year-over-year growth, excluding SEC lending. So what
does it take to really get that business kind of to a faster growth rate, high single digits? Is there just – is it structurally
just, even with some good tailwinds that structurally it's really just kind of a mid, low, single digit growth business? Or
is there something else that we're not seeing that you think is really weighing on that particular revenue line?
<A - Timothy Francis Keaney>: Robert, Tim Keaney again. I think if you pull out the securities lending, which is
probably the more helpful way to look at it, you'd see fees in asset servicing up 5% year-on-year, and 2% sequentially,
very closely aligned with sort of the AUC growth. But I think what's changing in the market is a shift towards financial
institutions. We don't see a lot of defined benefit pension plan or central bank business moving, and that's a good thing
because we have a big market share there. But they are very slow growers.
What's really been growing the asset servicing business is financial institutions. So mutual funds, banks, [ph] brokers
(54:19) and hedge funds. And I think that really plays to our strengths because we've been investing in our outsourcing
capabilities. Bridgewater is, I think, a great example of where we've been making big investments. I mentioned
collateral and FX, and I think that's where the opportunity for us is going to turn, as we focus on bundled players that
are winners in the consolidating industries that they compete in. When our clients grow, we grow. But it also means we
need to continue to invest in the products and services that our clients need. And those areas are ones that we really
believe are going to continue to drive our growth.
And I would also say there's a space that we have a unique position in that we don't see a lot of our traditional trust
bank competitors, and that's where private banks and other financial advisers are getting out of self-clearing and they're
looking at Pershing and the platforms that we've been investing in there. That, we believe, over the next year or two, is
going to be another really bright spot for us. So I think it's those two or three things that will be real catalysts for us,
and maintaining a strong price discipline.
<Q - Robert Lee>: Okay, and maybe just, it's a question and a suggestion maybe. You talked about new business wins,
and you did mention that you're seeing a lot of business not coming. I know revenue streams are tied to AUC or
administrative assets. But is it possibly to get a sense for what the revenue impact is on your new business wins? If you
have $160 billion of net new wins, should we be thinking – it's always hard to translate that into what it really means. Is
that $5 million in revenue, $25 million in revenue? So I guess it's a question and a suggestion, it would be great to get
some of those kind of metrics, [ph] what are (56:06) kind of the revenue impact of net new business?
<A - Timothy Francis Keaney>: I think, Robert, and it's just a point and I'm nodding at Todd here. It's really hard to
answer that question with any specificity because of the business mix. And I just will go back and say the question that
was asked earlier, am I worried at all about the sub-$200 million of AUC/A wins? I'm not. We've been looking at and
quantify what we see the value of the business being each quarter, and it's been pretty darn consistent the last six

quarters or so. Todd I don't know...
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, I think I'd just add the fact that our revenues in asset servicing is closely linked, the
growth rate is closely linked to the growth rate in AUC whether it's market driven or new business wins, I think it's
keeping that correlation pretty tight.
<Q - Robert Lee>: All right. Well, thank you for taking my questions.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: You're welcome.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Good morning.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Good morning.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Just on the SLR here, a lot of encouraging momentum here this quarter. Was hoping just
mechanically maybe you could break down the improvement in the SLR to the different components, how much was
retained earnings versus daily average balance on the asset side and such, and also give a reminder or some sort of
sense about what kind of buffer you intend to run with above the 5% requirement at the holdco?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Okay. Sure, Brennan. In terms of the breakdown between capital generation and what I'll
call the change in the denominator, it's about half in capital generation and half the change in the denominator. So the
change in the denominator, there were really two things, as the U.S. is moving towards the Basel adoption of the
denominator definitions. One is unfunded commitments get treated using the credit conversion factor that was
established under Basel I. That was worth about a $20 billion reduction in assets that we'd have to otherwise have put
into our denominator.
And then the rest of it was the change from going from an average calculation of the balance sheet to a month-end
calculation, so the average of three month-ends. So typically we would see balance sheets grow especially at quarter
ends a little bit and you could see our spot balance sheet versus our average balance sheet is almost always higher. That
was probably worth about $12 billion or $15 billion in assets. So the combination of the two was just about evenly
split.
<A - Curtis Y. Arledge>: On the buffer part of your question given how much cash we have at central bank, we don't
expect to run much in the way of a buffer.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. Okay, that makes sense. And then on the money market fund business, can you
maybe give us a sense of the size of the institutional money market business that you have in the U.S.? And how that
institutional book breaks down in between prime, versus treasury and other?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Well, virtually all of the money market business is U.S. We really don't have much in the
way of outside the U.S. money market funds. Most of it is sourced through – almost 50% of our money market funds
come from our asset servicing and Pershing platforms so that's been one of the positive synergies. It's not worth as
much right now but it's one of the positive synergies of being associated with a large asset servicing book of business.
So a lot of the deposits in the money market funds are sourced from internal clients or the Pershing platform. That's the
way to think about it. So it's really a U.S. based business.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: As to the split between treasury and prime, I don't have it of the top of my head. Curtis do
you have it?
<A - Curtis Y. Arledge>: Yeah. It moves around quite a bit. We have a – so let me give you some general answer. We
have a much larger institutional than retail money market business and a much larger treasury than prime compared to

many others. Again, the number's [ph] a rounding – (1:00:24) but it's a pretty meaningful treasury business.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay, so if we think about where the market is in that various breakdown you guys would
probably skew more to the treasury side than the broad market would?
<A - Curtis Y. Arledge>: Yeah, exactly.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: And so that's why the fee waiver thing is obviously – with treasury rates at zero.
<A - Curtis Y. Arledge>: Lower yields.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yes, exactly.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Sure. Great. Thanks for the color.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Thank you.

Thank you. The next question is from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Ashley N. Serrao>: Good morning. On collateral management, you touched a little bit about the investments
you're making to build out the business. But how should we think about the longer term opportunity for you there? So
any color on how much money you're making from the business today and how the competitive landscape is evolving
would be appreciated.
<A - Curtis Y. Arledge>: Okay. We've been making investments over the last year, year and a half in that space. It's
starting to show up in the Investment Services fees. It's one of the contributors to the growth there. We don't break it
out individually. Right now, we're seeing more in the segregation category, i.e., being the custodian for the segregated
assets around collateral services. At some point it will start to move into the higher-valued transformational aspects of
collateral services.
Doing some secured financing has also been a contributor to the collateral services. We do see this evolving. It's
evolved more slowly than we would have expected as the new laws and regulations are kicking in. We expect this to
pick up over the course of time and it's a global phenomenon, I might add. So we see opportunities to do this in all parts
of the world.
<Q - Ashley N. Serrao>: Great. Thanks for the color there. And on the SLR, good progress this quarter, but as the rule
hopefully enters the final inning, what impact do you think the rule as it stands today has on business decisions for you,
and more broadly the industry? And then just a broader update on the global regulatory landscape will also be
appreciated.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Well, I'll deal with the SLR question. Maybe Gerald you can handle the broader question
on the regulatory landscape. In terms of, for I think everybody in the industry and certainly the big institutions, they're
going to be more balance sheet sensitive and so use of the balance sheet is going to come with a higher cost. So that as
we look at any of our businesses, the balance sheet intensive businesses are going to come under tighter scrutiny, can
they make the returns and how do we squeeze the returns out of them? It's part of the reason that frankly we like the
Investment Management business because there's no balance sheet that comes with that. So I think that is a question
that all large financial institutions are dealing with right now. Gerald, I don't know if you want to comment on the
regulatory.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Well, on the regulatory front, I guess the thing that's challenging for all of us is the lack of
harmonization across the regulatory environment. What Basel adopts, the U.S. has a different standard, and the U.K.
has a different standard, the ECB has a different standard, it's particularly challenging to all of us to determine what's
the right mix of businesses and use of balance sheet or not, with this changing environment.

We're starting to get a little more clarity around it and it's – we're certainly very focused as a company around making
sure our business model performs well in the new environment. Other firms are going through the same
decision-making process.
I think as Todd pointed out, anything that's balance sheet intensive is either going to shrink or get priced up. And I
think that's one of the things the regulators are looking for, is to make sure risk is appropriately priced in the
marketplace or stop doing the activity. And so I think that's going to be some of the changes you see more broadly
across the industry.
<Q - Ashley N. Serrao>: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Rob Rutschow with CLSA.
<Q - Rob C. Rutschow>: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. The first question is on expenses. You
had close to a 10% decline in the employee benefits expense sequentially. And if I'm reading the numbers right you
also eliminated pension liabilities for capital purposes, so was the sequential change just due to a change in
assumptions? Or is there something else you're doing there that allows you to reduce those pension expenses?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Okay, Rob, the reduction in the pension expense is a combination of the – there's nothing
unusual there. The plan has been – the defined benefit plan is largely driven by I should say by the defined benefit plan.
The defined benefit plan was frozen to new entrants quite a few years ago and the year-over-year changes, the first time
that we actually saw interest rates go up in quite a few years as the discount factor on the liability, that in combination
with the very strong underlying performance of the assets that sit in the fund, even though we reduced what we
estimate our go-forward returns are going to be, that reduced our pension expense we estimated it should be by about
$100 million this year. So $25 million a quarter or so. So that's largely the driver of what you're seeing on the benefits
front.
<Q - Rob C. Rutschow>: Okay. That's helpful. And the follow-up question would be on – I don't know if you guys
have ever provided this or if you can, but what would be your total regulatory expense? And is there any way to
segment that between servicing and Investment Management? Thank you.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yes, we have not disclosed a specific number, except for the cost of actually complying
with tri-party reform, where we have seen our expenses in that particular unit run rate go up, and it's not exclusively
related to tri-party reform but most of it is, by over $70 million. There's very limited impact in the Investment
Management space around regulatory. It's almost all Investment Services related.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Jim...
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Wendy, we have time for one more question.
Operator
Okay. The final question is from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Hey, good morning. Maybe I could just ask about the DR business. It looks like M&A is
picking up across border IPO activity seems to be picking up. Can you discuss the pipeline and relative to the
somewhat weak results this quarter, is it just a little too early to tell? Or how do you think of that going forward?

<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, let me start just by referring to this quarter, Jim. It actually wasn't a bad quarter. We
saw some decent corporate actions, and revenues weren't too bad so when you look at the issuer services number, that's
masked by the weaker performance in corporate trust that we discussed. I don't know...
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: But sponsored programs I guess were down this quarter.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: No some of the sponsored programs are down mainly because of our own choice. We're just
being more again this is a category being more disciplined around the pricing of working with different programs.
Where our market share is still holding in the roughly 60% category so you're just seeing a slight decline in the number
of programs. It's not a big deal and it's really – so we've been proactively managing it.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: And in terms of the outlook?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: The outlook, as M&A activity picks up and as IPOs pick up around the world, this is an area
that benefits. It's mostly an emerging markets business, and so as you're seeing activity in that space, DRs will clearly
benefit from it. Corporate actions and M&A are the big revenue drivers for this business, not necessarily the day-to-day
trading, although that's the foundation of it. All those things that you mentioned really turbo-charged the revenues in
that business, so we're optimistic, as you are.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay, great. And then, a quick follow-up on the capital ratios. I noticed that your Tier 1
common on the standardized approach rose, I assume, with retained earnings, but the advanced approach declined by
30 basis points. Is that simply higher operational risk assumptions, or is there anything else in there?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: No, that's largely driven by some of the parameter changes as we get ready to come out of
the parallel run. There were some parameter changes around some of our risk-weighted assets that drove that change.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay. All right, thanks.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Great. Thank you.
Gerald L. Hassell
Thank you very much, everyone. And before closing the call, I just want to remind you, we will plan to host an Investor
Day in the late fall, and we'll be able to share more details around our business model and our strategies. So again,
thank you for joining us today and look forward to talking with you.
If you have any questions please follow up with Andy Clark. Thank you very much, everybody.
