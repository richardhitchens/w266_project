Sean M. Connolly
Thanks, Melissa. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We've been looking forward to this call as we
have a number of positive things to update you on. Before we jump into the quarterly details, I think it's worth spending
a minute on the big picture which is really all about building a different kind of food company; one that is
simultaneously lean and innovative and focused on doing what's necessary to sustain strong value creation over time.
Roughly two years ago, we hosted many of you in New York at our inaugural investor day where we outlined our
investment thesis which basically asserted that this is a terrific branded portfolio and if we could become leaner with
stronger skills, we could reinvest in demand drivers and deliver better sales growth and better margins. And when you
include smart balance sheet management, it would all add up to total strong shareholder returns that were excellent.
Well, here we are two years in and the progress we've made in strengthening our brands and reducing costs is
unmistakable. Our disciplined approach to brand building and innovation is clearly having the desired effect. And
underlying much of our progress is the work we've done to improve our capabilities in key areas like innovation,
pricing analytics, marketing and partnering with our customers.
Fueling our growth agenda is our relentless cost and productivity program which will continue to contribute into the
years ahead. All in all, the evidence is clear. We are well positioned to continue to deliver strong returns to our
shareholders.
And the strength of our results is evident. This quarter, our sales were up 3.4%, a number that we estimate comes closer
to 5% when you factor in the Easter timing shift to Q4. And our operating margins have been quite strong despite an
input cost environment that has been acutely inflationary and has worsened continuously over the past few months.
A number of factors have contributed to our profit improvement. The first is the fact that our brands have performed
well despite higher prices. Second, our cost containment has been excellent, both in our base productivity program and
in our additional belt tightening. Finally, we did benefit from some one-time favorability in corporate expenses. The net
of that is a very solid story.
And as you likely saw in our CAGNY materials, our innovation pipeline has never been stronger and many of the items
we showed at CAGNY are shipping as we speak. We are also beginning to leverage our strong balance sheet for
additional value creation, and our focus here is on smart acquisitions which we clearly expect to do more of. Overall for
the year, we now expect sales to be up in the low single digits and for EPS to be at the high end of our previous range.
Now, while I always welcome a good quarter, what's more important to me is the longer-term view of our performance,
specifically, how have we done since spin? And here again, the progress is excellent. Our sales growth has become
progressively stronger and our EPS growth is approaching 30% since we began this journey.
And importantly, our margins have improved despite the cost environment that we've had to navigate. This year,
through the first three quarters, our OI margin has averaged 10.3%. And since spin, it has averaged 9.7%. So excellent
progress here against one of our top priorities: margin expansion.
Now, getting back to Q3. Our consumption trends have been positive overall, and as you can see in this chart showing
the multi-outlet IRI data, still strong. Continued strong performance on Jimmy Dean, Hillshire lunchmeat, Ball Park,
Aidells and Gallo. You can also see here that the business that is most tied to sow costs, which is Jimmy Dean fresh
sausage at the top of the page, softened a bit, which is due to much higher prices. Now, I want to point out that the
Hillshire Farm smoked sausage line looks a bit worse than reality, and that's tied to the Easter shift to Q4.
Overall, this data reflects that our brand-building efforts are helping us to do a better job holding volumes in the face of
pricing than we've done historically. And clearly, we're pleased with the way consumers have stuck with our brands.
Sticking with the theme of our brands, there are four businesses I want to comment briefly on this morning.

The first is our power hitter, Jimmy Dean. Here, we continue to see very strong performance in frozen protein
breakfast, particularly on Delights which is a business that has delivered explosive growth since we got behind it with
MAP spend and innovation a couple of years ago.
Despite a number of new competitors over the past few years, Jimmy Dean sales, profit and market share growth
remains very strong. On Hillshire Farm, I am pleased to report that we have our lunchmeat business more than fully
back on track and at the highest volume shares we've seen since pre spin. A big part of this success is the terrific
advertising we've been running which highlights the brand's quality and craftsmanship.
Moving to Aidells, here momentum continues both in smoked sausage and in our new meatball line driven by our
proprietary product sampling capability.
And finally, a word on Golden Island Jerky. The integration here has been seamless and is nearing completion. As I've
said before, Golden Island gives us a great entry point into the attractive jerky category. Our priority now is on
expanding production capacity to meet the strong demand we have for this extraordinary product. We will have more to
report on our future jerky plans at a later date.
In Q3, we began rolling out a robust slate of new products. You see a number of those new items here. Our customer
response has been very positive. And as we reach scale on distribution, we will be in a position to back these
innovations with marketing support. For those of you who have already broken out your grills, I implore you to go buy
the new Hillshire Farm American Craft Sausages. I recommend you try the Jalapeño & Cheddar variety. You can thank
me later.
Now, fueling our growth drivers is our ongoing cost-savings program and recall here we're talking about unlocking
efficiencies in existing spend through discrete work streams around revenue management, supply chain and support
processes. This effort is also helping us to improve our capabilities in key areas, so we can sustain the higher level of
efficiency and effectiveness.
We delivered the $40 million we signed up for in fiscal 2013 and are well on our way to achieve the remaining $105
million we're after. Our supply chain team, as an example, is doing an excellent job. You'll recall we just announced
plans to close our Florence, Alabama, plant which is a project that will deliver strong returns. And the team's work to
minimize customer service disruptions on our turkey products following a fire at our Storm Lake facility has been
exceptional.
Now, a few words on Van's. Van's is a great business and I'm thrilled to have it as part of our company. The acquisition
lined up nicely with our criteria. It's a strong brand that's growing. It's margin-accretive. It offers a compelling
consumer benefit, in this case, real health and wellness credentials. Further, it helps us expand our presence in frozen
breakfast and provides new opportunities in the center store. And I view the fact that it further diversifies our COGS
base as a real positive. I should also point out that the Van's team is very talented and we look forward to welcoming
them to Hillshire. So, overall, a great fit and a business with a ton of runway.
Now, before I turn it over to Maria, a few comments on the months ahead. Clearly, we will continue to face acute
inflation near term and are currently communicating additional pricing actions that will phase in early next fiscal year.
While we will continue to keep the belt tight on costs and support our brands with MAP and innovation, we do expect
base volumes and margins to be pressured in Q4. In the case of volumes, it's largely tied to the much higher price
points on our Jimmy Dean roll sausage business where shelf prices have been up over 15% and promoted prices have
been up around 20%. In the case of margins, much higher COGS tied to PEDV are at the root of it.
Now, if our performance wasn't already ahead of our expectations, this unusually acute inflation may have caused us to
back off some of the merchandising we have planned for the upcoming grilling season. But, the fact is our performance
of the business is even better than what we expected. And that gives us the ability to maintain our grilling season
merchandising support on our businesses and still deliver our plan. And given the higher price points the consumer will
see in the market going forward, we believe that merchandising support is critical in maintaining brand vitality going
into next fiscal year.

So when you added it all up, we expect full-year sales now to be up in the low single digits with EPS at the high end of
the previous range.
And finally, while we're thrilled with the Golden Island and Van's acquisitions, we expect to do more.
With that, Maria, over to you.
Maria Henry
Thanks, Sean. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As you just heard, we delivered strong financial
results for the third quarter. Our business is performing well as we've effectively managed significant input cost
inflation with pricing actions and cost measures. Beyond that, our structured productivity program remains well on
track and we benefited from some favorable items such as mark-to-market and insurance true up in the quarter.
That said, the inflationary pressure that we are experiencing has become more acute since our last earnings call and I'll
talk more about that in just a moment. The bottom line is that despite the challenging environment, our core business is
strong and we continue to have balance sheet firepower to deliver additional shareholder value.
Going to the numbers. Our adjusted diluted EPS of $0.46 was up 31.4% on net sales growth of 3.4%. This sales growth
was mainly driven by pricing, which we took to offset higher input costs and also by favorable mix in both of our
segments. Pricing and mix offset a 3.2% decline in volume in the quarter. Gross profit dollars increased 3% as we were
able to hold our gross margin rates flat to last year at 29.6% through a combination of pricing and productivity actions.
Our third quarter MAP investment was $40 million or 4.2% of our net sales. That's up slightly from last year's third
quarter. We continue to gain efficiencies in our MAP spend above our original expectations and we're pleased with the
return that we're seeing on our investment in this area.
Our adjusted SG&A excluding MAP was down versus the third quarter of fiscal 2013 on tight cost management and
some expense timing in the segment. Additionally, corporate expenses were unusually low at $5 million for the quarter.
Lower corporate expense was the result of lower spending and the favorable expense items that I mentioned just a
moment ago.
Year-to-date our sales were up 2.1% but our gross profit was down $22 million with a 140 basis point decline in gross
profit rate, as the input cost inflation that we experienced was not fully offset by pricing.
Our adjusted operating income is up 3.9% as our cost programs and SG&A favorability offset our gross margin decline.
Now let's take a look at the segment. Our Retail segment sales were up 3.2% as the benefit of price and mix offset a
2.7% decline in volume. The volume decline in Retail was driven by Jimmy Dean roll sausage. As Sean said earlier,
that's the business that's most impacted by sow costs and therefore it's where we price the most. On the positive side,
our Jimmy Dean frozen business, Hillshire Farm lunchmeat and Aidells businesses were all very strong contributors
this quarter.
Operating income was up 19.9% in the Retail segment as sales growth, continued cost management, and some timing
favorability more than offset higher input costs.
In our Foodservice/Other segment, third quarter sales grew 4%. You recall, much of our food service business has
pass-through price contracts, so with higher inflation comes higher pricing. This increased pricing and favorable mix
offset a 4.1% volume decline for the quarter. That volume decline was the result of lower commodity meat sales.
Excluding those commodity meat sales, volume was effectively flat to last year and sales growth was 5.3%.
Operating segment income increased 9.6%, reflecting commodity-driven pricing actions, favorable mix and continued
cost management. Overall, our team has performed well given the challenges in the segment and they continue to focus
their effort on the growth channels within Foodservice.

Before I move on to cash, let me give you some additional color on movements in our input costs. We purchase over $1
billion of meat annually. What you see on this slide is the unhedged spot prices for our meat input basket. As you
know, we have a hedging strategy in place where we generally hedge up to six months out for a portion of our
commodities.
This inflation does not match what is flowing through our P&L, but it does give you a good idea of what we're dealing
with in the commodity meat market. You can clearly see that what we've been working through is significant cost
increases which have been primarily driven by the outbreak of PEDV. This has driven up the price of pork and sows.
We originally planned for some of this increase, but not to this extent. Our input costs are up well over $100 million
versus what we expected to be facing when we set our plan and provided guidance for fiscal 2014.
About three quarters of the increase versus our plan is the result of higher inflation in pork and sows. The inflation
caused by PEDV have been rapid and acute, but it will also be transitory. And we fully expect that the market will
revert to more historical norms once we're past this situation. However, we don't know exactly when that will happen.
As I've discussed, we've been able to offset much of the increase that you see here through pricing and cost
management. But since the last time we spoke in January, the curve has steepened and we expect that our fourth quarter
margins will be pressured.
Moving on to cash. We closed the quarter with $389 million of cash and short-term investments. We will use some of
this cash to pay for the Van's acquisition that we expect to close in the fourth quarter. The underlying cash flow of the
business continues to be strong. Our year-to-date adjusted EBITDA margin was 13.6% and we remain well positioned
to execute the growth agenda that we've outlined.
Our capital allocation plan hasn't changed. Our first priority continues to be investing in our business. Our investments
in brand building, innovation, capability development and efficiency programs are targeted at creating long-term
sustainable growth and profitability. And to-date, we're very pleased with what we're seeing from our investments in
these areas.
In the quarter, we advanced our M&A agenda with the announcement of the acquisition of Van's for $165 million. We
did not repurchase any shares during the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we've repurchased $30 million worth of
shares against our target to repurchase $200 million by the end of fiscal 2015.
We intend to pay off our zero coupon notes for $105 million when they come due at the end of June, which, because of
our fiscal calendar, will actually fall into fiscal 2015. And finally, we continue to pursue M&A opportunities to drive
additional value.
With one quarter left in the fiscal year, we are refining our fiscal 2014 guidance. We now expect sales growth to be in
the low single digits for the fiscal year. As you saw in the consumption trend, we have solid momentum on many of our
businesses.
We have the benefit of recently launched innovations, and of course, we have the volume pricing dynamic that we've
been discussing. We expect EPS for fiscal 2014 to be at the high end of our previous range. This incorporates our sales
estimate and our expectation that input cost inflation will pressure our gross margins in the fourth quarter. Additionally,
we now expect corporate expenses, excluding significant items and mark-to-markets adjustments, to be between $40
million and $45 million for the year.
So, let me close here by saying that overall, I'm very pleased with our business performance, both in the quarter and on
a year-to-date basis.
So, with that, I'll open it up for Q&A. Operator, if you could please open the line for questions.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alexia Howard of Sanford Bernstein. Your line is
open.
<Q - Alexia J. Howard>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Morning, Alexia.
<A - Maria Henry>: Hi, Alexia.
<Q - Alexia J. Howard>: Can I ask about the remaining cost-cutting opportunities? You've obviously achieved quite a
lot since the spin. How much is left at this point and what kinds of cost do you still have to get at? Thank you.
<A - Maria Henry>: Sure, Alexia. We have $105 million of the remaining cost and productivity benefits that we
expect to deliver. As you'll recall, we had $145 million. We delivered $40 million last year. We're realizing a lot of that
in fiscal 2014. The majority of the $105 million will come in 2014 and 2015. A little bit of it goes into fiscal 2016. So
those are the cost reductions and productivity gains that we expect to achieve from our structured cost program that we
announced last year.
In addition to that, because we've been seeing really significant pressure on the input cost side of our business, we've
tightened our belt in our spending in fiscal 2014. And you're seeing some of that favorability from those near-term
actions show up in our fiscal 2014 P&L. You see some of that on the segment SG&A line as well as in the corporate
area. Now the timing of that will vary depend on the business situation that we're in. But I think the key focus area is
that that fundamental corporate activity program that we announced is well on track and I have a very high degree of
confidence that we'll get the whole $105 million that we signed up for.
<Q - Alexia J. Howard>: Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.
Operator
Thank you. Next question, John Baumgartner of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: Good morning. Thanks for the question.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Morning, John.
<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: Sean, in terms of M&A, just wondering if you can maybe just frame the environment
here in terms of what you're seeing come across your desk in terms of target areas. Are you looking more towards
protein? Can we see more center-store acquisitions? Could M&A help your Foodservice margins? Just how are you
thinking about M&A going forward?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Well, it's a question we often get, John. And I think we're not going to give you the list of
our prospects, obviously. But what I would say is we always tend to favor good brands. We tend to favor brands that
are complementary to our portfolio, as you've seen us do some of that in the past.
We also look for things like margin accretion benefit. So as we've said before, we're open to smaller things that make
sense. We're open to larger things that make sense. The key is that we will look at it all in a highly disciplined fashion
and make sure that before we pull the trigger on anything, that it's a good deal for our shareholders.
<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: Okay. Thanks, Sean.

<Q - Farha Aslam>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Good morning.
<Q - Farha Aslam>: Question regarding your MAP targets. I believe your targets are sort of 5% of sales. Do you still
anticipate hitting those in 2015 given the cost inflation we're seeing and the pricing actions you're taking or should we
think that now a more 2016 target?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: We have not changed anything with respect to our midterm targets, and we certainly view
MAP as an area that drives the business, both top and bottom line, as opposed to attacks on the bottom line. We're very
disciplined in making sure that the MAP we spend is a high-ROI MAP.
So as you can see, within our business, when you get under the hood, the businesses that perform the best and have the
highest margin structures in our company are also those that are farthest along in terms of what I call being MAP ready.
So we view MAP as a positive driver to the top and bottom line. And hopefully, our investors know by now that we are
highly committed to MAP spend as one the best levers to drive sustainable results for the long term through healthy
brands.
<Q - Farha Aslam>: So, we should still expect it to be 5% of sales for next year?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Yeah. We've not changed anything. And to the degree we have any update at all on our
fiscal 2015 outlook, what we'll do here is what we do every year in August. So, August is the conference call where we
will provide our specific guidance for the following year and that's when we'll be back with our specific targets in a few
months.
<Q - Farha Aslam>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Next question is Ken Goldman of JPMorgan Chase. Your line is open.
<Q - Kenneth B. Goldman>: Hey. Thanks for the question. Sean, your implied guidance for 4Q, obviously, much
lighter than what the Street was forecasting on costs. Given that this inflation, unless there's a sudden cure for PED
(sic) [PEDV] (24:48) won't go away for a few quarters, doesn't this suggest that the first half of fiscal 2015 will be
under a lot of margin pressure, too? All right, so I know you don't want to give official guidance, but any help you can
give us regarding the magnitude of pressure we should think about 1H margins being under would be pretty helpful.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Well, I think with respect to next year, as I just point out to Farha, as we always do, we'll
issue guidance on our August call. Until then, we don't have an update. But clearly, the challenging near-term cost
environment is driven by the PEDV issue. But this issue is rare, it's acute, and it's transitory. So, there's likely to be a
reversal, especially when considering that aside from the virus, the fundamentals for pork are very strong. So we're
working through that forecast as we speak. And we'll share our best perspective on how it nets out in August.
With respect to what you're implying, Ken, on the lumpiness from half to half, that's a concept that we've dealt with
before. And frankly, it is what it is because at the end of the day, inflation happens and deflation happens. So there may
be short-term windows where our margins are temporarily inflated or deflated. We can't fully control that. But what we
can control is the health of our brands for the long haul and that is our focus.
And really, to get the real full picture here on this, you really need to go back to when we started and look at last year
because when we got going, after two years of significant commodity inflation, last year in fiscal 2013, we benefited
from deflation and recall we reinvested some of that benefit behind our brands and advancing our cost efficiency
program. And we did that in anticipation of a return to commodity inflation in fiscal 2014 which is exactly what's
unfolded to a greater degree than we planned. I think the key point is given the way our brands have held up so far this
year, I'm sure glad that we reinvested back in our brands when we had the deflation in fiscal 2013 because that's a
central piece of how we run this business for moving the center line of our profitability north over time, and that's what

<Q - Kenneth B. Goldman>: Thanks very much.
Operator
Thank you. Next question is Rob Dickerson, Consumer Edge Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Robert Dickerson>: Thank you very much. Just a quick, easy question on corporate expense. I know you said
you still have some of the cost saving opportunity coming through. That said though, now guidance for the year is $40
million, $45 million. Last year, I think you came in around $40 million. So I'm just wondering, again, I know you're not
going to give the guidance for next year, but that said, is the $40 million now, is that fair as a run rate going forward in
corporate?
<A - Maria Henry>: I think that the normalized run rate of corporate is higher than that. What I have said historically
is that I would expect a level of corporate expense of around $60 million. That was our guidance coming into the year.
There's been two things on our corporate expenses this year. One of them is that we've tightened our belt on expenses
and on investments that aren't directly tied to growth. And so that lowered our corporate number for fiscal 2014. The
other thing is that we have had expense favorability. And that is on items that can go either way in any given quarter or
in any given year; items like insurance, legal expenses, those types of items that can be up or down.
So I think that the $40 million to $45 million that we expect to have on the P&L in fiscal 2014 is low. I think that a
more normalized level of corporate expense would be closer to the $60 million.

Thank you. Next question is Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Rachel N. Nabatian>: Hi. It's Rachel Nabatian in for Rob Moskow.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Hi, Rachel.
<Q - Rachel N. Nabatian>: So, it seems like things have certainly turned around for lunchmeat. And I know you
mentioned advertising helping out. But have you also moved promotion at this point? And if you have, how are you
ensuring that the demand is sticky post that?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: I think that notion is too extreme. Lunchmeat is a business; it's a category that's always
going to have a pretty stable balance between what moves off the shelf and what's moves on promotion. And certainly,
as we learned last year when we had some supply challenges, you cannot walk away from promotion in the lunchmeat
category. That would not be a good business decision. So, going forward, we anticipate that we will have a balance of
strong base volumes and a competitive promotional profile.
But what you shouldn't expect from us is that we will be leading the category in terms of price-based competition.
That's not the way we play the game; that is not the way we think you build a relationship between a consumer and a
brand. We think the better way to do it is through innovation and advertising. And recall, on lunchmeat, part of our
strategy as well that we shared at CAGNY is to really expand the way we go to market in the category.
Historically, we've kind of been a one-trick pony with a mainstream lunchmeat, but we see distinct opportunities in the
value tier and then in the premium natural tier. So, we announced previously at CAGNY that we've got two great
initiatives that will be coming out next year with our Hillshire Farm, Farm Classics line, as well as our Hillshire Farm

Thank you. Next question is Akshay Jagdale, KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: Good morning.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Morning, Akshay.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: Hey. Just wanted to ask about the relationship between pricing and cost. We really
appreciate the extra color on the commodities, but can you give us a sense of if the price versus cost relationship was a
positive this quarter? I'm just trying to get a read into for next quarter. Your guidance obviously implies lower margins.
I'm trying to figure out whether it's on the SG&A line or gross margin line. It seems like it's a little bit of both, but if
you could give us a little bit more color on price versus cost and what's flowing through this quarter in terms of the
inflation versus [ph] mix, (31:36) that would be very helpful.
<A - Maria Henry>: Hi, Akshay. It's Maria. I'll provide some additional color there. First, let me take pricing. We said
on our last call that we were putting pricing into the market during the second quarter. So we put that in more toward
the end of the second quarter. So if you think about this quarter, we've got the benefit of that pricing showing up in our
numbers.
Sean commented in his comments earlier that given where the input cost inflation is going, we expect to take more
price. That price won't be in the market yet in the fourth quarter. And when I showed you the commodity curve in my
slides, you see that we have acute inflation that will be running through the fourth quarter. The timing of how the
pricing actions line up with the inflation that runs through the P&L is the big driver of the margins on a
quarter-to-quarter basis. So in the third quarter, we had that benefit of the pricing that we took at the end of the second
quarter.
In the fourth quarter, we'll still have that pricing in the market. We'll have higher input costs, which you can see from
the curve that I shared with you. And that's why I'm talking about a squeeze in terms of the gross margins for the fourth
quarter. Now, as you know, we intend to price against the inflation that we see coming into the P&L.
So we will do that, and over time we expect that we'll fully recover the inflation that we're seeing. But any quarter – in
any given quarterly period, you might have a dynamic where you got some new pricing with a commodity curve slope
in a quarter where you get some benefit the following quarter, that those commodity costs kind of overtake that. So, it's
a little lumpy on the quarters, but over time, we expect that we'll fully recover.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: Okay, great. I'll get back in the queue. Thank you.

Thank you. Next question, Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Hey. Good morning, folks. Maria, I want to pick up a little bit where you just left off, talking
about more pricing coming, everything washing out over the course of time. In the near term, can you enlighten us a
little bit more on what you're seeing in competitive dynamics, whether or not any of your competitors in sausage have
started to follow and close that gap with Jimmy Dean?
And then, also, KRFT made some comments last week around taking 10% pricing across 50% of its Oscar Mayer
portfolio. Have you followed or did you lead or do you have a similar type of pricing rolling through your lunchmeat

portfolio on the come? Thanks.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Hey, Jason. It's Sean. I'm going to field this one, primarily because I'm not going to
comment on any of our specific competitors' pricing actions and what our response is to that for obvious reasons. I
think the key point here is a principled based one, which is, when we experience inflation, we expect to do our best to
recover it with pricing. And we started taking price earlier in the year. We expanded it to other items as we move
through the year, and we still do have spots within the portfolio that we have yet to price. And that's the part where we
are currently communicating new pricing that will fold in next year.
So, the way we think about it, the decision to price, first and foremost, is a principle based one that we follow in order
to protect our margins at all times. Now obviously we need to be responsive should we see specific dynamics occur
within any given category. And of course, we will do that.
Also, as I've said before, we work too hard to build our market shares that if we see somebody get irrational short term
and we've got to take additional action to defend it, we'll do that because that's the right thing to do for the long haul.
What I will say, generically speaking right now, is I don't see extreme irrational behavior in the marketplace today.
What I see is fairly rational. Obviously, I hope that continues because I think that's the best thing overall, but we'll have
to continue to monitor it.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Thanks a lot, guys. I'll pass it on.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Next question is Ken Zaslow, Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Hi, Ken.
<A - Maria Henry>: Hi, Ken.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: I find in the acquisitions one of the greatest values is the distribution opportunities. Can
you talk about what distribution opportunities for Van's and Golden Island? Can these brands become part of the core
four or those bigger brands? How do you see them developing and how long do you think it'll take to develop?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Well, they have unique things that have to happen for each of them to fulfill their potential.
But big picture, I think they're both great brands. Van's is clearly much farther along than Golden Island, but they're
both great brands with a ton of runway. With respect to Golden Island, the issue there right now that we're working on
is not one of seeking out distribution. We have people calling us wanting to carry the product. It is an extremely unique
process. That's one of the reasons why we bought the company. So we're in the process of scaling that up and adding
new capacity in. And as we do that, we will surgically seek out distribution in the places that really build the brand the
most effectively for the long haul. Van's is much farther along clearly in the frozen section. Distribution is pretty solid
there. We see incremental opportunities obviously. That's a big piece of it. But one of the other things I really like
about Van's is the extendibility into other categories. And that's not an uncommon thing when you're dealing with a
health and wellness equity.
One of the analogies I often point to is when Safeway created the O Organics brand and the Eating Right brands. They
were successfully able to take those trademarks into a number of healthy categories where they went up against
incumbent brands who had market-leading positions but really didn't have a lot of credentials in the health and wellness
area.
And what we've seen through our analysis is that when you've got a brand that can have those credentials and deliver
on the promise of great taste, you can gain a lot of market share and do so profitably. And that's exactly what we expect
to do with Van's.

Thank you. Next question, Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Good morning, everybody.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Morning, Andrew.
<A - Maria Henry>: Morning.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Sean, you talked about some of the historical – well, the current elasticities on volume have
been better than some of the historical numbers would show. And I'm trying to get a sense, do you think that holds for
the overall category as well, or do you think the category has shown similar rates of elasticity, but because of the
investment you've done, the Hillshire numbers look quite a bit better?
And secondly, it's probably too early, but any early read on some of these new products that you're launching? It's
obviously an impressive array of activity. I'm just trying to get a sense of if there's some early read on which ones you
think look like they'll be more impressive for you or less so.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Yeah. Okay. Good questions. On the first piece of it, in terms of category elasticities relative
to brand elasticities, one of the things I look for there is, is it a mature category or is it a young category that's just
inherently going to be growing for a period of years? So, in a category, let's pick breakfast sandwiches as an example.
As I've shown you all many times, that's a young category. It's only at about 35% household penetration. I see no
reason why it shouldn't be at 60% household penetration.
So, even in a higher pricing environment, I think that's a category that's going to continue to grow and I think it's
inherently insulated with lower elasticities at both the category level and certainly when you're dealing with Jimmy
Dean, far and away the number one brand at the brand level.
I think it's a different story when you're talking about mature categories that, let's say, are flattish. So if you look at hot
dogs as an example of a category where I have said there hasn't been enough innovation historically, the category itself
volumetrically is somewhat flattish. But within that, you're going to see brands with very different elasticities.
And I think if we could run a correlation, you would see that those companies that are investing behind innovating
those brands and backing them with good MAP support and brand-building investments are going to see lower
elasticities. And those who don't are going to see the product behave in a more commoditized way. And that is the
fundamental premise of why we run the company the way we do.
With regard to the second part of your question on new innovations, I think the headlines are that it's early days but
what I'm seeing is encouraging. I'll give you a couple of examples. We just launched this American Craft sausage
which is a fantastic pre-cooked grilling sausage, the one I implored you guys to go out and buy for your grills. It's early
days, but sales are outpacing our original estimates. And that's due not to distribution; it's due to velocity. So, that's a
good sign. We haven't even begun marketing that one yet.
We have another new initiative called Park's Finest which is our entry into the super premium tier of the hot dog
category. And that one, we launched it, we got it on shelves and then as soon as we achieve the threshold distribution,
that is one where we've already begun running a specific commercial featuring Park's Finest advertising within the
context of our normal Ball Park advertising. And when you look at the data in terms of what elasticities have done
since we turned the advertising on, it's a vivid inflection point.
And that's typical because with new items, it's much easier to get trial once you create awareness. And that's what those
marketing investments do in the early days; they drive awareness.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Got it. Great. Thanks for that.

Thank you. Next question, Greg Hessler of Bank of America. Your line is open.
<Q - Greg Hessler>: Hi. Thanks for the question.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Hey, Greg.
<Q - Greg Hessler>: You guys had some commentary at CAGNY where you said based on the credit rating and
leverage that you wouldn't anticipate really deleveraging or paying down debt. So with the zero coupons that are
maturing this summer and the $165 million acquisition, should we expect you to be back in the debt capital markets in
the near term?
<A - Maria Henry>: Well, that will depend on a number of factors. The $105 million that's coming due just makes
sense to go ahead and take that out at the end of June. We have talked about the fact that we are very active in the
M&A space. And so depending on the size of the acquisition and depending on the timing of when we execute it will
depend if we'll be into the debt markets to get it done or not.
<Q - Greg Hessler>: Okay. And then just one follow-up. On M&A, if we're looking out year or two, just a longer-term
view, what do you think is the right level of leverage to run the business at?
<A - Maria Henry>: Well, if I look across the space at what do I think is kind of normal leverage for our space, it's
probably – it looks like 2.5 times, maybe a little bit more than that is a more normalized level for CPG food. Clearly,
right now, we're in a position where we've got a very low level of leverage. We've talked about the fact that we have no
issue with going into the debt markets to take on acquisitions that make financial sense and that we believe will create
long-term shareholder value. So, we'll see how that plays out and what we're able to get done.
<Q - Greg Hessler>: Okay. Thanks again.
<A - Maria Henry>: Sure.

Thank you. Next question Ken Goldman of JPMorgan Chase. Your line is open.
<Q - Kenneth B. Goldman>: Hey. Thanks. I have a couple of follow-ups. Maria, there were some public speculations
you were looking at Michael Foods. I won't ask if you were bidding for that asset specifically, but I am curious, right,
the bidding process is over. Is that the kind of business you'd be interested in? Again, very generally, a company not
necessarily with the greatest most well-known brands but very strong category trends in an area of protein you're
currently not playing in. Would that have made sense from a very general perspective or is it just a question you can't
answer?
<A - Maria Henry>: Well, as you know, Ken, I won't comment specifically on Michael Foods, and I understand you're
not asking me to do that. What I can say...
<Q - Kenneth B. Goldman>: Well, I kind of am. I kind of am, but I'm trying to ask in a roundabout way.
<A - Maria Henry>: Yeah. But you kind of know my response.
<Q - Kenneth B. Goldman>: Right.
<A - Maria Henry>: But let me bring you back to what we've said about M&A and how we think about it. I think the
first point is that we follow a very disciplined approach to how we think about M&A and how we evaluate potential

targets in the market. But if we think about M&A, we're a branded food company; we look for strong brands to bring
into our portfolio that we'll be able to leverage our capabilities to grow and to maximize the value of those brands as
part of Hillshire Brands.
We look at opportunities that would be able to leverage the core assets and capabilities of our company, whether that is
through synergies on the cost side or whether that is through leveraging our growth attributes, which would be things
like our strong sales force and our strong relationship with customers, looking to leverage our marketing capabilities,
looking to leverage our know-how on the capabilities that we've built in revenue management, managing trade, et
cetera.
But overall, we look for something that's a strategic fit and that also makes sense financially. And there, we're looking
at things that are margin accretive and have attractive long-term growth prospects. So, those criteria haven't changed.
These are a lot of different things that are in the market, available or could be available, and we put it through that filter
to make sure that we're very disciplined before we bring anything on.
<Q - Kenneth B. Goldman>: Okay. And then...
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Just one bit of additional color on that, too.
<Q - Kenneth B. Goldman>: Yeah.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Because we always get the question and that I think is a hangover from before we were
named and we were affectionately called MeatCo, I think we always get the question, would you consider things that
are not meat-centric? And my answer to that has consistently been of course. We go to market in a number of different
places. We like good brands.
And just look at what we did with Van's. We think it is a perfect complement to what we do. And I rather like the
notion that it continues to diversify our COGS base.
<Q - Kenneth B. Goldman>: Yeah. But Sean, I mean that makes sense for a Van's, which is frozen breakfast which
you're already in. Does it make sense for something like marinara sauce, right? I mean I think something like that could
be financially accretive, but strategically, it sort of gets you into something that, I don't know, how many people would
look at that as necessarily a – and I'm just using that as an example – as a strategic fit for the company at the time. Does
that make sense?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Well, so far, Ken, you've hit Michael and you've hit Ragu. I know [indiscernible] (47:51)
keep going here. But we're not going to comment on specific market opportunities...
<Q - Kenneth B. Goldman>: No. I'm not really – I'm really asking because people – there are some investors in your
stock who want to make sure that you stay more of a pure play, right? And if you go into something that's a little far
afield from frozen breakfast, I mean waffles make some sense, right? Something – forget tomato sauce. I mean
anything else beyond frozen breakfast that doesn't necessarily make sense might take you away from that pure play.
And I just think people are wanting to know a little bit more deeply about how you think about that. That's all.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Well, I think even the language of pure play is a bit of a holdover. What we're really
interested in is value creation. And what you got to ask yourself is, what is the relative value creation of your so-called
pure play model versus good brands, great cash flows and the ability to sustain top and bottom line performance over
time and do it in a consistent way. And I think that is really what we're focused on.
So as we look at things, we'll look at it in a very clear-eyed, analytical way around what does it do to complement the
existing enterprise as you know it today, and does it improve our ability to deliver returns to our shareholders, and do it
in a way that is more consistent and consistently less volatile than we've done historically. And that is exactly the way
we look at it.
<Q - Kenneth B. Goldman>: All right. Thank you.

Thank you. Our final question comes from Rob Dickerson, Consumer Edge Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Robert Dickerson>: Thanks for the follow-up. This will be quick again. So, Sean, not to beat the horse a little bit
on M&A, but I thought you'd be a good person to ask. Considering the purchase of Van's, which was owned by
Catterton Private Equity, and all the M&A activity that we've seen in the food space; people do point, as we just heard,
to some of the larger deals. But it'd seem like where we are in the health and wellness food cycle, where the investment
cycle is on the private side, are you seeing more deals come to you from private equity, from private investment that
are smaller deals with brand expansion potential relative to some of these larger, underperforming, weaker brands, per
se?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Well, I think there's certainly a ton of small startup companies with high growth trajectories
out there. But I think one of the simplest ways to look at it is look at our existing portfolio. And I think it shows you
what we're comfortable doing as operators. We are quite comfortable running these smaller, high-growth business like
Aidells, like Van's, like a Golden Island...
<Q - Robert Dickerson>: Like Applegate or something like that?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Well, now you're piling on Ken's approach here. But in addition to that, I'd just say we're
equally comfortable. In fact, our foundational capabilities are in running large established brands and helping revitalize
them to get more performance out of the top line and the bottom line. So, it's not as if one fits our model better than the
other. We are equally comfortable with both approaches.
<Q - Robert Dickerson>: Okay. And I think you pointed to this earlier, but you are still comfortable, out of the gate at
least, upfront with an acquisition of being around 3.5 times levered?
<A - Maria Henry>: Yes, we are. We have an eye toward maintaining investment grade. I've been asked the question
numerous times around would we go further than that. And we would as long as we saw our way back to investment
grade in relatively near-term order. So that's kind of how we think about it. We remain open to it. As Sean said, as long
as what we're doing is fundamentally improving our position to deliver long-term shareholder returns, then we're open
to doing it.
<Q - Robert Dickerson>: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
Sean M. Connolly
So, with that, I'm going to conclude our call today with a couple of closing thoughts. Clearly, I'm pleased with the
quarter but what I'm most pleased by is the strong progress our team has made to build a winner for the long haul. As
I've said before, we've always had great brands, but now our improved capabilities are enabling us to unlock the
potential of this portfolio. And I think that bodes well for the returns we continue to generate in the future. So between
our core business momentum and our plans to utilize our balance sheet for additional value creation, we are confident
that we will deliver strong returns for a long time to come.
With that, we'll sign off and wish you all a great day. So long.
