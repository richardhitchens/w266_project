Gregory D. Wasson
Thank you, Rick. Good Morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call. Before we get to today's financial
results, I would like to begin with a few comments on the proposed second step in our transaction with Alliance Boots.
Our management team and board are making significant progress evaluating the proposed transaction, determining the
timing and structure, the combined management team, additional synergy and cost reduction initiatives and potential
changes to our future capital structure. We'll be in a position to hold an investor call, once key decisions on these major
issues have been made, which is expected to occur by late July or early August.
Now, I'll turn to our third quarter financial results. Today, I'll begin with a review of the quarter. Next, I'll discuss the
key factors affecting our financial performance. And finally, I'll provide more detail on our strategies and overall
progress. And then I'll turn the call over to Wade for a more detailed financial review.
In the quarter, we continued to see improving top line growth with increased Daily Living sales and strong performance
in both prescriptions filled and our pharmacy market share.
For the quarter, sales were $19.4 billion, up 5.9% from $18.3 billion a year ago. GAAP operating income for the
quarter was $1 billion, up 3.5% from $991 million last year. Adjusted operating income for the quarter was $1.3 billion,
up 4.5% from $1.2 billion in third quarter 2013. GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.75 in the third quarter,
compared to $0.65 last year, up 15.4%. Third quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.91, up 7.1% from
$0.85 in the same quarter last year.
Our results this quarter benefited from a lower GAAP effective income tax rate. The lower rate of 31.5% compared
with 38.7% last year resulted from increased foreign income taxed at a lower rate, favorable audit settlements, certain
non-deductible expenses last year and other discrete events.
Turning to trends in gross profit dollars and SG&A dollars. In the third quarter, on a GAAP basis, our gross profit
dollars increased 4.2% or $218 million from a year ago. SG&A dollars increased 4.3% or $189 million compared to a
year ago.
Adjusted gross profit dollars increased 2.6% or $139 million compared to a 5.3% increase in the same quarter last year.
This difference primarily resulted from a decline in pharmacy gross margin, which we will discuss in detail later in the
call. On adjusted SG&A dollars increased by 2.9% or $121 million compared to the same quarter last year.
We remain focused on cost discipline to offset the negative effects of our gross profit dollar growth. We will be
accelerating our optimization efforts, taking additional steps to lower our expenses company-wide.
I appointed a key member of my executive team to lead this effort. We've been making tremendous progress in
identifying opportunities. When combined with additional synergies and cost reduction initiatives that are part of step
two and the completion of the strategic transaction with Alliance Boots, we expect to drive sustainable efficiencies and
value for the combined enterprise.
In the quarter, we continue to focus on our three strategic growth drivers: create a Well Experience; advance the role of
community pharmacy; and establish an efficient global platform. Today, I'll provide more detail on those strategies.

Performance in our Well Experience growth driver has continued to improve, giving us even greater confidence in the
significant potential of our Daily Living business. Our front-end comp increased 2.2% in the third quarter, and when
you look at the 2-year stack, our performance is the best it has been in 8 quarters, average basket size grew 2.9% as
customers continue to consolidate trips.
In addition, front-end margin improved in the third quarter compared to the same quarter last year. To drive margins
gains, we improved our product mix with a strategy to advance our health and beauty categories. We're also delivering
greater efficiencies in our promotional investment with our Balance Rewards program.
At the end of May, we had 81 million active Balance Rewards members, allowing us to reach more customers with our
offers. We received solid response rates on our personalized points offers, we've integrated our award-winning
Paperless Coupons into our program and have nearly 1.5 million people enrolled in our Balance Rewards for healthy
choices program.
Also in the quarter, while we continued our program to optimize our store footprint, we opened or converted 24 Well
Experience stores, reaching a total of 642 across the country.
To further engage our beauty customers, we extended the reach of Boots brands. We launched Boots No7 in more than
300 stores across the chain, primarily in our Phoenix and New York markets. In New York, one of the country's most
important beauty markets, we currently have Boots brands in more than 125 Walgreens and Duane Reade stores with a
goal of 183. From New York, we will begin our launch across the United States.
As we prepare for that expansion, results are coming in from Phoenix, our most mature market for Boots No7, and it's
clear our new beauty experience is elevating our performance. Boots No7 is the number one skincare brand sold in all
of our Phoenix stores, and baskets with Boots items are bigger than the average beauty basket.
In addition, 80% of our beauty customers tell us their beauty experience is improving. We're not only seeing better
performance in our stores, No7 is also the number one beauty brand on Walgreens.com.
Finally, our focus on extraordinary customer care is paying off. Our customer delight score increased 230 basis points
this quarter, and is at an all-time high for the company. Pharmacy delight is also at its highest level ever up 270 basis
points this quarter over last year. This performance is a credit to our store leaders and our team members who are
demonstrating their commitment to our customers with every transaction.
In our Pharmacy, Health & Wellness business, our script comp was up 4.1% in the quarter. Our retail pharmacy market
share increased to 19% for the quarter, up 20 basis points year-over-year, and we filled 218 million prescriptions, up
4.5% from the same period last year.
To drive our performance, we've been making deliberate strategic decisions to win with high-value seniors through
preferred relationships with Medicare Part D plans by growing 90-day at retail and expanding vaccines and other
preventative care services.
These decisions continue to drive results in the quarter, contributing to strong top line growth. We saw solid growth in
prescriptions filled for Part D patients, with an increase of 11.6% this quarter compared to the same quarter last year.
Part D market share increased 60 basis points this May compared to the same month last year, and overall, 90-day
volume was up 15%.
Our 90-day at retail product is competing effectively with mail, giving customers a choice to receive their chronic
medications at their pharmacy. As you know, 90-day at retail is at a lower margin than comparable 30 day fills, but we
believe the strategy will have a long-term positive impact on gross profit dollar and EBIT growth for our pharmacy
business as we grow our share of maintenance meds.
Turning to the headwinds facing the industry, we have seen an increase in reimbursement pressure as well as a shift
from historical patterns of deflation in generic drug cost to inflation. Over the past year, we have seen cost increases on
a subset of generic drugs, and in some cases, these increases have been significant. Both reimbursement pressure and
generic inflation are having an adverse effect on margin.

In addition, this quarter, on a year-over-year basis, there was a slowdown in generic introductions, although the impact
continues to moderate as we move through the second half of the calendar year. To address the pressure on our gross
margin, we are focused on our contracting strategy to account for increasing drug costs, we're aggressively working to
increase efficiencies and providing high-quality and cost-effective pharmacy services that reduce total pharmacy costs.
With our global procurement organization in Bern, Switzerland, we also are well positioned to offset the impact. Along
with Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen, our three companies are the largest purchaser of pharmaceuticals
worldwide. Together, we are working closely and collaboratively with manufacturers to drive sustainable growth both
here in the U.S. and in Europe.
Our strategic partnership with Alliance Boots contributed $0.15 per diluted share to Walgreen's third quarter 2014
adjusted results. Combined synergies for the first nine months of fiscal 2014 were approximately $367 million. We
now expect to exceed our second year combined synergy target and are now estimating $400 million to $450 million in
the second year combined synergies.
We estimate that accretion from Alliance Boots in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 will be an adjusted $0.06 to $0.07
per diluted share. And as I said at the top of the call, there are a number of opportunities we continue to work on as we
move toward consideration by the Board of Directors of the second step of our strategic transaction with Alliance
Boots.
Stefano and I are pleased with our progress to realize our joint vision for exercising step two of our strategic
transaction. We're working through complex issues and we're taking the appropriate time to come to the right
resolutions for the combined enterprise.
One final note; as a result of the many step two considerations and current business performance, the company is
withdrawing its fiscal year 2016 goals that were previously announced in 2012. The company expects to provide a new
set of goals and metrics for the proposed combined enterprise for fiscal 2016, and we will communicate those to you on
our call, which we expect to hold in late July or early August.
Let me speak directly to two of the prior goals, regarding our adjusted operating income goal of $9 billion to $9.5
billion. On previous calls, we noted we were tracking below the CAGR required to meet the goal. We now no longer
expect to reach that goal. On our combined synergy goals, I noted earlier, we are tracking ahead of that goal and we
expect to exceed the $1 billion amount by the end of fiscal 2016.
As noted above, some of the opportunities we are pursuing are below the operating income line, on the income
statement, and decisions about those will be reflected in our new goals and metrics. Two years ago, we announced our
strategic partnership with Alliance Boots, an opportunity to bring together two companies with iconic brands.
We've made tremendous progress over the past two years bringing to life our vision for a global pharmacy-led health
and well-being enterprise that can address the needs of a challenging healthcare market, improve service delivery and
health outcomes.
With the addition of our strategic relationship with AmerisourceBergen, we are creating a truly powerful combination
of retail and wholesale leaders that can better serve customers in the U.S. and around the world.
Now we are focused on making the decisions necessary for the combined enterprise in preparation for step two. We
have work to do; we are intent on getting that work done right for the benefit of our enterprise, our team members,
customers and shareholders. We look forward to sharing our decisions with you later this summer.
And now, I'll turn the call over to Wade.

Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on the call. This morning, I'll take you through
our quarterly results as well as update you on our Alliance Boots strategic partnership and our AmerisourceBergen
relationship.
As Greg noted earlier, for the quarter, we reported a GAAP EPS of $0.75 per diluted share based on nearly 968 million
shares. GAAP EPS walks to an adjusted EPS of $0.91 for the quarter as illustrated by this chart. The LIFO provision of
$0.03, acquisition-related items were $0.13 per share, consisting of $0.06 of acquisition-related amortization costs,
$0.01 of acquisition-related costs, and $0.06 from Alliance Boots related tax.
Finally, the special items had no net impact due to the positive $0.07 impact of the warrants issued by
AmerisourceBergen to Walgreens and Alliance Boots, with the Alliance Boots impact reported on a three-month lag
basis offset by the negative $0.07 impact of store closures and other asset optimization costs.
Let me now review our comparable store sales for the quarter. Comp prescription sales increased 6.3%. Comp
front-end sales increased 2.2%. And total comp store sales increased 4.8%. Comp prescriptions filled increased 4.1%
versus a script comp of 7.1% in the year-ago period. The components of the 2.2% front-end comp are traffic, which
decreased by 0.7%, and basket size, which increased by 2.9%. We're pleased with the trends in the one-year and
two-year stack comps over the past few quarters.
Moving to comp store script numbers, our retail scripts were up 4.1%. This performance reflects the fundamentals of
our underlying business, the ongoing progress on winning new Medicare Part D customers, an increase of 90-day at
retail scripts and the return of Express Scripts customers. The two-year stack on script comp has improved dramatically
in the last two years.
With respect to margin, our adjusted gross margin reflecting FIFO inventory was 28.3% in the current quarter
compared to 29.2% last year, a 90 basis point decline. The primary drivers of the pharmacy margin decrease were
increasing third-party reimbursement pressure, particularly due to a few contract step downs, increases in Medicare
Part D mix, including the strategy to continue driving 90-day prescriptions at retail, fewer generic drug introductions
versus the year ago and pronounced generic drug inflation on a subset of generic drugs as well as the mix from
specialty drugs.
Purchasing synergies in the pharmacy and front-end did partially offset this margin pressure. Front-end margin
increased in the quarter benefiting from mix and promotional adjustments. And we still expect the rate of generic drug
introductions to increase in the fourth quarter to the point that it should not be a drag on margin year-over-year. On net,
we expect the negative factors impacting pharmacy margin will more than offset generic introductions and front-end
margin benefit next quarter on a year-over-year basis.
Taking a look at our adjusted gross margin trends, this quarter's 90 basis point decrease versus a 60 basis point increase
a year ago. Based on our strategies and plans we do expect the front-end margin to continue to improve over the
long-term.
As we demonstrated and discussed in the last few quarters, this graph illustrates the impact that new generic drug
introductions have had on our monthly prescription sales comps. The highlighted quarters illustrate the number of new
generic drug introductions remains slower than a year ago. And you can see the generic impact on comp prescription
sales was about a negative 4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 versus generic impact of negative 1.4% in the most
recent quarter.
In our experience, the margin change resulting from generics is inversely correlated and slightly lagged to the impact of
generic sales changes. And that is the strongest positive effect on margin typically occurs shortly after the generic
impact on prescription sales is the most deflationary.
The tough year-over-year generic impact margin comparison has continued to dissipate throughout fiscal year 2014 and
expected to turn positive in the fourth quarter of 2014, given the increase in generic impact on pharmacy sales comps
expected in that period. This trend, however, continues to be negatively impacted by the delay of a few large volume
drugs like generic forms of Nexium and Diovan.

Transitioning now to gross profit, this slide illustrates our quarterly gross profit dollar growth trends for the past 11
quarters on a GAAP basis. And the next slide shows this trend on adjusted basis. Adjusted gross profit dollar growth
increased to 2.6% versus 5.3% in the year ago period. Gross profit dollar growth was positively impacted by the comps
in both the pharmacy and the front-end and further helped by a margin expansion on the front-end.
On the pharmacy side, gross profit dollar growth was negatively impacted by the same issues impacting pharmacy
margin, which I described a moment ago. But, despite these headwinds and the benefit of synergies, adjusted gross
profit dollars grew faster than the average 1% growth rate in the first half of the year.
For the quarter, GAAP SG&A dollar growth was 4.3%. We then deduct 2.3% for store closures and other optimization
costs and 0.1% for Walgreen's amortization costs and add back 0.3 percentage points for acquisition-related costs and
0.7% for the DEA legal settlement. This walk yields an adjusted SG&A dollar growth of 2.9% for the quarter.
Shown here are the SG&A dollar growth trends for the past 11 quarters on a GAAP basis and the follow-on slide shows
a similar trend on an adjusted basis.
The adjusted SG&A dollar growth for the quarter was a 2.9% year-over-year increase versus the 4.5% increase in the
third quarter of fiscal 2013. Keep in mind that last year's fourth quarter GAAP and adjusted net earnings included $0.03
per diluted share in net gains from certain litigation matters. This net litigation gain reduced SG&A dollar growth by
0.9% last year and will be a factor in the SG&A dollar growth comparison year-over-year in the fourth quarter.
This next chart illustrates our two-year stack SG&A dollar growth trends on a GAAP basis for the last nine quarters.
Now, let's review the two-year stack trend on adjusted basis. Two-year stack adjusted SG&A trends increased versus a
year ago by 510 basis points with a two-year stack of 7.4% growth in the third quarter of 2014, up from 2.3% last year.
The two-year stack from a year ago included the period when we were out of Express Scripts network in the third
quarter of fiscal year 2012.
SG&A grew negative 2.2% in that period as we responded to the lower volumes in the pharmacy. Likewise, the
two-year stack SG&A dollar growth will be difficult to lap for the next two quarters as shown by the fourth quarter
two-year stack of 0.5% and the first quarter two-year stack of 2.9%.
Turning to a few other components of our income statement, this quarter included a LIFO provision of $41 million
versus a provision or charge of $120 million a year ago. Our effective LIFO rate for the quarter was 2.25%, down from
3.5% a year ago.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $35 million versus $50 million from a year ago. We expect interest expense of
approximately $35 million in the fourth quarter. Average diluted shares outstanding were 968 million shares versus 959
million shares last year. And the change is primarily due to the impact of a higher stock price on a number of
in-the-money options, which are counted in diluted shares. In the fourth quarter, we expect diluted share count of
approximately 968 million shares subject to changes in the current share price.
Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 31.5% versus 38.7% last year. And the difference is primarily attributable to
additional foreign income tax taxed at a lower rate and that benefit per changes in uncertain tax provisions as well as a
lower permanent difference between book and tax income. For the fourth quarter, we estimate our GAAP tax rate to be
approximately 36% and we expect a similar increase in our adjusted tax rate in the fourth quarter compared to the third
quarter.
Accounts receivable increased by 25.3%, primarily due to higher vendor funding receivables from the Bern JV and
AmerisourceBergen for brand and generic rebates along with the higher receivables generated by higher third-party
pharmacy sales.
Accounts payable decreased 6.5% and LIFO inventories decreased 6.4% in conjunction with our new agreement in
terms of AmerisourceBergen as more of the generic pharmacy distribution transitions to them. Overall, net working
capital increased by 9.8% versus a year ago.

During the second quarter, we generated approximately $1.3 billion in cash from operations versus $1.4 billion in the
year ago period. And free cash flow in the quarter was $1 billion versus $1.1 billion a year ago.
The next slide shows our quarterly accretion from Alliance Boots, which was $0.15 per share for the quarter versus our
forecast of $0.13 to $0.14 per share. With the out performance primarily related to incremental procurement synergies.
You can find a more detailed walk included in the appendix to this presentation on our Investor Relations website.
Combined net synergies for the quarter totaled $131 million and for the first three quarters of the year totaled $367
million. As Greg noted, because we are running ahead of our previous estimate of $375 million to $425 million of
combined synergies for the year, we are raising the estimated range to $400 million to $450 million.
Looking forward, we estimate the adjusted EPS accretion from Alliance Boots for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014
to be $0.06 to $0.07 per share based on our current estimates of IFRS to GAAP conversion and foreign exchange rates
versus $0.08 in the year ago quarter. The adjusted accretion is expected to be slightly lower than the year ago period for
Alliance Boots, primarily driven by the timing of recognition of certain tax matters.
Additionally, we are assessing whether the fair value of one of the Alliance Boots wholesale reporting units is below its
current value for U.S. GAAP purposes. Our share of the goodwill from this reporting unit is approximately $195
million, while we plan to finalize this assessment prior to filing our Form 10-Q, any impact would be reflected in our
fourth quarter financial statements and we'd expect to exclude any impact from adjusted earnings.
Since I usually end with commentary on the fiscal year 2016 goals, let me reiterate the comments made in the press
release and by Greg regarding these goals. As a result of the many step two considerations in current business
performance, we are withdrawing the fiscal year 2016 goals that were previously announced in 2012.
As Greg mentioned, we are evaluating the proposed transaction including the potential timing and structure, the
combined management team, continued synergy and cost reduction initiatives and potential changes to our future
capital structure all through the lens of what is in the best interest of our shareholders long-term.
Once key decisions have been made on the above matters, Walgreens anticipates being in a position to hold an investor
call, which is expected to occur by late July or early August. Many of the areas under consideration are interdependent
and so we believe that the prudent course is to share the scope of our decisions and related financial objectives and
metrics together all at that time.
In summary, our strategies remain sound in the fundamentals of our business in particular with respect to top line
growth has continued to strengthen. While we have gross profit reimbursement pressure in the traditional pharmacy as
mentioned, we also have significant opportunities to drive additional cost efficiency and also turn the front-end of our
business into a very meaningful profit pillar.
Our Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen partnerships also continue to go well and we are beginning to move
beyond the cost-only synergy phase to one where we are starting to share and exploit organizational capabilities to
strengthen our core business and find new levers to create value for shareholders.
With respect to our merger with Alliance Boots, we realize that our investors have been patiently awaiting additional
information about step two. I can assure you that we have been using the time to evaluate all aspects of the transaction
with the best long-term interest of our company and shareholders in mind.
And now with that, I'll turn the call back over to Rick.
Rick J. Hans

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Thanks. I appreciate you taking the question. I guess maybe we'll start first with the 2016
guidance. It seems like that you guys aren't going to come in line with the original expected range. But I don't think
most investors had kind of expected you to hit the numbers given current business performance. Is there any color you
can give us with respect to how far off that range you think you are?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: George, Greg. So, yeah, I think as we had said, we weren't in the last couple of quarters –
we weren't tracking on a CAGR that we required to hit that adjusted earnings number. And certainly with our current
performance and some of the things we've talked about on the call that's impacting pharmacy, we didn't think that it
was achievable.
Now that doesn't mean we're still not working on a whole host of things to try to continue to drive value. I think the
main point, and I'll let Wade kind of take it from there, is the fact that in 4 weeks to 6 weeks, we do have a lot of
moving parts. We are going to be looking at different goals and metrics both above the line and below the line. And we
want to really get focused on those. So, Wade do you want to add any more color?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yeah, I think that's right. I think we're still aggressively driving all the [indiscernible]
(28:22) opportunities, but as Greg said, we have opportunities below the line as well in terms of how we think about
structure, cap structure, refinancing and the like. And so, we're making sure at this point in time that we look at
everything kind of interdependently as a web of choices and we maximize value as best we can.
<Q - George R. Hill>: Okay. That's helpful. And then, Wade, maybe a quick follow-up. I recognize that you guys are
planning to do a call, I guess, in a little over a month from this point now. Is there any more color you can give us on
what the puts and takes kind of the company is considering as it evaluates step two?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yeah, I mean, I think, both Greg and I kind of listed them. But I would say everything and
anything that can create value. So, we're looking at apart from, again, kind of the organizational operational structure
we're looking at what's the ideal cost structure moving forward. We're looking at what's the ideal way to structure the
transaction from a legal point of view. We're looking at what's the best balance of cap structure as we think about the
amount of cash this company can generate in the combined form. We're looking at again, the best way to refinance the
transaction as we move forward, so I would say, that everything and anything related to the big measures. And again, I
think we're going to make sure that we land down in a place that's in the best interest of our shareholders long-term.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: And, George, I'd add. And I think the main point is all of those that Wade just rattled are
interdependent. And therefore, we want to make sure that we've thought through them all and that's the reason we
thought late July we'd have a lot more visibility on how all those connect and drive value together.
<Q - George R. Hill>: That's very helpful. And then last one quickly and I'll drop off. In the press release, you
highlighted an increased focused on internal costs and reducing internal costs. Is there any way to ballpark that
opportunity for us, I guess, kind of as we think about the next 12 months to 18 months?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Well, we're working on accelerating optimization efforts across the entire organization.
George, we've actually identified and actually realized a lot of opportunity currently. The challenge is, unfortunately,
some of the pressure we've seen on pharmacy margin has eaten some of that up.
That's the reason I have elected a key executive to begin to look for and identify new opportunities. The good news is,
we're finding opportunities. We're now in the process of trying to figure out how to get at it. What are the plans, the
processes, some of those maybe require some restructuring, or not. So, we're in the process of doing that.
The other thing is that, we've been 4 weeks to 6 weeks away from the real work that Wade and team are doing around
the combined merger, we definitely see opportunities to reduce costs as the entity comes together. So again, we want to
kind of put all that together and come to you with as much as we possibly can in that call that's coming up in 4 weeks to
6 weeks.

Our next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Hi, John.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Looking at the big picture, when you think about the U.S. pharmacy or drug retail
business, you and all your peers, do you think, is that business not going to be as profitable going forward as maybe
you thought because of reimbursement pressure, government involvement, et cetera? Do you think it's a secular issue?
And then, if that's true, or remotely true, the things you think about on the cost side, are they really more strategic i.e.,
supply chain, what do we need to do with that long-term in how we staff our stores? Is it really very secular and
strategic? Or you think, no, it's just a period we're going through and it requires more tactical stuff?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yeah, John, on the first part, no, I don't necessarily think that we should assume that the
U.S. business cannot continue to grow on profitability. I think the work that Alex and Mark and team are doing on the
front-end of the business, we think we actually have tremendous opportunity to grow EBIT and operating margin on
the front-end of the business. We're beginning to getting more confidence in just that. And I think that is obviously
going to help us with the overall business.
I think in the pharmacy business, the good thing is, is that we are growing top line for the first time consistently in a
long time with some of those strategic decisions I talked about. We are absolutely winning in the Part D space. We're
growing 90-day customers and so forth.
We do have obviously the pharmacy margin pressure that we talked about. But I think Kermit and team and he can
maybe allude to a little bit about how we think we'll go at that. We think with our contracting strategy going forward
with the generic inflation that we're seeing versus historical deflation, we're going to start taking that into consideration
in our contracting. He is going at cost-of-fill reduction with a vengeance. And I think with Bern and Jeff Berkowitz and
John out in Bern, we're positioned better than anyone to be able to get at cost.
As far as the cost opportunities, I think there's a little of both. I think that there's opportunity to get at cost, to your
point, that's more maybe cyclical. But I think structurally we're going after the business from a structural point of view,
everything from supply chain, everything from how we supervise and manage stores, everything from looking at our
store footprint as we never have in the past and as we indicated on the last call. So, we're really taking a step back and
looking at the entire enterprise from a structural perspective.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: And is there, with what's going on in Bern, how much opportunity is there to accelerate
those efforts to offset the margin pressure you're seeing today? Is there enough flexibility to do that, or not really to
play around with that?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: I think there's opportunity, yes. I think Jeff and team have their pedal to the metal and
their foot on the accelerator as far as trying to find and deliver additional opportunities. And I'm optimistic that there's
additional opportunity in Bern.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Thanks, John.

<Q - Meredith Adler>: Good morning. This is Meredith Adler and I've got questions from Eric Percher as well. I
guess, I would like to start by asking about talking with payers about the fact that you have generic inflation. How
much work do you have to do to change the terms of the contracts? I mean, if it was branded drugs I think the inflation
would be sort of dealt with automatically, but not so with generics. What kind of discussions are you having and how
hard do you think it will be to get this adjusted?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Well, I'd say, it's a fairly complex topic. But there's lots of different levers. One is I think
that we're not going to be very tolerant of long-term partners, so people that are opportunistic. I think number two is,
we do have contracts, which over time need to reflect the market. But then there's also indexes those contracts are
based on and some of those are sometimes maybe late in reflecting the realities of the marketplace, but over time we
believe that those will catch up as well and therefore that will flow through.
So, there are many different levers to go at it. And we are working all of them, but I do think that it will roll through as
we go through. So, I don't know if Kermit, if you want to comment on that?
<A - Kermit R. Crawford>: Yes, Meredith, maybe I'd add to that, that certainly this past year we've seen a shift from
historical patterns of deflation in the generic drug costs, which we have planned for. And to one that is inflation and it
is negatively impacting our margin. But I wouldn't say it's all around the drug inflation. I mean, we've certainly had
some increase in our third-party reimbursement pressures. We've had fewer brand to generic drug conversions
compared to a year ago. And so, as we think about our contracting strategy, it certainly will account for these increases
in the drug costs.
But there are other things we're doing as well. Greg had mentioned we're aggressively looking at our cost to fill around
improving efficiencies in our cost to fill from things like technology where our customers are refilling their
prescriptions through digital and mobile technology, through automation that is making us more efficient in filling
prescriptions, through centralization that is reducing labor in the stores, but at the same time increasing our customer
service levels.
And I also do believe that our joint venture with Alliance Boots, we're well positioned to provide some offset to this
increase in drug pricing. So, I think, over time, you'll see the market adjust through market efficiencies, through supply
and demand.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: And then I guess I have a question. I mean, I would have said that some of these pressures
have been there for a while. Was there something in particular that really made you feel that you needed to start
addressing both aspects of cost structure, the way you fill scripts and becoming more efficient? Is there something
particular that drove that now?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Meredith, I would say, I'm a three-bucket person. I would say that we have, bucket one,
we've made strategic decisions that I believe are absolutely the right thing for the company to do long-term, which is to
grow our share of high-value senior patients with preferred physicians, Part D plans, convert 30-day supplies of chronic
medications to 90-days. That's helping us win share, but it's also impacting margin. As those preferred physicians have
a little more aggressive rates with them and obviously 90-day supplies have a little less margin than 30-day fill.
So, bucket two would be there are reimbursement pressures that are ongoing, step down to some of the contracts
year-over-year, but there's also consolidation going on in the industry. And there has been some significant step downs
from consolidation.
And third would be the fact, as Kermit alluded to, we are seeing inflation versus deflation in some of those contracts
that we have to make up for. So, I think with that, all those together, as I said, we've got to get at, one, trying to make
sure that we account for that both in our purchasing at Bern, our contracting with payers, but at the same time get after
our cost structure to offset. But I do think the opportunity for us to continue to grow share and win in the senior market
is encouraging, because we're starting see real growth.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Okay. And then I guess just a final question on expenses. Some of what you sound like you're
going to do is going to be taking costs out of the operations in how you run the stores and I assume some of it is just

more looking at the overhead structure. How much opportunity do you think there is in either place to generally lower
costs?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yeah, I think we still have opportunity in both. And again, I think it's looking at how we
support stores, the businesses we have, the projects we have, the way we run projects so forth in corporate. So, all of
the above, we have opportunity. I don't know, Wade, if you want to add anything?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yeah, no, I think that, the way we're going at it is to really look holistically across the
major processes that drive cost versus in silos or in small buckets. And I think, I guess one of the examples Kermit used
is just the entire cost to fill process and how we think about 90-day and how we think about e-prescribe, how we think
about working with payers differently to drive really radical improvements in those processes and therefore costs. So, I
think there's a lot of opportunity in both. But I think that it's looking at it more systemically and going after the big
prize is the way we're going to get the big costs out. Kermit?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Mark, Alex, anybody want to – Mark?
<A - Mark A. Wagner>: Yeah, Meredith, this is Mark. I think we – part of looking at the cost structure was what I
talked about on the last quarter call was the store optimization and shutting down some of the unprofitable stores, or
stores that weren't really strategically positioned. But there's lot of opportunities even within the operation of the store,
in terms of, one, making the right investments in the stores in terms of labor, but then pulling out where it doesn't make
sense.
I think there's other ways to manage the cost that's on the property side that the team has taken a look at and have really
engineered through the last six months into the stores. I think that there's always opportunity to re-examine the cost
structure and to pull out what's not necessary or to re-establish what really adds value and not.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Okay. That's all very helpful. Thank you. I wish you guys luck.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Thanks, Meredith.

Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Yeah, hi, good morning and thank you for taking my question. Greg, there's a lot of
discussion around inversions especially in the healthcare world. And a couple of times on this call both you and Wade
highlighted the below the line benefits, so can you just give us a sense of what kind of like is your most updated
perspective on the prospect of inversion?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yeah, Ricky, I think as I've said, we're certainly analyzing all the moving parts that will
lead up to certainly our decision on the timing structure of step two and so it's difficult to kind of break those apart and
talk in more of a piecemeal.
I will say, as we have said that we're looking at all and everything. We're looking at everything from what's the best
timing would be, what capital structure should be, what our tax structure – or what the structure could do as far as our
effective tax rate. And that's complex stuff, I guess, is what I would say, Ricky, as we work through this.
We are working around the clock to try to understand all the above, so that we are able to make the right decision for
the company. And again, that's why we need a little more time to be able to bring all this together; but I would say, that
we're looking at everything, it is complex, and it's all interdependent, and that's why we want to come forth with a call
where we can give as much as we possibly can in late July or early August.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay. And then, I mean, obviously, on the expense side and kind of like the margins, trends
have been sluggish for some time now. I guess the question is, have you kind of like, not been as, I would say,
proactive about kind of like – and I know you've done some, but maybe you've not been as proactive as you could

about managing the margin, because you are kind of like, looking now at the combination and looking at things and
doing holistic? Just kind of like trying to understand what could have been done already versus kind of like the
opportunity going forward?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yeah, Ricky, I'll start off, maybe by peers can weigh in. I would say that historically we've
done, I think an admirable job on controlling our SG&A and two-year stack.
Now with that said, we need to do more, and I also think that frankly, we have cut a lot in the last six months to a year,
unfortunately, some of that has got absorbed in the increased pharmacy margin pressure that we've seen. With that said,
we are continuing to identify additional opportunities, so I wouldn't want you to read into the fact that we have not been
getting after it.
Now with that said, we also think that as we look at current Walgreen business and opportunities, in addition with the
merger of the two, that there are going to be even greater opportunities in different ways of looking at that. So, we are
absolutely focused on the core business. We have made significant reductions. Some of that has been absorbed, as I
said, because of the pressure on the margin. We're identifying additional opportunities and we're going to combine
those with the opportunities we have at step two.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay. And one final one, because you did mention the re-pricing and just to follow-up on
Meredith's question, can you remind us when is your contract with Express Scripts is up for renewal?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: We don't give that out. They were both – it's a multi-year contract, Ricky, but we don't –
and the reason is for competitive reasons, we obviously don't want to be disadvantaged.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay. Understood. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with UBS.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: So, yeah, that color on the complex issue, I think is definitely helpful for people.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Thank you.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: So, I'll just leave that alone. But I guess, Greg, since you mentioned you're a three-bucket
guy, I guess, just a quick three-bucket question for you on the gross margins. Since you did mention the pharmacy
reimbursement pressure, the generic price inflation and fewer launches, just curious which of those buckets had the
biggest impact in the quarter?
And then also just to be clear, did the generic price inflation, in particular, did that definitely increase in the May
quarter specifically versus the trends you saw back in the February quarter? So, I definitely want to hone in on that
generic price inflation specifically.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yeah. Thanks, Steve, for putting it into three buckets for me. I think – and I'll let – Kermit
maybe weigh in, I think certainly generic inflation kind of runs through a lot of this. And meaning that, it shows up in
the contracts, obviously, certainly we were thinking about deflation and now we're seeing some inflation. We're also
obviously just playing COGS. We're certainly doing everything we can do at Bern to offset that.
But I think in the order of magnitude, I think probably generic inflation is specifically and probably more important,
because we didn't quite anticipate it, a lot of the other strategic decisions we certainly anticipated. We know exactly
what our contract arrangements with some of the commercial plans are, we know what our Part D preferred physicians
cost us as far as gross margin. This was really kind of snuck up, I think on the industry and us.

And now I do think, as I said, I can't think of anyone that's better positioned than us to offset this, because of what
we're doing at Bern, but I would say inflation. I don't know, Kermit, do you want to add anything?
<A - Kermit R. Crawford>: Steve, I would add to that. Generic inflation was higher than we expected compared to
the normal deflation that we planned for and we saw the full impact of that in the third quarter versus the second
quarter. But I'd also add our growing 90-day share and our market share of Medicare Part D. I mean, both of those, as
Greg mentioned earlier, were growing market share. Both of those margins have been hurt in the near-term, because of
that.
And the expectation in both 90-day and in our mix of the Medicare Part D is greater than we had anticipated this
quarter. So, I think when you look at a combination of the impact of our reimbursement pressure, we've not been able
to fully offset that due to a lack of new generics as well as the generic inflation versus deflation.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Okay. Got it. Okay. Thanks.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Thanks, Steve.
Operator
Our next question comes from David Larsen with Leerink.
<Q - David M. Larsen>: Hey. With respect to the reimbursement pressure, aren't the generic rates typically set at a
MAC price? And aren't those fixed, so that the pressure is really the cost of the generic at the higher inflated rate and
the difference between that and the fixed MAC price? Or do those prices actually shift around? Or are they fixed?
Thanks.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: So, every contract is different. But you're right, as a kind of a general distraction, that's
more or less true. But the thing is, is that, I guess, the key thing I alluded to earlier is that the indexes that those are
based on don't always immediately reflect the changes in that inflation, and so that's the disconnect. But again, I think
we're working this from many different angles.
<Q - David M. Larsen>: Okay. Great. And then, how were volumes relative to your own expectations? Did you see
any flow from newly enrolled members through the public exchanges?
<A - Kermit R. Crawford>: David, it's still very early to tell around ACA. I mean, obviously, publicly they've
announced 8 million people have joined the ACA. We certainly feel like we're getting our share of that 8 million
people, but certainly some of those folks were former cash paying customers that are now in the exchange. They were
former customers that other forms of coverage that are now in the exchange.
So, I think it's still early on around ACA. We're seeing growth in our core business. I mean, Wade, talked about gaining
back customers from our ESI customers. But primarily when we look at this business, our core business, Med D,
90-day, return of ESI, a little ACA is all growing our underlying business.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yeah, I guess, I just would say across the board, both in the front-end and in the pharmacy,
I think we've got real growth momentum. And I think what's also encouraging is that our customer satisfaction metrics
continue to strengthen.
<Q - David M. Larsen>: Okay. Great.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: That's very, very fundamental and important for the long-term.
<Q - David M. Larsen>: Great. And then just one more quick one. Any thoughts around specialty, is that a positive
driver or longer-term and any impact from Hep-C? Thanks.
<A - Kermit R. Crawford>: Yes, Hep-C is certainly a positive driver long-term. David, as you know, it does impact
the margin. Wade missed it earlier in our speech, but we are seeing positive growth in our specialty business.

<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: I think one of the things, David, that we're excited about, and again, I think it's the work
that Jeff Berkowitz and the team in Bern are doing combined with Mike Ellis and Kermit's group that's running our
specialty group here with our central and retail op model, we're gaining access to limited distribution drugs.
In fact, I think we've gained access to every one of the last 14 or 15 launches of limited distribution drugs. I think that's
reflective of the fact the good work that Jeff and team are doing with our pharma partners who are looking for special
services as well as what Kermit and team are doing with the services we provide both centrally and at retail. So to me,
that's a solid proof point that we're making progress and winning in specialty space.

Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Robert P. Jones>: The questions. Not to keep going back to this topic, but just on the gross profit margin in the
quarter, I guess what the concern is, in the last couple of quarters, is you guys are pacing very nicely on the
procurement synergies. If I look at this quarter, it looks like $89 million to Walgreens. But if I back that out assuming
most of that is clearly from purchasing the gross margin rate looked like it was somewhere in the 27%, 28% range,
clearly below where I think the company has been historically.
Could you maybe just give us a little bit of context relative to history of where these pressures are? And is it something
that is more transient such that as we move past them we will start to really realize the benefit of the procurement
synergies?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yeah, I'll just take it. I mean, look, there are some conscious choices we made, as Greg
said. So, for example, driving 90-day and also being aggressive about Part D.
And I think those are the kind of opportunities based upon how they're set up structurally in the volume over time that
we can cost optimize on the other side to make sure that it's beneficial and accretive. But that's a conscious choice.
I think there's things that we will cycle. So, for example, as we talked about just the pace of new generics and the
timing of that and we've been very explicit with that. But I do think there has just been, there are some new things. And
we always have contractual step downs, but of course there's things like brand inflation and generics and whatever that
compensate.
And I think the real thing that's probably different is what we've seen in the inflation on generics and how we handle
that. But at the end of the day, I guess, what I'd say is in aggregate, we're focused on gross profit dollar growth. And
again, both those choices of what we can control and then what in the short-term we can't, but over the long0term we
have to address, that's really I think the focus in terms of how we drive the business.
<Q - Robert P. Jones>: So, I guess just to be clear, you wouldn't characterize any of these pressures as some kind of
structural change in the business that you didn't contemplate, say 1.5 years, 2 years ago when you embarked on the AB
transaction?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: I think the thing that I think Greg said, is the thing that probably wasn't fully anticipated
probably was just what we've seen in some inflation on drugs. And it's a fairly narrow subset, but some pretty hefty
increases and those contracts historically have been under the assumption that there is net deflation.
But like I said, I think there's many ways that we can attack this. And I can assure you that we are going after it from all
angles. And I do think though that, again, I think that if we can drive market share growth, if we can drive better
customer satisfaction, if we can optimize our cost accordingly, and if we can attack this issue on all fronts, I think we're
as well positioned as anybody to be successful.

<Q - Robert P. Jones>: Got it. And then I guess just my follow-up changing subjects a bit, just around ABC obviously
now being part of the purchasing platform, sounds like you're getting the incremental benefit from their volume. Are
you looking at opportunities of bringing any other companies into the joint venture to further enhance that scale? Are
there ongoing conversations that you could highlight in the marketplace?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yeah, I think, certainly, right now, we're focused on maximizing and optimizing the
synergies that we can achieve through the three of us with AB and ABC. And I think there's tremendous opportunity
there to continue to realize before we begin to really discuss maybe other partners.
<Q - Robert P. Jones>: Got it. All right. Thanks.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yeah. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Thanks very much and good morning.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Hi, Lisa.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Greg, I heard you made a comment around regaining, or Wade made the comment around
regaining some scripts for Express Scripts. And you talked about 90-day as well and the growth of that. Are you seeing
the scripts that you're regaining are through the Smart90 program? Can you maybe just update us on how that program
has gone thus far with Express Scripts?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yeah, maybe I'll start and let Kermit jump in. When I'm talking about the growth in
90-day, Lisa, it's 90-day in general across the entire marketplace, which excites me because I think, as I said, we
launched it, we realized it was going to impact margin, because of the fills; but at the same time, we've seen mail level
off, we've seen customers who want to get 90-day supplies through community pharmacists continue to grow. So
therefore, I think it was absolutely the right thing for us to do for the consumer.
Smart90 is a subset of that. And I do think we have been working with Express Scripts customer by customer,
somewhat unique. Those that are looking for a Smart90 solution, the good thing is Express Scripts has an opportunity
to present that. And, Kermit, I think, we've been pretty pleased with that.
<A - Kermit R. Crawford>: Yeah, let me just add to that. Smart90 is just hitting the market now. And right now, it
wouldn't be a significant contributor to our overall 90-day retail. I mean, a lot of the 90-day retail has been driven by
the increase in market share of our preferred networks under Medicare Part D.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Okay. Great. And I know you've already talked a lot about the reimbursement buckets, et cetera,
and around generics, but the one thing that I'm still a little bit confused about is just you should be one of the largest
global generic purchasers. Is it that the timing of Bern hasn't kicked in yet? Because if we go back and we look at Rite
Aid last week, they talked about the fact that their relationship with McKesson hasn't kicked in yet, and therefore that's
why they're feeling this pressure. Given the fact that you're already starting to see some of the synergies, I'm just trying
to understand what's happening around procurement and the timing aspect of how you're buying from Bern?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yeah, Lisa, I wouldn't say that it's been delayed. I think Bern, we're pleased with and
we're out of the gates pretty quickly and on track. I think it's those subset of molecules that have kind of popped up in
this inflationary environment that we are – that caught, I think, the entire industry, a little off-guard, I'd say ourselves as
well. We are now all over it with the combined Walgreen team and Bern team focused on those molecules.
I do think that – and there's a lot of moving parts there as Wade alluded to earlier. There's the cost increase, the
corresponding AWP is not keeping up with cost increases, there's a whole lot of things that we're looking at.

What I will say, back to the structural issue, I think the good thing is, we're aware of it, we're on it, we know how to go
at it, and I think we're as well positioned as anyone to get after it. But it was something that we didn't expect. We're
working through it and I think we're well positioned to cover and correct for it.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: And as we talked about gross margins, it sounds like most of this was on the healthcare pharmacy
side in the quarter. But I was just wondering if Mark or Alex had any comments around promotional activity and what
you're seeing on that side of your retail business?
<A - Alex Gourlay>: Yeah, hi. It's Alex here, Lisa, hi. We're feeling pretty good about our progress in the front-end
margin. We increased it quarter-on-quarter through more promotional efficiencies, it's really making sure that we
reward our best customers by using the data from the loyalty card. So some of [ph] that's promotional (58:22) market
that would be more efficient and more targeted and we're feeling pretty confident we can keep that going into the
long-term.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

Our last question comes from Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Hi. I wanted to start off with Alliance Boots. We did get results out of Alliance Boots more
recently and I was hoping – could you just provide a little color on their performance, how they are faring versus
relative to what you thought and how much of the shortfall to EBIT in 2016 is the Walgreens' business versus the
Alliance Boots business? Any color there I think would be helpful.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Maybe I'll start, Ed, and let Wade fill in. I think obviously still a challenging environment
in some of the countries throughout Europe. I think as I've said Stefano and his team, pretty solid team, they're
managing through that. But they are indeed have had some challenges in some areas of the business.
I do think when you look at their business compared to the markets, whether it's the retail business, Boots business or
the wholesale business and compare them to the market, to their competitors, they're actually winning against the rest
of the market and therefore that's encouraging, they're growing share. But as we've had some softness in parts of our
business that we're correcting for, they've had softness in parts of their business that they're working to correct for.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: I think, and I guess I'd just augment it, and say, I think they've also done some great work
below the line. So, both in terms of some of the tax efficiency work that they have done in terms of driving very
aggressive cash flow, which has helped them de-lever and as you know they refinanced a while back.
Also we have a strong pound situation, which is also very favorable too. So, I think on that, we feel very good about
their business; and again, they have a couple challenging markets they're in. But they're positioned well for the
long-term. And I think on a cash flow basis and after-tax basis, the business has made up a lot of ground there. So, we
feel good.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: And then I do think as we've said, certainly, we weren't on hitting the CAGR, to hit our
adjusted earnings we had and their CAGR – their EBIT CAGR has not been – is below their original plan, but they're
doing a lot of things to try to offset that and correct for it.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Okay. And just one follow-up on your 2016 commentary. Are you optimistic that the below
the line considerations may potentially offset the shortfall on the EBIT, or even more than offset the shortfall on the
EBIT as you think about 2016?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Ed, I'll jump and let Wade – I'm hesitant to go there. I think as I said, we just had too
many moving parts right now that we're working through. Hey, there's potential obviously and that's what we're looking
through from all of those how they come together. But I think give us the 4 weeks to 6 weeks and we'll be able to give
– we'll have a lot more clarity on how this is coming together and be able to give you a lot more information at that

time.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yeah. And there's lot opportunity, but I think the key is making the right choices, so they
all interplay with each other for the best long-term value creation for shareholders and we're looking at everything.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Thanks, Ed.
