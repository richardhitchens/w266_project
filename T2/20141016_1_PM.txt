MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day and welcome to the Philip Morris International third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Today's call is
scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Philip Morris International Management and the question and
answer session. [Operator instructions]
Media representatives on the call will also be invited to ask questions at the conclusion of the questions from the
investment community. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and
Financial Communications. Please go ahead, sir.
Nicholas M. Rolli
Welcome and thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed information on our
2014 third quarter results. You may access the release on our website at www.pmi.com. During our call today, we'll be
talking about results for the third quarter of 2014 and comparing them to the same period in 2013, unless otherwise
stated. A glossary of terms, data tables showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI or currency and acquisitions,
asset impairment exit and other costs, free cash flow calculations and adjustments to earnings per share or EPS, as well
as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP measures are at the end of today's webcast slides which are posted on our website.
Please note that Reduced-Risk Products or RRPs is the term we use to refer to products with the potential to reduce
individual risks and population harm in comparison to smoking combustible cigarettes. Today's remarks contain
forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the forward looking and
cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the various factors that could
cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements. It's now my pleasure to
introduce Jacek Olczak, our Chief Financial Officer.

Jacek Olczak
Thank you, Nick and welcome, ladies and gentlemen. Our volume and financial results in the third quarter came in
slightly above our expectation. Our organic cigarette volume decreased by just 0.4% due to an improvement in industry
volume trends and higher PMI market shares in the EU and EEMA regions which nearly offset relatively modest
volume declines in the Asia and Latin America and Canada regions.
Net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 4%, while adjusted OCI was up by 4.3% on the same
basis. This growth was driven by the EEMA and Latin America & Canada regions, thanks in large part to higher
pricing, most notably in Russia. It was partly offset by previously announced investments behind our brands and iQOS.
Adjusted diluted EPS, excluding currency, grew by 10.4% to $1.59, driven primarily by continued strong profit growth
across the EEMA and Latin America & Canada regions.
For the first nine months of the year, we achieved a growth in currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS of 11.9%. Let me
remind you, however, that we will face a much more challenging comparison in the fourth quarter. Ex-currency
adjusted diluted EPS grew by 19.4% in the fourth quarter of 2013, and the pattern of our expenses this year is weighted
much more heavily to the remainder of the year.
In addition, we will be making significant investments in the fourth quarter behind the pilot launches of our iQOS
platform and Marlboro HeatSticks in Nagoya, Japan and Milan in Italy. We will also make additional investment in the
continuation of the rollout of Marlboro Red 2.0, as well as the absorption of underlying costs attributable to the
optimization of our manufacturing footprint.
As announced in our earnings release this morning, we are revising our 2014 reported diluted EPS guidance to a range
of $4.76 to $4.81, compared with $5.26 in 2013, due predominantly to the impact of unfavorable exchange rate
movement.
Since July, we have witnessed a sharp decline in the value of certain key currencies versus the U.S. dollar, in particular,
the Indonesian rupiah and the Russian ruble. Accordingly, at prevailing exchange rates, our guidance now includes a
full year unfavorable currency impact of approximately $0.72 per share versus $0.61 in our previous guidance. In
addition, there was one additional $0.01 in the third quarter, in after-tax asset impairment and exit costs related to the
termination of cigarette manufacturing in the Netherlands. And it is anticipated that there will be a further $0.01 in the
fourth quarter related to the closure of our factory in Australia.
Our underlying business performance is slightly better than our previous expectations. While consumer downtrading
and heavy discounting in Australia have persisted, there has been an improvement in the EU region and Indonesia and
continued strong profit momentum in the EEMA and Latin America and Canada regions. Excluding the impact of
currency and after-tax impairment and exit costs totaling $0.27 related to previously disclosed footprint optimization
initiatives, our adjusted diluted EPS are projected to increase by approximately 6.5% to 7.5% compared to the $5.40
achieved in 2013. Our revised guidance results in a narrowing of the growth range around its midpoint.
I will now discuss the recent developments in key regions and markets starting with the EU region. The third quarter
confirmed the improving cigarette industry volume trend with a decline of 3.4%, thereby bringing the year-to-date
September decline rate also to 3.4%. This represents a significant moderation compared to the 7.9% decline in the same
period last year. We attribute this improvement to a slight decline in illicit trade, a slowdown in the growth of e-vapor
products in several markets and the less out-switching to fine cut products.
The improved trend in cigarette industry volume is visible across all six of the largest EU region markets by volume,
with a particularly strong improvement in the worst affected market in the Southern Europe. While we do expect to see
some acceleration in the decline in the fourth quarter, due to recent price increases, notably in Germany and the impact
of a more challenging industry volume comparison versus the fourth quarter of 2013, we are now forecasting a full year
decline of approximately 4%.
Our market share performance in the EU region continues to be very strong with growth of 1.2 points in the third
quarter to 39.7% and 1 point year-to-date September to 39.8%. The growth has been broadly based with share gains

this year in all six of the largest EU region markets by volume. Our share growth reflects the strength of our key
international brands, Marlboro, L&M and Chesterfield. These brands now represent the top three industry brands in the
region.
In the third quarter, Marlboro gained 0.2 share points to reach 19.1%, the growth momentum being reinforced by the
successful rollout of Marlboro Red 2.0. L&M share was stable at 7% with a notable performance in Germany.
Chesterfield continues its particularly strong performance, gaining 1.4 share points to reach a regional share of 5.8%.
The share growth was driven by Italy, where it was price repositioned in February this year, as well as by successful
line extensions in Poland.
The combination of more modest cigarette industry volume declines and share gains has resulted in an improved PMI
volume performance. Were it not for the issues related to the excise tax structure in Italy, this would have translated
into ex-currency adjusted OCI growth in the EU region year-to-date September. In addition, our profits are being
impacted by costs related to the ending of cigarette manufacturing in the Netherlands and to the build-up of our
commercial infrastructure in the UK. We are cautiously optimistic that as of 2015, the EU region should contribute to
PMI's profit growth provided that improved cigarette industry volume trends continue.
I will now discuss some of our key markets in the Asia region, beginning with Japan. Year-to-date September, industry
volume in Japan declined by 3.2%, which is in line with our forecast decline range of 3% to 3.5% for the full year. The
third quarter provided further evidence of our success in stabilizing our market share. Excluding the impact of trade
inventory movements, our market share has remained around 25.9% since the fourth quarter of 2013.
The share stabilization has been driven primarily by Lark, which is performing well following the successful morphing
of the Philip Morris brand in April; as well as the recent revamp of the Lark brand family. Our share has also benefited
from the rollout of the Be Marlboro marketing campaign and the August launch of Marlboro Clear Hybrid, a smooth
tasting, regular to menthol capsule product, which achieved a 0.6% market share in September. Going forward, we
believe that our pipeline of new innovative products should further reinforce our competitive position in Japan.
In the Philippines, third quarter tax-paid cigarette industry volume was down by 3.2%. However, as Mighty
Corporation continues to significantly underdeclare it sales volume for excise tax purposes, the trends in the tax base
market remain distorted. We estimate that Mighty is paying excise taxes on less than half of its total sales. Market
research data on adult smoking incidence and adult daily consumption show continued resilience.
The Bureau of Internal Revenue issued its expected regulation on tax stamps. This requires manufacturers to affix tax
stamps on all locally-manufactured packs of cigarettes. However, there is still significant technical issues with the
production of the stamps, resulting in a delay in implementation.
In Indonesia, cigarette industry volume trends are subject to quarterly fluctuations. This was evident in the third quarter
when industry volume increased by an unexpectedly vigorous 4.9%, driven by growth in the machine-made kretek
segment.
On a 12-month-moving basis, industry volume is up by 2.8%, and for the full year, we expect industry volume to grow
by around 2%. While our market share remains below the previous years' level, we continue to achieve positive
sequential share momentum with 35.5% in the third quarter, following shares of 34.6% and 34.9% in the first and
second quarters respectively. This growth has been driven by our strong performance in the growing lighter-tasting
machine-made kretek segment behind Sampoerna A, U Mild and Dji Sam Soe Magnum Blue. We have also seen a
recent stabilization in the share of our key hand-rolled kretek brand, Dji Sam Soe, as competitive brands have crossed
critical price points.
Let me now turn to Russia, where our business performance continues to be strong. In August, we reached a market
share of 27.4% and on a year-to-date August basis, our share increased by 0.9 points to 27%. The strong performance
was driven by above-premium Parliament, mid-price L&M and the low-price Bond Street and Next.
2014 has been characterized by significant retail price increases, driven in large part by the sizeable excise tax increase
that took place at the beginning of the year. Retail prices have increased by some 17% in the premium segment and

around 30% at the low end of the market. This has resulted in an estimated September year-to-date cigarette industry
volume decline of 9.4% and we expect a decline of 9% to 10% for the full year. However, we have been able to boost
margins through higher prices.
On September 20, the cabinet submitted draft amendments to the tax code, including proposed excise tax rates for the
period of 2015 to 2017. This proposal was submitted to the Duma for further considerations and approval. The
amendments are essentially in line with previous legislation and do not include features that we consider to be
particularly disruptive. Should the amendment be signed into the law by the President as foreseen this November, the
new excise tax rate will take effect on January 1, 2015.
While cigarette industry volume has declined significantly this year in Russia, it has remained essentially stable in the
rest of the EEMA region. This stability is attributable to Turkey, the Middle East and North Africa. Our business is
performing well. We grew our year-to-date September regional market share by 0.1 points to 25.1%. Combined with
strong pricing, this led to an increase in original adjusted OCI, excluding currency and acquisitions, of 20.8%
year-to-date September. The business outlook remains very positive thanks to the strength of Marlboro and Parliament
in many key markets.
Marlboro has been one of the key drivers of our favorable global market share momentum. In the third quarter, the
brand gained 0.3 share points in the Latin America & Canada region, and 0.2 share points in the EU and EEMA
regions. Its share was stable overall in the Asia region. Parliament, our above-premium proposition, has been a
contributor not only to share growth, but also to improved profit, as its volume increased by 9.3% in the third quarter to
12.9 billion units. The brand gained share across a broad range of markets, including Japan, Kazakhstan, Russia, Saudi
Arabia and Turkey.
Pricing remained the key driver of our adjusted OCI growth during the third quarter. Our pricing variance reached $491
million for the quarter and $1.4 billion for the first nine months of the year. This has been boosted by our new business
structure in Egypt, partially offset by Italy.
During the third quarter, we increased prices in a number of markets across the region, most notably in Argentina,
Germany, Indonesia and Spain. We are on track to achieve, again, this year our historical average of approximately
$1.8 billion in annual pricing variance.
Let me now take a moment to provide a brief update on our Reduced-Risk Products. As I speak, we are in the final
stages of preparing for the pilot launches in Japan and Italy of our heat-not-burn iQOS product platform and Marlboro
HeatSticks. These launches will be made without any reduced exposure or reduced risk claims. As already announced,
the official launch of iQOS in Nagoya, Japan's fourth largest city, will take place on November 4.
IQOS kits and Marlboro HeatStick will be available at over 1,000 retail outlets in Nagoya, including the world's first
iQOS flagship store located in the city center. The iQOS kit will have a recommended retail price of ¥6,980 or
approximately $65, while Marlboro HeatStick in regular and menthol variants will retail at ¥460 per pack of 20 or
approximately $4.29, at price parity with Marlboro cigarettes. Our HeatSticks have been classified by the Ministry of
Finance in Japan in a category that results in an effective excise tax rate that is lower than cigarettes. Our second pilot
launch will take place in Milan in Italy later this year. For competitive reasons, we will not disclose any details at this
time.
In September, our board approved a 6.4% increase in our quarterly dividend to an annualized rate of $4 per share. As a
result, this year, we will exceed our target dividend payout ratio of 65%, reflecting our strong confidence in our
business fundamentals and future prospects. Our dividend yield last Friday was 4.7%.
During the third quarter, we spent $750 million to repurchase a further 8.9 million shares at an average price of $84.54
per share. We continue to target total spending of $4 billion on share repurchases during 2014. Since the spin, through
the end of September this year, we have returned over $70 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share
repurchases.

In conclusion, third quarter and year-to-date results were slightly above our expectations. As mentioned, we will face a
much more challenging comparison in the fourth quarter. We have revised our 2014 reported diluted EPS guidance,
due predominantly to the impact of unfavorable exchange rate movement.
On a currency-neutral adjusted diluted basis, we have narrowed the growth range around the midpoint to approximately
6.5% to 7.5%. While consumer downtrading and heavy discounting have unfortunately persisted in Australia, we have
been able to offset this through a better performance in the EU region and in Indonesia, while the EEMA and Latin
America regions have continued to perform very strongly.
The iQOS pilot launches in Japan and Italy this quarter mark an important milestone for our Reduced-Risk Products
portfolio. We're excited to bring this product to market and strongly believe that this could represent the first step in a
positive paradigm shift for both PMI and the tobacco industry
Looking ahead to 2015 and 2016, we remain confident that our business fundamentals are improving and confirm our
goal of returning to currency-neutral net revenue and adjusted OCI annual growth within our mid to long-term annual
target rate of 4% to 6% and 6% to 8% respectively, after taking into account the anticipated investments behind the
commercial expansion of our Reduced-Risk Products. On this basis, we target a currency-neutral adjusted diluted EPS
annual growth rate of 8% to 10% for this period.
Thank you. I will be now happy to answer your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog from Wells Fargo.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Good morning.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning, Bonnie.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Hi, Jacek. I guess I'm trying to understand a few moving parts. On one hand, your total
shipment volume was better than expected and you took share, but on the other hand, your operating margins were
down 230 basis points. So I'd be curious to hear how much of the margin pressure you experienced in the quarter was
from a negative mix shift in your portfolio versus the higher costs you've been experiencing. And then could you give
us a sense of how downtrading pressures have been trending so far in Q4?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: There is some mix pressure, obviously, coming mainly from Asia, from Australia, but I think it's
more due to the increased investments as previously anticipated or announced in the second half of the year. So, we
will have increased the investments in Q3 and we will have more of the investments going into the Q4 for the reasons
which I mentioned in my remarks. This is what stands behind the movement in operating margin.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Okay and then I have a few questions on Asia, specifically Japan. Are you seeing any shift
in your portfolio mix due to the tax increase? And then, could you quantify for us the negative impact of inventory
movements or maybe give us a sense of how much this impacted your volume and profits in the country in the quarter?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, I mean we could see a better performance of Lark, partially following the successful
morphing of Philip Morris into Lark and also some marketing initiatives which we put behind the brand. And Lark,
obviously, is also slightly more lower-priced than the premium brands in the market. I think it's a little bit too early to
say what this pricing move – unequal pricing moves of ¥20 and ¥10 have created in terms of a dynamic behind the
brands. But yes, I think Lark is doing slightly better than Marlboro in this comparison.
When it comes to the adjustments which we're making in Japan, it's essentially, we're trying to adjust the inventories to
reflect the total market outlook and still year-on-year. I mean, our lower share, as you might notice, we stabilized our
share on a sequential basis. But versus last year, we're still down and these adjustments essentially represent this one.

So I think you have – just to give you a number, I think on inventory, we will have about half a billion units on the
inventory adjustments in Q3.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Okay. That's helpful and then my last question is on the e-vapor slowdown in the EU that
you mentioned. What are you seeing in terms of the key trends and pressures on this category and then does this give
you even more confidence in your iQOS platform?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: The trends essentially are the same trends which I talk about, what we talk about at Investors Day
or on the second quarter. The consumers are moving into the tank system. I think we all know the reasons behind it.
The first product launches in e- cigarettes category are not really satisfying the consumers, so the acceptance rate are
falling down. That's about the trend. In most of the markets, essentially in all of the markets, we see the same, so just a
continuation of the trend.
Now, does this give us more optimism behind iQOS? I think it was more than a year or two years ago when we said
that the current technology behind the e-cigarette doesn't augur that well. We think that iQOS is by far a much better
satisfying product. We have confirmed it in our test before going to the test market. As you remember, acceptance rate,
consumers who fully switch from a conventional cigarette, combustible cigarette to iQOS proposition were really very
high. They were reaching 30%. I think we were encouraged by this one, by this result, and hence we're going to this
test market. I don't think this change in the trends or continuation of this negative trend in e-cigarette gives us more
confidence behind the iQOS. Frankly speaking, we have the confidence – we are at a very high level of confidence
when it comes to iQOS.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: And then maybe lessons learned on pricing too, just in terms of the affordability of the
e-vapor category relative to where you're pricing your iQOS and then the HeatSticks. You're pricing them, you
mentioned, at parity I think with Marlboro, I believe you mentioned.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Yes, this is how we position the product in Japan, although we are not disclosing the details for
Milan, but you understand our philosophy. The product has a benefit.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Right.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: And therefore, I think that product deserves to be sold at a premium price. So I think we stayed to
what we have said before that that's the positioning based on how much effort we have put in developing this product,
despite the fact that we're not claiming other benefits in Japan. But we're all aware about also the science which we
have put in validating the benefits of this product. I think it all comes together and makes this product deserving being
put at the premium segment, at a premium price.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: All right. Thank you, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Hi, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning, Judy.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: So first, just maybe on FX and obviously the currency market continues to be very volatile and if
we just assume maybe prevailing rates and just trying to gauge the impact on 2015 really and I get to a number
something like a negative $0.35 or so. So can you just confirm that that's kind of in the ballpark of where you see the
impact in 2015 at current rates, especially when you take into consideration the effect of hedged rates on the end.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I wouldn't go into 2015 at this stage, you know that our practice was we always get this – we talk
about the impact of the currency at the time when we give the guidance for the year. One thing which – I'm not

presumably disclosing anything new, if you look what is happening in the currency market over the last 24 hours, 48
hours, a week, it's extremely volatile markets. So I think it's another presumably reason it's better not to give any
number or confirm any sort of the range at this stage.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Just on the yen though, Jacek, I think the last time you talked about the effective hedge at ¥98
for this year. Has there been any change to that number as we think about the year-over-year impact?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Yes, there was a bit of an impact. There is a bit of the impact of the yen. The effective rate will
be higher than ¥98. In the revised guidance for the currency, the spot rate, which we gave today, when we revised the
impact by additional negative $0.11; yen actually just then further contributed the $0.01. I mean, most of the impact
which we have in this $0.11 additional is coming from Russian ruble and the rupiah, the Indonesian rupiah. So yen just
stands at the additional $0.01, very much because the last portion of our cash flow revenues from Japan is already
hedged.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. And then just in terms of what you're seeing in the Russian market, just wondering if any
of the recent volatility and the currency fluctuation is having any impact in terms of demand or the pricing or the
competitive dynamics in that market. And your volume in the third quarter in Russia was up 0.8%. Market share,
obviously, was up. But was there any benefit in terms of any year-over-year inventory movement that boosted your
shipment number as well?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No. Actually, the volume, the shipment volume I think was down by the 0.4%, shipment volume
was not up, market share was up. And this, partially, is why our shipment volume is better than overall market
performance. It's partially coming from the strong performance of our brands. The share advancements which we're
realizing in Russia, at the tune of one full share point, that's significant.
There is obviously some timing of the shipments to our distributors, but I think overall is the performance of both
Parliament, that's very positive if you take into consideration the magnitude of the pricing, which we have realized in
the market, but also Bond Street. So I think the portfolio there is nicely complementary and that stands behind the
better share and hence the better shipment versus the total market.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: And just any color on the recent trends, given the recent volatility in that market?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Yes, sorry, I missed this one. Not really, if you see our outlook for the full year, even taking into
considerations, the implemented and announced price increases in Russia, still the market's going to decline, the range
9% to 10%. If you will just calculate what is the resulting price elasticity, everyone would realize that Russia is very
normal for our category, for tobacco category elasticity range So it doesn't seem that there are any, at this stage, any
headwinds coming from a currency, from inflation or other macros.
Now, this is the situation as of today. I will have to obviously watch and we do watch carefully how the situations may
unfold into the next period. But as I said, I think our comfort on Russia is also coming through the well-laddered
portfolio of brands. I repeat myself, starting with the premium – Parliament in the premium, going for the value
mid-price brands, low-priced brands. So, I think on that one, I think we should be able to hedge any potential
headwinds if they were to materialize there.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Got it. Okay. Thank you.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you very much.

<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Yes. Thank you. Thank you. It's exciting. Just two questions from me. First, I wanted to
follow up on the price/mix question, specifically for Europe. I expected to see some sequential improvement in pricing
realization within the region, given Germany, Portugal, Spain; but that didn't seem to materialize during the quarter. So
just more at the regional level, market share trends were very strong, that's positive, just wondering if you're seeing
incremental downtrading overall within your portfolio or shifts within Marlboro to some of the lower price variants that
are weighing on overall pricing realizations.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: The pricing, yes, it was very low pricing. The variance coming from the EU this quarter is
partially the timing when we took the German – sorry, price increase in Germany. And obviously, there is a negative,
which is in this number coming from Italy. Just to remind, we are in the VAT absorption for the three quarters of this
year, obviously, including the third quarter. It's going to be about behind us around the mid of the fourth quarter. And
obviously, there was Chesterfield, the reposition.
If I would look in detail, market by market, in the EU region, I can see the positive pricing variance coming essentially
from most of the countries, with the exception, as I mentioned, Italy. So Italy is the overall drag, if you like, on the
pricing variance in the region.
And, obviously downtrading, I think, again, I would have to go to Italy. I mean, the Chesterfield, which is now
recorded the market share well above 10%. I mean, there is a bit of a decline over Marlboro, to the tune of about a
point. So, yes, there is some downtrading, but this is also the reasons why we have lowered, the beginning of the year,
the price of Chesterfield in order to stop any total market share erosion on our side.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: And the brand responded very well. So I think that part of exercise went very well.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. So, really the only thing that would change much sequentially in the fourth
quarter would be the headwind from Italy becoming less severe.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: On the pricing variance, yes.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: On the pricing variance, because on the OCI, as I mentioned in my remarks, one of the test
markets which we will be conducting is in Italy, is in the European Union. And second, EU was on the forefront and is
on the forefront of the rollout of Marlboro 2.0 architecture. Hence, in our remarks, I think we make this comment that
despite the fact that the volumes and our shipment volume is performing very strongly and it's great for this year and
even greater for 2015, however, this year, our profitability will be impacted, as we cannot convert it into the
profitability growth due to Marlboro 2.0, iQOS and some underlying costs due to shutting down the manufacturing,
cigarette manufacturing at our factory in Holland.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: And secondly, just on currency, specifically on hedging. Given the persistence and the
magnitude of the currency headwinds, have you considered at all changing the internal philosophy toward how you
manage FX risks, perhaps including more active hedging? Or if not that, maybe encouraging local country managers to
more actively offset transactional FX through pricing or discretionary reductions in operating costs?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: But this would require a significant change to the risk profile, if you like, which we'd like to
have. I mean, as I – presumably known to the community, I mean most of the impact of the currency on our results
comes from the translation, the range of 70%, 80% of the impact which we have on the translations, not on the
transactions. So our philosophy is, obviously, has an impact on our reported results. But I don't think we should be
moving closer into something which would add an element of speculation – adds volatility into our performance.

<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. And just to confirm, historically, we've thought of your hedging practices as
isolated within sort of euro-yen and perhaps dollar-yen. Are there any others that you are actively hedging? Just when
we're thinking about the disconnects between our currency model and...
<A - Jacek Olczak>: There are some hedges which we're doing on the leaf, associated with the leaf purchases in
Turkey. But most of the hedges are around the yen and the balance sheet hedges on our positions on the euro.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Hi, Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. I just had a question for you to start off on, just to understand the third quarter,
maybe the fourth quarter, the phasing of cost that may be coming through. And if I could just list what I have been
watching, obviously the Marlboro 2.0; obviously, there's some cost related to that. I think that cuts across all regions.
Obviously, the closure of Bergen op Zoom, maybe a little bit of Australia. And then, I guess also related to that, the
Reduced-Risk Products and is that a heavier fourth quarter spending versus third quarter? And do you have any color
you can add around the phasing and maybe in general, how much those costs are a burden on profit right now?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Certainly, Chris. I will give you color. But I would start with 2013 fourth quarter. Because if you
would look at our performance in 2013, you'll realize that our phasing of the cost in the last year was much more
skewed toward the first half of the year or the first three quarters of the year. So adjusting apples to apples, I have $200
million positive cost variance in the Q4 of 2013. So that's my entering or starting position going into Q4 of this year.
This is now combined that the pattern of our spending initiative is much more skewed towards the second half, and in
particular, to the Q4 of this year. And that may create – that actually creates the swing on the cost, Q4 on Q4, going
into the range of $400 million, maybe $400 million-plus even in this comparison, okay? So this is one element.
Now, drivers of this additional – of this investment in the second half or in the Q4 of this year, is as I mentioned in the
case of the EU before is iQOS launch in Milan. There is some preparation costs already falling into Q3, but most of that
would hit my Q4 result. Marlboro 2.0 will be the remainder part of the markets in the EU, which would roll out the
Marlboro new architecture in the Q4. And there was this underlying cost associated or related to the closure of the –
associated with the closure of the factory.
To give you a magnitude, the underlying costs which we carried this year due to the overall restructuring, both in
Holland and Australia, is in the range of about – will hit my Q4 results in the range of about $40 million. So now you
start adding these numbers, you will see why we're saying that the Q4 result, it will not be as great as the Q3 or Q2 this
year and this is reflected in our guidance.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Sure, that was actually very good color. Thank you for all that detail. If I could ask as a
second question; in relation to your guidance for the year, in which you've now kind of narrowed the guidance range
for EPS, do you have the same assumption for Australia built into that guidance? Has that gotten any better or any
worse than what you thought even back from sort of the Investor Day back in June?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No, it didn't get any worse or didn't get any better. So as I said, unfortunately, the heavy
discounting and the competitions in the low part of the market, as it intensified at the beginning of the year continues to
be pretty intense. And I think maybe also, to be more on a positive side, if one of the competitor makes an assumption
that you can have a volume growth in that market by being very aggressive on the price, you will not break this strategy
until you switch off the volume growth of a given brand. So I think what we do and part of our strategy, despite the fact

that this is, obviously, costly financially, I think it actually may lead to bringing some logic to the behavior in the
market.
So this is all in our guidance. I think versus the Q2, especially at the Investors Day, which I think prudence at that time
has dictated that we had to recognize that there was this potential headwind coming from Australia. I think at that time,
we were waiting for the more confirmation of the positive trends coming from our geographies, which have very nicely
materialized in Q3. But as I said, I think it would be imprudent to bet on this development in Q2. And now we are in a
very comfortable position to say that this lower end of the range of the guidance, which we gave at that time, is no
longer something which we should be worried about, that we can comfortably deliver in the midpoint of that range.
And the drivers, I think are well-known. EU has spectacularly good improvement on the total market and our market
share continues to do very well. Indonesia is a very positive surprise. It's coming, we knew that the market might be
stronger, but I think last quarter, Q3 has confirmed that the market goes in the right direction. And also the growth
momentum, so our adjusted OCI growth in EEMA and Latin America, I mean they're really coming very strongly. So
this is very important for us, not only from a Q3 perspective, but I would say even more important for us from a 2015
and beyond perspective. As you know, the road map which we have laid down for this year, we step-by-step, made the
progress, and therefore, we should return to the higher level of growth in 2015 and 2016.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. Well, that was very good. Thank you and I agree. So thanks so much. We'll
speak to you soon.

Your next question comes from the line of James Bushnell from Exane BNP.
<Q - James Bushnell>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Morning, James.
<Q - James Bushnell>: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two, please. The first is on the tax situation in Italy.
I just wondered if you could give us your latest thoughts as to what might be happening and when. I think January 15,
we were hopeful that something might change.
And then my second question is on plain packaging in Europe. When the first country passes legislation, whoever that
might be, do you think you could give us a roadmap about what would happen and would you be hopeful that a legal
challenge to that could either delay or stop the implementation of plain packaging? Or is it just the case of having to
take a country to court and then having to do that while they're going ahead with the measure? Thank you.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Okay. I'll start with Italy. The tax restructuring in Italy is following its normal legislative process.
We expect or the objective is that this should happen still this year. So would be implemented as of January 1 next year.
I mean, that's the objective and then we'll see how it works. But as I said, the restructuring is being discussed and it's
following the normal Italian legislative process.
When it comes to plain packaging, the second question, which you raised, there's nothing really new which has
happened recently because we were aware about Ireland, we're aware about UK. Yes, there was a statement from the
Ministry of Health in France that she will propose the legislation implementing, calling for implementations of plain
packaging. To date, to our knowledge, this is not a governmental position and no legislative initiative has been made, at
least to date, into this direction.
Now litigation, which you have mentioned quite rightly, it's obviously in our tool book of actions which we can take in
order to protect extremely valuable trademarks which we have. But there are also other elements which we are
exploring before we reach into litigation. But, yes, there is a litigation which clearly is something which we will not be
shy to use if this is what would be required by us.

One thing which is important to note, when we talk about the UK and Ireland, is if I am not mistaken, there are nine
countries today or member states in the EU which have raised their concerns to Ireland in particular. And I think there
are two countries already which have raised their concerns to the UK, vis-a-vis they announced or their indication of
introducing the plain packagings in this country. I mean it clearly demonstrate us that a number of member states in the
EU itself are pretty much concerned whether this is the right policy to be implemented, both from the perspective of the
principles of internal market and let's remember that the whole purpose of creating EU and the legislative powers
which were given in the form of directives, were to support the development of internal market. And frankly speaking,
plain packaging is not necessarily something which goes into this direction.
So, yes, to summarize this, plain packaging is an element in our toolbox and we will not be shy to use that if this is
what will be required.
<A - Nicholas M. Rolli>: Litigation.
<Q - James Bushnell>: Okay. Thank you very much. If I could just follow up, I'm sorry to bring up currency again.
But I noticed that the gap between your FX effects on your sales line versus your OCI line is widening, which
presumably reflects a bit more transactional hits. And I just wondered if you could comment, is that still mostly the yen
or does the Russian ruble come in there as well?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No, mostly in our revised guidance, the largest impact was coming from ruble, the rupiah. The
yen was, as I said earlier, was $0.01. We obviously had a positive Swiss franc on the cost side, which more than offset
the negative coming from the euro.
<Q - James Bushnell>: Sorry, I meant in terms of the transactional FX exposure that you've seen in Q3. Is it mostly
from the yen or is there also an impact from the rubble where I believe your costs are presumably not in rubles,
whereas obviously, your revenues are.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No, I think it was more from the ruble. I think it was more from the ruble; on the transactional
side.
<Q - James Bushnell>: Yeah. Okay. Great. Thank you very much for your help.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Erik Bloomquist from Berenberg.
<Q - Erik A. Bloomquist>: Hi, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Hi. Good morning.
<Q - Erik A. Bloomquist>: Good morning. I was hoping you could discuss a little more detail about the tax treatment
of the HeatSticks in Japan and then perhaps in Italy as well. And I was wondering if you could give us some more
perspective on the tax differential, what is it driven by? Is it a lower rate? Is it taxed by – what the basis for that is? And
then the ability of that tax treatment to be extended into other countries in the various regions. Thanks.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Tax treatment in Japan results the iQOS, HeatSticks will pay a tax about 20% lower than the tax
on cigarettes. It's classified in a different tax category for the reasons that this is not a cigarette and this is not
combustible. So, it's another tax category and the Ministry of Finance have decided to classify this product there. It's
also very much similar to what has happened with competitive product in that market, I mean, Ploom from JT which
also was – is classified in this tax category.
I can't tell you more about Italy, about the tax classification. But as we have said also during Investors Day, I think we
have a pretty strong case that this product, for various reasons, should enjoy better taxation than the combustible

conventional cigarette. Now, how this thing will materialize, we will have to see, but this is what we – in our
engagement in the various markets, that's the direction which we take.
<Q - Erik A. Bloomquist>: Okay. And then with respect to, again, another foreign exchange-related question, given
that that has such a material impact on the balance sheet and the ability to buy back stock, I mean is this really implying
that in 2015, the amount of buyback available to Philip Morris will be much more at the low end of what you suggested
or – and does that therefore imply, given your confidence in hitting kind of an 8% to 10% constant currency EPS target
that the operational component of next year perhaps looks a bit stronger?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: We have said, I think at the Investors Day, that we're looking at the range of $2 billion to $3
billion for next year. But obviously the final target, the final amount will depend on two factors: one is obviously the
acquisitions and second is also importantly the development on exchange rate, which obviously with our limited
headroom to further leverage the balance sheet in order to support a single-A rating, that's something which we'll have
to – we are watching very carefully. When we'll give the target in February, the target will reflect the development or
potential development on both sides. So I don't want to go into – commit to any number for next year. As I said, we
will announce it in February.

Your next question comes from the line of Vivien Azer with Cowen and Company.
<Q - Vivien N. Azer>: In terms of South Korea and the potential for a proposed tax increase, can you speak to the
likelihood of that actually passing?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Hi, Vivien. Well, I think there is high likelihood that the tax increase will happen, what we don't
know at this stage is the magnitude of that increase. If it's going to be in the range of KRW 1,000, KRW 1,500 or KRW
2,000, we'll have to see. So this is what I can tell you at this stage. Clearly, it is a significant, very significant tax
increase, but we also have to remember, if my memory is not wrong, that we're approaching the tenth anniversary of no
tax increase in Korea. So, I think we'll have to take this magnitude also from the perspective of when was the last time
Korea have adjusted the tax rate.
<Q - Vivien N. Azer>: That's fair. Thank you. And your key competitor in that market has not always priced, I think,
the way that everyone would have hoped. Is there any reason to think that they would be more constructive on pricing
around the tax increase?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, I wouldn't like to go into this speculation.
<Q - Vivien N. Azer>: Fair enough.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I mean investors community knows that the past performance is not necessarily the best, the
driver of the guidance for the future performance. So let's stay with this. I don't know. I can't tell you.
<Q - Vivien N. Azer>: Okay. Fair. In terms of platform 2.0, can you just confirm that it remains about on track and
roughly one year behind platform 1.0?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Yes, there's nothing changed there.
<Q - Vivien N. Azer>: So would we expect a test in the coming six months?

<A - Jacek Olczak>: But we say that the platform 2.0 is about one year – is a year behind – as per plan is behind the
platform 1.0.
<Q - Vivien N. Azer>: So not even a consumer test, because in Japan and Italy even though you're going to city tests
in the fourth quarter, didn't you go in to do some consumer testing that you spoke about at CAGNY in February?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Vivien, we're talking about the two levels of the consumer testing. One is the consumer testing in
terms of a whole offer test, which obviously will be done, we will be doing first. And then there's a consumer testing in
terms launching into the selected city or closed geography, okay? So always we'll go into the same – in the same – we
will repeat the same sequence as we have done – as we are doing so far with iQOS, i.e., platform 1.
<Q - Vivien N. Azer>: Terrific.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: The second part of 2015.
<Q - Vivien N. Azer>: Understood. My last question is on the FDA submission that you're working on jointly with
Altria. Any progress or updates on that? Do you have a sense of when you might actually make a formal submission to
the FDA on MRTP?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Well, I think it was subject of us concluding the clinical studies and closing the entire scientific
package, which is to support that submission. So, the clinical studies, as per plan, we will be completing them in the
mid of next year, second quarter of next year and then the whole preparation for the packet submissions can only really
start afterwards.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with CLSA.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Just turning to Indonesia, you indicated that the guidance for the category for the year
would be around a 2% growth rate, which implies around a 1% decline in the quarter for 4Q. I know that the comp gets
about 2 points tougher, but that's around a 6 point deceleration. Is there anything, you think, that's looming that would
drive that? Or is that just a conservative number? How are you thinking about the category dynamics there?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I think we're looking a little bit on the longer time span. I mean, not just the quarters. As I
indicated in my remarks on the 12-month-moving basis, the market is in a 2.4% decline. I think the 2% sounds to us,
seems to us more realistic for the full year. Maybe it's going to come a little bit better. I have to admit that the Q3 came
better than we expected. So that we recognize by changing a little bit, changing the outlook for the full year. The
market may come better because there's not much in the headwinds, which I can see in the market. Actually quite
opposite because as long as nothing is dramatically changing in terms of drivers of the lower performance last year, i.e.,
fuel subsidies or removal of partial of fuel subsidies, I think there were spikes in the food inflation, I think that these
things slowly coming behind us, so maybe the market can even do better. But let's see. I think the 2% is about the
realistic number as we see it at this stage.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Okay, that's helpful. And you had said that your July share was just over 35% and you came
in, in the full quarter at 35.5%. Was that a sequential progression, and so you would have finished the quarter maybe
around 36%? And could you give any sense of how that's continued into 4Q or for September?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: There was a sequential growth of the share in Indonesia quarter-on-quarter and also within the
month and this is very much driven by the fact that the Dji Sam Soe competitors, main competitors of the Dji Sam Soe
have crossed the critical price point of IDR 12,000 per pack. And as we expected this moment that Dji Sam Soe will
compete with the brands without this obstacle, if you like, of the psychological price point, we should observe a better

performance and Dji Sam Soe is coming actually now flat on the third quarter and year-on-year. So we stabilized the
brand.
Obviously, our entry with extending the brand into machine-made kretek both on full flavor and lighter variants helped
a lot, so this is very good. So, yes, I mean, we're growing the share sequentially there. And I think we should expect
this going through the year. Although, I think for still on the full year basis, we will be below our market share over last
year. But I think it's a very nice starting point which we're building already now into 2015.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: And what is the mix impact from that? Obviously, you've lost the low-end brands and that
would seem to be a benefit; certainly, hand-rolled Dji Sam Soe pressure would offset some of that. But if that's
stabilizing, is your mix a positive benefit or is that still pressured?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I don't think it's that much of the mix. There is some mix pressure, but you have to remember that
there's a different tax level also behind the different price points and the different category of the product. So the
margin differential is not necessarily fully translated or can be translated just from the retail price perspective.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Okay, great. Yeah, thank you. And then, just on iQOS, you have the unit price that you
mentioned, does that have any flexibility in terms of the launch period just for discounting or anything that – obviously,
you want to get people to try this or get it in people's hands. Certainly, it's a premium product, I understand that pricing
approach. But what's the right way to think about adoption and how to make sure that's not a prohibitive cost for people
to think about up front?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: By the regulatory ramifications which we have in Japan, we cannot have a discount on the
Marlboro HeatStick.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Oh, no, sorry. I didn't mean the HeatStick. I mean the iQOS unit itself.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: It's the introductory price in the whole offering, the introductory offering to the consumer which
will be going through the iQOS heating device, tobacco heating device.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: So you do have room to put incentives on that?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Sorry.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: You do have flexibility to how you price that in terms of just getting it adopted initially?
Because I think you said it's – the ¥6,980 that's the sort of list price, I guess, and you could work off of that to have an
upfront discount or something.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Absolutely correct. You're reading tea leaves like you would be in Nagoya.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Okay, great, thank you. And then just one last question on lower oil prices. I know certainly
in Indonesia last year, we saw consumer sensitivity to inflation there. Obviously, every country's different, but very
broadly speaking, with the big move in oil, do you feel like that's potentially a net consumer benefit enough to impact
any volume outlook? Or obviously it hasn't – it's a recent move and it hasn't stuck for a long time necessarily, but is that
potentially a positive in terms of how you just look ahead for the next three, six, nine, 12 months?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: I think it is positive. I think we would all like to have oil lower, right, lower prices, especially in
Indonesia, where the market is – or consumers are more sensitive. Yes, that's the right direction. Hence, as I said earlier
that it might be that the volumes in Indonesia will do a bit better than a 2% for the full year. Let's see how this
develops, but it's positive, you're absolutely right.
<Q - Michael S. Lavery>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Owen Bennett from Nomura.
<Q - Owen M. Bennett>: Good morning, Jacek.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Good morning.
<Q - Owen M. Bennett>: Just one from me, I was just wondering, the pricing benefit from the change in business
structure in Egypt. I was wondering if you could quantify this and can we expect this to drop off into next year when it
lapse?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: The benefit is coming from – in the past – sorry, in the year, in 2013, the way we operated our
structure in Egypt was that we've been selling just the materials, the components, i.e., tobacco, the cut filler, et cetera.
The manufacturing was taking place outside Philip Morris by the partners in Egypt. As of this year, we fully own the
entire process and we recognize the full cost of manufacturing. So this is the whole materials plus the conversions, et
cetera. But also correspondingly, we recognize the full revenue, i.e., the price which we're charging to the first
customer.
The impact of Egypt, of this accounting or reporting reflecting this new structure is in the range, at the top line, at the
revenue, in the range of about $200 million. And there is, obviously, the business organic growth, which we are
realizing this year, which is coming on the top of this. This is how much Egypt is pushing or increasing our revenue.
But you also remember, you have an offset in the cost base, when it comes to OCI, the net benefit which we're realizing
due to the structure, is not really inflating the numbers between the two years, but there is organic growth in Egypt.
<Q - Owen M. Bennett>: Okay. Great, thank you.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you.

We have time for one final question today. Your last question comes from the line of Adam Spielman with Citi.
<Q - Adam J. Spielman>: Hello, thank you for taking the question. I hope I can ask a question about 2015 and 2016
because you mentioned this in your press release. In it, you say that you – and reiterate that you hope to achieve 6% to
8% OCI growth, constant currency. But you also mentioned the costs of the expansion of Reduced-Risk Products. And
so the question is, in the context of your entire OCI, is the commercial cost of commercializing Reduced-Risk Products
material? I assume it is and I assume that it's going to be one or two percentage points, otherwise you wouldn't have
bothered mentioning it in your press release? That's my question, thank you.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Yes. I mean you are – good afternoon, Adam. Yes, there is an increased cost of iQOS, which is
already included in our overall target for the next year. Obviously, when we come in February, we'll give the proper
details, guidance for the year. But from the very beginning, we said that we're targeting 6% to 8% adjusted OCI growth
ex-currency in 2015 and 2016 and this number includes the cost, also obviously, in the later part of that period, the
revenue coming from iQOS. So this is all included there and there will be quite the increase or substantial increase of
our spending behind iQOS next year. But this number is included in our target.
<Q - Adam J. Spielman>: Okay. But just to confirm, it is a material amount that is included?
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Yes, but I will not disclose you.
<Q - Adam J. Spielman>: How material? I knew you wouldn't do that, but that's clear. Thank you very much. It's
helpful.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you.
