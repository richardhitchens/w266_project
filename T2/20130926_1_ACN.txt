MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Accenture's Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2013 Earnings
Call. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
I'd now like to turn the conference over to KC McClure, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
K. C. McClure
Thank you, Paul, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2013 earnings
announcement. As Paul just mentioned, I'm KC McClure, Managing Director of Investor Relations. With me today are
Pierre Nanterme, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and David Rowland, our Chief Financial Officer.
We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the
agenda for today's call. Pierre will begin with an overview of our results. David will take you through the financial
details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for both the fourth
quarter and the full year. Pierre will then provide a brief update on our market positioning. David will then provide our
business outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2014, and then we will take your questions before Pierre
provides a wrap up at the end of the call.
As a reminder, when we discuss revenues during today's call, we're talking about revenues before reimbursements or
net revenues.

Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, KC, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We are pleased with our result for the first quarter and full
fiscal year, which demonstrate our ability to continue to drive profitable growth in a volatile and fast changing market
environment.
For the full year, we once again increased market share, drove double-digit EPS growth, and strong free cash flow and
delivered value for our shareholders. David will provide more detail on both the quarter and the year in a moment, but
here are a few highlights for the full year.
We delivered new bookings of $33.3 billion, an all-time high and near the top of our guided range. We generated
revenues of $28.6 billion, a 4% increase in local currency. Fourth quarter revenues of $7.1 billion were above our
guided range and we were pleased with our double-digit growth in Health & Public Service and the improved
performance in both Resources and Communication, Media & Technology.
We delivered earning per share of $4.93. After adjusting to exclude tax and reorganization benefits in the second and
third quarters, earnings per share for the year were $4.21, a 10% increase. We grew operating income and delivered
operating margin of 15.2% for the year. After adjusting to exclude the reorganization benefits, we delivered operating
margin of 14.2%, a 30-basis point expansion for the year, which was in line with our expectations.
We generated free cash flow of $2.9 billion, slightly above our guided range, and we continue to have a very strong
balance sheet ending the year with a cash balance of $5.6 billion. We continued to return cash to shareholders with $3.7
billion in share repurchases and dividend payments during the year. And we just announced a semiannual cash dividend
of $0.93 per share, which is a 15% increase over our prior dividend. In fiscal year 2013, we again benefited from the
diversity of our business from an industry capability and geographic standpoint and made significant investments to
position us well for the future.
Now let me hand over to David. David, over to you.
David P. Rowland
Thank you, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. As I review the results on this afternoon's call, you'll
see that we delivered good results in quarter four starting with continued strong profitability and cash flow, but also
delivering solid improvement in our net revenues with local currency growth of 4.5%.
We saw improvement in revenue growth in quarter four with four of our five operating groups, the Americas and
EMEA posting stronger local currency growth in quarter three. Overall, we continued to increase market share in a
challenging environment while driving our business to deliver on our profitability targets and returning a substantial

portion of our strong cash flow to our shareholders.
Now let's get to the numbers starting with new bookings. New bookings for the quarter were $8.4 billion, resulting in
an all-time high of $33.3 billion in new bookings for the full year, which was also solidly in the upper half of our
business outlook range provided in June. Consulting bookings were $3.8 billion and a book-to-bill of 1.0, consistent
with what we signaled last quarter. Outsourcing bookings were very strong at $4.6 billion and a book-to-bill of 1.4.
Taking a closer look at her new bookings, there's several additional points worth noting. All three components of our
consulting bookings, management consulting, technology consulting and systems integration, were all at the low end of
our book-to-bill range and very similar to our Q3 bookings level. And at the same time, we did see consulting bookings
convert to revenues slightly faster than we expected.
Outsourcing bookings showed continued strength and represented our fourth highest quarter on record. Technology
outsourcing bookings reflect continued strong demand for solutions that drive operational efficiencies and enable
greater business performance, and yielded a book-to-bill of 1.2 for the quarter.
BPO bookings were particularly strong, the second highest quarter ever, and reflected strong market demand for
finance and accounting, procurement, and industry-specific offerings in Financial Services. Lastly, we had bookings
over $100 million at 11 clients giving us a record 44 clients with bookings at this level for the full year, which reflects
our strong position in the marketplace in helping our clients tackle their largest, most complex projects.
Now, turning to revenues. Net revenues for the quarter were $7.1 billion, an increase of 3.7% in U.S. dollars and 4.5%
in local currency, reflecting a foreign exchange impact of approximately negative 1%, which was consistent with the
assumption we provided in June. Quarter four revenues were roughly $90 million above the upper end of our guided
range, primarily driven by stronger than expected consulting revenues. Consulting revenues for the quarter were $3.8
billion, up 2% in U.S. dollars and 3% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $3.3 billion, an increase of 6% in
U.S. dollars and 7% in local currency.
So looking at our how our operating groups contributed to our revenue results for the fourth quarter. H&PS continued
to lead the way with double-digit local currency growth of 13% driven by very significant growth in North America.
We saw balanced growth across Health & Public Service in both consulting and outsourcing. After nine quarters of
double-digit growth, we expect H&PS growth to moderate in the near-term.
Products delivered 6% local currency growth in the quarter, slightly higher than their year-to-date performance,
reflecting broad-based growth across most industries, across consulting and outsourcing and in both the Americas and
EMEA.
Financial Services grew 3% in local currency for the quarter, and as expected, lower than the growth rate in each of the
first three quarters. Growth continues to be driven by strong outsourcing activity reflecting our clients' focus on large
transformation projects. Consulting revenues declined modestly, including lower levels of growth in insurance in the
Americas as several projects are ramping down. Growth this quarter was also impacted by a tough year-over-year
compare. We expect the growth rate in Financial Services to be similar in quarter one.
CMT delivered 2% local currency growth in quarter four, reflecting the improvement we expected, and we're
particularly pleased with the performance in the Americas, especially in electronics and high-tech.
Resources also showed improvement with flat local currency revenue growth in the quarter reflecting some overall
stability in the business. We continue to work hard to reposition the business, especially in North America.
So moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 33.2%, compared to 32.9% for the same
period last year, up approximately 30 basis points. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 12.6% of net
revenues, compared with 12.3% of net revenues for the fourth quarter last year.
General and administrative expense was 6.7% of net revenues, compared with 6.9% of net revenues for the fourth
quarter last year. Operating income was $984 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting a 13.9% operating margin, up 10
basis points compared with quarter four last year.

Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.6%, compared with 32.8% for the fourth quarter last year. This lower rate
in the quarter was primarily due to a lower level of reserve additions and higher benefits related to final determinations
of prior year tax liabilities.
Net income was $727 million for the fourth quarter, and it was $636 million for the same quarter last year, an increase
of 14%. Diluted earnings per share were $1.01, compared with $0.88 in the fourth quarter last year, an increase of
$0.13.
Turning to DSOs, our days services outstanding continue to be industry leading. They were 31 days, up from last
quarter and the 27 days in quarter four last fiscal year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.2 billion, resulting from
cash generated by operating activities of $1.3 billion, net of property and equipment additions of $102 million.
Moving to our level of cash, our cash balance at 8/31 was $5.6 billion, compared with $6.6 billion at 8/31 last year,
which reflects the significant level of cash returned to shareholders, a number of strategic acquisitions this year and our
decision to fund the U.S. pension plan in quarter one.
Moving to some other key operational metrics, we hired approximately 60,000 people in FY 2013, ending the year with
a global head count of about 275,000 people, and we now have over 182,000 people in our Global Delivery Network.
In quarter four, our utilization was 88%, consistent with quarter three. Attrition, which excludes involuntary
terminations, was 12%, in line with quarter three of this year and quarter four of FY 2012.
As it relates to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the fourth quarter, we repurchased or redeemed
14.5 million shares for $1.1 billion at an average share price of $75.57 per share. For the full year, we repurchased or
redeemed 34.4 million shares for $2.5 million at an average price of $74.05 per share.
Earlier today, we announced that our Board of Directors declared a semiannual cash dividend of $0.93 per share. This
dividend will be paid on November 15, and represents a $0.12 per share or 15% increase over the previous semiannual
dividend we declared in March.
So, before I turn things back over to Pierre, let me just briefly summarize where we landed for the full year across the
key elements of our business outlook. Again, new bookings were $33.3 billion, in the upper half of our guided range
for the year.
Net revenues grew 4% in local currency for the full year at the top end of our most recent guided range and just below
the low end of the range provided at the beginning of the year. Even though the second half of the year didn't
materialize as we originally expected, we did grow faster than the market and take share, which is an important
objective for our business.
As a reminder, we had two unusual items that impacted certain full year metrics in fiscal 2013 for which we provided
outlook ranges on both a GAAP and an adjusted basis. So excluding the impact, adjusted operating margin was 14.2%,
within our most recent guided range and a 30 basis point expansion over last year, and very importantly, incorporates a
significant increase in our investments, including acquisitions, as we continue to position the business for future
growth.
Adjusted EPS was $4.21, toward the upper end of our most recent guided range and 10% growth over fiscal 2012. Free
cash flow was just over $2.9 billion, slightly above the upper end of our previously guided range.
Finally, we returned $3.7 billion of cash to shareholders, approximately $400 million above our initial objective
through $2.5 billion in share repurchases and $1.1 billion in dividend payments we made during the fiscal year. In
addition, we reduced our weighted average diluted shares outstanding by about 2%.
So all in all, in a market that grew less than we expected, our results continued to reflect rigor and discipline in the way
we manage and drive our business. Once again, we've proven our ability to adapt our business as the environment
evolves and to deliver results which overall were very much aligned to the outlook that we said at the start of the fiscal
year.

Back to you, Pierre.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, David. In a fast changing market environment, we continue to execute our growth strategy in a highly
focused and disciplined way. We are providing differentiated services across the full spectrum of our capabilities that
are resonating with the needs of our clients. We continue to invest in our industry and technology capabilities to further
differentiate Accenture in the marketplace, particularly in areas that will help us capture new ways of growth such as
digital marketing, mobility, analytics, and cloud.
In fiscal year 2013, we made significant investments, including $800 million in acquisitions to enhance our ability to
help clients compete in the new digital world. We are helping a leading European retailer enhance its customer
experience by combining our capabilities in retail and Accenture Interactive, including our recent Fjord acquisition, as
well as mobility and analytics. We are delivering seamless integration across all channels, including the client's 750
store locations.
In Belgium, we are working with Belgacom, the country's largest telecommunications company, and BNP Paribas
Fortis to create the country's first mobile wallet. When fully deployed, the new solution, which is based on the
Accenture mobility platform, will enable secure shopping and payments via smartphone.
We also continue to invest in new and innovative and to win business services that leverage our industry skills and
combine our capabilities across management consulting, technology, and business process outsourcing to deliver
tangible outcomes for our clients.
In banking, we are strengthening our capabilities in Accenture Credit Services through two recent acquisitions. In Q4,
we acquired Mortgage Cadence in the U.S., adding an advanced loan origination software platform. And just last week,
we acquired a majority stake in Vivere Brasil, a leading mortgage processing technology company in the rapidly
developing Brazilian mortgage market.
In capital markets, we created Accenture Post-Trade Processing, a new business service, to provide clearing and
settlement of equities and bonds for investment banks. This service, which is priced by the transaction, should help
clients cut their securities processing costs by about 30%. We are already working with our first client, Société
Générale, and have similar others in the pipeline.
And in the hospitality industry, we launched Accenture Hospitality Services to capture the growth opportunities we see
in providing finance accounting and related services to hospitality companies. We are working with our first client,
Marriott, and their franchise hotel owners to deliver significant cost savings.
At the same time we invest in innovative business services, we remain extremely focused on supporting our clients in
their large scale transformation programs as demonstrated by our 11 bookings over $100 million in Q4, which you
heard David mentioned. Our clients continue to focus on driving more productivity and effectiveness in their
operations, and this is generating demand for our core services.
We are in the early stages of helping global agribusiness company with 30,000 employees transform its business to an
ERP implementation across 140 countries. We will help and answer clients' efficiency and decision-making supporting
its global expansion plans.
And we are working with Vodafone on a major IT transformation based on an integrated global ERP solution from
SAP, as well as cutting-edge technology for mobility and analytics. More than 85,000 employees across 20 operating
companies are now live on the platform. Vodafone is benefited from more transparent information and standardized
processes that will improve reporting, drive better decision-making, and enhance risk management. And just this
morning, we announced an IT collaboration with Telenor, a leading global telecommunications provider to manage the
development and maintenance of IT systems with the mobile value chain.

From a deal geographic standpoint, needless to say, we are living in an interesting world. A year ago, the big questions
were around Europe and the sovereign debt issue. It now seems that Europe is stabilizing and even showing some early
signs of improvement. And today, the question is around the emerging markets where we are seeing more volatility. In
that context, the geographic diversity of our business continues to serve us well as we have a significant footprint in
most of the major markets in the world.
Looking at the United States, our largest market, I couldn't be more pleased with our performance. We again delivered
double-digit revenue growth in the U.S. for both the quarter and the full year, and we increased our market share. In our
priority in emerging markets, for the full year, we continue to grow at a faster rate than Accenture overall. That said, it
was a challenging year for our business in Brazil and we expect to see stronger growth in fiscal year 2014. At the same
time, we were very pleased to see continued strong double-digit revenue growth for the year in China, India, the Middle
East, and Mexico.
In closing, at the time where volatility and uncertainty are still the name of the game, we continue to focus on driving
our own competitiveness applying rigor and discipline across the board to increase our efficiency and expand our
margins and this is giving us the capacity to invest in the business to continue to capture new ways of growth.
Before I hand back to David, I want to thank our people at Accenture for their significant contribution to our fiscal year
results. Our people are extraordinarily committed to the success of clients and bring their unique knowledge and
capabilities to their work every day.
And with that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our fiscal year 2014 business outlook. David, over to you.
David P. Rowland
Thanks, Pierre. Before I provide our business outlook, let me share some thoughts on how we see the overall
environment and the implications on our view of fiscal 2014. For the past four to five quarters, it's clear that our
addressable market has been in a cycle of lower growth and this has certainly impacted our growth. As we look
forward, we think it's likely that our overall market conditions won't change much in the near term. In other words, it
will be more of the same. Regardless of how the market evolves, we are driving our business throughout this cycle to
grow faster than the market.
Turning now to our business outlook. For the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we expect the revenues to be in the range of
$7 billion to $7.3 billion. This assumes a foreign exchange impact of approximately negative 2% compared to the first
quarter in fiscal 2013. For the full fiscal year 2014, based upon how the rates have been trending over the last few
weeks, we currently assume the impact of foreign exchange on our results in U.S. dollars to be negative 1% compared
to fiscal 2013.
For the full fiscal year 2014, we expect Accenture's net revenue to be in the range of 2% to 6% growth in local
currency over fiscal 2013. For the full fiscal year 2014, we're targeting new bookings to be in the range of $32 billion
to $35 billion. And in consulting, we expect quarter one bookings to be similar to the last two quarters.
For operating margin, we expect fiscal year 2014 to be in the range of 14.3% to 14.5%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion
over adjusted fiscal 2013 results. We expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 26.5% to 27.5%.
For earnings per share, we expect full year diluted EPS for fiscal 2014 to be in the range of $4.42 to $4.54 or 5% to 8%
increase over adjusted fiscal 2013 results.
Now turning to cash flow, for the full fiscal 2014, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $3.6 billion to
$3.9 billion. Property and equipment additions to be approximately $400 million and free cash flow to be in the range
of $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion.
Finally, we expect to return at least $3.7 billion through dividends and share repurchases, and also expect to reduce the
weighted average diluted shares outstanding by approximately 2% as we remain committed to returning a substantial
portion of our cash to our shareholders.

With that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. KC?
K. C. McClure
Thanks, David. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as
possible to ask questions. Paul, would you provide instructions for those on the call?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein, please go ahead.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: Okay, guys. So your revenue growth took a step in the right direction in the August quarter,
but bookings were down year-over-year and consulting and outsourcing, and your fiscal 2014 bookings guidance calls
for flattish bookings versus fiscal 2013.
So overall, are you seeing overall stable to improved demand trends as implied by the August quarter revenue growth
results? And if you are seeing overall stable to improved demand, is this not showing up in recent and projected
bookings due to a drop in duration or some other factor in your outlook?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Rod, I'll start with a few comments and then I'm sure Pierre will have a few things to add.
You know, in terms of the demand environment, one key measure we look at is our opportunity pipeline and we have
seen good expansion in our opportunity pipeline across most aspects of our business over the last 90 days during the
fourth quarter and that is indicative of the level of client discussions that are taking place and the way our services and
offerings are resonating in the marketplace.
So we do feel good about our pipeline and we think it's well positioned for what it needs to be to support the revenue
range next year. As it relates to the bookings, the bookings, we triangulate with our revenue growth based on what we
believe we need from a book-to-bill standpoint, our conversion assumptions, et cetera, and we believe that the
book-to-bill range that we guided to will support the revenue.
On the consulting side, while we feel good about our pipeline overall, at this point in time it is a little bit more early
stage. And for that reason we see quarter one consulting bookings being pretty consistent with what we've seen the last
two quarters, but yet we feel very good about the pipeline overall. It just has that early stage characteristic at this point
in time.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes. Just to add, I must say I like the way you've been framing that, Rod, which is indeed, I
think, the demand is I would characterize as stable with some pockets of improvement here and there and by and large
we're pleased with our pipeline and the way it's shaping, but the overall demand I would characterize as stable plus, if
you will.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, can you specify at least roughly how does your fiscal
2014 revenue growth guidance breakdown between the consulting and the outsourcing business? And also, is your
revenue growth in fiscal 2014 more likely to be stronger in the first half of the year or the second half the year or are
you assuming it's reasonably level loaded across the year?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah. Rod, in terms of the breakout, we are – we believe outsourcing will be in the mid to
high single-digit positive. On the consulting side, anchoring to the 2% to 6% range, we see that on the low end as being
flattish to low single-digit positive. And in terms of the revenue phasing, we do see our revenue building as we go
through the year coming off the range that we guided to for quarter one and then building from there.

There are a couple of our operating groups in particular that for different circumstances are going to have lower growth
in quarter one, Financial Services being one and Health & Public Service being the other. I believe I called both of
those out in the script, but yet those are two operating groups that we feel very good about the positioning of the
business, the pipeline, their contracted revenues and we're very optimistic that their growth will be much stronger as
they progress through the year.
<Q - Rod M. Bourgeois>: Excellent. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan, please go ahead.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Great. Thanks. Just to build on your last, those last comments there, David, just trying to
better understand Q1, I heard the FS and the Health & Public sector. You exited the year, what, 4.5%, low end is down
2%. Is it really just those two segments that might push you negative there? Because we maybe argue that some of the
revenue converted a little bit faster and pulled forward some revenue into 4Q? Just trying to better understand how
much of that down 2% on the low end is conservative versus some specific issues if that makes sense?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, I think, Tien-tsin, you know that again, I think you hit the nail on the head again. The
situation we find ourselves in quarter one is that we do have this cycle, this short-term cycle that H&PS and FS are
going through, whereas prior to quarter four, they were contributing at a very high rate relative to our overall growth.
We also have Resources and CMT, which improved in the fourth quarter, and we feel good about how those businesses
are moving along to return to positive growth. We think both of those operating groups will be positive for the year, but
yet as we look at quarter one, they're still very much working their way back up to where they want the business to be
and where we want the business to be.
So really, quarter one is just a reflection of H&PS and FS going through this period of lower growth and then given
some allowance for the fact that CMT and Resources are continuing to build, but we've got a little ways to go.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Got it. Okay. So got that in 1Q and then jumping into 2Q is always a little bit tricky, but it
sounds like the second half implied guidance should be relatively strong. I guess my follow-up – there's no question
there. My follow-up I guess I'll ask acquisition-wise.
Did you give roughly how much some of these acquisitions could contribute to fiscal 2014 top line? And then just
generally speaking, there's been a lot more chatter, Pierre, about acquisitions that Accenture might be pursuing. I know
Booz & Co. has come up a bunch. Can you comment on that in general just your appetite for larger acquisitions?
Thanks.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah. Tien-tsin, I'll just comment briefly. In terms of the contribution to the top line, it's still
roughly in that 1% range. And I'll pass it over to Pierre, and he will certainly want to add some thoughts on acquisitions
in general.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes. Thanks, Tien-tsin, for the question. Indeed, we are executing our strategy against what
we always shared with you from an acquisition standpoint. Our strategy in term of acquisition and the final trajectory
was to deploy around 15% of our free cash flow (sic) [operating cash flow] around acquisition, and we've always been
clear that it might be a little bit more or a little bit less depending on the opportunities in the marketplace and how
attractive they might be for us to invest for the future.
It happened that this year indeed we found pretty attractive opportunities in the marketplace and we deployed in the
range of $800 million. So this is consistent with our strategy, and indeed, moving forward, we will continue to execute
these targeted strategic acquisitions deploying around 15% of our free cash flow (sic) [operating cash flow]. We have
the cash to deploy a little bit more and of course, we're going to look at the good opportunity for us and for our
shareholders to invest wisely.

<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Understood. Thank you. Good revenues this quarter.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Thank you.
Operator
David Grossman of Stifel, please go ahead.
<Q - David M. Grossman>: Thank you. Last couple of quarters you talked about bookings conversion rates and the
absence of some the smaller quick turn types of projects negatively impacting revenue growth and now it seems like
you've seen a little bit of an improvement and that's changed a little bit this quarter.
But that said, your assumptions around consulting growth remain relatively cautious it seems for fiscal 2014. Can you
help us better understand what you're seeing in the market and what is the typical lag between better economic growth
and improvement in these metrics?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah. I'll make a few comments on that and Pierre may want to make some comments as
well. But in terms of this whole conversion point, interestingly, we did see slightly better conversion in the fourth
quarter than we expected and that contributed to the revenue growth, the uptick in consulting revenue growth in the
quarter.
It's interesting to point out that that was not because of an uptick in the smaller deals. The smaller deals were relatively
stable from a volume standpoint. And for the market that is there, we feel like we're winning our fair share, but we
really aren't seeing any uptick at least in the fourth quarter in the smaller deals.
So it was really a situation where the deals in the $10 million to $50 million range, the characteristics of those deals
were such that they just converted faster in the quarter, and that is everything from the timing of when the contracts
were signed in the quarter to how quickly we were able to staff the jobs and get into revenue generation mode, to also
just the characteristics of the work we sold. And so we continue to watch this conversion very carefully. We think
we've accounted for that appropriately in our FY 2014 guidance.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Nothing to add. Perfect.
<Q - David M. Grossman>: Okay. Thanks for that. And then secondly just looking at the changes going on at
Microsoft and Nokia, I know you're recognizing you're close to both those companies. Does the sale of the handset
business to Microsoft at all change the relationship with Nokia? And are there any specific headwinds or tailwinds that
we should think about over the next several months as that deal takes shape?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: No. I mean, the simple answer is going to be no. I mean, we do not expect any impact on our
business.

us some sense on what your competitive landscape or pricing or any other factors are, something to think about?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes. Again, and maybe you're going to hear a lot of that word in our answers, it's stable. I
don't think we've seen any change. We are in a very competitive market. We are competing against all the classic

incumbent, the companies from India and you know that very well. I don't think there's been any change from a pricing
standpoint. I would probably state that pricing is stable on balance. So again, no material change in that front.
So we are in a very competitive market, and for us, again, the name of the game is to concentrate on us, on Accenture,
and to make the company more competitive to as David mentioned before to win in the marketplace, having winning
more than our fair share and gaining market share, and this is what happened in fiscal year 2013.
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: Got it.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: It is competitive, but we're fighting to win.
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: Got it. Understood. And then just on the follow up, just some thoughts around head count.
Headcount growth for this quarter including acquisitions looks like it's a little bit light and then any thoughts for fiscal
2014 gross head count adds?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah. So we hired about 60,000 people this past year. We had our normal higher level of
new hires hitting the book so to speak in the fourth quarter. We will hire, let me say, at least 50,000 people in fiscal
2014. Supply management is a top priority for us always. I think we are very effective in terms of managing the supply
demand equation, and we will adjust the hiring as we need to as we progress through the year to meet demand and
continue to operate at very high utilization levels.
<Q - Julio C. Quinteros>: Got it. Thank you.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Thank you.
Operator
Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley, please go ahead.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Yeah. Thanks. The revenue guidance range this year is a point wider than fiscal 2013, which
implies some uncertainty. And if you back out the one point of acquisitions, the range sends a very different message at
the low end with sort of flattish growth versus at the high end more mid single-digit growth. So can you talk about what
some of the biggest swing factors are that would land you at the low end of the range versus the factors that could get
you to the upper end?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah. In terms of the range being wider, it really doesn't have anything to do with
confidence as much as it does, as much as it reflects the process that we go through every year to look at the size of our
range as our business grows and as our business gets just more complex. And so we have this discussion annually.
There have actually been a few years in the past where we considered expanding to four percentage points, but this
year, finally, as our business has gotten to the size that we are and as we are complex across so many different
industries, geographies, et cetera, that range, we think, serves the business and, really, our shareholders the best in
terms of giving good transparency to where we think we can land.
In terms of how we think about either end of the range, I think I would describe that in the context of our five operating
groups. What we see broadly as you look at the year is we see H&PS and Financial Services, as I said earlier, starting
the year with lower growth but then building through the year to having very strong growth as they progress through
the year.
We see Products continuing to produce at very good levels on a stable basis. And we see Resources and CMT
continuing to build to be positive growth overall for our fiscal 2014. Now, where we land in that range of 2% to 6% is
going to depend on the degree to which each of those things happens. But that is our model in terms of how we would
rack and stack the operating groups and how we view their growth trajectory for the year.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Okay. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up, you mentioned that Europe seems to have maybe
turned the corner. Curious whether some of those ERP deals that didn't convert to revenue as fast as expected last

quarter in Southern Europe, whether that environment improved or whether it was more northern Europe.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes. I'm going to pick up, of course, Europe, I guess. Overall, my assessment on the situation
is Europe is stable with hopefully early sign of improvement, but you know the overall economic condition probably all
Europe been moving from a slight recession to a slight growth being more or less the same plus.
And indeed, what we've seen in Q4 but we will need to wait for Q1 to see whether it's going to be sustainable, is
improvement in our growth in Europe and especially in countries, important countries such as Germany, Italy, the
Netherlands and France. And indeed, I mentioned our recent win that we announced this morning with Telenor, another
European company.
I mentioned Vodafone; again, very well known European company. So I will not declare victory in Europe given the
complexity of that continent until the challenges which are not been dealt with in term of sovereign debt growth
competitiveness, but definitely Europe sounds more stable with early signs of improvement.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: And was ERP specifically part of that improvement or not necessarily?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: I would say not necessarily. I mean some ERP sales are lumpy, it happened that we had a few
this quarter. Overall, as we stated before, continued strong demand for outsourcing and BPO, because many of the
European companies are still focusing on improving their competitiveness and addressing their productivity and cost
efficiency and lower growth if you will in consulting. So pretty similar to the patterns we already highlighted prior in
the year.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Okay. Okay.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Thank you.
Operator
Bryan Keane, Deutsche Bank, please go ahead.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Hi. Just wanted to follow up on that. How is overall your ERP demand and there's always a lot
of questions about how cloud is impacting services, so just curious to your thoughts on if it's impacting your ERP
business at all?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: I would not make a direct correlation between the cloud and ERP. When you look at ERP, the
fact of the matter is we've been through a cycle of very strong activity around ERP these last years and been a kind of
wave. The reality is and probably given the overall economic conditions and some softness in the investment from our
clients, this recent cycle being of lower growth around ERP. Now that being said, it's not true across the board, it's not
true across all the industries and it's not true all the geographies. That's why I will not mention any secular trend around
the end of the era of ERP, because there's going to be a new era of the cloud.
Again, we've seen strong ERP activities in some of our verticals, because there will always be a need for a very strong
backbone to run the operation from a finance standpoint and from an HR standpoint, from the procurement standpoint
and from a supply chain standpoint. That is going to move from one country to another and from one industry to
another and I think this is what it is. I would say that that's more cyclical than secular.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Okay. Okay. And then just one question for David. When I look at consulting, it did 3%
constant currency this quarter and demand environment I think you guys are staying stable to positive and we're
hearing signs of enterprise spending generally getting better but consulting guidance for the full year, I think you said
constant currency flat to low single digits, which is almost a decline from the fourth quarter. I heard your comments on
the first quarter, but I guess I'm surprised that there's no pick up in consulting kind of throughout the fiscal year so I just
want to make sure I understand why that is.

<A - David P. Rowland>: Well, again, I think we are influenced by what we have seen really for the last four or five
quarters now in the consulting space and we were pleased with what we saw in quarter four, but yet one quarter doesn't
make a trend. So in many ways, it's been – it's more of the same. We see some green shoots, we see some areas of
potential strength, we see a pipeline but yet the market environment is such that it is not yet translated itself into a
sustained upward trajectory of growth. And so when we see that, we'll call it as we see it, but at this point, we need to
string together a couple of three quarters of seeing that before we could declare that as a trend and then factor that into
our guidance.

Moshe Katri of Cowen, please go ahead.
<Q - Moshe Katri>: Thanks. You spoke a bit about Brazil, but you didn't say much about Japan. I believe, if I
remember, Japan's high-tech vertical was weak last quarter. Can you kind of elaborate on that?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes. So let me comment on [ph] the panel (47:12). So just starting by saying that I'm pleased
with the overall performance of the...
<A - David P. Rowland>: He asked about Japan.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: About Japan? Sorry, sorry. Okay. Japan. When you look about Japan, indeed, we mentioned
last quarter that we were challenged with the EHT activity in Japan, and again it's more or less the same. We're working
hard in Japan and I'm pleased to report that we have some recent bookings that are giving us more optimism that Japan
might turn the corner and get back to the kind of growth we might expect from that country.
Now probably Japan is not totally out of the woods. We are still challenged, especially in the vertical you're
mentioning, but it's interesting to see that this is exactly in that vertical that we're starting to see some opportunities and
some of our recent bookings. So not yet there, but clearly sign of improvements.
<Q - Moshe Katri>: Okay. As a follow-up, on the outsourcing, as you said your book-to-bill looks very reasonable,
very strong actually. Any comment on conversion rates, conversion bookings there or conversion rates in general, is
there a change, is that accretive, or it's kind of the same? Thanks.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, we really haven't seen any notable change in the conversion rates on the outsourcing
side.

Joseph Foresi of Janney Montgomery, please go ahead.
<Q - Joseph D. Foresi>: Hi. I was wondering if you could talk about the moderation you're calling out in Financial
Services and Healthcare. How much is that cyclicality versus large projects? And how should we think about that? I
know you've talked about the ramp throughout the year, but how we should think about that in a more macro way?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yeah. Let me pick that one at the macro level, if you will. I think for HPS and Financial
Services, I don't think there is, again, something structural. I think here we had some very, I would say, classic and
cyclical situation. The two verticals have been doing very well, of course, on back of some strong and large program,
which is very typical at Accenture.

It happened that some of these large programs are naturally coming to an end and they need to be replenished and that's
happening on a regular basis in our business. It happened that for both HPS and Financial Services, we have this impact
in Q1, and so we mentioned this moderation of the growth. But in both of those three verticals, Health, Public Sector,
and Financial Services, we are pleased with the level of pipeline as we can see it and we are confident they're going to
build again moving forward in the next part of the year.
<Q - Joseph D. Foresi>: Okay. And my second question, I think this is a number of consecutive quarters where we've
seen BPO have record bookings. Is it fair to say that you're seeing a shift away from those ERP projects to either new
technology and outsourcing work? And if so, if that's a permanent shift, can we expect that bookings conversion rate to
trend lower over a longer period of time?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: I will comment overall on the BPO and let David commenting on the rest. BPO is doing very
well and we are doing very well in BPO, so I'm pleased to have the opportunity to acknowledge our people and our
leader driving the BPO business. Why? I mean, first, there is a natural demand on BPO for the reasons of cost
management, productivity and efficiency, and of course, businesses process outsourcing is a good response.
But what's different with the BPO at Accenture? We invested a lot in BPO, first, and invested to create innovative
services with a lot of analytics inside, what we're calling BPO generation four or five. But forget about the generation.
Just to mention that we are investing in bringing more capabilities and more innovation out of our BPO.
So there is a strong demand. We have differentiated solutions and services and indeed, we invested as well through our
acquisitions, as I mentioned before, because we believe it's a very good solution for our clients. So very pleased with
where we are with BPO and we believe there is a sustainable pattern here.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah. And we really haven't seen any structural change in the book-to-bill ratios or the
conversion rates. I mean, we do have, I guess, to Pierre's point, we do increasingly integrate a lot of classic consulting
type services with these BPO offerings, and that's a key point of distinction for us. But yet, we really haven't seen any
structural change overall in the book-to-bills, conversion rates, et cetera.
<Q - Joseph D. Foresi>: Thank you.

David Koning of Baird, please go ahead.
<Q - David J. Koning>: Yeah. Hey, guys.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Hi, David.
<Q - David J. Koning>: Yeah. In just looking at free cash flow historically we go back and it had been about 20% to
50% above EPS for many years in a row and last year it was maybe 10% above EPS, and then this year it looks like
you're guiding to in line to maybe up to 10% above earnings. So I'm just wondering, is there maybe a little change
maybe even how you issue share based comp or maybe why has free cash flow that range kind of narrowed?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah. There really hasn't been any change and if anything through the years, our DSOs, at
least until recently, they've been pretty steady at the current levels. But through the years, if you think about where we
were originally as a public company and where we are now, our DSOs have actually gotten progressively better. So
frankly, I'll have to give some thought to your question and look at that, but I can't. I certainly couldn't put my finger on
any structural change as you're implying, but I can give that some thought.
<Q - David J. Koning>: Okay. No, that's great. And just I guess as a follow-up, if we look back very long term, you
guys have outside of recessions generally grown somewhere around 10% or so top line and I know now last year-this
year it's feeling a little more like low to mid single digit growth. Is part of that just the moving into I guess more
penetration of IT that maybe we're just in a lower growth period now for a sustained period or do you think you can get
back to more of that normalized 10% growth over some period of time?

<A - David P. Rowland>: Well, I think that as I had mentioned in some of my comments, where we find ourselves
right now is that we have been in a certainly in a four quarter to five quarter period of just lower growth in our
addressable market. And I mean not to get into this too deeply, but when we talk about our addressable market and it's
the same approach we take for looking at market share, is we take this very fragmented market space that we're in and
we've chosen carefully thoughtfully 40 some odd companies that we think represent really the market that we're in, and
we track the actual growth of that market defined in that way.
And then we look at our performance against that, and if you look at that market, the addressable market as we describe
it, that market has grown 2% to 2.5% probably on average if you go over the last four to five quarters. And what we're
in right now is no different than cycles that we've been in, many other cycles, where when you hit a period of low
growth in our addressable market, even though we take share, the math is such that even taking share, our growth is
going to be lower. And I think what you and we think about is how much the market will grow when we come out of
this cycle, and then of course, when it returns to stronger growth, we'll continue to do what we do which is take share in
a stronger market.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yeah. And to build on that and we're just looking at the numbers. If you look in the prior
2008, the global economic growth within the range of 5%-ish. If you look at these last couple of years, the global
economic growth within the range of 2%-ish. And at the end of the day, the addressable market is somewhat correlated
to the global economic growth. I mean that's a kind of natural correlation at some point in time.
So the reality is that today we are in a world growing at 2%. And as mentioned by David, the addressable market, the
way we define has been growing in that range. So we are executing against our commitment, which is anyway to grow
more than the market, and then deliver value to our clients and shareholders. But the world has changed.

Ashwin Shirvaikar of Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ashwin Shirvaikar>: Thank you. So I want to go back to the M&A question. And so if you spent, let's call it
$800 million roughly to gain say about $300 million of revenue contribution which is about 1%, that's a pretty good
sized revenue multiple. So from a strategic viewpoint, what is it that these acquisitions bring you that you like so
much? If you can explain on that and then I have a follow-up.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes, absolutely. What we like so much is the differentiation, the positioning, and the future
growth they're going to bring to Accenture. And first, if you want to buy good companies, you need to pay for it. This
is as simple as this. You do not have so many good companies in the marketplace. So you need prepare to pay for the
quality.
And second, we are concentrating our acquisitions in companies with differentiated assets and not only with people,
and companies where you will find differentiated assets and solutions, and so proprietary IP, do have a multiple, which
is higher than the pure people-based kind of company.
So we are always very thoughtful that we are paying the right price; that we are looking to pay the right price for right
quality as well, and the companies we acquired are very good in the context of BPO, in the context of digital marketing.
You know the names. And we are very pleased with the returns so far and we believe that indeed they are bringing
differentiated solution and assets that's going to position very well Accenture for the future.
<Q - Ashwin Shirvaikar>: Understood. And then sort of a similar question on the ERP side, one question I get a lot
from investors is how big is the ERP dependency for Accenture, specifically with regards to such things as license
growth at partners like SAP and Oracle versus how much of that ERP work is long-tail work like maintenance? If you

could help us on that, it would be great. Thanks.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: I mean, we're managing a highly diverse portfolio of business. So of course, ERPs are
important and they are important for all the industry. It's the backbone of a lot of things our clients are doing in IT to
build system, and then in driving maintenance and so forth. But again, we are a very highly diversified company. We
are doing ERP, and we are doing a lot of other things in our portfolio of business.
I'm thinking about what I mentioned in digital marketing, in mobility the way [ph] it steadied (59:30) around the

mention many other activities. So yes, ERP are important, and yes, we are not dependent only on ERP given our

volatility, and how that's affecting demand patterns in consulting and outsourcing?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: I mean, frankly, the one with the highest volatility, and probably caught us by surprise to be
honest, will be Brazil. We had very strong growth over many years. Brazil was, as you all know, a place where many of
our clients have been investing for quite a long time. And what happened in Brazil probably caught our clients and
ourself a little bit by surprise with what's happened now.
But I think that it's going to come back because when you look at the fundamentals of Brazil, they are still very strong.
They have the population, they have the middle class, they have as well natural resources. So the fundamentals are
there. They just need probably to get to some level of consolidation, put our act together from a political and
economical standpoint, and then the growth will come back in Brazil.
For the rest, frankly, I'm very pleased with one country, which is very important for Accenture, but going to be very
extremely important to the future, is China. I mean, China is going to be the second largest economy in the world. We
all know how strong is China, and frankly, double-digit growth in China this last quarter, not to mention this last couple
of years, I'm extremely pleased with what's happening.
So for the rest, we might see a little bit more maybe volatility, if you will, in countries such as South Africa. I think it
might happen in countries such as Russia as well for all sorts of reasons we might all understand. But what's important
for us is to have some critical anchor countries where we are putting some significant level of investment, leadership
and attention. And for us, clearly China is extremely important for the future of Accenture.
<Q - David M. Togut>: And then, any thoughts on consulting versus outsourcing in the largest emerging markets in
terms of growth and demand trends?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes, I mean, good question. Because clearly in the metro markets today, you have a bias
towards cost productivity, still efficiency, for all sort of reasons we know. Low economic growth, so company to be
more competitive, you need to be extremely mindful regarding your costs. And so you have this consequence around
outsourcing and BPO being more in demand than consulting in that cycle.
If you move to the emerging markets, they're still in an environment, but you need to build capabilities and such a
surprise we see some ERP work or build work or consulting work, for instance in countries such as China, where you

will see probably more consulting than outsourcing in countries such as China.
So it's probably fair, indeed, David, to quote that in emerging markets, it's going to be more skewed towards consulting
versus outsourcing, and in metro markets, it's going be the other way around. Again, that's why I couldn't be more
pleased, if you will, with diversified portfolio of business, because at the end of the day, we have the opportunity to
balance our portfolio from a consulting to outsourcing going from mature to emerging markets from a multiple industry
standpoint, and I think this is a recipe to make Accenture resilient in the cycle.
