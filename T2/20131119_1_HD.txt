Before I turn the call over to Frank, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our
executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our
expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors identified in the
release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Today's presentations also include certain non-GAAP measurements. Reconciliation of these measurements is included
in the release and is provided on our website.
Now let me turn the call over to Frank Blake.
Francis S. Blake
Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the third quarter were $19.5 billion, up 7.4% from last year.
Comp sales were positive 7.4% and our diluted earnings per share were $0.95. Our U.S. stores had a positive comp of
8.2%.
From a geographic perspective, sales were strong across the U.S. All of our U.S. regions posted positive comps in the
quarter as did 39 of our top 40 markets. The only exception was New Orleans, which anniversaried the impact of
Hurricane Isaac from last year. Our Mid-South, Southeast, and Pacific North regions had our strongest comp
performance with double-digit gains.
During the quarter we saw strong growth in both transactions and ticket. We have now had ten consecutive quarters of
transaction and ticket growth, which we view as an encouraging sign of the balance in the growth of our business. We
were also able to achieve operational improvement across key elements of our business with improvement in inventory
turns, shrink performance and continued expense leverage.
On merchandising, as Craig will detail, the core categories of the store were solid and we saw strength in larger ticket
categories, such as appliances and countertops. Project-based categories, such as tile and vanities, performed well and
our Services business grew double digits.
The recovery of our Pro business continues. In the third quarter, our Pro business grew at a slightly faster pace than our
Consumer business. In addition to sales from our Pro customers, we also track whether we're drawing an increased
number of pros. We household our customer data looking at unique customers and account numbers and we've seen a
steady year-over-year increase in the Pro segment. During the quarter we launched our first version of a mobile app for
our Pro customers. The app enables pros to see multiple stores' inventory at one time, provides them direct access to
our Pro desks, tracks receipts and provides other functionality that can help pros better manage their businesses. We
will continue to upgrade and improve the app and are already ahead of our plan on downloads.
We also continued to enhance our website and consumer mobile presence. During the quarter we added enhanced
communication for order delivery, refreshed category pages, simplified the checkout process and invested across
interconnected retail to improve the customer experience. Both traffic to the site and our conversion rate grew double
digits in the quarter. Sales from our online channels, including those picked up in our stores, were up over 50% and are
now approximately 3% of our total sales.
Marvin and his team rolled out new First training, focused specifically on the interconnected experience in our stores.
We know that our customers are expecting a simple and easy experience shopping online and in our stores and in the
intersection between the two. That has required new training for our associates as well as technological improvements.
For example, during the quarter we enabled our First Phones to be able to process, buy online and pick up in store, or
BOPIS, and buy online and ship to store, or BOSS, orders. Previously, an associate would have to go to a terminal for
this activity, adding time to the customers' visits and complexity to our process. Now with the First Phone, our
associates can close the transaction immediately from wherever they are in the store. The training and additional
technology have led to a significant improvement in our interconnected customer service. We separately track customer
satisfaction scores on BOPIS and BOSS orders. Those scores have shown a marked improvement over the quarter and

we will continue to refine and improve this process.
On the international front, our Mexican business positively comped for the quarter. That makes 40 quarters in a row or
ten years of quarter-over-quarter positive comp growth for our Mexican business, a great achievement. Our Canadian
business had positive comps for the eighth quarter in a row.
As Carol will discuss in more detail, we are updating our sales and earnings guidance for the year based on our third
quarter outperformance versus our plan and a somewhat more favorable outlook for the remainder of the year. We still
face several headwinds in the fourth quarter, particularly the storm-related sales from last year. But the housing market
continues to be a positive. Private fixed residential investment, or PFRI, as a percent of GDP improved again this past
quarter to 3.2%. But it remains well below the 60-year average of approximately 4.6%.
Let me close by thanking our associates for their hard work and dedication throughout the quarter and for their ongoing
efforts to assist those in need as the results of the tornado that hit the Midwest this past weekend. Based on this
quarter's results, almost 100% of our stores will qualify for Success Sharing, our profit sharing program for our hourly
associates. We're proud of that result and plan on carrying that forward into the fourth quarter.
With that, let me turn the call over to Craig.
Craig A. Menear
Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone.
We are pleased with our performance in the third quarter, as sales exceeded our expectations. Strength in the core of the
store, the continued resurgence of our Pro customers, and mild temperatures helped us overcome difficult comparisons
cycling last year's storm-related sales. All merchandising departments posted positive comps. Kitchens, lighting, décor,
lumber, electrical, indoor garden, paint, and bath were above the company average. Millwork, flooring, plumbing,
outdoor garden, building materials, hardware, and tools performed positively but were below the company average.
In the core of the store, maintenance and repair categories saw continued positive comp performance in products like
ladders, light bulbs, air circulation, wiring devices, pipes and fittings, fasteners, and builders hardware. There was also
strength in décor, with comps above the company average in categories such as lighting, countertops, floor and wall
tile, window coverings, faucets, vanities, fixtures, and special-order carpet.
At the end of the third quarter we had approximately 400 stores with our enhanced appliance showroom, a reset that we
began last year. Using localization tools in these stores that have various footprints, we optimized the space between
our kitchen and appliance showrooms and showcased our expanded assortment. This expanded assortment is also
available online. And as a result, we experienced double-digit growth for appliances both in-store and online in the
third quarter.
As Frank mentioned, Pro customer sales continued to gain strength. And while pros shop across the store, we saw
double-digit comp growth in categories such as gypsum, concrete, pressure-treated lumber, and moldings.
Mild weather throughout much of the quarter and across the country continued to drive sales in our exterior project
categories. For example, sales in exterior stains and water sealers, pressure washers, and exterior paint all posted comps
above the company average. Our Labor Day and fall cleanup events provided great values and were well received by
our customers, resulting in solid comps in grills, storage, and soils and mulches.
Total transactions grew by 4% while average ticket increased 3.2% for the quarter. Our average ticket increase was
positively impacted somewhat by commodity price inflation from products such as lumber and copper. The total impact
to comp growth from commodity inflation was approximately 45 basis points. Transactions for tickets under $50,
representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 3.1% for the third quarter. Transactions for tickets over
$900, also representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 10.3% in the third quarter. The drivers behind
the increase in big-ticket purchases were continued strength in our Pro business, appliances, HVAC, countertops, and
in-stock kitchens.

Now let me turn our attention to the fourth quarter. Our strategy of partnering with our suppliers for exclusive launches
of new and innovative products continues to gain traction. During the fourth quarter, we're excited about the launch of
the Nest Protect smoke and carbon monoxide detector. Its alarm quiets down when you wave your hand at it and sends
a message to your phone if the alarm goes off or batteries run low. Instead of just chirping at you, it speaks with a
human voice and gives a friendly heads-up before burning toast can turn into an emergency.
We're also introducing new technology in door locks with the Kevo Bluetooth deadbolt from Kwikset. With Kevo, your
smartphone is your key. You can share keys with visitors, monitor lock activity, and delete or disable access, all from a
mobile app.
Finally, there's innovation in lighting with Cree with the launch of the Cree TruWhite bulb. The TruWhite LED bulb
gives off some of the best natural color when compared to other LED bulbs on the market and is a great complement to
the product launches that we have celebrated this year.
We have an outstanding offering of products in our gift centers for the holiday season. This year we're featuring a
RYOBI One+ cordless drill that includes two lithium ion batteries, charger, and carrying case at a price below the
NiCad alternatives in the market today. For our Pro customers, we have exclusive values on popular combo kits from
Makita, Milwaukee, and RIDGID. And we're also introducing the Husky Total Socket. The Husky Total Socket is an
adjustable wrench, one tool that replaces up to 44 sockets. It also features a lower profile than standard socket
wrenches, allowing you to get into tight spaces.
And we have our best lineup yet in holiday décor. We continue to bring innovation in the latest offerings to our
customers, and we are becoming a leading destination for the category, both in-store and through our extended
assortment online. We're committed to simplifying holiday décor for our customers. About half of our pre-lit artificial
tree assortment is designed with quickset electrical connections. Just connect the poles to the base, and your tree will
illuminate hassle free. Making it easy for our customers to enjoy the holidays and providing great values will allow us
to win this holiday season.
Finally, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the outstanding Black Friday special buys that we have planned this year with
extreme values for our traditional DIY-ers and professional customers, including some amazing offers on appliances.
Going to our stores or online, and I think that you will agree, this is one of our most exciting lineups yet.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.
Carol B. Tomé
Thank you, Craig, and hello, everyone.
In the third quarter, sales were $19.5 billion, a 7.4% increase from last year. Comps, or same-store sales, were positive
7.4% for the quarter, with positive comps of 8.7% in August, 8.2% in September, and 5.6% in October. Comps for U.S.
stores were positive 8.2% for the quarter, with positive comps of 9.6% in August, 9.4% in September, and 6.2% in
October.
Our total company gross margin was 34.9% for the quarter, an increase of 35 basis points from last year, of which 32
basis points came from our U.S. business. Our gross margin expansion in the U.S. is explained by the following factors.
First, we experienced 22 basis points of gross margin expansion in our supply chain, due primarily to higher
productivity. Second, we experienced approximately 17 basis points of gross margin expansion due to the impact of
gross margin accretive businesses that were acquired in 2012. Third, our shrink reduction efforts continued to gain
traction, and we realized two basis points of margin expansion due to lower shrink. Finally, we experienced nine basis
points of gross margin contraction due to a change in the mix of products sold, the majority of which was due to a
higher penetration of appliance sales than one year ago. Our total company gross margin performance also reflects $10
million of inventory liquidation costs associated with our China store closings in 2012 that did not repeat this year.

While we continue to project modest gross margin expansion for the year, as we look to the fourth quarter of fiscal
2013, we expect our gross margin to decline roughly 15 basis points from what we reported in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2012, due primarily to certain gross margin benefits recognized last year that we do not expect to repeat.
In the third quarter, operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 187 basis points to 23.1%. Our expense
leverage reflects our strong sales performance and some favorable year-over-year comparisons. As you will recall, in
the third quarter of 2012 we closed our stores in China and incurred $155 million of operating closing costs that did not
repeat this year. Adjusting for the China store closings, we leveraged operating expenses by 101 basis points, better
than our plans. For the year, we expect our expenses to grow at approximately 34% of our sales growth on a 52-week
basis.
Interest and other expense for the third quarter was $188 million, a 25.3% increase from last year, reflecting new
interest expense associated with $2 billion of incremental debt issued in April and an additional $3.25 billion of
incremental debt issued in September of this year. Proceeds from the September debt issuance will be used to repay
$1.25 billion of outstanding debt that is coming due in December, with the remainder to be used for share repurchases.
I'd also like to note that during the quarter, we received an upgrade from Standard & Poor's, taking our long-term debt
rating to single-A.
Our income tax provision rate was 35.8% in the third quarter. And for the year we expect our tax provision to be
approximately 36.5%.
Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $0.95, an increase of 50.8% from last year. Adjusting for the cost
of the China store closings, our diluted earnings per share grew 28.4% from the same period in the prior year.
Now moving to our operational metrics, during the third quarter we opened two new stores in Mexico, for an ending
total company store count of 2,260. At the end of the third quarter, selling square foot was 236 million. And total sales
per square foot were $329, up 7.2% from last year. At the end of the quarter, inventory was roughly $11.3 billion. And
inventory turns were 4.7 times, up from 4.6 times last year. We ended the quarter with $43.8 billion in assets, including
$4.9 billion in cash.
Moving to our share repurchase program, in the third quarter we received 2.4 million shares related to the true-up of an
accelerated share repurchase for an ASR program we initiated in the second quarter. Additionally, in the third quarter
we repurchased $2.1 billion or 24.5 million of our outstanding shares. This included $600 million or 8.1 million shares
repurchased in the open market and 16.4 million shares repurchased through an ASR program. For the shares
repurchased under the ASR program, this is an initial calculation. The final number of shares repurchased will be
determined upon completion of ASR program in the fourth quarter. Further, we plan to repurchase an additional $2.1
billion of outstanding shares in the fourth quarter, bringing our total share repurchases to $8.5 billion for the year.
Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on
invested capital was 19.7%, 360 basis points higher than the third quarter of fiscal 2012.
As we look to the fourth quarter, please remember that the fourth quarter of 2012 had an extra week, contributing $1.2
billion in sales and $0.07 of earnings per share that will not repeat in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.
Additionally, we are up against some very tough comparisons, as we had approximately $255 million of storm-related
sales in the fourth quarter of 2012 that we don't expect to repeat. But we had a great third quarter, exceeded our plan in
all departments, and our business momentum continues. Housing is a bright spot in our economy. As such, we are
forecasting our fourth quarter sales and earnings to be stronger than our plan.
So today, we are lifting our 2013 sales and earnings per share growth guidance, reflecting our year-to-date performance
and our forecast for the quarter. We now expect fiscal 2013 sales to increase by approximately 5.6%, with positive
comps on a 52-week like-for-like basis of approximately 7%.
For earnings per share, remember that we guide off of GAAP. We now project fiscal 2013 diluted earnings per share to
increase approximately 24% to $3.72. This earnings per share guidance includes the $6.4 billion of share repurchases
completed in the first three quarters of 2013 and our intent to repurchase an additional $2.1 billion in shares in during

We look forward to talking with you at our Investor Conference on December 11 in Boston, where we will update you
on our key strategic initiatives and progress towards reaching our longer-term financial goals.
We thank you for your participation in today's call and, Jake, we are now ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll hear first from Gary Balter with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Gary J. Balter>: Thank you. First of all, congratulations on just another solid, solid, good quarter. Frank and
Carol and everybody, question is a couple years ago when you had your last Analyst Meeting, you highlighted that
you're more focused on GDP as your driver as opposed to PFRI or previous housing metrics that you used, yet your
numbers have clearly been better than GDP. And, Carol, as you just finished, you talked about housing being one of the
drivers. As you look at your results and you look at the opportunities in housing, are you the rethinking the metrics that
you use from a macro perspective?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Gary, thanks for your question and for your comments. Thank you very much. We still think
GDP is the basis for sales growth. But as you know, we have an imperfect but directionally correct model that gives us
some insight as to how housing is driving our sales. Now it's hard to nail it on a quarter, but for the year we feel pretty
good about what our model is telling us.
So as you know, we just increased our comps for 2013 to 7%, and the way we get there is this way. First, we start with
the GDP estimate of around 2%. Then we add to that what we think housing is contributing to our sales. We look at
housing turnover, home price appreciation and new household formation. And when we look at those drivers, we think
housing is contributing about 250 basis points of our growth.
To that, we add the benefits that we've enjoyed this year from commodity price inflation. That's maybe around 80 basis
points for the year. The benefits that we're enjoying from our new expanded appliance assortment, that's another 80
basis points. And then there's about 90 basis points left that's just coming from other growth, be it new innovation that
we're bringing into the store, great execution by our store associates, but that's how we get to the 7%.
<Q - Gary J. Balter>: Thank you, that's very helpful.
Operator
And now we'll take a question from Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher Horvers>: Following up on the housing topic, there have been – some of the metrics recently have
slowed down or at least perhaps plateauing and you've had a lot of rate volatility. So I was curious what your thoughts
are around that, if you're seeing anything in your business. And playing devil's advocate, is what you're seeing today
simply a lag effect that would suggest that later on as we start to comp to comp and see the lag from slower housing
metrics that things are going to be slower in the future?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: So, Chris, one of the things that I think, and Carol might want to elaborate on this, is for us,
new home construction is less important as a driver of our business than what is happening with existing homes, both
turnover and, most importantly, price appreciation. We've long thought that one of the key determinants of our business
is do people feel good about investing in their house because they're going to see pricing appreciation in their home,
and that continues to move forward at a pretty good pace. But, Carol, you may want to get into more detail.

<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Sure, so we've regressed ourselves both against 10-year Treasuries and 30-year mortgages to
see if there's any correlation, and we can't see it. But all that being said, we do pay particular attention, as Frank
mentioned, to both housing turnover and home prices. And if we were to see housing turnover decline because of the
rising rate environment, we would then look to see what's happening to home prices. And if home prices were to
decline, then we might have a different point of view on the housing recovery, but we're not seeing that.
And for us anyway, we think home price appreciation has been the biggest contributor of our sales growth this year.
And if you look at the Case-Shiller data, it shows that home prices are up 10% year on year; and if you look at the
composite index, maybe up closer to 13%, but still 25% lower than their peak. So we think that there's a lot of room for
recovery and it's not going to step out in the short term.
<Q - Christopher Horvers>: And how much of that do you think perhaps is the under-investment, that the home is a
durable product filled with durable products and there's this recapture effect as people have under-spent for a number of
years?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: That's a tough one answer, Chris. I would say many years ago, somebody commented, an
economist's comment to us was look for when consumers start to think of a granite countertop as an expense rather than
an investment. And our hypothesis is there are a lot of things that people want to do with their home, whether it's just
improving the livability or actually fixing things up that is determined by that investment versus expense factor.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: And CoreLogic has done some interesting work that shows people who have positive equity in
their home, and that comes as a result of rising home prices, people who have positive equity in their homes spend
three times as much as those who have negative equity in their home.
<Q - Christopher Horvers>: Thanks very much.
Operator
Brian Nagel of Oppenheimer will have the next question.
<Q - Brian W. Nagel>: Good morning.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Good morning.
<Q - Brian W. Nagel>: A question on the Pro customer. The comments you made today in your prepared remarks
suggest that the Pro business for you continues to improve. And if I look back over the prior few quarters, it seems like
we're seeing a strengthening trend there. The question I have is how should we think about the potential for Pro going
forward with the backdrop of an improving housing environment?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: So, Brian, I would say first off, it has been really for the last several years one of our key
indicators on recovery because the Pro customer was hit harder for us during the housing crash, and now is recovering.
Going forward, and you see it a bit this past quarter, we would expect Pro to be growing at or maybe slightly better
than the rate of our consumer. But really the catch-up already has happened and now they should both be growing
probably at about the same rate. And it will probably bounce a bit back and forth depending on the quarter. Second
quarter, consumer grew slightly more than Pro. Third quarter, Pro grew slightly more than consumer, but the good
news is both are experiencing growth.
<Q - Brian W. Nagel>: Got it. And then as a quick follow-up, if I could, for Carol, if you look at the expense leverage,
and it's more I guess a modeling question. If you look at the expense leverage here in the third quarter versus what we
saw in the second quarter, it was much better. In the second quarter you called out the step-up in incentive
compensation. I know there's a lot moving on. Was that basically the difference Q2 to Q3?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: There are a number of things that drove the differences between the quarters. In the second
quarter of 2012, we had some good guys that didn't repeat, including a positive expense resulting from our casualty
reserve analysis. As we look to the third quarter and the fourth quarter of 2013, we're going to have higher expenses

related to compensation, and we're really thrilled.
If I could just put our expenses into perspective for you, if you go back to the beginning of the year and the guidance
that we gave and fast-forward now to the end of the third quarter, we've increased our sales growth guidance by $2.9

guidance that I've given you. Of the $180 million, a third of that is variable compensation, Success Sharing and bonus.

Our next question will come from Dan Binder with Jefferies.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Hi, good morning. Congratulations on a good quarter.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Thank you.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: My question was regarding the appliance reset. I was wondering if you could give us any
more color around how the stores with the full reset are performing in that category versus the stores that have not
received the reset, specifically in the appliance business.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Dan, obviously the customers responded well to the expanded brands that we have. And
where we're able to show that footprint, we're seeing very nice lift in those stores. But also remember that all those
brands became available to all stores through HomeDepot.com. And as a result, we have seen nice lift really in all
stores and seeing category growth in every subset of the appliance business. So we're very pleased with how that is
going so far.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: I guess I was wondering because as you look at the two different sets, the reset obviously is
pretty impressive. I'm just curious how many stores you'll ultimately put that in and why you wouldn't put it in certain
stores versus others because it seems like it's a material improvement over what you had.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: We certainly intend to continue to look at the opportunity. We don't see this as a fit for all
stores, but clearly there's opportunity for us to continue to improve in additional stores. And we'll evaluate that as we
continue to watch the performance.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: We'll talk more about this at our Investor Conference because we're going to lay out our goals
for 2014, and we'll talk to you about our capital and where it's going.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Okay, great. Thanks.

Now we'll take a question from Matthew Fassler, Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks a lot and good morning.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Good morning.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: A couple questions. First of all, can you talk to us how to think about the cadence of the
business given the trend you saw in October and the compares that you face during Q4? Maybe any initial comments
on the tone of business in November as presumably you're facing the teeth of the Sandy comparison would be very
helpful.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Sure. As you know, we did a lot better than we thought we would do in the third quarter, and
the cadence of the business is really a reflection of year-over-year comparisons. So we had strong comps in all three
months, but obviously October was our lowest comping month. If you think about it, that is when we were up against

the Sandy sales from last year, and we had $122 million of Sandy sales in October. Also if you think about one of our
largest [ph] regions (33:02), the Gulf region, the Gulf region had a terrific month in October. It slowed down year on
year because the prior year they had double-digit comps coming off of other storm sales.
So we were pleased with the cadence of the business. And now that we've entered into the fourth quarter, and obviously
it's very early in the fourth quarter, our toughest compare is ahead. Our hardest comping month is the month of
December. But, Matt, we lifted guidance today because we think we're going to do better than we originally thought in
the fourth quarter, and we wouldn't have done that today if we hadn't started off ahead of our expectations.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Great. And then the second question, as we look at the expectation for EBIT for this year
on a full-year basis, you're creeping up to that 12% number probably a little faster than you thought you would when
you first issued that guidance I guess about a year and a half ago. How does that lead you to think about the long-term
target, which probably becomes quite germane as you look towards next year where expectations probably are going to
start to get to that number?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: So, Matt, the good news is we have our conference coming up in just a few weeks. And so
we'll be able to lay that out for you and everyone then.

And now we'll take a question from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.
<Q - Aram Rubinson>: Thanks, everybody, great work. A question on the balance of ticket and traffic, I think the last
time we saw ticket and traffic so well balanced, actually I think you have to go back to before the year 2000. And I was
just wondering if you can talk about whether or not you find that as significant and what it says about the business and
if you'd expect the shape of that to change as the cycle progresses. Thank you.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Yes, the first comment, Aram, is as I said in my opening comments, we do find that – see that
as a real positive for the balance of the growth of our business. And obviously, it's something we'd like to sustain.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Yes, it is definitely something we work on consistently to drive both traffic and ticket, and
we do think it's important. Certainly, it's a measure of how well the assortments are performing within the store.
Clearly, we've seen nice growth in big-ticket categories for several quarters in a row now. And again, our Pro
contributes to that. Things like kitchens and HVAC, all that have been positive contributors. But likewise, we've been
really focused on making sure that we capture the opportunity for the consumer with the smaller tickets as well.
And some of the key driving factors behind the lower ticket categories are things like bulbs and power tool accessories
and fasteners that are being driven with larger projects, more Pro business, as well as great innovation in products like
spray paint and hand tools that have allowed us to drive the smaller ticket. So it's something that we really focus on to
try to bring a balanced approach to the business.
<Q - Aram Rubinson>: Thanks. And it's not easy to stay in stock on a lot of those smaller ticket items when you're
comping as hard as you are, so you must be doing a great job on the supply chain.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: The supply chain is definitely helping with awesome in-stock position while leveraging
inventory investment.

<Q - Budd Bugatch>: Good morning and let me add my congratulations on a very solid quarter.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Thanks, Budd.
<Q - Budd Bugatch>: I guess my first question really has to do with the leverage factor. Carol, you've talked about
34% for the year. I wonder if you could maybe give us some more color on the fourth quarter. And how should we
think about that for 2014 and beyond now?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes, so as you look to the fourth quarter, our expense growth factor will be higher than it was in
the third quarter for a couple of reasons. It will be higher because of incentive comp. We've just raised our guidance,
which means we're going to blow through the plan that we put together, which is great news for our store associates
and for everyone who is bonus or Success Sharing eligible. So that will drive year-over-year outperformance and
higher expense growth, if you will.
We also pushed some of our – we've got a year-over-year comparison, pardon me, related to China. Last year, we had a
good guy in China. It was a $20 million good guy, and that will not repeat. So as I look at our expense growth factor in
the fourth quarter, it will be more like 50% of our sales growth. But for the year it's 34%. And as Frank pointed out,
we've got an Investor Conference coming up on December 11, and we will give you longer-term point of view on
expenses at that time.
<Q - Budd Bugatch>: I thought that would be the answer for 2015. And my follow-up question, you talk about you
did better than you expected. Can you give us, can you quantify how much better than expected you did in both sales
and maybe earnings?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Sure, I'm happy to do it from an earnings perspective, but I'll give it to you for both, why not?
So we beat our sales plan by about $700 million, and we beat our earnings plan from an earnings per share perspective
by about $0.10 a share.
<Q - Budd Bugatch>: Very impressive, thank you very much. I look forward to seeing you in a couple of weeks,
congratulations.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Okay, thank you.

We'll take a question from Dennis McGill, Zelman & Associates. Go ahead, please.
<Q - Dennis P. McGill>: Good morning and thank you. My first question would just be as it relates to mix within
categories and thinking about consumers' willingness to trade up. Can you maybe just elaborate on what you're seeing
there and maybe any examples of whether you I guess: A), are seeing mix benefits; and B), if you are, where that might
be?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Yes, we are seeing customers willing to spend, particularly where you're bringing innovative
product that helps them complete a job faster, saves them money. So things like LED, which is a significant premium
in the market compared to incandescent or halogen, for that matter, or CFL bulbs, we're seeing terrific growth in that as
customers understand the value proposition. Likewise, when you think about tools, lithium continues to grow. It carries
a premium price in the market, particularly in Pro tools because the performance enhancements have been there and
we're on about our fourth generation of lithium battery technology over the past five years, so we've seen customers
step up there.
And likewise, we've seen customers willing to step up on things. We tested, for example, a 100-gallon Japanese maple
tree for $3,000 this spring, and we were actually quite surprised at how well that sold. So there are customers willing to
step up. And likewise at the same time we need to be conscious that there are more runners in the market today, less
space. So we're also looking at the opening price point for the smaller items within our categories as well. For example,
we added in products in our cleaning. We took it out of club packs, if you will, and brought in singles, and we've seen

nice response with that as well.
<A - Marvin R. Ellison>: Dennis, this is Marvin. And also double-digit growth in the services install business is a
reflection of customers' willingness to trade up and take on bigger ticket purchases.
<Q - Dennis P. McGill>: So it sounds like innovation is a big part of it. If I said it a different way, is the better and
best portion of the price spectrum gaining share at the expense of good if you looked across the store?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: No, I wouldn't necessarily say that. I think the opportunity that we have seen is we have
customers willing to step up but not necessarily seeing a decline in the opening price point.
<Q - Dennis P. McGill>: Okay. And then second question, the fourth quarter comp which you highlighted seems to be
a recurring theme that we've seen now for the last few years. And you've continued to best that comp I think above
expectations after the quarter is wrapped up. Or I guess said another way, the fourth quarter seems to be becoming a
bigger portion of the store as you get into more décor and holiday items. How should we think about that growing piece
of the pie in relation to how you're approaching merchandising and the categories that are in the box?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Certainly one of the things that we're trying to do is in many ways create our own seasons, if
you will. And so we have seen tremendous growth over the past several years with our holiday décor program as a
driver of both traffic to the stores, new customers coming into The Home Depot, so that has been nice.
We have likewise focused on the opportunity that we have around the gift giving holiday season with Black Friday.
We've put a bigger effort around that as well. But even with those things said, we have a lot of customers doing
projects every single day in our stores. And we're continuing to focus on the core of the store as well, which is a key
factor. Things like paint remain one of the top categories. Customers need cleaning products, they need bulbs and so on
throughout the year. And that's really been our focus is to drive productivity through our assortment in our bays on a
consistent basis quarter over quarter.
<Q - Dennis P. McGill>: Great. Best of luck, guys.

We'll take a question from Keith Hughes with SunTrust.
<Q - Keith Hughes>: Thank you. My question is on gross margin. You had discussed in the prepared text about a 15
basis point sequential decline. Can you give any more detail on what's happening as we move from the third to the
fourth on that metric?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: I'd be happy to. In the fourth quarter of 2012, we had 15 basis points of gross margin expansion
coming from improved shrink. As you know, Keith, we've been really working on through a cross-function effort to
manage our shrink down. We've done a great job, but we don't expect that 15 basis points to repeat in the fourth
quarter.
The other thing that's happening from a year-over-year perspective is if you look at the nature of the products sold in
January, the margin coming off of that tends to be higher than the nature of the products sold both in December and
November. In the fourth quarter of last year, we had an extra week. That extra week was in the month of January that
had a higher margin rate, so just the year-over-year comparison is causing that 15 basis point decline.
<Q - Keith Hughes>: The 15 basis points is year over year, correct?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: It is.
<Q - Keith Hughes>: Okay, year over year. And then second question, I believe as Marvin mentioned earlier about the
installed product being strong the quarter. Is there any specific product that was stronger than the other in the last

quarter or two?
<A - Marvin R. Ellison>: Across the board, when you think about install businesses, you think about carpet, you think
about kitchens, countertops. We had strength really on the flooring side of the business. We also have strength across
the board from a kitchen standpoint. We're pleased with that business. We worked really hard to simplify the entire
offering and the process. As you can imagine, big ticket and also big complexity.
So we're working really hard on the customer experience and we're going to talk at the Investor Conference about our
vision of how you take our flooring model and how we really transition it to three easy steps for the customer. And
we're going to try to transition more of our install businesses to a similar format. But overall, we're pleased with that
entire business platform.

We'll take the next question from Kate McShane, Citi Research.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: Thank you, good morning. I wondered if we could hear a little bit more about the ongoing
improvements in the supply chain. It seemed like you benefited more this quarter with the 22 basis points of gross
margin expansion from the supply chain. Can you walk us through if there any meaningful changes during the quarter?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: I can start and then maybe Mark Holifield will jump in. As I look at it from at least the lens of
the CFO, we had higher units per hour. We had better outbound and inbound cubic utilization, which drove
productivity throughout the supply chain. But it didn't just stop us there. We also had about a basis point of benefit
from coming from lower fuel cost. And then we had about seven basis points coming – this is all in the 22 basis points
– seven basis points coming from lower cost within our international distribution channel.
Mark, do you want to give any more color?
<A - Mark Holifield>: Yeah. Carol has run down the key points there in terms of the key contributors to productivity.
I would just add that that occurred across the board. All of our distribution platforms, our direct-to-store expenses for
transportation, and our international logistics were all leveraged during the quarter.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: Okay, that's great. Thank you. My second question is a longer-term question. Carol,
you've always given your opinion on what you thought could be the next leg for growth in the housing market aside
from the turnover and higher prices, and that was the easing of the availability of mortgages. I just wondered if you
could maybe update us on what your opinion is on timing or anything you're hearing with regards to that.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Kate, that's still an opportunity, isn't it? If you think about it, the underwriting standards are
very tight. There was a recent survey of banks, 79% of the respondents said that they have not loosened up on their
underwriting standards. And you can appreciate that from some perspective because they're all faced with higher
capital requirements. They're trying to make a buck in a low interest rate environment, so taking on more risk is
difficult for these financial institutions.
But, boy, we sure need to some movement there because that I think would just be a big boost to the steepness of the
recovery. We also continue to believe there needs to be reform with the GSEs, and there is a lot of dialogue there but
nothing really happening. But if we were to get some movement in this space, I think we'd see a sharper recovery than
what we're experiencing.
<A - Mark Holifield>: Thank you.

Michael Lasser with UBS will have the next question.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Good morning, thanks a lot for taking my question. I'm curious about the week-to-week
volatility within traffic that you're seeing in the stores. How does it compare to what you saw year or two ago when the
cycle just started to build? And then how does that compare to the depth of the declines? Are you just seeing more
consistent traffic build on a week-to-week basis at this point?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Michael, you're getting us – I don't think we have a good answer for you in terms of whether –
if I understand your question is whether the delta on traffic week to week, whether that differential is narrower with a
recovering market or steeper? And it's an interesting question and I don't have an answer for you.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Michael, we'll get back to you.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Yes.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Is a more consistent now so you...
<A - Francis S. Blake>: I understand the question. And to be honest, we just haven't analyzed that. It's a good
question.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes, we'll have to figure out how to normalize for weather because it certainly impacts traffic.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Right.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: But we'll take a look at that, it's a good question.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Yes.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Okay. The other question I had is if you look within the basket of the Pro customer, is there
anything to suggest that you are starting to take share within categories where you have historically under-indexed
relative that customer base? I think probably the prototypical product is paint, but presumably there are others as well.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: I would say that when we look at our unit productivity across many Pro dominated
categories, we're very, very pleased, whether that be things like dimensional lumber, plywood, concrete. We're
extremely pleased with the performance and actually the growth in terms of quarter-over-quarter growth as well. And
it's a little bit hard to tell you around share with the Pro because it's a very fragmented market against a lot of
competitors, lumber, building material, supply houses, electrical distributors, and that data is a little bit harder to get at.
But given the unit productivity we have, we feel pretty solid that we think we are taking some share.
<A - Marvin R. Ellison>: Mike, this is Marvin. The only thing I'll add to that, the expanded appliance offerings gave
us the ability with property investors to have a better, more economical offering for appliances, and so we've seen
strength in that category. Craig noted that appliances was really strong across the board. The Pro segment contributed
to that. Other than that, I think Craig answered the question pretty well.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you very much.

We'll now take the next question from Greg Melich with ISI Group.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Hi, thanks. I have a couple questions. One is on gross margins, just to understand the fourth
quarter a bit more. Historically, your fourth quarter gross margin usually gets better sequentially, and I would have
thought supply chain and other things wouldn't go away, so I understand last year's comparison. But if you just look at
it sequentially, why would gross margins be down a little bit if I take your guidance right?

<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Sequentially, they will be. I'm just talking year over year.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Okay, year over year, got it. And on online, so if I've got the number right, it was up 50%? Was
that in the prepared comments?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Was there acquisitions or anything else driving that or what changed? And then how does that
impact traffic and ticket and all the other metrics we talk about because that's a point of revenue?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes, we were very pleased with our online performance. We've been talking to you a lot about
all the investments that we're making from an interconnected experience, and it's starting to play out in terms of sales.
So as Frank pointed out, about 3% of our total sales are now online, up 50% year on year. I can give you little color as
relates to traffic. Traffic for our company was up 13 million year on year. One million of that was driven by our online
properties. But remember, Greg, we look at this totally interconnected. It's how do we increase strong close in our
stores, how our stores do the same thing for our online presence, and it seems to be getting good traction.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: And there was no acquisition.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: No, there was no acquisition.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Nothing else to turn that around. And then lastly, Carol, could you update us on credit? You
talked about how generally speaking banks have not shifted their underwriting standards. How have you guys been able
to maybe help your consumer out to offset that?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes, our private label grew from a penetration perspective. It grew 68 basis points in the
quarter. We're now standing at 23.4%. If you look at the consumer approval rates, they were up 150 basis points year
on year, so now 69%. The through-the-door FICO score is 715, so that's still pretty doggone high. But I'm glad to see
that the approval rates are up. Those lines for consumers are about $5,700, and they're about 26% utilized.
On the Pro, where credit I think is actually more important, we also saw approval rates at 69% at a much higher rate.
The average line is around $8,400. What we're doing for the Pro are a couple of things. It's very targeted. It's very
focused. But for our large spend pros, we will work with them to extend lines, so we work with the underwriter of the
program and we will go back and extend the lines. We think that makes good sense. We also have a card called a
PROX card, which is a payment term card, usually 30 days. For certain select Pro customers, we will extend the
payment days to 45 days or 60 days, whatever it is, on a case-by-case basis. So we're working very closely with the
underwriter to give credit to this very important customer.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: That's great, thanks.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: You're welcome.

The next question will come from Scot Ciccarelli was RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Hey, guys, Scot Ciccarelli. The slowdown that we saw in the month of October, was that more
on the transaction side or ticket side because obviously if it was more ticket, that might just be a mix issue? And I know
you guys have touched a little bit upon big ticket sales during this call. But is there any reason to believe that the
momentum we've seen in that category or bucket should slow anytime soon? Thanks.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: So on the sales slowdown, basically we're up against $122 million of storm from a year ago,
and so that's spread across things like generators and cleaning and those type of categories where we've – batteries,
flashlights. So that's really the pressure that you saw in October in the year over year.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: So more ticket than transactions because those generators are big-ticket items.

<A - Francis S. Blake>: Big ticket, right. And then as it relates to big ticket in general, as I mentioned earlier, we've
had several quarters in a row now of strong growth in big ticket and don't really see why that would change going
forward. We have continued opportunity to grow big-ticket categories, things like appliances, things like kitchens,
flooring, all those have been key focuses for us to continue to enhance our offerings, our assortments, and we saw
strong, strong growth in those categories again.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: And, Craig, if I may, we saw an increase in items per basket in the third quarter. That's the
second quarter in a row where we've seen that. And that's a contributor, isn't it, to the big ticket growth?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: It is. And as Marvin mentioned earlier, likewise our install businesses have seen nice growth
as well, and we see that continuing going forward.

<A - Francis S. Blake>: Good morning.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: The improved sales in the second half, both 3Q and 4Q relative your expectation, any specific
categories or areas of the store that would look at and say we thought this wouldn't be as good as it's turning out to be?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: So we did about 400 basis points better from a growth rate perspective in the third quarter than
our expectations. We had thought that we would see a drag from appliances. We thought that we would see commodity
deflation, and we didn't expect to have good weather in the third quarter. And when you add that all up, that contributed
about 230 basis points of that outperformance because we didn't get commodity inflation, appliances grew, and weather
was a help. And then the remaining 170 basis points was across the store. As Craig pointed out, every department was
positive. And as we look to the fourth quarter, we're expecting more of the same.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Within that, I guess the appliance drag, is this the category you expected to be slower or the
payback from your expansion initiatives and market share efforts that you expect it to be slower? What if we drilled
into that specifically?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Yes. If you remember, Eric, we had begun to rollout expanded showrooms at the end of the
third quarter last year, actually the beginning of the third quarter into the fourth quarter. And we thought that we would
see tougher comps as we came over those rollouts from a year ago, but that wasn't the case.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: And then secondly on the impact of Sandy in October, from a basis point perspective, what was
roughly the impact? It looks like it's 150 or 200 basis points was the impact of that in the month.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: I'll give you the dollars, and you can calculate it. Last year we had $122 million of Sandy sales.
This year we had $10 million of Sandy sales, so the net deduct is $112 million.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Okay, great. Thank you.
