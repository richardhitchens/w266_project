Robert A. Niblock
Good morning and thanks for your interest in Lowe's. I'm pleased that we delivered another solid quarter, driven by
balanced performance. Comparable sales for the quarter were 6.2%, once again driven by a balance of ticket and
transaction growth. We drove positive comps in 11 of our 12 product categories in the quarter. In fact, Outdoor Power
Equipment, the only outlier, was achieving solid positive comps until the last week of the quarter, when faced with the

substantial headwind from the sales of generators, the result of Superstorm Sandy.
We also saw strength in all regions of the country, with double digit comp performance in Florida, as well as particular
strength in California and Arizona, markets where the housing recovery is well underway. And our Pro Services
business continued to perform well across the country. Our balanced performance is a testament to our enhanced Sales
& Operations Planning process, applied to the stronger base we've been building with Value Improvement, Product
Differentiation and our Store Labor Investment.
I'm also pleased with our performance in Canada. We have a new leadership in team in place. And for the second
consecutive quarter, they've delivered double digit comps in local currency.
Gross margin expanded 26 basis points. We effectively controlled expenses and we delivered earnings per share of
$0.47 for the quarter, a 34.3% increase to last year's third quarter.
Delivering our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the third quarter, we repurchased $761 million of
stock and paid $191 million in dividends. As I mentioned, we've enhanced our Sales & Operations Planning effort, a
process that is led by our Customer Experience design team within Greg's organization. The intent is to better
understand and anchor around the consumer mindset season-to-season and to change the way we go to market through
coordinated planning across channels that binds together every function of our organization. That cross-functional
effort has produced a comprehensive and coordinated view of the path ahead, allowing us to leverage resources to drive
sales and margin. Greg will provide more details in a few minutes, leveraging our All for Fall campaign as a tangible
example of this effort.
Now, looking at the consumer landscape going forward, our most recent consumer sentiment study suggests that
consumers are adapting a more resilient mindset and, a result, embracing a broader perspective. During the recession,
consumers had a very focused perspective, the result of household budgetary constraints. Their primary concern was
how to adapt to what felt like a freefall. That perspective is starting to broaden, as consumers have gained a foothold
and we're seeing it play out in strengthening home improvement affinity metrics, an increasing number of installed
sales leads, as well as in the strength of large project category performance. So despite the recent government shutdown
and fall off in home affordability, the home improvement industry is poised for persisting growth in fourth quarter.
Based on our year-to-date performance and outlook for the balance of the year, we've raised our fiscal year 2013
guidance. We expect further acceleration of industry growth next year, stronger job and income growth, improving
household financial conditions and the lagging benefit of the recovery in home buying will be key drivers.
In closing, our Sales & Operations Planning process, applied to the stronger base we've been building with Value
Improvement, Product Differentiation and our Store Labor Investment, together with our associates' hard work and
continued dedication to serving customers, has improved our level of execution, allowing us to more fully capitalize on
market demand in 2013.
Thanks again for your interest and, with that, let me turn the call over to Greg.
Gregory M. Bridgeford
Thanks, Robert. Good morning, everyone. Our third quarter performance reflected our improving collaboration and
execution within a strengthening home improvement market. We performed particularly well in large project
categories, such as Flooring and Kitchens & Appliances. The strength of these large project categories reflects an
emerging willingness among consumers to finally replace items that are worn or outdated or to make significant
enhancements to their homes. Large project discretionary spending is still far below pre-recession peaks, but we are
seeing steady improvement.
We also performed well in Fashion Fixtures and Paint, as we were well prepared with the right products and advice to
assist customers as they spruced up their interiors in advance of the holidays. We're pleased that our improved
performance is enabling us to take advantage of the home improvement market growth. This is due in large part to our

enhanced Sales & Operations Planning process. Through this process, we have addressed an opportunity to improve
seasonal planning, including the cadence of product introductions, promotions and staffing.
We've always planned and executed these seasons in our stores. Previous planning was completed function by function
and reconciled to minimize conflicts. Now the process starts earlier and is anchored on the customer mind-set for the
season. The process more thoroughly considers detailed input from all functions to determine resource allocation. And
it enables Lowe's to provide a consistent message and experience across all selling channels, stores, lowes.com, contact
centers and in-home selling. Our recent All for Fall campaign, which ran from late August through the end of October,
is a great example of how the enhanced process works.
Our planning began earlier than it would have under the legacy process. Instead of each function separately developing
its own plan to achieve our comp and margin targets, we started with two key customer mind-sets for the fall. First,
customers want to complete fall maintenance projects, such as prepping the lawn for next spring, planting, and sealing
windows and doors to save energy during the winter. And then they transition to make their home's interior more
inviting to holiday guests.
We anchored on the mind-sets to determine the projects customers would complete, the key products needed, which of
those products should be promoted to drive traffic, what products should be merchandised nearby as project completers
helping to build the basket, how much inventory would be needed, when it would need to be available, and what
staffing and training was needed for each store department. Then we staged the introduction of new product and sets
based on climatic zone.
This planning process, while capturing input from many different teams, was centrally managed by Bob Gfeller's
Customer Experience design team. Bob's team communicated the final plans, both the underlying insights and the
implementation steps. This approach drove better understanding of each function's role in the plan's success and
consistency of execution across channels. This season's theme, All for Fall, was also clearly and consistently messaged
across all media, and was used in theme store displays built for cross-merchandising.
We believe that our particularly strong performance in fall interior project categories like Flooring, Kitchens &
Appliances, Fashion Fixtures and Paint is evidence that our coordinated All for Fall campaign resonated well with
customers. And, remember, this enhanced Sales & Operations Planning process is made more effective by other
elements of our transformation undertaken since 2011, including the organizational changes we made last year, our
product differentiation initiative, which drives customer engagement through better display techniques and facilitates
the smooth execution of seasonal themes and product introductions, and our Value Improvement initiative, which is
providing the right product assortments and inventory depth by location. All these elements work in concert to improve
the customer experience.
Having just mentioned Value Improvement, I'd like to take a moment to update you on the progress of this initiative. At
the end of the third quarter, we had completed resets representing approximately 80% of our business, and we expect to
substantially complete the initial round of resets in 2013. As a reminder, the financial benefit of Value Improvement is
greatest once we have reached stabilization, that is, when we are past clearance and selling only new assortments. We
estimate that roughly two-thirds of our business was at this stage at the end of the third quarter.
Value Improvement is captured in our improved comp performance, and we continue to obtain average gross margin
rate improvement of roughly 100 basis points for product lines that have reached stabilization. Beginning in 2014,
Value Improvement will be fully operationalized and no longer separately tracked as an initiative.
Examples of resets completed in the third quarter include core products, like thermostats and electrical tools; decor
products, such as wall sconces and decorative shelving; and seasonal products, such as leaf blowers and fireplace gas
logs.
In addition to the Value Improvement resets, we are investing to improve the customer's in-store experience. One
example is our implementation of mobile functionality that helps customers locate products in our stores. Customers
can create a shopping list and plan their route before arriving at the store. While there, they can check items off the list
as they shop, ensuring they get everything they need, accurately and efficiently. We'll share further plans to improve

our customer experience as we enter 2014.
Likewise, we continue to invest in inventory. Using intelligence provided by Value Improvement, together with our
Sales & Operations Planning process, we are leaning into increasing demand as we bolster job lot quantities to benefit
pros, increase overall in-stock service levels, and present compelling end-cap displays. We expect that these
incremental inventory investments will be completed this year, and we will be positioned to achieve greater inventory
productivity.
We've also invested in additional weekday labor hours to improve close rates. As a reminder, we added an average of
approximately 150 hours per week to the staffing model for nearly two-thirds of our stores. These hours were allocated
to interior areas of the store, supporting key fall projects identified within the Sales & Operations Planning process.
While we realized improving benefits from this program in the third quarter, this incremental investment caused payroll
deleverage, as expected at this point in the program. We continue to monitor this initiative's performance and will make
adjustments as necessary.
Finally, I am pleased to share that through the first three quarters, approximately 87% of our U.S. stores have qualified
for a Service and Sales Employee Initiative, or SSEI, payment. As a reminder, SSEI is our profit sharing program for
hourly associates.
Thank you for your interest in Lowe's. And I will now turn it over to Bob.
Robert F. Hull
Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the third quarter were $13 billion, which was an increase of
7.3%. Total customer transactions increased 5.7% and total average ticket increased 1.5% to $64.07. As you know, we
acquired 72 Orchard Supply Hardware stores on August 30. Orchard's smaller format neighborhood hardware stores
are located in densely populated markets and offer a product selection focused on Paint, Repair, and Backyard
categories. As a result, Orchard stores have more transactions per square foot, but fewer per store, and a lower average
ticket than a traditional Lowe's store.
So, while Orchard aided total sales by approximately 75 basis points, it added roughly 175 basis points to our
transaction growth and negatively impacted average ticket growth by almost 100 basis points. The Orchard scores are
considered non-comp and will be included in our comp sales calculation after the anniversary of the acquisition in Q3
2014.
Comp sales were 6.2% for the quarter. Looking at monthly trends, comps were 7.3% in August, 5.6% in September,
and 5.8% in October. For the quarter, comp transactions increased 3.6%, and comp average ticket increased 2.5%.
As Robert noted, our Sales & Operations Planning process, applied to a stronger base we've been building with Value
Improvement, Product Differentiation, and our Store Labor Investment, allowed us to more fully capitalize on market
demand.
Additionally, inflation added roughly 25 basis points to comps, while last year's hurricanes, Sandy and Isaac, were a
headwind of approximately 45 basis points. Year-to-date sales of $41.8 billion were up 5.8% versus the first three
quarters of 2012, driven by a 5.1% increase in comp sales, new stores and the acquisition of Orchard Supply Hardware.
Gross margin for the third quarter was 34.5% of sales, which increased 26 basis points over Q3 last year. The biggest
driver of the increase was Value Improvement, which helped gross margin by 52 basis points, our estimate of the
improvement, net the clearance impact of the resets, against the benefit of the stabilized lines.
The improvement was offset somewhat by the following items: first, our proprietary credit value proposition negatively
impacted gross margin by 14 basis points. This was driven by higher penetration of our proprietary credit program,
which reached 26.6% of sales, an increase of 145 basis points over Q3 2012. The negative margin impact was more
than offset by expense leverage associated with the program, which I will comment on in a moment.

Also, competitive pressures in the market impacted the level of appliance promotions, which reduced gross margin by
an estimated 10 basis points. Lastly, the mix of products sold modestly hurt gross margin in the quarter.
Year-to-date gross margin of 34.57% to sales is an increase of 27 basis points over the same period last year. SG&A for
Q3 was 24.56% of sales, which leveraged 47 basis points. In the quarter, we incurred long life asset impairment and
discontinued project expenses of $10 million. This compares to $52 million in similar charges last year, resulting in 35
basis points of SG&A leverage in this year's third quarter.
Risk Insurance leveraged 35 basis points in the quarter. We are self-insured for certain claims related to workers' comp
and general liabilities. Due to the duration of the claims, we discount our liability. As discussed Q3 last year, we
reduced the discount rate applied to incurred but not reported claims, which increased Q3 2012's insurance expense by
$33 million, and was the primary driver of expense leverage this year.
Also, we experienced 31 basis points of leverage associated with our Proprietary Credit Program. The leverage was
driven primarily by lower operating costs, including costs associated with promotional financing. Contract Labor
leveraged 20 basis points, as we cycled against an elevated level of spending for information technology projects in Q3
last year. These items were somewhat offset by incentive compensation expense, which deleveraged 41 basis points as
a result of higher expected detainment levels relative to last year.
During the quarter, store payrolls deleveraged 16 basis points. Payroll dollars were up approximately 9% versus Q3 last
year, which includes the additional weekday hours investment. Reset and remerchandising expense deleveraged 16
basis points, driven by the efforts Greg described to improve customer experiences.
Year-to-date, SG&A was 23.52% to sales, which leveraged 39 basis points versus the same period last year.
Depreciation for the quarter was $373 million, which was 2.88% of sales and leveraged 20 basis points compared with
last year's third quarter, as a result of the sales growth.
In Q3, earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, increased 93 basis points to 7.14% of sales. Year-to-date EBIT was
8.43% to sales, which was 85 basis points higher than the same period last year. For the quarter, interest expense was
$125 million, and deleveraged two basis points to last year as a percent of sales. Total expenses for Q3 were 28.41% of
sales and leveraged 65 basis points. Year-to-date, total expenses were 26.97% of sales and leveraged 54 basis points
versus last year. Pre-tax earnings for the quarter were 6.17% of sales. The effective tax rate was 37.6%, which was
essentially flat to last year.
Net earnings were $499 million for the quarter, an increase of 26% over Q3 2012. Earnings per share of $0.47 for the
third quarter were up 34.3% to last year. The $0.47 were roughly $0.05 per share higher than our expectations.
Year-to-date, earnings per share of $1.84 represents a 29.6% increase over the same period last year.
Now, to a few items on the balance sheet, starting with assets, cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the
quarter was $1.1 billion. Our third quarter inventory balance of $9.6 billion increased $598 million, or 6.7% versus Q3
last year. The increase was driven by higher inventory levels to support demand and the addition of 72 Orchard Supply
stores. Inventory turnover [indiscernible] (20:24) trailing four quarters cost of sales divided by average inventory for
the last five quarters was 3.71, a decrease of four basis points versus last year. Return on assets, determined using a
trailing four quarters earnings divided by average assets for the last five quarters, increased 98 basis points to 6.72%.
Moving on to the liability section of the balance sheet, accounts payable of $5.8 billion represented a 6.6% increase
over Q3 last year, which was consistent with the increase in inventory.
In the third quarter, we issued $1 billion of unsecured bonds. The bonds were split between 10 and 30-year issuances,
with a weighted average interest rate of 4.44%. At the end of the third quarter, our lease adjusted debt to EBITDAR
was 2.17 times. Return on invested capital, measured using the trailing four quarters earnings plus tax adjusted interest
divided by average debt and equity over the laugh five quarters, increased 187 basis points for the quarter to 11.26%.
Looking at the statement of cash flows, cash flow from operations was nearly $3.9 billion, an increase of $351 million
over last year, largely due to the earnings growth. Capital expenditures were $610 million, a 36% decrease from last

year. As a result, year-to-date free cash flow of nearly $3.3 billion was 27% higher than last year.
In August, we entered into a $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. At this point, we expect to receive
10.5 million shares, but the ultimate number of shares will be determined upon completion of the program in the fourth
quarter.
Also, in the third quarter, we repurchased 5.5 (sic) [5.5 million] additional shares for $261 million through the open
market. For the quarter, we repurchased a total of $761 million. We have approximately $2.2 billion remaining on our
share repurchase authorization.
Looking ahead, I'd like to address several of the items detailed in the Lowe's business outlook. Based on our
year-to-date performance and our outlook for the fourth quarter, we've raised our 2013 guidance for the second time
this year. We expect total sales to increase by approximately 6%, primarily driven by comp sales increase of
approximately 5%. We expect to open nine stores for the year. We are anticipating an EBIT increase of approximately
75 basis points. The effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 37.8%. As a result of these inputs, we are
expecting earnings per share of approximately $2.15, which represents an increase of 27% over 2012.
For the year, we are forecasting cash flow from operations to be approximately $3.8 billion. Our forecast for capital
expenditures is approximately $900 million. This results in estimated free cash flow of $2.9 billion for 2013. Our
guidance assumes approximately 3.7 billion in share repurchases for 2013. For the year, we expect that lease adjusted
debt to EBITDAR will be at or below 2.25 times.
Regina, we are now ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Scot Ciccarelli with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Morning.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Bob, can you give us any more details on the impact that Orchard had on the quarter,
specifically on gross margin and SG&A? I know you listed out some items already on SG&A, but, you know, I'm
particularly curious on that line item.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Scot, so Orchard had a relatively modest impact. I gave you the sales impact, which is 75 basis
points. Orchard's gross margin is modestly higher than the company's, but remember, we only had two months of
activity in the three month quarter. From an SG&A perspective, not much impact, other than we had roughly five basis
points of deal-related expenses included in the quarter. That, obviously, was included our guidance for the quarter, but
would not have been included in Q3 last year.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: And then the compensation that you noted, the 41 basis points, that's executive compensation?
Is that separate from the incentive comp for the stores? Can you just give us some more clarity on that and kind of the
way to think about that part going forward? Thanks.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So, Scot, that is all incentive compensation. That would include the SSEI that Greg spoke of
that is entirely store based. That would be the store manager program. That would be DCs and that would be the
corporate office. By far, the largest share of that expense is stores. Also, recognize that there's some timing involved in
the accruals for incentive compensation. So while it's up 41 basis points to last year in the third quarter, it's only
expected to be up roughly 15 basis points to last year for the year. So you have to think about the rate of accrual this
year versus last year, but it did have a pronounced impact Q3 this year.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: All right, very helpful. Thanks, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of Dennis McGill with Zelman & Associates.
<Q - Dennis McGill>: Hi, good morning. Was wondering if you could just talk about how you're thinking about the
pace of growth transitioning from 3Q into 4Q, if you take the approximately 6% comps this quarter and then the pace
down to, I guess, 4%-ish implied by the guidance.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Yeah, well, Dennis, I'll start. You know, certainly there's a couple of things that we spoke
about, certainly cycling against Superstorm Sandy last year and the sales associated with that. So that's obviously a
headwind in the quarter. As you know, most years, the fourth quarter is probably our most weather-susceptible quarter.
And so certainly not knowing what the weather is going to hold, last year, if you remember, the month of January had
extremely favorable weather. So we are cycling up against – even if it's not unfavorable weather this year, we are
cycling up against very favorable weather last year. So we took all that into account. And so it's just a case of always
wanting to be somewhat conservative because of the unknown that's out there. So I think all of those would be implied
into the top-line in the comp guidance that was in our updated outlook, so.
<Q - Dennis McGill>: Okay, and just based on that last comment on the conservatism, is it fair to say that November
so far is running above that guidance?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Yeah, I don't think you would have seen us take our guidance up if we weren't comfortable
with our outlook for the balance of the year, so.
<Q - Dennis McGill>: Okay. And then just secondly, can you elaborate a little bit more on the appliance promotion
headwind that you talked about in the quarter?
<A - Gregory M. Bridgeford>: Yeah, Dennis. This is Greg Bridgeford. I'll be happy to elaborate on that. It is a,
relative to larger ticket categories and Appliances is the key one, it is more of a promotional environment out there.
And there's a lot of media out there. And we indicated early on in the year we were going to drive at what we believe to
be an effective blend of traffic driving promotional activities and especially through the Sales & Operations Planning
process, make sure we were coordinated across the channels and across the messages we were sending, and especially
in-store. And that's what we did in Q3. It was as promotional as we expected it to be, and there's a – this is a peak
period for appliance sales, pre-Thanksgiving. So we did see – we performed well in Appliances, one of our
best-performing categories. And we're excited the addition of LG this year has meant a lot to be a leader in innovation
in appliances, with both LG and Samsung promoted and highlighted on our floors.

<Q - Mike A. Baker>: Hi, thanks. Can you hear me okay?

<Q - Mike A. Baker>: Great. So you talked about the large product discretionary sales still being below past peak. Can
you talk about – can you sort of quantify that where you are with the past peak and also the trough after the recession?
And I didn't hear, maybe I missed it, but I didn't hear you talk about growth in tickets less than $50 or greater than
$500, as you sometimes talk about.

non-discretionary, discretionary. And in the discretionary large ticket category, it really hasn't moved appreciably. We
are seeing in sales some movement but we think it's from a – it's a relatively small segment of the market right now that
has the income, that feels confident to spend on some discretionary categories. But, overall, we still think it's a slow
build because, as we tracked this through the last six years, we're still seeing that large discretionary spend inch up, as
opposed to make some significant leaps. Do you want to talk about it, too?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: I got it. Yeah, Mike, this is Robert. On the slides that we provided for you, that detail is in
those slides on ticket size, but I'll give it to you: less than $50, up 3%; $50 to $500, up 5.6%; and greater than $500, up
8.6%.
<Q - Mike A. Baker>: All right. Thanks. I haven't seen the slides yet. One more question, just longer term, I'd say this
quarter there was some incentive comp and other things, but can you remind us the kind of comp that you feel like you
need to leverage your SG&A, excluding all the one-timers that show up? Thanks.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Sure. Mike, we've talked about, generally speaking we need a one comp to get to a flattish and
then beyond that one point of comp drives roughly 20 basis points of EBIT growth. Obviously, in my response to Scot's
question, I mentioned there is some fluctuation quarter to quarter in how incentive compensation is accrued relative to
last year, so that had a pronounced impact this year. Also, in both Greg's and my comments, we talked about reset and
remerged activity. Think about that as preparing for next year's sales. We're creating Value Improvement resets and
customer experiences that are going to benefit Q4 and beyond. So that's not necessarily a periodic expense, more of an
investment for future sales.
<Q - Mike A. Baker>: Okay, but generally, we can keep that rule of thumb on an annual basis?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Generally speaking, yes.
<Q - Mike A. Baker>: Thanks.

Our next question will come from the line of Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: All right, you guys, thanks. Just one thing on the third quarter, you said that the earnings
were $0.05 better than your plan. I assume that the sales were favorable, but can you break it down a little bit, how
much of it was sales and then gross margins presumably a little less than you had anticipated? Just a little more color
around that? Thanks.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Sure, Pete, this is Bob. Our sales were roughly $300 million higher than our implied guidance
for the third quarter. The margin rate was modestly worse, largely due to the impact of the credit value proposition. The
performance in the customer take on the program continues to be above our expectations, which is a good thing. As I
noted, we had more than offset by lower promotional financing costs within SG&A. And then we only added roughly
about $20 million of SG&A higher than our implied guidance. So that really drove the $0.05 beat.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay. That's helpful, Bob. And then just a bigger picture question, just trying to understand
your current store portfolio and how it compares to how the company looked back in 2005, you know, when you guys
had your peak sales productivity and operating margins. I mean, you've added about 500 stores since then. Can you
help us understand that bucket of stores and how they're performing right now relative to the rest of the business? Are
they in line? Are they noticeably better? Are they lagging? What can you tell us about that?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So relative to 2005, our average sales since 2005 are roughly $37 million. The traditional big
box stores this year will do just a hair below $30 million. So to a degree, all boats have fallen, based on what happened
to housing in prior years. As we think about store performance, age of store is less of a predictor. It's more about

location of the store and the local market performance and the state of housing. Yes, there were some stores that were
opened in the 2006, 2007, 2008 timetable that underperformed some of those closed in 2011, but as we culled the

Your next question comes from the line of Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group.
<Q - Joe I. Feldman>: Hi, guys, good morning. I wanted to get a little more color on the Pro customer. I know you
mentioned the Pro Services were solid, but can you just give any more color on maybe how the trends were, percent of
sales, any incremental changes that you're noticing in maybe what they're buying, are they making bigger purchases on
the trips or not? Thanks.
<A - Gregory M. Bridgeford>: Joe, I'll start and then I know Rick's going to add in. We've seen, as we mentioned,
we've seen that particular segment of our customer base, you know, outperform any other segment. And that is
intuitive, given the strength of commercial sales in the marketplace today, as you look at any third party research.
We have a number of Pro initiatives going on. I'll start in merchandising. We've actually restructured our
Merchandising group to make sure that we are providing relevant commercial assortments, project-based assortments
that both have the breadth of product and the depth of product that we needed, thus the inventory investment we made
earlier this year. It was targeted to what we call the center of our store, which is Rough Plumbing, Rough Electrical,
Hardware, Power Tool Accessories, some of those categories that are key to commercial customer supply. Rick may
want to add in some comments on Pro.
<A - Rick D. Damron>: Yeah, absolutely. When you look at this, Joe, when you look at our Pro sales, we had strong
performance across all operating divisions and, as Greg mentioned, the sales of Pro continue to outpace our DIY
consumer, and did so again in this quarter. Our average ticket increased by $2.38 year-over-year, driven primarily by
ticket size and transaction, but ticket was the primary driver of the performance, growing at 8.9% when you look at it
from that way. We saw traffic increase in all ticket buckets, with the greatest amount being driven in the medium range
ticket growth area.
<Q - Joe I. Feldman>: Got it. That's great. Thanks, guys. And then another kind of similar question, I know you
mentioned that all regions were positive. I was kind of curious, again, if you look at what was selling in the various
regions, you know, are you seeing any big differences beyond the normal, like, you know, maybe when the housing
markets that are recovering a little faster at the moment, is what they're spending on different than some of the slower
recovery markets?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Yeah, this is Robert, Joe. We are seeing, obviously, as we said, widespread strength across
the country. Certainly, I have talked about California, Florida, Arizona, areas where you are seeing housing recover.
And as we've said, is you know, that one of the – we feel good about how the recovery is taking place out there in
housing. We expect that to continue through the fourth quarter and, obviously, into 2014. And one of the big drivers is
where home values are increasing, consumers are feeling better about moving gradually into larger and larger projects.
So whether that's in some markets, it may be windows, when they're doing work. There are other times it may be
refreshing the inside of the home, the bath, those type things.
Obviously, we highlighted a lot of the categories. We think about Flooring, Kitchen & Appliances, Paint, all of those
being above average for the company, or where we're seeing the consumer reinvest in the home. So we saw a nice
balanced strength across the country and we expect that to continue as housing values continue to recover.

<A - Gregory M. Bridgeford>: Joe, this is Greg, to layer onto Robert's comments, where we've seen some particular
category strengths in some of the areas where housing is on quite an upturn is in the Fashion Fixtures categories, and
Kitchens & Appliances. And it's really interesting because it's more of a refresh than a remodel activity. So you're
seeing some, you know, delayed, in some cases, it's projects that may have been delayed for four years, and in
particular parts of the country, where housing values have been on a rise for the last 18 months, the last 12 months. So
our focus is on bath refresh and kitchens and appliances, where the opportunity is available, and that did very well for
us in Q3.
<Q - Joe I. Feldman>: Perfect. That's really helpful, guys, thanks. And if I could indulge one more question, the
buyback trend seems a little bit slower than I think what we had initially thought. Any color you can provide there?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: No, I think, Joe, coming in here we said the buyback would be roughly pro-rata across the four
quarters. It was modestly lower in the third quarter, but we're still targeting 3.7 billion for the year, which is up 100
million from our thinking 90 days ago.
<Q - Joe I. Feldman>: Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys, for clarifying that. Good luck with this quarter.

Your next question comes from the line of Budd Bugatch with Raymond James.
<Q - Budd Bugatch>: Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. I guess I have two questions. First, on
Orchard Supply, what's implied in the guidance for Q4? And will it be accretive or how do you think about that?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Yeah, I'll start just with overall just reminding you and then I'll have, Budd, then I'll have
Bob jump into the guidance. As you know, we bought assets of 72 locations. We didn't buy the entire company. So
coming out of bankruptcy, we bought the assets of 72 locations. That's why they're not comps. We don't have prior
history built into the numbers. So it's just from the performance of those 72 locations, from the August 30 date going
forward. And so, Bob, what is built into their data?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Yeah, I think as we think about fourth quarter, Budd, should add about $125 million in sales or
about 110 basis points to sales growth. For the year, Orchard is going to be modestly dilutive, about $0.01 per share,
which does include the deal cost I mentioned previously.
<Q - Budd Bugatch>: And just on that, just to make sure, what was it in this quarter? Was it the $0.01 in this quarter
or would the $0.01 be in the fourth quarter, or is it half and half?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Half and half.
<Q - Budd Bugatch>: Okay. And my second question really goes to Appliances. You talked about 10 basis points of
margin degradation. Appliances are about 10% of your overall business, if it's still true as it was in 2012. That implies
that the overall Appliance margin was down about 100 basis points on the appliance sales. What's the outlook for Q4?
How does that impact overall gross margin? Are you going to get any help from the vendors? Maybe you can go into a
little detail of what's implied in your guidance and how we should think about all that.
<A - Gregory M. Bridgeford>: Yeah, Budd, I'll start. This is Greg. The focus on our work in Q4 is to make sure that
we can continue sales momentum. And I think we're always adjusting the balance of promotional activity from ticket to
traffic-driving and basket-building, and that's the work of that process I talked about today called Sales & Ops
Planning. So, as we move past Thanksgiving, you know, we move into seasonal categories. We move into, you know,
gift giving opportunities, like tools and hardware. We move into home fashions. We move into cleaning and home
organization. So we have to drive against those occasions appropriately and we're watching that balance very, very

carefully.
We're continuing to work on Value Improvement, which we're moving further down the cycle, virtually completing all
the resets at the end of this quarter and moving to stabilization on a significant, larger portion of the business. You
know, we have resets going on in Value Improvement in Q4, because we have capacity to reset, particularly in
December.
So when you put that body of work together, we recognize that there is opportunity in the Appliance category right
now. We're trying to manage it appropriately, through Sales & Ops Planning. We also have lots of other opportunities
on the occasion and we will carefully manage and, you know, lead the blend of that business.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Sorry. Thanks a lot and good morning. I'd like to start off by asking about the labor
investment and just get a sense from you as to the return on that labor investment that you think you extracted this
quarter and how that compares to your big picture expectations for that program.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Matt, I'll start just a little bit and then turn it over. Obviously, everything we're doing, we're
talking about Value Improvement, Project Differentiation, Labor, all of those things, I think, come together to see some
of what you're seeing in the comp performance that we've had out there. We're starting to see an improvement in our
close rates. So I think the investments are, I think, resonating with the consumer.
Certainly, as you know, our average customer doesn't shop every day. So when we went into this, we knew the
incremental labor investments, that it is something that the reaction from the customer would build over time. So, you
know, and I think we talked about, in prior calls, that, you know, it took us a little while to get the jobs filled with the
right people, ensure that everyone knew that they were permanent weekday positions that were out there. We feel really
good about where we're at now. And we're starting it to see the benefits of that. But, no, we knew it would be a drag at
this point, because, as we've said, we're making an investment really to build that experience that'll build over time, so,
Rick?
<A - Rick D. Damron>: Yeah, absolutely, Matt. One of the things I think that we've learned as we moved from the
first half of the year into the back half of the year is how we allocate those hours across the store. We communicated in
the initial rollout that they we were used as flex, moving across the store, interacting with customers throughout. As
part of the Sales & Operation Planning focus during the second half of the year, we allocated those hours into the
departments, as Greg highlighted, that we expect to drive incremental traffic to. So we're redeploying them more
specifically into areas, therefore, being able to provide greater depth of training into the areas they'll be focused on on
this quarter.
As Robert highlighted, the hours investment, along with Value Improvement and Product Differentiation, go to allow
us to capitalize on the market that is being driven in the marketplace. We went into the second quarter. We talked about
gaining momentum coming out of the quarter. Pleased to say that momentum continued throughout Q3, and drove
approximately 200 basis points of close rate improvement in Q3 compared to last year.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: If I could just follow up, I guess, on expenses more broadly, the incremental operating
margin that you drove this quarter, clearly, it was a bit light of where the Street was, I guess. And many of us look at
the numbers, excluding the impairments last year, I know those are real dollars, but we don't really build them into our
base. And I guess the labor investment and the incentive comp were probably the two outliers, I would guess, to Street
numbers. So, Bob, if you think about whether you view this quarter as sort of an outlier, from an expense growth
perspective, or whether this is sort of the run rate that you think we should consider would be very helpful color for the
go-forward.

<A - Robert F. Hull>: Sure, Matt. So you mentioned potential outliers from where the Street were, and the two items
you mentioned were incentive comp and labor investment. The third item I would give you is the reset and
remerchandising expense. So, as we think about our business, they're not all periodic expenses. As Robert mentioned,
with the labor-hour investment, just because you add somebody in a department today doesn't mean the customer
shows up the same day and they're able to interact with that associate. So some things do take time. As I mentioned
with the incentive comp, it's lumpy based on the rate of accrual going forward.
I think, Matt, in prior conversations, a lot of discussion regarding Lowe's ability to capitalize on the market, how well
are we doing from a comp sales perspective, how well are we doing from a market share perspective? For the first three
quarters of 2013, we are growing with the market, something we couldn't have said in prior years. We feel good about
that. As we think about investing in our business, we expect to generate returns on these investments, whether it's
SG&A or inventory. It just doesn't show up in the same quarter.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: And, consequentially, the dollar growth rate, would you expect it – I mean, clearly,
incentive comp is lumpy, but as you think about that impact of labor for the next couple quarters, should that persist
and just sort of wait for the business to build?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: The labor will persist until we cycle the investment last year. As was described previously, as
we think about the training and classification and positioning of those employees to better match up with the seasons
and the Sales & Ops Planning process to ensure that they're positioned for high likelihood to intercept with customers
and generate a return.

Your next question will come from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Morning. Two questions. First of all, I think within the numbers, if I remember right, the
October improved a little bit from September. And I know October is when the Sandy compare began. I'm just
wondering if you could give a little bit more color on the month of October in light of that. Were there are other areas
that improved in October that might be sustainable, or was more of your Sandy influence showing up later into
November?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Eric, relative to last year, we did have some Sandy improvement – sales associated with Sandy
towards the tail end of Q3 last year, obviously all hitting in October, not a substantial amount of money. As I think
about the rate of growth, I think we saw some improvement in some of the bigger-ticket categories in October, relative
to September. And Greg can provide...
<A - Gregory M. Bridgeford>: Yeah, we did, Eric. And one of the keys was some of the big-ticket categories related
to prepping home for the holidays began to kick in in October, real strength in Flooring, strength in Kitchen, strength in
Appliances, strength in Fashion Fixtures, and most specifically Fashion Bath. So that was some of the impact that you
saw sequentially from September to October.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Great. And then secondly, if you could give us a bit of an update of as you're working through
the line review process and wrapping that up here shortly, what the next phase of that might look like, how that is
continuing or evolving from the first effort, even the pace of what you're doing in those areas, as we move into 2014
and beyond, relative to what you've experienced over the last 12 or 18 months.

Page 13 of 14
<A - Gregory M. Bridgeford>: Yeah, absolutely, Eric. What you're seeing in the fourth quarter now is a completion
of the resets of what we would call the first round of accelerated product line reviews or Value Improvement category
programs. In some categories, we are actually in round three. So this is an ongoing process, but we have taken a step
back. And we did this beginning nine months ago. And we reset kind of the cadence of the process about six months
ago and said, here's the categories that we're going to go through full line reviews on at least an annual basis.
And, as you know, in some categories, Appliances, for example, because of new product introductions and staying on
top of innovations, we actually have to review categories, in some cases, more than annually on a cadence. In other
categories, we said we're going to review those on a mini basis, in excess of, more than – in excess of a year, 18 months
or a 24-month basis. And in some categories, we're going to go in and do some tweaks, some business reviews in those
categories on kind of a constant basis, but probably would be on a three-year rotation.
So we've really stratified the 400 categories into what's appropriate for those categories and where – but, again, it's an
ongoing process. The key is that if – and we all tend to forget the focus of why we're doing it. We're doing it to create
values from using the insights and the information that customers give us about the buying occasions that these
categories are represented in, and to drive better line design, and therefore, try and drive better productivity out of that.
So that's helped us quantify, you know, what's the timing of each one of these. Does that make sense?
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Yeah, and within the timing, I appreciate that. Within the strategy in implementing or executing
these, is it fair to say that, similar to the earlier part of today's discussion, that it's a little bit more balanced on achieving
market share progress in concert with margin and inventory progress? How is the balance of that different in the second
or third version of this, relative to the first?
<A - Gregory M. Bridgeford>: I think it is. What we're actually trying to drive through the ongoing improvements to
this category that Mike Jones is leading in Merchandising, is to go back and make sure we've utilized the consumer
insights in research, because line design, as the primary focus, we think has – we've hit the marks in a fairly large
percentage of the reviews, but we still have some improvements to make there. If we do that, we get that better balance.
We get better productivity out of the lines. We do achieve [ph] share (55:18), but we achieve better, what I would call,
operating margin flow-through.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Eric, this is Bob. Just two points back to your first question on monthly comp progression.
Looking back at Q3 last year, we did a 3.4% in September and a 1.3% in October. It's a little bit easier comparisons in
October as it relates to storm activity. In Q3 last year, we saw sales associated with Isaac and Sandy in Q3 2012
roughly offset by Irene sales in Q3 2011. So storm activity was relatively flat for Q3 last year. Regina, we've got time
for one more question.
Operator
Your final question will come from the line of Christopher Horvers with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher Horvers>: Thanks. Two questions, so big picture, you mentioned the 20 basis points of EBIT
margin expansion for point of comp above one, but to your point, Bob, as you think about next year, you get the major
reset expenses behind you, you're going to lap the incremental labor that you put into the stores and there should still be
a lag benefit from – to the gross margin line from the reset activities. So shouldn't that 20 bp rule look a bit better as we
get this stuff behind this?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: As we think about 2014 and we'll certainly provide a lot more color on 2014 on our Q4 call, as
we think about what's next beyond Value Improvement and the works of Bob Gfeller's organization in the Sales & Ops
Planning process, there will be some other investments in customer experience design. Some of that's taking place in
Q4 this year.

And then the second thing, as we think about 2014, Chris, as our prior outlook regarding 2013, 2014 and 2015, did not
have any expenses associated with the Affordable Care Act, we have open enrollment at this point in time. As we think
about the individual mandate and the number of employees that are on our insurance plans in 2014 relative to 2013, it's
still unknown. So we'll certainly provide more color on that and other initiatives on the Q4 call.
<Q - Christopher Horvers>: And then more as it relates to the fourth quarter, just to check my math, based on what
you said about the incentive comp pressure for the year, about 15 basis points, it looks like – does that imply about five
basis points or so of incentive comp accrual pressure year-to-year in the fourth quarter? And should the reset benefit the
gross margin, improve sequentially, given the number of categories through stabilization?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So, yes, as we think about the reset benefit, that should be greater because greater lines stabilize
in Q4 relative to Q3. Having said that, Greg noted this is peak time for appliances. As we think about Black Friday
morphing into black November, there's some risk on the margin line there that we're proceeding with caution.
As it relates to expenses, Chris, I'll give you some color on pushes and pulls for expenses for Q4. The biggest delever is
reset and remerchandising, call that 40 basis points. Risk Insurance, about 20 basis points, largely because we had huge
favorability Q4 last year; credit, about 20 basis points, again huge favorability Q4 2012 and then a similar deleverage in
operating salaries because of the labor hour investment offset by incentive comp leverage of roughly 10; some contract
labor impairment and legal benefits in the five to 10 basis point range.
<Q - Christopher Horvers>: Thanks very much.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Yep.
