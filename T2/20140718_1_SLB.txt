I will now turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat
Thank you, Simon. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call. Second-quarter earnings
per share from continuing operations excluding charges and credits was $1.37. This is an increase of $0.16 sequentially
and is $0.22 higher when compared to the same quarter last year, represents increases of 13% and 19% respectively.
During the quarter we recorded $205 million charge in discontinued operations relating to the potential resolution with
the governmental authorities concerning a historical matter. Please refer to the supplement information contained in our
earnings press release for further details.
Second quarter revenue of $12.1 billion increased 7.3% sequentially. Pre-tax operating income increased 10.7%
sequentially, while the pre-tax operating margins improved 67 basis points to 21.7%.
Sequential highlights by product group were as follows. Reservoir Characterization revenue of $3.1 billion increased
8.5% and pre-tax income grew by almost 18%. This resulted in margins improving by 233 basis points to 29.7%. This
growth was driven by a very strong performance in Wireline, improved WesternGeco Q-Marine utilization, and an
increase in SIS software sales.
Drilling Group revenue of $4.7 billion increased 7.4% and margin improved by 74 basis points to 21.1%. These
increases were largely attributable to robust international activity in M-I SWACO and a strong drilling and
measurement activity in North America and Russia.
Production Group revenue of $4.3 billion increased 5.5%. This growth was led by Well Services as a strong
performance internationally and in U.S. land more than compensated for the impact of this spring break-up in Canada.
Margins declined by 123 basis points to 16.7% primarily as a result of pressure pumping commodity inflation
combined with the impact of the Canadian spring break-up.
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 21.7% in the second
quarter compared to 22.6% in the previous quarter. We expect the effective tax rate for the full year of 2014 to be in the
low- to mid-20%s. However, this can vary on a quarterly basis due to geographic mix of business.
During the quarter, we generated $2.4 billion of cash flow from operations. For the first six months of this year, we
have generated $4.2 billion of cash flow from operations. This compares to $3.8 billion for the first six months of 2013.
As we have mentioned at our Investors Day, our investment in SPM business have now reached a point that starting
this quarter we have begun to report them separately in our cash flow statement. Similar to the way we report CapEx
and multiclient. While this change has no impact on our free cash flow, it does result in an increase in the amount of
cash flow from operations that we report.
Net debt increased $1 billion during the quarter to $6.1 billion. Significant liquidity events during the quarter included
$1.2 billion of stock repurchases, $522 million of dividend payments, and $922 million of CapEx excluding multiclient
and SPM. During the quarter, we repurchased 11.5 million shares at an average price of $101.85.
CapEx excluding multiclient and SPM is still expected to be approximately $3.8 billion in 2014 as compared to the
$3.9 billion we spent in 2013.
And now I will turn the conference over to Paal.
Paal Kibsgaard
Thank you, Simon. Our second quarter results were strong and fully in line with our expectations as international
activity rebounded in Russia, Norway, and Australia and North American activity grew offshore in the U.S. Gulf of

Mexico and on land in spite of the Canadian spring break-up.
As a result, second-quarter revenue grew 7% sequentially and 8% year-on-year, while pre-tax operating income
increased by 11% sequentially and 15% year-on-year.
Year-to-date, we continue to show solid growth in all our main financial indicators compared to last year with revenue
and operating income growing by 7% and 18% respectively, pre-tax operating margins expanding by 191 basis points,
earnings per share increasing by 22%, and with incremental margins at a solid 48%.
Several factors are contributing to the strength of this performance. These include additional market share gains at the
back of new technology sales and operational efficiency as well as service support from strong quality, cost and
resource management throughout our global operations.
Our overall financial results continue to demonstrate our leadership in technology, reliability, efficiency and
integration, which form the four components of our engine of our performance that we detailed at our June investor
conference in New York and which will continue to drive our corporate performance in the years to come.
In the second quarter we generated more than $1.2 billion of free cash flow bringing the year-to-date number to $1.9
billion, which is 35% higher than for the same period last year. The strength of our cash flow reinforces the confidence
we have in the financial targets we laid out at our June conference and will also enable us to further invest in the
business while increasing the cash we return to our shareholders.
Our international business continued to perform well in the second quarter with seasonal rebound of activity coupled
with growth in key markets leading to an 8% sequential increase in revenue while pre-tax operating margin expanded
by 122 basis points to reach 24%, a level not seen since the pre-financial crisis peak of 2008.
Compared to the second quarter of last year international revenue was up 7% when adjusting for Framo on the back of
strong growth in the Middle East and Asia and in Europe, Africa. In terms of pricing the international market remains
highly competitive and we have still not seen any signs of a general pricing inflection. However, our latest technology
and our best-in-class service quality continue to carry a premium, which together with the growth in integration related
activity is reflected in our strong top line and margin performance.
The premium in effective pricing together with our ongoing transformation programs focused on reliability and
efficiency puts us in a very competitive position in the international markets, which we are using to drive both market
share gains and further expand margins.
In Latin America, revenue was up 5% sequentially while margins were essentially flat with the previous quarter at
21.2%. Compared to the second quarter last year, Latin America revenue was down 3% driven by Brazil and Mexico
where the impact of lower activity and pricing were only partly offset by the strong activity in Argentina, Ecuador and
Venezuela. Pre-tax operating margins, however, was up 62 basis points due to careful cost and resource management as
well as our broad and diverse business portfolio in the region.
The stronger sequential revenue growth was recorded in Venezuela where we also renewed our payment agreement
with PDVSA during the second quarter. Compared to the same quarter last year our revenues in Venezuela this quarter
was up significantly while we at the same time have reduced both DSO and the absolute value of our receivables.
In Argentina, the strong sequential growth was driven by rig-based activity in the Vaca Muerta shale where we are now
seeing encouraging results from the application of new technology and workflows and where a continued focus on well
cost reduction is also improving performance.
In Ecuador, we continue to progress on the Shushufindi SPM project and during the quarter we also signed a letter of
intent for Group One of the mature fields tender with contract signature and ramp up of operations expected in the
second half of this year.
In Mexico, revenue fell sequentially and year-over-year due to lower overall rig count in the country, continued budget
restrictions in Pemex and as several of our IPM rigs in the South were shut down for the entire quarter due to local

social issues that are outside of our control. However, the activity outlook for the second half of the year is stronger as
we continue to ramp up activity on the new Mega Tender contract where we have gained significant market share and
as Pemex and the local government resolve the social issues impacting our IPM project in the South.
Middle East and Asia revenue increased 4% sequentially while margins grew by 151 basis points to 27.8%.
Year-over-year revenues increased by 12% and margins were up by 323 basis points. In the Middle East, sequential
revenue growth was again driven by Saudi Arabia where new well activity continues to expand supported by steady
growth in the rig count and where rigless activity is also increasing in a number of fields.
We continue to add resources and invest in additional infrastructure in the Kingdom to keep pace with the additional
work we are taking on, and with the capacity and capabilities we now have on the ground, our Saudi operations is
quickly becoming one of the largest and most advanced setups in our global portfolio.
Growth was also driven by the United Arab Emirates as activity continues to ramp up on our existing contracts together
with additional seismic and completion technology deployments.
In Southern Iraq, activity was, as expected, down both sequentially and year-over-year as commercial discussions
between the government and the international oil companies continue and where the situation was further complicated
by mounting civil unrest during the quarter. The worsening security situation led us to take additional measures to
protect our people and assets in the country, but beyond the additional cost and lower efficiency there has been no
impact on our ongoing operational capabilities. However, safety remains our top priority and we continue to monitor
the situation closely together with our security advisers and we are ready to take the appropriate actions should the
situation worsen further.
Activity in Northern Iraq on the other hand was strong in the second quarter driven by exploration drilling and we
expect growth in this part of the country in the second half of the year to offset the activity drop we are seeing in the
South.
Turning to Asia, we saw strong year-over-year growth in several geo markets driven by higher customer activity as
well as market share gains. The strongest growth was seen in Australia from continued land activity in Queensland,
successful completion of the first IsoMetrix seismic survey in the Great Australian Bight, and strong new technology
sales for both Wireline and Drilling & Measurements on exploration projects. In China, revenue was up sequentially
driven by strong offshore activity, seasonal recovery on land and our tight-gas SPM project in the auto space for
Yanchang Petroleum.
Still, year-over-year revenue was down in the second quarter due to slow down in activity in several land basins as
customers continue to review budgets and internal processes.
Looking at the second half of the year, offshore activity looked strong and land activity including the shale gas
development is set to pick up from current levels. However, we expect growth rates to be somewhat tempered until our
customers complete their internal reviews and spending plans are clarified.
In Europe, CIS, and Africa, revenue grew 13% sequentially with margins improving by 180 basis points to 22.1% as
activity rebounded from the first quarter seasonal lows. Compared to the same quarter last year, revenue grew by 4%
and margins were up by 158 basis points. Sequential revenue growth was driven by Russia where we saw strong
recovery in activity after a harsh winter.
The underlying activity outlook, both offshore and on land in Russia continues to look solid and with recent contract
awards in Sakhalin, we expect to finish the year on a strong note. Activity also increased strongly in the North Sea
driven by seismic and core rig-related services in Norway for a number of customers. In Africa, Sub-Saharan activity
was solid, in particular in Chad and Mozambique while in North Africa activity rebounded sequentially with growth in
both Algeria and Tunisia, but was partly offset by Libya where activity remained subdued.
In North America, revenue grew 6% sequentially in spite of the Canadian spring break-up and 16% year-over-year as
we continue to grow our market share on land in hydraulic fracturing, artificial lift, and drilling services. As we actively
expand our land business we are currently seeing some impact on our pre-tax operating margins which were down 53

basis points sequentially and 170 basis points year-over-year driven by additional costs related to supply chain and
transportation and on-boarding of several new companies.
However, these effects should be short-lived as we continue to implement our strategic plan for our North America
land business and in the process establish a broad and unique platform for profitable, technology-driven growth in the
coming years.
In our hydraulic fracturing business, we posted strong year-over-year revenue growth driven by market share gains,
further improvement in operational efficiency, as well as introduction of new technologies, which altogether more than
offset the effects of the spring break-up in Canada.
In terms of basic pressure pumping pricing, we saw some improvement in the second quarter, but this was contained to
newer basins with lack of service capacity and to customers where we still operate at very low margins. Still, the
pricing traction was partly offset by continued cost inflation for labor, sand and transportation and pricing discussions
with our customers, therefore, continues to have a strong focus on cost recovery at this stage.
In the second quarter we also saw further improvement in our land drilling product lines where the combination of new
technology introductions, new business models and new alliances are driving both market share gains and higher
operating margins.
In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico deepwater drilling activity was up sequentially due to the expected rebound from the
operational delays that impacted the first quarter. In the second half of the year the drilling rigs count growth will
flatten somewhat as some rigs shift to completions-related work, although we still expect to see revenue growth
through market share gains in several product lines.
The highlight of the quarter was undoubtedly last month's Investor Conference in New York where we set out clear
goals for continued strong growth and financial out performance over the coming years. Our plans are built on the four
key themes of technology, reliability, efficiency and integration with technology and integration driving superior
growth; and reliability and efficiency improving financial performance.
In terms of technology, we showed how our R&D transformation that started six years ago has led to a step change in
operational performance of our products and how we continue to accelerate the pace of new technology introduction
with flattening R&D investments. During the Investor Conference we also laid out full details of our reliability and
efficiency transformation programs and how this will change the way we manage our people, our assets and our
inventory as we look to further improve our financial performance.
Based on a set of realistic assumptions covering the global economy, the oil and gas markets and industry investment
levels, we are confident in our ability to continue our run of financial out performance and to deliver on the earnings
per share, return on capital employed and free cash flow targets that we laid out during the conference.
Turning our focus back to the remaining part of 2014, we continue to see a relatively constant mix of headwinds and
tailwinds in the global economy and in our industry, which leads us to maintain our already established outlook for the
year. The slow and steady recovery in the global economy is continuing and the global oil market remains relatively
tight with a solid demand outlook, continued supply uncertainty related to geopolitics and with Brent prices holding
steady above $100 per barrel, which should encourage oil-directed investments in both the North American and
international markets.
The North America natural gas market appears more comfortably supplied as U.S. production continues to grow and
storage levels gradually reconnects with historical averages, while the market balances in the international natural gas
markets remain more or less unchanged. We continue to expect well related E&P investment levels to grow north of
6% driven more by development and production-focused activities, while exploration spend will likely be flattish in
2014, driven by lower seismic expense as the IOCs focus on free cash flow generation.
Within this scenario, the growth and performance drivers that we outlined in late June amplified by our broad
geographical footprint, our balanced technology portfolio and our agile organization will enable us to outperform in
almost any market, whether in North America or anywhere else in the world. We, therefore, remain positive and

optimistic with respect to the 2014 outlook as we continue to aim for solid double-digit growth in earnings per share,
viewing this quarter's results as merely a stepping stone on the way to delivering the commitments we made in New
York.
Thank you. We will now open up for Q&A.
Simon Farrant
Thank you, Paal. Greg, we will now take questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please
go ahead.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Yes, thank you very much. Paal, I wonder whether you could just shed a little bit more light
about your comments on the cost structure in North America. We're seeing very large volumes of sand for example.
This can hardly carry the same margin as your technology offering. So how does this impact and how did it impact the
margins in the quarter? And how do you see that impacting margins in North America going forward when it comes to
the relative pricing power and ability to take your markup on sand costs and logistics?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Okay. Thank you, Ole. As I said, there are a lot of moving parts for us in North America at the
moment. So maybe I could just take you through the picture the way I see it. So, we have been focusing lately on
revenue and expanding our revenue base in North America land. At $3.9 billion at the quarter, revenue was up 6%
sequentially and 16% year-on-year, which is a record for North America in spite of the Canadian breakup. Now the
growth came from both efficiency and share, including pressure pumping, artificial lift, and drilling services. In
pressure pumping we added one more fleet during the quarter and that takes the total of eight additional fleets in the
past year. So we have clearly gained share in pressure pumping.
So the key here is to, like I said, expand the revenue and share base in North America land to further broaden our
platform for technology-driven growth in the coming years. Now with that, we see some temporary impact on margins
as we take on a higher proportion of somewhat lower margin businesses but we plan to drive margins up in the coming
quarters in these businesses through integration, scale, and new technology introduction. And like you said as well,
there were also some short-term additional costs linked to supply chain, for instance, on sand where we took some
higher costs because there were some significant changes in sand size and volume for several of our customers. And
also transportation had some higher costs due to the fact that we had a very high growth rate and transportation
availability become quite tight.
In addition to that, you have the Canada breakout and you also have somewhat lower multi-client sales. So all in all,
that drove the 53 basis point reduction, but our focus going forward again is to drive the margins back up but on a much
broader platform for revenue growth.
<Q - Ole H. Slorer>: Thank you very much, Paal.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thanks, Ole.

<Q - Jim D. Crandell>: Good morning. Paal, could you address the potential for sanctions impacting Schlumberger's
business in Russia?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, as of now, nothing has really changed for our position in Russia. Sanctions were
implemented early in the year. There were some new sanctions coming out this year. So far that has no real impact on
our business. So as of now, it's business as usual for us. In Russia so far this year, activity has been as planned or even
slightly stronger. The only change from the plan we laid out at the beginning of the year was the impact of the ruble,
which had a fairly significant impact in Q1, but the ruble rebound somewhat in Q2. So that's really only the main
change from the plan that we've seen so far in Russia. So as of now, no impact on sanctions and whether there will be
impacts in the future is a bit difficult to comment on, but as of now we continue business as usual.
<Q - Jim D. Crandell>: Okay. And one follow-up, Paal. Could you talk just a little bit about the recent announcement
of the deal with Precision Drilling and how quickly you think the U.S. can move to incentive pricing or some kind of
integrated model? And I guess would this in essence be shared with Precision or would Precision be working for you?
Or are there a number of different scenarios as you look forward?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: So part of the reason for doing this alliance with Precision Drilling is that both ourselves and
Precision Drilling believe that over time the North America land drilling market will move towards a general contractor
model, towards more of a well construction turnkey type of market. And in that set up, we have now established this
alliance where Precision Drilling will be the general contractor and we will rent them our downhole technologies. In
addition, we will train their people to run it and, obviously, we will own the equipment and we will maintain the
equipment for Precision Drilling. So we see this as an avenue to establish further penetration for our unique
technologies in the North America land drilling market and hence it's another good growth opportunity for us.
<Q - Jim D. Crandell>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you.
<A - Simon Farrant>: Next question, Greg?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Greg?
<A - Simon Farrant>: One moment while we check the line.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: There's no back up.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Anderson>: Thanks. Good morning. Paal, I just wanted you to just kind of expand a little bit about cost
pressures around your supply chain. I guess my first question is, are you able to pass through most of those costs right
now? You had said kind of near-term pressures. I'm just wondering is that because you're expecting to get those passed
through? Or is it also partly because kind of the way your transformation is set up it just takes a little while to kind of
absorb those and you start to see kind of better margins as we start to progress?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yes, David, I think in general we are able to pass through those costs. What happened towards
the end of Q1 and also into Q2 there were some significant changes in the way some of our customers operated in terms
of sand sizes, in terms of volumes. And these were basically somewhat unannounced and something we had to respond
to relatively quickly.
We managed to continue to support our customers and support our operations, but we took some additional costs in
order to do that. And over time, we are able to pass these on and a lot of them we managed to pass on towards the
second part of this quarter. But there were some short-term changes that resulted in additional costs for us that we
decided to absorb.

<Q - David Anderson>: All right. And then I guess my other question around that was around your logistics.
Obviously you have a very big logistics operation. As we see how North America progresses over the next several
years and in some of the cases we're seeing doubling of the amount of sanded wells, do you need to build that out
more? Are you satisfied? I guess I'm asking, are you satisfied with your logistics footprint, or is this an area where we
need to build up a little bit better?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: No. This is all part of the entire story that I'm talking about as well. We are gradually
expanding that to make sure that we can meet changes to how our customers want to operate but also a continuous
expansion of our business, right? So we continue to invest in that. And given the fact that we have grown so much over
the past year, as I mentioned eight additional fleets in the past four quarters, we are at the point now that we are
upgrading some of this as well and that is resulting in some additional costs in this quarter.
<Q - David Anderson>: Okay. Thank you. Real quick question. Simon, could you just tell me where the share count
was at the end of the quarter if you don't mind?
<A - Simon Ayat>: Okay. Well, the average for the quarter was 1.315 billion and this is a result of what we purchased
during the quarter, which is 11.5 million shares. So your question about the end of the quarter...
<Q - David Anderson>: Yes, just at the end of the quarter. Just help me understand that, yes.
<A - Simon Ayat>: I think towards the end of the quarter I have to confirm this figure for you will be about 1.38
billion.
<Q - David Anderson>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - Simon Ayat>: Good morning.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: So, Paal, on the analyst day, it certainly was clear that Schlumberger has decided that land rigs
are important to furthering your technology and you just discussed the Precision deal, but you acquired earlier in the
year 100% of Saxon. So can you talk about how that differs and the thoughts there in being able to integrate the rig
with the bottom hole assembly and the timeline to actually develop a newly designed rig and how many rigs could you
actually put into the market over the next three years?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, if I first address the alliance with Precision versus the acquisition of Saxon, so Saxon is
generally focused on the international markets. And that's the means that we are going to use to pursue the international
well construction market. As of now, we have decided to pursue the North America well construction market more
through alliances and that's where the Precision Drilling alliance comes into play.
So in terms of our investment into a new rig, or into new rig technologies, that is something we're just starting. So that's
going to obviously take a little bit of time before we have something to put into the market. So I can't give you a
specific number of how many rigs we will put into the market. But that would be when the rig is ready and we will then
just gradually add capacity as we have viable work for these type of rigs going forward. So we have two different
strategies, one for North America through the Precision Drilling type of an alliance and through our own rigs in the
international market.

<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Okay. Fair enough. And then on China you hit on it on your opening comments, but clearly
things have changed there with the recent events with the corruption of CNBC and the slowdown of Petro China. So
has that just changed your near-term outlook for China or your long-term outlook as well? And now do you believe it
could be difficult for the independent Chinese oil service companies to succeed in the region?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I can't really comment on how it's going to be for the independent Chinese companies,
but I would say that the main thing that is changing for us is the short term. We are still very bullish on the medium- to
long-term growth prospects in China. We are very well set up in China to be part of that through our technology and
integration capabilities. So, as these processes continue and hopefully draw to a conclusion over the next couple of
quarters, we see growth being tempered but beyond that I'm very bullish on China going forward.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Kirk LaMotte>: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Paal, if I could return to the Precision in North America
strategy question a little bit and maybe ask you to address it within the context of the joint venture that you did last year
with forest in the Eagle Ford. My understanding of that venture was that it was really about establishing a business
model in the U.S. of integrated services and control of project. Can you contrast that versus what we're seeing now in
the Precision arrangement, which looks more like Schlumberger as a supplier or vendor to general contractor?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, I think these are two different things. So within IPM, we have two different business
models; one is well construction and one is production management. And the Forest deal we did is a production
management type of deal where we are paid on a fee per barrel, while the alliance with Precision is more along the well
construction line side. So in some cases, we end up being the general contractor and we either own the rig or rent the
rig and deploy our services through that. Or in the case of Precision Drilling, we will be renting them our downhole
equipment, while they are the general contractor. So these are different permutations of the well construction model.
<Q - Michael Kirk LaMotte>: Thank you for the clarification. That helps. Simon, if I could ask a quick one for you
on Venezuela and the bolivar exposure. Paal in his prepared comments talked about the good performance even on
DSOs. Can you talk about what the currency impacts are there? And what they might be here in the third quarter?
<A - Simon Ayat>: So in the third quarter we don't have – in the third quarter our assumption that the exchange rate
for the bolivares will continue at the same rate that we are using today. And this is 6.3 bolivares to a dollar. Some of
our revenues are in bolivares and obviously some of the outstanding receivables are also in bolivares. If the exchange
rate will change, will definitely impact us. I don't know to what extent the exchange rate will change. We know about
the different exchange rates that are being used and we simulate our results on the various exchange rates. But for the
time being, our Q3 assumption is that there will be no change.
<Q - Michael Kirk LaMotte>: No change. Okay. Thank you.

<Q - James K. Wicklund>: If we could shift to Latin America, Mexico first if I could. Revenues were down, we all
know what's kind of going on in Mexico. You've won some projects, yet you mentioned you had some rigs down in the
IPM projects in the South. Can you kind of walk us through the next 18 months of what you expect to see happen in
Mexico?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: 18 months is a long time, Jim, but let's start off with H2. So, we see activity picking up in the
second half of the year and that's going to be primarily in marine but also in the north. We've had, in addition to the
Mega Tender also several service contract wins in marine and in the south, which is going to give us further market
share gains. So this year is still impacted by the budget constraints or PEMEX. So as we work through that we still see
growth in the second half of the year, but I believe most of these budget constraints as well as the rig shutdowns will be
sorted out over the next one to two quarters. So while I expect growth in the second half of the year, I'm still a lot more
optimistic about 2015 and hope that we can get back on track to have a really good year next year in Mexico.
<Q - James K. Wicklund>: Through 2015 covers my 18 months. I appreciate that. Now can you do the same thing for
me for Brazil considering the drilling contract is now being re-tendered? Do we expect that really to switch over at the
end of the year? And what's the implication for your idle equipment in Brazil if that happens?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: First of all, we don't have any idle equipment in Brazil. We don't hold idle equipment around
in various countries. If it's idle, we put it into the pool and put it to use. But in Brazil, this year is obviously
significantly down, both due to pricing and significant lower activity. There might be some uptick in 2015, but I'm not
as optimistic on the improvement in 2015 in Brazil as I am in Mexico. I think we will see improvement in activity
partly due to the drilling activities surrounding the Round 11 exploration awards, which is going to start for some of the
IOCs in 2015 and there could also be a chance that Petrobras will increase some of their activity. But I'm a bit more
guarded on how great 2015 will be in Brazil. And for these two contracts that are now tendered, I expect them to be
quite competitively bid again. I don't think there's going to be any dramatic change to that. Now we'll see what
happens.

Your next question comes from the line of Doug Becker from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Douglas L. Becker>: Thanks. I wanted to circle back on North America. First quarter was impacted by weather.
We saw second quarter impacted by some of the supply chain sand, labor issues. Just any quantification in terms of
what type of impact we have here that would be outside the norm?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I can't give you that. Like I reviewed in I think the first question from Ole. There is a lot of
moving parts from us. Supply chain has some impact, but there's a lot of other moving parts that I just reviewed. So I
can't break it down for you but with all the moving parts, 53 basis points down isn't dramatic and we are quite confident
that we can improve margins going forward from this point.
<Q - Douglas L. Becker>: Sure. Maybe just order of impact between supply chain, sand, labor? Just [indiscernible]
(40:16).
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: No. I'm not going to break it down any further.
<Q - Douglas L. Becker>: Okay. And then just circling back on Latin America, just an update on the mobilization for
the Mega Tenders, is that on pace to be complete this year, or do we actually maybe see some margin improvement in
the fourth quarter as that winds down?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: No, we are on track with mobilization for that. So a fair bit of the equipment that we needed
for those contracts we already had in country. So at this stage, we are operating 10 rigs across three projects for the

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons & Co. Please go ahead.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Morning.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: A question with regard to international revenue outlook for the second half of the year.
First half broadly speaking we were up about 5% year-over-year. What do you think would be a reasonable expectation
for second half on a year-over-year basis?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, if you correct for Framo, which was counted as revenue in H1 of last year and obviously
now as a minority interest in one subsea this year, our international revenue was up 7% in H1.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: And we expect that at least to continue in the second half of the year.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Okay. And a similar question, incremental margins were about 75% year-over-year, I
mean stunningly strong. I expect them to moderate for the second half of the year. But I guess the question is, I know
your target through 2017 on a consolidated basis is 40%, but it just seems to be that the execution is generating
considerably stronger incrementals than frankly most seasoned observers have been expecting.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, was there a question? Or...
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Yes, I guess a observation and the question is the sustainability of what we've seen the
first half. I'm modeling a considerable moderation and that's what the Street estimates convey and yet you continue to
outperform markedly on front.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Fair enough. Fair enough. So H1, like you said, I think we're about 65% incremental. So I
think it's fair to say that there might be some moderation in the second half of the year. Now we are working very hard
on keeping these incrementals up and the strength of our position internationally should allow us to have higher
incremental margins than obviously what we see in North America. Whether it's going to go down from the 65%?
Potentially it could, but we are going to do our best to keep it as high as possible.
<Q - William A. Herbert>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Tillery from Tudor Pickering Holt. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to follow up on North America outside of the supply chain side.
You mentioned on-boarding of some of the acquired companies. If you could just talk about the Artificial Lift business
in aggregate, a dozen different companies in rod lifts, where are you in the continuum of bringing everything to some
sort of standardization or getting your manufacturing and operational efficiency where you want to be? And what sort a
timeline do you think that occurs on?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: That's a good question. So we are in the early phases of bringing everything together. So we
are not looking to integrate each of these 12, 13 companies into one completely unified entity. They are working in
different basins. They all have their individual setups. So we are looking to consolidate supply chain as much as

possible and also take the best practices from the individual companies and try to populate them across all the different
companies. So this is going to be done gradually and I still think it's going to take us probably a good 12 to 18 months
to get everything set up exactly the way we want. But these companies are well run. It is a different business than what
we have been in the past and we are also partly learning some of these things as we go into it. But I would say it
probably will take us at least another 12 months to get the setup up exactly the way we want it.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: And then you referred on the last conference call too you have to be in the game in order to change
it from a technology standpoint. How should we think about that timeline for introducing new technology in that
business? Does that come post that 12-month period or should we look for some markers here in the interim?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: What we are gradually doing now is to bringing our ESP business closer together to these rod
pump companies because we still believe that there is a period of utilization for different type of lift solutions
throughout the life of the well. So by having a very good footprint when it comes to rod pump market share, it should
be easier for us to penetrate this market in the early phase of the wells before you put the rod pump on the well with our
ESP. So the first step in getting more technology into this is to increase the penetration of ESPs on that rod pump.

Your next question comes from the line of Waqar Syed from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Waqar M. Syed>: Thank you. Paal, there have been some comments out of some major operators in the
Norwegian area about maybe re-looking at their capital spending. What's your outlook for Norway for the second half
and maybe more also into the 2015?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, if we focus on H2, I mean, for the summer months, we expect a normal impact from the
rig maintenance both in the UK and Norway. But, as of now we have a solid activity outlook for the remaining part of
the year in Norway. We have some good contract wins recently. There are some other work that is out for bid that will
probably be awarded relatively soon, some of these contracts are key for us. So we are hopeful that we will be
successful in winning them. So I think overall I'm positive on the activity outlook for Norway for the second half of the
year.
<Q - Waqar M. Syed>: Okay. And then in Kara Sea there is some important drilling going on. Are there any
discussions going on regarding anything follow-up beyond the first well right now? Or is it too early to have that till we
see the results from the first well?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: You talking about Russia?
<Q - Waqar M. Syed>: Yeah, that's right.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I don't know the detail of the specific well you're referring to, but I am aware that there is good
activity in the Arctic in the second half of this year. Going into 2015, I don't have any detail visibility yet, but there is
strong focus on advancing both these exploration and development programs in the Arctic in Russia, and we are
actively participating in that.

<Q - Brad Handler>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<A - Simon Ayat>: Good morning.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Couple of questions related to seismic, please. Obviously you've laid out your macro view and
that's very helpful but noted that multiclient sales in the second quarter were particularly soft. I guess they haven't been
this soft in a few years and I'm curious if you can put that into some greater context for us and give us a sense of, if that
has implications for your views on the fourth quarter, which is obviously where it's seasonally strongest generally? And
then secondly, just perhaps overall for the year, I think you signaled that you expect seismic to be down for the industry
but I'm not as clear if that's what you expect for yourselves as well or are some things like IsoMetrix and other factors
helping you out on a relative basis?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Okay. If we started with multiclient, like you said multiclient revenue in Q2 was weaker than
we expected. At $133 million this is down 47% year-on-year, which is quite significant. It is not surprising that
multiclient revenue falls when there is basically added scrutiny on exploration and seismic spend. But we are now at
the lowest level that we've seen since 2009 just following the financial crisis, right? But we managed to absorb that
reduction in the second quarter and still deliver on the quarter, which I'm pleased with.
In terms of the rest of the year, I expect Q3 to be fairly similar to Q2. I don't expect any significant improvement. There
should be a year in effect. It might not be as high as what we saw in 2013, but I still expect there to be a surge towards
year-end but potentially lower. In terms of the overall outlook for seismic for us, we also expected to be down in terms
of overall revenue for this year. And it's driven then partly by multiclient and also through Q-Marine where we at this
stage have gone from 15 vessels at the beginning of the year down to 13 vessels at the end of Q2. And we plan to
reduce also down to 12 vessels in Q4. So we are doing this to maintain profitability and utilization and we'll continue to
look at further vessel stacks if it's necessary.
<Q - Brad Handler>: Got it. Thank you very much. Very helpful.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Sanchez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Paal, I wanted to ask you just quickly on your offshore revenue growth outlook here. I mean
clearly the offshore revenue component is very important for Schlumberger. And just how are you seeing that unfold
here versus maybe where you were at the beginning of the year given the fact that we've certainly seen some utilization
challenges on the floater side as new capacity has come into the market and certainly you mentioned again the demand
waning here on the IOC side. Has there been any material changes as you think about revenue growth here for you?
What should the market externally look at? I mean, because clearly we see the utilization numbers and we're able to
track that. We know day rates have come down significantly. We know you've got share opportunities here that you're
gaining. I mean, how do we think about the offshore revenue shrink for Schlumberger?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Well, if you look at the international market, so far this year we're seeing about 6% growth in
rig count on land as well as 6% growth in rig count for the conventional offshore. Now deepwater is basically two
stories. We have Brazil, which is down about 27% year-to-date while the rest of the world is also up about 6% which is
similar to the conventional offshore. So there's really no change to what we expected going into the year. We had
factored into our deepwater plans some lower utilizations as we were expecting these commercial discussions on rig
rates to lead to lower utilization. Some of these discussions have concluded actually quicker than what we thought and I
think that has a positive impact on the utilization versus what we assumed, but really nothing dramatic. We expected

And your final question today comes from the line of Rob MacKenzie from IBERIA Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - Rob J. MacKenzie>: Hey, guys. I guess I've got a little bit of a different question for you on the lift business than
what you've had so far. My question is centered around your view of where that business develops over time. Because
clearly, obviously, buying rod lift companies and the dumb iron, if you will, associated with that is not something that,
it's something Schlumberger has typically been interested in in the past. Is there another angle here we should be
looking at mainly perhaps making it more of a service delivery business through the life of a field versus just a pure
equipment sale business? What's your vision for where that segment goes?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Hi. It's a very good question. I think there are two things to be said about that. Firstly, I think
over time, there are things that could be done to advance the technology that is used. Now I think you will be needing a
range of technologies because the flow rates of these wells, they vary gradually with time. But I think there are things
that could be done both on the ESP side and on the PCP rod lift side, which we are working on. So that's on the
technology itself.
But the other part is the business model like you alluded to. And our view of this for the future would be that we
potentially, ultimately can sell lift, so we will take on a well and we will basically have a business model where we are
paid on production for uptime and our ability to maximize production through the optimal lift solution for the well. So
that is our view on the future, that's why we're getting into this. And again, changing the game will have to be done
from within. Rod pumps are going to be key in this, based on the install base in North America land. But I think there is
opportunity to optimize the technology and there is also a very good opportunity to potentially change the business
model over time.
<Q - Rob J. MacKenzie>: Great. And how would you help us think about how that trajectory looks? How long it
takes, pace of adoption and so on and so forth?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: It's a bit difficult to predict on that Rob. What we are focusing on now is to basically
consolidate all these companies that we have bought, gain a further understanding of the markets, and get closer to this
