Satya Nadella
Thank you, Chris. Good afternoon, everyone.
Three months ago I outlined how Microsoft is the productivity and platform company for the mobile first, cloud first
world. Since then, we have galvanized around this direction and are executing well.
I'm proud of the results we have delivered this quarter across all businesses. Results are up in every category from
commercial to consumer to hardware. With $23.2 billion in revenue for this quarter, we are off to a great start to the
year. More importantly we're also pleased with the progress we've made in evolving our culture to be fast, innovative,
partner-friendly and customer-obsessed. As I reflect on this past quarter, there are four important indicators of progress
that I want to highlight: cloud, Windows, hardware, and finally I'll talk about our ecosystem momentum.
First, our cloud offerings continue to grow at a rapid rate. More people and organizations are signing up and we are
generating more revenue across both commercial and consumer customers. Our commercial cloud revenue grew 128%
year-over-year, the fifth consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth. In fact, we're the only company with cloud revenue
at our scale that is growing at triple-digit rates. And 80% of the Fortune 500 are now on the Microsoft Cloud. Office
365 commercial seats nearly doubled. Two out of every three new customer seats are Premium versions. Consumer
Office 365 now exceeds 7 million subscribers, up more than 25% for the last quarter alone.
We've continued to invest in growing our leadership position in areas with great opportunity. To that end, we are
expanding our data center capacity to meet demand, provide the best customer experience, enable data sovereignty and
deliver continuous innovation. Azure has seen robust growth, because of our unique approach, as the only hyperscale
public cloud provider with enterprise-grade capabilities and true private cloud and hybrid cloud offerings.
We continue to add new features and capabilities faster than ever, based on user feedback cycles. One major Azure
service or feature is released every three days on average, opening up many more new user scenarios for our customers.
Our premium services on Azure create new monetization opportunities in media, data, machine learning, advanced
analytics and enterprise mobility. More than 60% of the Azure customers are now using at least one of these premium
services, such as Enterprise Mobility Suite, which is off to a very fast start.
Startups and ISVs love our open and flexible approach and are building on Azure at a rapid pace. In fact, 40% of Azure
revenue now comes from startups and ISVs. Even with our tremendous growth in public cloud, we are still seeing
strength in our on-premise businesses with double-digit growth across Windows Server, SQL Server, Systems Center
and Dynamics. This is because of the unique hybrid and private cloud capabilities that are built into our servers.
The second indicator of progress is the improvement in the overall health of the Windows ecosystem in the first
quarter. We introduced an expanded set of Windows offerings, which helped drive consumer unit growth in quarter
one, and will provide incremental opportunities for use of Microsoft services such as Bing. With these new offerings,
OEMs are delivering exciting new devices at extremely attractive price points, including Windows PCs at $199 and
below.
In September, we took the first steps in publicly sharing more about the next generation of Windows. Windows 10 will
unlock new experiences for customers to work, play and connect across an incredibly broad set of devices, with screens

from 4 inches to 80 inches and even IOT devices. Windows 10 will deliver a single, unified application development
platform, one way to write a universal app across the entire family of Windows devices, and one store with a unified
way for applications to be discovered, purchased and updated across all these devices.
Think about it – with Windows 10, developers can build one app that spans billions of devices. When I talk about
putting customers at the center of everything we do, it's especially true for Windows. We're incorporating customer
feedback earlier than ever in the development cycle especially with our enterprise customers. This will be the best
Windows release ever for businesses and with hundreds of thousands of pieces of feedback flowing into the team
already, Windows 10 will be the most collaborative version of Windows we have ever shipped.
Third, I want to highlight some specific markers of advancement in hardware and gaming. Across the entire hardware
portfolio, I'm encouraged by the reception from customers and our continuously improving execution. Surface had
strong results this quarter, driven by positive customer response to Surface Pro 3. The product lineup is the right one
and customers are responding favorably. Surface Pro 3 is now in 28 markets and importantly we have improved the
business economics of this product line.
With phone, we have moved quickly to integrate the business. We are executing on all of the restructuring changes we
talked about in the last quarter while driving Lumia share growth. We saw modest growth over the prior year driven by
sales in Europe, where we gained share with lower price devices.
Now let's talk gaming. As I've previously said, gaming is an important category that will drive additive business value
for Microsoft. It is the single biggest digital life category measured in both time and money spent across devices of all
types. We launched Xbox One in 28 markets, increased console unit sales from a year ago, and grew users of Xbox
Live apps by more than 20%.
The acquisition of Mojang, which we expect to close in November, extends our ecosystem and community across
multiple platforms. Minecraft adds to our already strong portfolio of first party games and content such as Halo and
will strengthen our gaming experiences on PCs and consoles as well as cross platform monetization.
The fourth and final area I want to focus on today is the renewed energy and momentum in our partnerships. As a
productivity and platforms company we create vast opportunity for our partners. We are moving fast to extend our
platforms and tools to reach more customers through partnerships. From SAP and Oracle to Salesforce, Adobe and
IBM, to the latest partnerships we announced this past week with Docker, Cloudera and CoreOS.
Great partnerships emerged from great products, strong momentum and a shared enthusiasm about our long-term
vision. Technology leaders across the board recognize the customer value inherent in products like Office 365, Azure
and Windows and they want to align their businesses with our healthy and growing ecosystem. You'll see more
partnerships in the months ahead. It's the best way to deliver the best possible experience for our customers in today's
heterogeneous mobile first, cloud first world.
In summary, I'm pleased with the progress we are making. Teams all across the company are rallying around our core
focus to reinvent productivity and create platforms for a mobile first, cloud first world. We will continue to drive the
changes that will position us for the future. We will be accountable to our customers, partners and shareholders, and we
will be relentless in looking for areas to invest for long-term growth.
With that, Amy will go through our Q1 results in detail. And share our outlook for Q2, and then I'll join her for Q&A.
Thank you very much.
Amy Hood
Thanks, and good afternoon, everyone.
As Satya said, we had a very strong start to the fiscal year. We made meaningful progress with improved execution
across all our businesses. I'm encouraged by what we have received – achieved and believe we are well positioned for
the future. With that said, let me take you through the financial highlights of our first quarter.

Revenue was $23.2 billion, up 25% over last year and up 11% excluding phone. Earnings per share were $0.54 which
included an $0.11 negative impact from integration and restructuring expenses. Excluding that impact, EPS grew 5% to
$0.65, even after considering the impact of the phone business on profits.
We are accelerating the pace of decision-making and taking decisive actions to improve how we operate. This approach
is reflected in the progress we've made in restructuring the company and integrating our phone business. As a result, we
incurred charges of $1.1 billion this quarter.
Geographically we saw strong performance across the U.S. and Europe and consistent with Q4, a more challenging
environment in China and Russia. Let me now discuss our results in greater detail.
Our commercial business had another strong quarter. Revenue grew 10% and unearned revenue grew 12%. Renewal
rates were higher than what we've seen independent in recent first quarters and at Office, one-third of renewals
included Office 365. Importantly, we are seeing a mix shift from on-prem to the cloud, from transactional purchasing to
annuity, and from standard to premium versions.
Our commercial cloud services continued their exceptional trajectory with another quarter of triple- digit growth. We're
investing in higher level services and new scenarios in Azure, enabled by the scale, cost and flexibility of the cloud.
These services are expanding our addressable market. We're adding new users and importantly, growing revenue from
existing on-prem customers who have adopted Azure services.
Our on-prem data platform infrastructure products continue to have strong momentum with an ongoing shift to
premium versions. Revenue from premium SKUs was up 25% this quarter. Office 365 had another terrific quarter and
remains on path to becoming the unparalleled leader for cloud-based productivity apps. CIOs are selecting Office 365
as the centerpiece of their hybrid productivity solutions as they look to meet the growing mobile needs of their
employees. SMBs are also realizing the benefits of Office 365 and as a result, are moving from transactional
purchasing to subscription. And, as Satya mentioned, we're seeing good partnership momentum as other companies
look to integrate Office 365 into their products.
Turning to Windows. Windows OEM Pro revenue performed in line with the business PC market and volumes were
more consistent with those seen before the XP refresh in fiscal 2014. Windows volume licensing grew 10% as business
customers continued to value the platform's security and manageability.
During the quarter, we took important steps to grow Windows usage and improve the health of the ecosystem. Both our
existing and new OEM partners are bringing to market an expanded set of device offerings at more competitive price
points. Channel inventories are higher than they were last year, reflecting confidence from our OEM partners heading
into the holiday quarter.
IP licensing revenue declined this quarter as our licensees sold a higher mix of low cost devices, which generated lower
per-unit royalty. Consumer Office revenue, inclusive of our subscription offerings, grew 7% this quarter. Within this,
we saw an accelerated transition to Office 365 Home and Personal, which contributed to a decline of traditional Office
license revenue. Overall it's important to note that we continued to grow attach to consumer devices.
In Bing, revenue was driven by both volume and rate growth. We again delivered double-digit monetization gains
driven by investments in core relevance and ranking algorithms. These improvements keep us on the path to Bing
profitability in fiscal 2016, and consistent with prior quarters, display revenue remained under pressure.
We are excited by Surface Pro 3 performance as unit sales are pacing at twice the rate of what we saw with Pro 2.
We're seeing strong interest from students, professionals and increasingly, enterprises who are replacing their laptops
and tablets with Surface Pro 3 for their productivity needs. Gross margin for Surface was positive this quarter.
Within gaming, our results reflect a growing console market. Our improved competitive position with the new Xbox
One SKU and launch of Xbox One into new geos including the initial channel fill for the launch in China at the end of
Q1. As we head into the holiday season, we're looking forward to the differentiated content that will be available on the
Xbox platform, including Sunset Overdrive, which launches in late October and Halo: Master Chief Collection, which

launches in early November.
In phone hardware, the focus of the quarter was on positioning the business for the future, and we remain committed to
reaching breakeven in fiscal 2015. As part of our restructuring efforts we started rightsizing our manufacturing
capacity, created one development team to accelerate the pace of innovation, and focused our sales and marketing
efforts on Lumia, which grew in several key markets.
Sales of non-Lumia phones were down, driven by declines in the underlying feature phone market as well as the
portfolio rationalization as we execute on our phone strategy. Gross margin this quarter included the benefit of
non-recurring items resulting from our business integration efforts.
Operating expenses were favorable to our expectations as we chose to redeploy spend to projects occurring later this
fiscal year. These decisions reflect our disciplined assessment as we prioritized where to best allocate our resources.
Importantly, we continue to invest in developer and customer facing roles to capture the opportunities in key growth
categories such as the cloud, big data and the Internet of Things. Our effective tax rate was 23% this quarter influenced
by the changing mix of our business as well as NDS operating losses and restructuring charges, some of which are not
tax deductible.
This quarter, we had $1.3 billion of capital expenditure. We continue to expand the capacity and locations of our data
centers to deliver higher service levels, reduce latency and help meet local data compliance requirements for our global
customers. Importantly, even while making these investments, we continue to grow the gross margin of our cloud
business.
This quarter, we increased our capital return by 19%, with $4.6 billion returned to shareholders through buy-back and
dividend. As we said in September, the board and management continue to assess our broader capital allocation
strategy as we focus on increasing long-term shareholder value. With that overview, of the current quarter let me now
turn to our outlook for the second quarter, starting with foreign exchange.
Foreign exchange did not have a material impact on our Q1 results as movements were relatively late in the quarter.
The following guidance is based on current FX rates and should the U.S. dollar continue to strengthen it will create
headwinds in our foreign transactional business. The impact of FX in our annuity business would first be reflected in
deferred revenue as it is based on rates when the contract is billed, and then into the P&L at that same rate, as the
revenue is recognized.
Now moving onto guidance, starting with Devices and Consumer, in licensing, we expect revenue to be $4.0 billion to
$4.2 billion. Remember, in Q2 of last year we recognized about $650 million of revenue from our commercial
agreement with Nokia, which has ended. While revenue recognition for the agreement was heavily weighted to Q2
based on contract terms, COGS were recognized ratably over the course of the year. Consistent with the current
quarter, IP licensing revenue will reflect lower per unit royalties with the changing mix of devices sold by our
licensees.
With the addition of Office 365 consumer services in Japan, the transition from traditional licensing to a subscription
service will negatively impact revenue by approximately $100 million in Q2. We expect the ongoing business PC
refresh cycle to continue, though comparables are challenging as we began to see the benefit of XP end-of-support in
Q2 of last year. We expect that the consumer PC market will remain stable, with many of the same dynamics we saw in
Q1.
In Computing and Gaming, we expect revenue to be $3.5 billion to $3.8 billion. This range reflects growth in Xbox
One consoles over the last year, but a mix shift to lower price SKUs announced last June. With the momentum we are
seeing with Surface Pro 3 we expect units to grow sequentially.
In phone hardware we expect revenue to be $2.0 billion to $2.2 billion. This range anticipates both year-over-year and
sequential growth in Lumia units driven by the 500 and 600 series devices. As a result of the ongoing market dynamics
and our portfolio rationalization, we expect both volume and ASPs of non-Lumia devices to decline in Q2.

In Devices and Consumer Other we expect revenue to be $2.3 billion to $2.4 billion, which includes growth from
Office 365, the launch of Halo: Master Chief Collection, and continued monetization gains in Bing.
In Commercial Licensing we expect revenue to be $10.8 billion to $11 billion which includes a slight drag from prior
years' estimated XP impact. With the accelerated shift to our cloud services, we expect Commercial Other revenue to
be $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. Overall, we expect our fundamental strength in our Commercial business to continue.
And in Corporate, we expect about $300 million of positive revenue impact next quarter as we recognize prior period
deferrals related to bundled offerings. We expect COGS to be $9.5 billion to $9.9 billion, with variability driven by
both hardware segments. We expect second quarter OpEx to be between $8.6 billion and $8.8 billion. As I mentioned
earlier, our Q1 favorability was primarily driven by the timing and our continued prioritization of activities. Therefore,
we still expect full year operating expenses to be $34.2 billion to $34.6 billion as we remain committed to investing and
prioritizing growth areas where we have customer momentum.
Over the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect to incur an additional $500 million of expense related to our
restructuring efforts. This results in total charges of roughly $1.6 billion, the high end of the range we provided in July.
Separately, we are reducing our anticipated integration expenses, down to $100 million per quarter for the remainder of
the fiscal year.
As a reminder, other income and expense includes dividend and interest income offset by interest expense and the net
cost of hedging. We expect these items to generally offset one another. We now expect our full- year tax rate to be
between 20% and 22%, including the impact of integration and restructuring. In Q2, we expect CapEx to sequentially
increase in support of our growing Cloud business.
As you know, we typically see a decline from Q1 to Q2 in our unearned revenue balance. This Q2, we anticipate a
slightly higher sequential decline in our noncommercial segments. This is primarily due to the $300 million impact
from revenue recognition in Corporate that I referenced earlier. We expect Commercial unearned to be in line with
historical trends, with some of the benefit of our business model transition to annuity offset by FX rate impacts.
In closing, this was another quarter of continued growth and disciplined execution. Across the company we're making
thoughtful, data-driven decisions to continually assess and prioritize our resources. We're also investing to accelerate
momentum in key strategic areas and to capitalize on emerging trends. We are making great progress in reshaping our
company and I'm encouraged by the opportunities to continue to create long-term shareholder value.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Chris and we can move to Q&A.

question.
<Q - Brent Thill>: Thanks. Good afternoon. On the Commercial revenue, it continues to grow at an impressive
double-digit rate. Many of your peers have not been doing quite as well as you have, just in the last reported quarter.
And Amy, I know you mentioned you were confident about this business continuing. I'm curious if you could just
maybe underscore what you feel you guys are doing differently than what's happening in the peer group and
underscoring that confidence going forward?

<A - Satya Nadella>: Let me start. Overall, what we see is the increasing competitiveness of our products. I think
that's really what's reflected in our results. The cloud story, I think is fairly clear at this point. The combination of
Office 365 as well as Dynamics CRM in particular, combined with Azure, are driving our cloud growth. As it turns out,
the technology that we build for our cloud is what we incorporate in our server products. In fact, our R&D expense is
the same expense. And that's made our server products very competitive. And so against some of our traditional
competitors, we are seeing significant share gains across the entire infrastructure line of our server products in
particular.
And we've also architected our cloud very differently. We are the only hyperscale cloud provider that also thinks of our
server products as the edge of our cloud. So some of the hybrid capabilities of our servers have increasing attach and
that's also leading to overall competitiveness as well as monetization and margin. Those are the trends we've seen in
our numbers. We live in the same macro environment as the rest. But right now, we are confident about our
competitiveness driving our results.
<Q - Brent Thill>: Thank you.
<A - Chris Suh>: Thanks, Brent. We'll take next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Mark L. Moerdler>: Thank you, and congrats on the quarter. Two quick questions on – relating to cloud. Amy,
can you give us a sense of what the revenue run rate for the commercial cloud was this quarter? And Satya, could you
give us a little more on the use cases for Azure? Is it more test and dev or are you seeing most of it being on the
production side? Thanks.
<A - Amy Hood>: Thanks, Mark. As you know, we gave our run rate at the end of last quarter at $4.4 billion, and the
quotes we've said in our numbers have us on that continued trajectory as we head for Q1. So I think the pace and our
accomplishments in share gains remain on a good trend line.
<A - Satya Nadella>: And as far as the use cases, right now it's actually pretty diversified. We talked pretty
extensively about the customer case studies at our cloud event last week, and it turns out that we have ISVs, in many
cases, driving new applications on top of Azure.
There are businesses, like for example NBC that are reinventing their business models on top of Azure. We have
customers using us for true hybrid, if you were deploying, for example a SQL Server, you can have high availability
using Azure. That's a pretty common deployment now, using Azure as the backplane for disaster recovery and high
availability. Dev/test for sure is a workload, but at this point I would say we have emerging ISVs, some of the global
ISVs, building their SaaS applications on top of Azure driving a significant amount of growth. New businesses and new
business models emerging on Azure as well as hybrid which I would say are driving.
One of the other categories that I see a lot of lately is IOT. And the way we participate just on the Azure side, we
obviously participate even with our Windows embedded, but on the cloud side, we are seeing the attach to our
emerging machine learning services as well as advanced analytics. That's another place where we are well suited for
some of the emerging use cases.

<Q - Keith E. Weiss>: Excellent. Thank you, guys, and a very nice quarter. Perhaps a question for Amy. Really nice
gross margin improvements across the board but you did mention some one-time items. I was hoping you could help us
understand where you're seeing sort of underlying gross margin improvements, particularly if we look at the
improvements we saw in the phone gross margins as well as the big improvement we saw in the cloud gross margins.
How much of that should we look at as durable on a going-forward basis?
<A - Amy Hood>: Thanks, Keith. Let me start with the cloud and then I'll move to your phone question. Overall in the
commercial business I think we've continued to see gross margin improvement and that is sustainable improvement as
opposed to, I think, what you characterized as non-recurring things that I had mentioned. It continues to be
improvements in scale, improvements in our infrastructure, improvements in utilization. Really strong work across all
of our engineering teams here. And so I think our year-over-year improvement as well as sequential improvement, and
our ability in the overall commercial business to see the gross margins we did as the mix shifts to the cloud, I think
we're all quite proud of.
Onto the phone business where I did call out nonrecurring items due to the business integration expense. An easier
way, frankly, to think about that, Keith, is our Q4 gross margin and our Q1 gross margin. Q4 was a little depressed. It's
how I would think about it due to some of the restructuring. Q1 is a little bit higher. A more blended rate of those two,
is probably a better way to think about a go-forward margin. Although when you're transitioning any business and all
the hard work that we're doing here to prepare ourselves going forward, I do expect to see some volatility in that
number.
<Q - Keith E. Weiss>: Excellent. That's very helpful. Thank you very much.
<A - Satya Nadella>: Just to add one thing that I'd say that sort of fits into Mark's question which is the – in particular
on Azure, we have some commodity workloads. But we also have many differentiated higher-margin workloads,
especially the Enterprise Mobility Suite is what as call out as a good example of infrastructure workload completely in
the cloud that has got a very different margin structure. And those are the things that really give us the ability to have
good margin structure for our cloud efforts.
<Q - Keith E. Weiss>: Excellent. That's great. Thank you very much, guys.

Our next question comes from the line of Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Philip A. Winslow>: Thanks guys. Congrats on another great quarter. I had a question on Office 365. Obviously
you all continue to see great growth both on the Commercial and on the Home and Personal side. But we also saw just
Office Commercial products and services continuing to grow 5%. So one question for Satya and one for Amy. Satya,
how do you feel right now about the momentum particularly on the Commercial side that you're seeing on Office 365
and how you're targeting large enterprises versus SMBs?
Then, Amy, obviously you've talked about cannibalization of in-period revenue from the success of Office 365. Can
you help us frame that 5% this quarter on the product and services and how we should think longer-term about the
revenue and the profitability there? Thanks.
<A - Satya Nadella>: I'll start then Amy I'll turn it over to you.
<A - Amy Hood>: Okay.
<A - Satya Nadella>: Specifically on Office 365, the overall product depth and breadth is continuously improving.
One of the great benefits of Office 365 that our customers get to enjoy is that as we innovate and launch new features,
they get to use them as soon as we have got them deployed on our cloud. And so that's what's driving both the

competitiveness as well as usage of Office 365 and quite honestly, the full consumption of what we build and which I
think in the long run is super important to us and our customers.
But it also turns out some of the server products that we have, as we've seen increasing adoption of the cloud, we still
have, as I said, very competitive server products. I mentioned a lot of infrastructure server products, but take something
like Lync. It's a fantastic product. It is again gaining share in the marketplace. It's getting deployed in on-premise
solutions. So it's the combination that's driving our growth.
The other dimension we are seeing is Office 365 is a cross-platform cloud service. We've seen our coverage across all
devices and that leads to customers still using the service even more. So that combination of effects, competitive server
products, very competitive cloud service with features being added all the time as well as cross platform is what's
driving our growth.
<A - Amy Hood>: Let me try to take the second part of that question, Phil, which is really the dynamics between our
transactional business, the move to the cloud and how I think about bridging those numbers. Our Office transactional
business was down this quarter and the difference, as you said, to get to the 5% growth is clearly the growth in Office
365 all up. The other place I always like to point out in terms of triangulating when I look at the health of the overall
transition, is renewal rates. Our renewal rates are amongst the highest we've had in a Q1. Both our ability to recapture
both the contract as well as the revenue and the value and add services is higher than it has been.
In addition, we're seeing premium units added more frequently in the cloud than we have on-prem. And those types of
mixes you'll see both in our bookings number as well as in the unearned balance growth. And so while the exact dollars
in and out in any given quarter may be difficult, I guess, to triangulate on, the components I always look to to see health
I've outlined there, specifically in the Office business.
<Q - Philip A. Winslow>: Great. Thanks, guys.
<A - Chris Suh>: Thanks, Phil. We'll go to next question, please.

Our next question comes from the line of Rick Sherlund with Nomura. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Richard G. Sherlund>: Yeah, thanks. I wanted to follow-up on Phil's question. I think that Office transition, our
analysis suggests that that's a net benefit from here for you. I'd like Satya's and Amy's thoughts maybe about the
transition for the rest of the business if you've got Server and Tools at some point, I mean it continues to show really
terrific growth, at some point I suppose that becomes cannibalized by your cloud business with Azure. Maybe Satya if
you can share how you think that transition, how long, how does it transpire, any thoughts? And should it be net
additive to the revenues and operating income as we've seen on the Office side? Maybe if you can talk on Windows as
well. It looks like it was OEM down a little bit this quarter which has been growing. Are we going to see lower ASPs
with these $200 devices coming out this fall?
<A - Satya Nadella>: Let me talk a little bit about the dynamics we've seen in particular with our infrastructure servers
as well as Azure. Because it is actually pretty unique I think, to at least, our product offerings. As I said our servers
have become much more competitive because of the same technology investments that we are making in our cloud.
And the use cases that we see in the cloud in many cases happen to be net new workloads. IOT was not driving our
server growth traditionally. Mobile back ends was not driving our servers traditionally. So – machine learning and
advanced analytics are areas we did not participate even in the past.
So one of the things that we are seeing is a lot of new use cases of Azure which were really new greenfield territory for
us. And it turns out that the need for more computing, more storage and more infrastructure server products is much
broader than just even the hyperscale public cloud. Because the one thing that is true as there are more devices is that
you need backend. And that backend in many cases, in regulated industries, with the geo participation we have, is
needed everywhere. So one of the things that we are, in fact, very focused on is enabling others to build their own

cloud. So our private cloud premium SKU mix is also growing, you see that in our results.
So at least in the intermediate timeframe we do not see cannibalization. We see more impact of these hybrid, private, as
well as public cloud, all being complementary. And, of course, being used together delivers more value to customers
and that's where our competitive advantage comes from.
On the Windows side, just to finish off, we wanted to make sure that we have competitive Windows ecosystem
participation across all price points. So we made some deliberate changes to our business model. And that is in fact
playing out in the marketplace where we now have very competitive, full Windows PCs less than $199 going into this
holiday season. And that in fact in Q1 caused the market to expand. That was really by design and so we are happy to
see that. And so on a blended basis, of course, the ASPs will be different because of the two ranges. So – but overall
that's what our goal is. We want to be able to make sure that we compete on all price points and overall grow the
volume.

Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citi. Please proceed with your questions.
<Q - Walter H. Pritchard>: Hi. Thanks. Satya, I'm wondering if you can talk about – you're seeing some progress on
the cloud gross margins. But you're also investing pretty heavily, and I'm wondering how important it is for you kind of
medium and long term to be able to get things like Bing, Xbox Live and Office 365 running on the same infrastructure
as Azure in terms of getting the kind of scale you want and ultimately driving the margins to where you want it to get
to. Is that sort of a prerequisite to get to where you'd like those margins to be?
<A - Satya Nadella>: Yeah, it's an absolute prerequisite for us to have our entirety of our cloud infrastructure plant
drive scale economics for us. And, in fact a lot of the core Azure technology around machine management and data
center management comes out of our [ph] bring (42:06) efforts. We manage all of the supply chain of all of this as one
supply chain. We do the SKU design as one SKU design. We drive costs of both network, storage, compute down all
together. In fact, you should think of Azure as the common fabric of all our applications. And you look at even some of
our games like Halo, have significant usage of our cloud, and that's what's really driving some of the economics.
In fact the – I celebrate the fact that we don't have just one first body workload because it's very easy for one first body
workload to completely co-opt, if you will, the architecture of a cloud. But in our case we have a very diverse set of
workloads. We have Xbox Live, we have Office 365, we have Dynamics and Bing, and that diversity is what allows us
to build in fact for our own needs, a cloud architecture that then can meet many more workloads. And that's working
pretty well for us.

<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Great. Thank you so much. Satya, I was wondering if you could share with us, given the
amazing XP refresh we've seen over the last 12 to 18 months, as you're talking to customers, how do you feel about the
corporate PC refresh cycle in calendar 2015?

<A - Satya Nadella>: I think it will come back to the pre-XP business PC refresh, and so that's what I think Amy's
comments also reflected, and that's what we expect to have happen in the rest of this fiscal year. The thing that,
Heather, we are focused on is how do we make sure that not only do the incremental value that we have today on
Windows 8 gets adopted, there are in fact lots of use cases, especially around field devices, mobile work force, where
we are in fact seeing great adoption of Windows 8. But Windows 10 is something that's completely optimized for the
enterprise and across all screen sizes for the mobile worker, as well as the desktop and large screens.
Perhaps one of the most unique things about at least our portfolio and our innovation is that we think that it's the
mobility of the individual, not the one device, that is important in the enterprise. And that's what we are building
towards with great management and great security. And so we are pleased with the early feedback we are getting from
the first disclosure of Windows 10, and as well as some of the successes we are having with Windows 8 adoption in the
enterprise. But the adoption, I think, will get back to a normal PC refresh in the enterprise.

<A - Chris Suh>: Thanks Heather. We'll go to the next question, please.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Ives with FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Daniel H. Ives>: Thanks. Satya, what do you think as you move to the cloud and really try to go into this next
phase of growth, is the biggest challenge and then maybe the biggest opportunity from just a high level as we think
about Microsoft going into the next stage?
<A - Satya Nadella>: I mean for us, the biggest opportunity is to be able to get into spaces. I mean one of the things
that I always think about is for all the success we've had in our server business, we were a low-share share player. And
when I look at the total IT spend of that enterprise customers have today, as I said, we've not participated in many,
many areas.
Bring up even the data stack. We have a very good business in SQL Server. We have perhaps the most competitive
SQL Server product ever in SQL 2014, which is going nicely. But if look what is secular in terms of growth going
forward, it's data, data management in a variety of new ways. So those will be opportunities we want to be able to take
advantage of by doing some good work both in the public cloud as well as with our server products.
The challenge will always remain at the end of the day for us, to make sure that we are bringing together unique offers.
One of the things that I want us as a team to be very focused on is to bring uniqueness that only Microsoft can bring
into the marketplace. That's why this approach around platforms and reinvention of productivity, I believe, is what we
can do.
For sure we're going to have credible competition, but at the same time I think that if you asked anyone, at least in our
campus, whether we deeply get what it means to reinvent productivity, I believe so. Do we get deeply how to take the
various constituents from end users, IT, and developers and harmonize their interest in really unique ways so that
enterprises can adopt solutions. We get that deeply. So to me, staying with that and staying focused on our unique
contribution is perhaps both our opportunity and our challenge. And we will obviously index on the opportunity side.
<Q - Daniel H. Ives>: Great job on the quarter, especially relative to your tech peers. Thanks.
<A - Chris Suh>: Thank you, Dan. We'll move to the next question, please.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Kash Gopalan Rangan>: Hi. Thank you for taking my question, Satya. I just wanted to get your perspective on
the business mix. Clearly you have a very strong and growing consumer footprint especially with Nokia and then
you've got a very solid enterprise backbone. It feels like the consumer side of the house is pulling away much faster and
obviously you've got some implications for how you look at the business in terms of margins and how they could
potentially inflect in the future. If you could just give us your thoughts, Satya, on how you see the business mix, that
would be great.
Also wondering, Amy, if you could shed some light on cost controls and what further things that specifically the
company is engaging in because the sales and marketing expense came in at a nice surprise, much lower than we
expected? Thank you very much.
<A - Satya Nadella>: Thanks, Kash. So the way I see the market when we sort of talk about productivity and
platforms, we really don't make this big distinction between consumer and Enterprise. But it takes productivity out. We
are very focused on dual use. In fact one of the pieces of data that Amy and I shared was the growth in the consumer
subscriptions of Office 365, even sequentially grew by a significant percentage. Therefore we are seeing good adoption
of our productivity services specifically in the context of this dual use where people want to use it at home, and people
want to use it at work. That's where in fact a lot of our R&D investment is to make that very seamless.
To me that's how we want to drive, and gaming is the one category we have said that we will invest in it for its own
sake in driving enterprise value out of our gaming. There are in fact lots of benefits which come because of technology.
In fact, the reason why we are so competitive now in Cortana and speech recognition, which I think is core to
productivity, is it first started with Kinect and Xbox.
So we always have those kind of incidental benefits. But really in gaming we want to have our first body gaming Xbox
Live console. And also as PC gaming thrives and drives volume incremental value for us, and Minecraft obviously
helps in that context. So that's how we'll view the future for how we think about our businesses.
<A - Amy Hood>: And, Kash, on the overall operating expense, and how we've managed that. In general, I don't think
about it as control using that sense of the word. I think what is perhaps most impressive is that we have managed to
continue throughout the quarter, whether it's week to week or month to month to look and ask where is the highest ROI
we get from our spend? How can we drive our business forward, both in period but also for the future? It's just as
important for us to balance that. And I think we've done a very good job of picking those places and really investing
intentionally and aggressively behind places where we know we're differentiated.
<Q - Kash Gopalan Rangan>: Wonderful. Thank you very much. Happy Halloween.
<A - Chris Suh>: Thanks, Kash. Operator, we'll have time for one more question please.

Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Karl E. Keirstead>: Hi, yeah. Question for Amy. Amy, just thinking through your guide by business segment,
everything seems roughly in line but for the D&C licensing guide, which implies, I think, a 24% year-over-year
decline, and given that that's a 90% gross margin business I just want to make sure I understand what's happening there.
And I have two questions. I'm wondering if you could help disaggregate how much of that is due to the tough
XP-related compare versus some other perhaps one time issues that make for a tough comparison. And then secondly,
when in your best judgment, do you think that D&C licensing revenue might turn positive? Thank you.
<A - Amy Hood>: Great. Karl, thanks for asking that question. It gives me a chance to reiterate how many of those
components are a bit one time in nature.

The first and the largest issue is the end of the Nokia commercial agreement. That's about $650 million that we earned
in Q2 of a year ago that because of the end of the agreement simply goes away. So I'll start with that point.
The second component relates to the same trend we saw in our IP business that we saw in Q4 and in Q1. We're doing
and seeing again in Q2. So I would also see that exact same trend line and assessment.
The next component, which is a change, is we have actually launched some of our Office 365 Consumer Services in
Japan, which is a geo that we had not been in historically. That does result in a revenue deferral. It'll end up in
unearned, but that's about a $100 million impact that we would not have seen before that.
And so by the time you move all of that out of the comparison group, you really get back to very similar trends in our
D&C Licensing business that we saw this quarter, for what I think are the components you are focused on, which is
OEM Pro and OEM Non-Pro, which we expect to really resemble the results we saw this quarter, and marry and sort of
match the PC business dynamics overall.
<Q - Karl E. Keirstead>: Okay. That's very helpful. And if I could sneak in one more. Amy, if the $2.9 billion share
repurchase feels like an uptick compared to what you've done every quarter for the last couple of years, is this sort of a
new level that we can expect from Microsoft? Maybe just a thought on the pace of the share buyback.
<A - Amy Hood>: Thanks for the question. I did – we are proud of the increase in shareholder return this quarter. And
importantly, we're focused on how we can continue to do that as a part of our overall long-term shareholder growth.
<Q - Karl E. Keirstead>: Okay.
