MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Honeywell's Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Elena Doom, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Elena Doom
Good morning. Thank you, Leo. Welcome to Honeywell's second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. Here with me
today are Chairman and CEO, Dave Cote; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Tom Szlosek. This call and webcast,
including our non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at honeywell.com/investor.
Note that elements of today's presentation do contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the
world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change and we would ask that you interpret
them in that light. We do identify the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our Form 10-K
and other SEC filings.
This morning, we will review our financial results for the second quarter, share with you our outlook for the second
half and the rest of the year and then leave time, of course, for your questions.
So with that, I'll turn the call over the Dave Cote.
David M. Cote
Thanks, Elena. As I'm sure you've seen by now, Honeywell had another terrific quarter and a very good first half of
2014. EPS of $1.38 increased 12% year-over-year when normalizing for tax, so another quarter of double-digit EPS

growth with earnings coming in above the high end of our guidance range. We saw strong execution across the
portfolio with margin expansion in each of our four businesses. We're continuing to benefit from our enablers and key
process initiatives that are delivering growth and productivity benefits. And we're achieving this while continuing to
invest for the future, planting the seed that will drive outperformance and achievement of our new five-year plan.
In the quarter, we were encouraged to see that our organic sales growth accelerated 3%. We saw continued
improvement in our short-cycle order rates as the quarter progressed with steady growth in ESS, a return to growth in
Advanced Materials, especially in Fluorine Products and a continued healthy pace of recovery in Transportation
Systems. Our robust long-cycle backlog, which stands at $15.7 billion, up 4% from the end of last year, continues to
support a favorable outlook with record orders for UOP and a continued uptick in new Process Solutions orders. We've
also seen a moderation of the sales decline from Defense & Space that we saw earlier in the year.
Speaking of D&S, I am encouraged to see that the headwinds are nearly behind us. We're expecting growth in D&S in
the third quarter. In fact, we had 9% international growth in this last quarter. And early indications point to a modest
increase next year. We recently celebrated the centennial anniversary of innovation and leadership in the Aerospace
and the Oil and Gas industries, two examples of where we have great positions in good industries.
Honeywell Aerospace has been a pioneer in aviation for the last 100 years, offering products and services that could be
found on virtually every aircraft worldwide. We've led the way from the beginning with firsts, like the first autopilot,
the first truly automatic flight management system and the first transatlantic biofuel flight. And we have differentiated
through disruptive technologies across our electrical and mechanical portfolios as well as our push into global
connectivity, as you've seen with recent partnership announcements with Inmarsat and AT&T.
And in Oil and Gas, where our UOP business created the first conversion technology for upgrading crude oil,
jump-starting the modern oil refining industry, we're a driving force for innovation for the global petroleum and natural
gas industries. Today, our leadership continues with new process technologies designed to: get more valuable products
from every barrel of oil; convert coal and natural gas into plastics; and convert bio feedstocks, such as algae, into
renewable fuels. We not only saw double-digit sales growth this quarter in UOP, but record orders and backlog, so the
future continues to be promising there.
Another innovation I'd like to point out is our new Lyric thermostat, designed for how people really live today. Using
the location of your smartphone, the geofencing feature automatically turns the thermostat to energy-saving mode when
a home is empty. It senses when you're coming home and heats or cools the house to your preferred temperature. It's
just another example of how the Honeywell user experience, or HUE, or HUE, depending upon how you want to
pronounce it, enables us to move quickly to develop exciting new products that are easy to use, easy to maintain, easy
to install, and exceed customer need.
ECC has seen continued good growth through the retail channel. And that's up 40% in the second quarter. We think the
portfolio is well positioned, aligned to favorable macro trends, and there is significant runway to grow. We remain
confident in our outlook for this year. As a result of our first half performance, we are raising the low end of our
guidance again by $0.05, giving us a new pro forma EPS guidance range of $5.45 to $5.55, or up 10% to 12% for the
year.
The closing of the sale of Friction Materials was a significant step in positioning our existing portfolio for continued
outperformance. We also realigned the Transportation Systems business segment into Aerospace to better take
advantage of the engineering and technology similarities and the shared operating practices between these two
businesses. Under the realigned segment reporting structure, the parts of Friction we're keeping will remain under
Transportation Systems, reported within Aerospace.
We just concluded our strategic planning reviews with our businesses. And in these all-day sessions, each of our
businesses presents their five-year strategic plan. While we're not expecting much help from the macro environment, I
can tell you that each business has a strong roadmap to the 2018 targets we laid out for you back in March. The growth
opportunities and new product pipeline are quite impressive.

We approach the finish line of our previous five-year targets confident in the strong foundation in place for continued
outperformance. We have great positions in good industries. We're investing both organically and inorganically to grow
faster than the markets we serve. And we'll stay the course on seed planting and continuous improvement initiatives.
We're going to stay flexible and deliver on 2014 and beyond.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.
Tom Szlosek
Thanks, Dave, and good morning. On Slide 4, let me walk you through the financial results for the second quarter.
Sales of $10.3 billion were up approximately 6% on a reported basis. That's 3% organically and came and just above
the high end of our guidance range. As we highlighted previously, the low first quarter organic growth was a bit of an
anomaly, with declines in Defense & Space and Scanning & Mobility driving roughly two points of top-line decline in
the first quarter. As we signaled, these headwinds have dissipated.
The contributions in 2Q from the businesses were broad-based with each SPG sales growth at or above the guidance we
had communicated. Regionally, organic sales were: up 2% in the U.S., despite the drag from Defense & Space; 5% in
Europe, Middle East and Africa; and 10% in China. In China, we saw good growth in our short-cycle businesses,
namely ESS and Transportation Systems, in addition to continued long-cycle growth, particularly in UOP and Process
Solutions.
Once again, our quality of earnings were strong with most of the improvement coming from segment profit, which
increased 10% in the quarter. Segment margins expanded 60 basis points to 16.7%. That's 70 basis points, excluding
the dilutive impact of M&A, and 20 basis points higher than the top end of our guidance. We had profit growth and
margin expansion in all four businesses, so really a balanced contribution across the portfolio. It's also notable that the
better-than-expected performance from Intermec reduced the segment margin dilution from M&A in the quarter.
Overall, we continue to see significant benefits from our productivity initiatives and proactive restructuring actions,
while continue to invest for growth.
Items below segment profit were mostly as anticipated. You'll recall that in the second quarter of 2013, we recognized
an OPEB curtailment gain of $42 million, which was more than offset at the time by restructuring actions, so really no
year-over-year net impact. In the second quarter of 2014, we funded $14 million of restructuring projects, bringing the
total for the year to approximately $100 million. On a reported basis, the tax rate of 26.1% in the quarter represented a
$0.06 tailwind, or sorry, headwind compared to the second quarter of 2013 and about a $0.01 tailwind relative to our
guidance.
EPS was $1.38, $0.02 above the high end of our guidance range. $0.01 was from operations and $0.01 came from the
better tax rate I mentioned. EPS increased 8% on a reported basis, or 12% when you normalize for the income tax rate.
This was again driven by the 10% increase in segment profit, slightly more favorable below-the-line items and a minor
benefit from lower share count. Finally, on free cash flow, approximately $1.1 billion in the quarter, 5% higher than
2013 and 101% conversion, despite a 17% increase in CapEx and higher cash taxes. Year-to-date free cash flow was up
28% through the first half.
Moving to Slide 5, where we're looking at Aerospace, now this is prior to the realignment of Transportation Systems
into Aerospace. We'll adopt that change in the third quarter. You'll also see us file an 8-K in the third quarter to reflect
this change on our historical reporting. So when it comes all to the forward-looking guidance that I'll touch on later, we
do reflect the new reporting structure.
So Aerospace sales were flat in the quarter, which is in line with our guidance, with 1% Commercial sales growth
offset by a 1% decline in Defense & Space. Despite the challenging top-line, segment margin was up 30 basis points
driven by Commercial Excellence and productivity, net of inflation, partially offset by BGA OEM payments, a higher
mix of OE content and investments in growth programs. The flat Commercial OE sales reflect strong growth in large
air transport driven by OE build rates, offset by lower regional jet sales, engine shipment timing and higher BGA OEM

payments. Now, as a reminder, we have won significant content on a number of new OE platforms and have and will
continue to incur upfront costs as a result. These costs are fully contemplated in the five-year planning we have shared
with you and our accounting for these costs is very conservative compared to the industry. The Aerospace business
model is fully intact and these wins, coupled with the exciting new technology offerings in Aero, give us full
confidence that the growth will accelerate over the five years in our plan.
Commercial Aftermarket sales up 1% in the quarter with continued strong spares growth in both ATR and BGA. This
strength was offset by lower R&O revenues, a reflection of fewer maintenance events and timing, particularly in
Business Aviation. Aftermarket backlog levels in R&O, along with robust spares demand, underpin an acceleration of
Aftermarket growth in 3Q.
Defense & Space sales were down 1%, but a nice improvement from the 8% decline in the first quarter. U.S. Defense
Aftermarket and Government Services decline significantly moderated from first quarter levels. And growth in
international markets, which Dave referenced earlier, helped to offset those declines. Defense & Space is tracking to a
3% decline for the full year.
On Slide 6, where we're looking at ACS results for the second quarter, ACS sales were up 10% on a reported basis and
3% on an organic basis, in line with our expectations. The difference in the two rates principally reflects the
contributions of Intermec. Looking at the businesses, ESS sales, so the products businesses, were up 4% organic, with
ECC and Scanning & Mobility showing particularly strong growth. ECC continues to benefit from strong residential
end markets and new product introductions, particularly in the retail channel. Dave talked about Lyric and overall the
Thermostat category is performing very well for us.
As for Scanning & Mobility, following the ramp-down of certain large programs in Q1, it returned to strong organic
growth in the second quarter. New wins, which ramp over the course of the year, are driving sustained growth.
Intermec also continues to perform very well, supplementing the growth we're seeing out of the core HSM business.
Our Fire & Safety, or excuse me, our Fire Safety and Gas businesses have shown continued strength as well. On a
regional basis, penetration of high-growth regions remains a big driver of growth in ESS as we saw strong double-digit
growth in both China and the Middle East.
Moving to Building Solutions & Distribution, sales were up 2% with strength in the Americas Distribution business
offsetting pockets of weakness in Building Solutions, specifically the U.S. Energy Retrofit business. We are
encouraged, however, as Building Solutions' Project and Services backlog continues to grow.
I'd like to take a minute to comment on what we're seeing in the commercial building sector. We've seen modest
improvement from the first quarter to the second quarter in the ESS Products businesses and Service sector, primarily
ECC and Fire Safety. We are anticipating further improvement in the second half.
In the Americas Energy business, as I said, orders have been delayed due to financing and municipal contract holds up.
While the projects can be lumpy, we are seeing bid activity heating up, especially in the Middle East and China, and
energy-efficient products globally. This, along with the easing of year-over-year comps, gives us confidence that our
Commercial building-related sales will modestly accelerate in the second half.
Moving to ACS margins, expansion of 50 basis points to 14.8% in the quarter, up 80 basis points excluding M&A.
ACS continues to benefit from productivity net of inflation, Commercial Excellence, as well as higher volume, while
also continuing to invest for future growth.
Moving the Slide 7, Performance Materials and Technologies, PMT sales were $2.6 billion, up 6% organic and were
above the high end of our guidance, driven primarily by stronger than expected results in UOP. UOP sales increased
17% in the quarter, driven by increased catalysts and gas processing sales, reflecting continued strong refining,
petrochemical and gas markets. UOP had a record quarter for both orders and backlog, which currently stand at $2.6
billion. We saw a continuation of orders trends in gas processing, particularly at Thomas Russell, so continued benefit
in UOP from oil and gas investments occurring globally.

In Process Solutions, sales were flat on an organic basis, primarily driven by a couple of large projects completed in the
prior period, offsetting growth across the remainder of the portfolio in high-margin areas like Services and Advanced
Software Solutions. Process Solutions' orders growth accelerated in the quarter, up approximately 7% organic. And, as
we will preview, modest sales acceleration is expected in the second half of the year.
Advanced Materials sales increased 5% in the quarter. We saw volume increases across the businesses, with particular
strength in Fluorine Products, driven by new global warming molecule offerings. These volume increases were
partially offset by unfavorable pricing, particularly in resins and chemicals, as we've been signaling. We expect these
pricing headwinds to moderate in the second half of the year.
Segment margins for PMT were up 30 basis points to 18%, consistent with our expectations, driven by productivity net
of inflation and higher volumes, partially offset by price, raw headwinds in resins and chemicals, unfavorable UOP
catalyst shipment mix and continued investments for growth.
On Slide 8, you can see Transportation Systems, which, again to remind you, includes Friction Materials for the second
quarter. TS had another strong quarter, with sales up 8%. That's 4% without foreign exchange and segment margin
expansion of 310 basis points. The sales increase was primarily driven by turbo volume growth across our three largest
regions, Europe, North America and China.
In each of these regions, our volume growth outpaced auto production. The growth we're seeing in Europe was strong
in both the Light and Commercial Vehicle segments. We benefited from an uptick in European commercial vehicle
demand, primarily driven by the Euro 6 regulationship in the region.
Outside of Europe, both North America and China saw strong volume increases in Light Vehicles, both diesel and gas,
which more than offset lower Commercial Vehicle volume sales in those regions. In North America specifically,
commercial off-highway sales remain soft, consistent with trends in Mining & Agriculture segment. Overall, we
continue to benefit from improving global industrial macros on vehicle production, regulation, turbo penetration, and
our strong win rates. As we begin to lap the strong second half performance from 2013, however, we do expect some
moderation in these growth rates beginning in 4Q 2014. The segment margin improvement to 16.4% reflects the strong
productivity and volume leverage in turbo and the benefits from restructuring and other operational improvement.
With closing of the Friction Materials divestiture behind us, let's now turn to Slide 9 and walk through our guidance for
the third quarter under our new reporting structure. We're expecting sales of $9.9 billion to $10.1 billion, which would
be up 3% to 5% reported, or 3% to 4% on an organic basis. Segment margins are expected to be up approximately 50
basis points, and earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $1.37 to $1.42, up 10% to 15% from the prior year.
For Aerospace, as I indicated earlier, we are providing guidance under the new reporting structure with Transportation
Systems included. Sales growth on a reported basis is expected to be flat to down 2% in the quarter, reflecting the
year-over-year absence of Friction Materials' sales in the quarter. On an organic basis, or, in other words, without the
Friction business, sales are expected to be up approximately 2% to 3%, with growth across the portfolio, Commercial,
Defense & Space, and Transportation Systems.
In Commercial, OE sales are expected to be approximately flat year-over-year, with continued growth in ATR
offsetting declines in BGA similar to the second quarter. However, we are expecting acceleration in Aftermarket
growth in the quarter, up low single-digits, driven by continued spare strength, and higher airline maintenance events.
We're also expecting see a return to growth in Defense & Space, as Dave indicated, up low to mid-single-digit, where
international programs continue to drive growth.
In Transportation Systems, we're expecting mid-single-digit organic sales growth in the quarter. And as for margins, we
expect an increase of approximately 150 basis points with significant contributions from both the Aerospace and TS
businesses.
For ACS, sales are expected to be up between 8% and 10%, or 3% to 4% on an organic basis. And, as a reminder, we
closed Intermec in the third quarter of 2013, so this will be the last quarter of M&A impact from that transaction.
Organically, we expect continued mid-single-digit growth in ESS and improvements in BSD. Our short-cycle orders

have been trending up at ESS and the backlog is growing in Building Solutions. Both trends bode well for our third
quarter outlook. ACS margins are expected to be up approximately 20 basis points, or approximately 40 basis points
excluding the dilutive impact from M&A. ACS continues to ramp their investments for growth in new products, as well
as adding feet on the street as we continue to further penetrate high-growth regions.
In PMT, sales are expected to increase between 4% and 6% in the third quarter. In UOP, we foresee another quarter of
increased catalyst growth. However, similar to the first half, product mix in Q3 will result in a headwind for UOP
margins. As a reminder, UOP sales can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter based on the timing of products and, as such, we
are forecasting a sales decline of approximately 10% in the fourth quarter for UOP against a much more challenging
comp. However, our outlook for the year remains intact for mid-single-digit growth in UOP. And with the record
orders and backlog experienced in Q2, we expect strong growth to continue over our five-year plan.
In HPS, after several quarters in a row of strong orders growth, we're expecting to see sales accelerate in the back half
of the year, carrying into 2015 with continued strong margin expansion. The increased orders growth will really start to
show in the fourth quarter as we're expecting high single-digit sales growth in HPS.
In Advanced Materials, we anticipate another quarter of broad sales growth across the portfolio, including improved
production levels in resins and chemicals and increased sales of global warming products and Fluorine Products.
Overall, PMT's segment margins are expected to be up slightly versus the prior year, reflecting similar trends that we
explained for Q2, with the exception that pricing pressures in Advanced Materials are expected to moderate.
Let me move to Slide 10, where I'd like to take a moment to refresh our 2014 segment outlook. This guidance reflects
the realignment of Transportation Systems in Aerospace as well the transition of Process Solutions into PMT that
occurred in 2Q. Let me explain the set-up here. The left half represents the guidance we provided in April, so with
Process Solutions already in PMT but prior to the sale of Friction Materials and prior to the movement of TS. The right
side reflects our current outlook including the Friction Materials divestiture and the realignment of Transportation
Systems into Aero.
So at the bottom of the page, you can see our new sales and sales guidance, which reflects the absence of
approximately $300 million Friction Materials' sales in the second half and our increased segment margins guidance for
the year, driven by our strong first half performance and the margin accretion we will experience from the absence of
Friction Materials' sales in the second half.
There are some comparable dynamics to be aware of as you think about the full year. First, in Aerospace, with the
inclusion of Transportation Systems, we're expecting 4Q sales to be down low single-digit on a reported basis, but up
about 1% to 2% on an organic basis, driven primarily by the timing of OE shipments in our Air Transport business.
However, you can see the significant margin expansion we're expecting this year with contributions from both
Aerospace and Transportation System businesses. Also as I referenced, we expect a decline in 4Q sales in UOP, all
timing and comp related. And I want to reiterate that we anticipate another good growth – a year of good growth in
2015 from UOP, given the significant multi-year backlog we're building there. There are some minor puts and takes but
no real changes to ACS or PMT from their prior outlooks, with continued margin expansion in both businesses.
Turning to the next slide, Slide 11, you can see the basis for our 3Q, 4Q and raised full-year guidance. Full-year sales
are now expected to be $40.2 billion to $40.4 billion, reflecting first half performance and a modest organic sales
acceleration in the second half. Estimated full-year sales are lower at the mid-point from our previous guidance,
reflecting the absence of approximately $300 million of Friction Materials' sales in the second half. So on an organic
basis, we continue to expect about 3% growth for the full year. Although acceleration is expected in the second half,
most notably in Defense & Space, Process Solutions and Advanced Materials, we will see tougher comps in the fourth
quarter, specifically in UOP and Aerospace, as I mentioned. As you'll recall, we saw strong acceleration in organic
growth at the end of 2013, with growth of 5% from the fourth quarter of last year.
On segment margin, we've increased our full-year guidance and now expect 16.8% to 17%, up about 60 basis points at
the mid-point versus last year. On EPS, we're raising the bottom end of our pro forma guidance by $0.05, making the
new range $5.45 to $5.55, or an increase of 10% to 12% versus the prior year. We are planning for a 26.5% tax rate in

3Q with 4Q just slightly higher to get to our full-year planning assumption of 26.5%. So overall, we feel like we're
executing well and delivering on the high end of our 2014 commitment.
I'm now on Slide 12 and before wrapping up, I want to give you an update on our new five-year plan out to 2018. On a
full Honeywell basis, the targets are identical to those we shared at the March Investor Day. However, the individual
components now reflect our new business segment reporting structure. So even with the Friction Materials divesture,
the overall Honeywell targets are identical to those originally communicated. We're continuing to target a 4% to 6%
organic sales CAGR and segment margin in the range of 18.5% to 20% by 2018, which is 220 to 370 basis points
improvement from 2013, strong earnings growth, which you've come to expect from Honeywell.
On the left side of the page, you can see the previous outlook by business based on our old reporting structure. Moving
to the right side of the page, our current targets now reflect the combined Aerospace and Transportation Systems
businesses less Friction Materials, as well as HPS transition to PMT, so minor puts and takes, but overall very
consistent with what you heard in March and significant contributions across the portfolio.
And as Dave continues to emphasize, the growth in margins story doesn't end in 2018. Each of our businesses still has
significant runway based on the continued evolution of our internal processes, global growth and execution and the
value we add for the customer through innovation and the Honeywell user experience, so even more to come.
Let me finish on Slide 13. The second quarter results put us another step closer to delivering on the high expectations
for 2014 we laid out in December. The pace of accelerations in organic growth over the course of the quarter gives us
confidence in our second half outlook, where we expect a modest uptick in organic growth and a continuation of strong
productivity.
We're going to keep investing for our future, focused on our new five-year plan. Innovation and new product
innovations, which are the lifeblood of our growth, remain a key priority as well as the investments we're making to
further penetrate high-growth regions. We feel confident that our balanced portfolio mix, alignment to favorable macro
trends and focused cost discipline will enable us to continue to outperform. And we're focused on executing sustainable
productivity actions, including delivering on the strong restructuring project pipeline we've already funded.
So with that, Elena, let's go to Q&A.
Elena Doom
Thanks, Tom. Leo, we'll now take our first question.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from Scott Davis from Barclays.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - Tom Szlosek>: Hi.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: I wanted to – you didn't really talk much about M&A in the release or I'd say not at all. But it's –
Roger Fradin now has had a couple of months in the role. I mean, can you give us a sense of how he's progressing as
far as pipeline and changing the M&A process and your confidence in being able to do deals in the next 12 months?
<A - Tom Szlosek>: Yes, Scott. I'm happy to answer that. As you know, historically, our approach to M&A has been
really a bottoms-up process from the businesses. So each business has resources and has an action plan to maintain a
robust portfolio of M&A targets. And that's what you've seen generate the deals that we've done over the years. And as
you alluded to, when we did the appointment of Roger into the Vice Chairman's role, one of the things Dave asked him

to do was to focus with our M&A team on the pipeline and that portfolio.
So we've kind of gotten a tops-down focus from Roger in addition to the process that we've had in our history. So what
you've got is you've got two ways of looking at it. And when you look across the portfolio, we are seeing quite a bit of
interest as a result of this process. As you know, we're quite active in looking at potential deals in Aerospace, ACS and
in PMT. And I think that activity will continue.
<A - David M. Cote>: For what it's worth, Scott, Tom has also said he enjoys having Roger report to him on this.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Well, good luck. We'll be watching closely on that. But, guys, can you give us a better sense? I
mean, I've struggled to understand this business for a lot of years and I'm talking about UOP and kind of the
quarter-by-quarter variability. I mean, it's a fantastic business, but I have no idea how you forecast it or how you really
have any confidence one quarter to the next in that regard. But how does a business like that have such a strong quarter
without there being an inventory build or some sort of something going on at the customer level that may come back
and bite you in the tail in a quarter or two? I mean, I just don't understand it, I guess.
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, I'll answer first then turn it over to Tom. But I'd say on an annual basis, it's pretty
forecastable. They don't have a lot of inventory depth at the full [ph] width (31:53) in the first place. So a lot of this is a
technology sale . I mean, there is some inventory, but not a huge amount. It's the between quarters that can be more
variable, but even that variability is generally forecastable. It's just that you can end up with lumpiness when it comes
to one quarter versus another, but we generally have a pretty good handle on what's going to be going out the door.
<A - Tom Szlosek>: Yeah, I think Dave hit it on the head, Scott. It is quite lumpy, but because of the long-cycle nature
of it and we referenced the backlog earlier. I mean, we're at a record backlog of $2.6 billion, up double-digit from last
year. We have good insight into what's going to happen quarter-over-quarter. And that backlog dissipates and will end
up in our P&L over a fairly short timeframe, a year-and-a-half to two years. So we do feel like we have a good track on
forecasting that.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. And last, just quickly, guys, we used to think about in TS, we used to think about Turbo
as being one of those businesses that was kind of 600 basis points over Autosar, maybe a little bit better in some
quarters, maybe a little bit worse. But has that changed at all? I mean, is there a different thought process in how that
grows versus Autosar globally?
<A - Tom Szlosek>: Well, we do end up with a regional mix difference that can impact us. As you know, we've got a
strong position in Euro diesel. And that was one of the things that really helped us, just that industry bottoming out this
year, so with all the wins finally started to show up as opposed to mitigating the declines we were seeing in Euro autos.
But overall, yeah, it's going to continue to grow well for a long time.
<A - David M. Cote>: Yes, and I guess what I'd say is that I'd reemphasize that the growth profile that we've got
going, I mean, it's in all of our big regions. I mean, in North America, both on the diesel and gas side, strong
double-digit growth; China, strong double-digit growth on both diesel and gas as well. And Europe's doing pretty well
as well, and the Commercial Vehicle side in Europe in particular, they're very strong for us. So those regulations and
the other things...
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: But that 600 basis point above SAR, I mean, has that changed? I mean, I think, or are you
punting on the answer?
<A - Elena Doom>: Well, Scott, I would say that European Light Vehicle production in the quarter was flat, and so for
Turbo, we had organic growth of 5%, so 500 basis points. It's within that range.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. Good. That's what I really wanted to know, but thanks, guys. Good quarter. Thanks.
Good luck.
<A - David M. Cote>: Thanks, Scott.

Our next question comes from Steven Winoker of Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Hey. Thanks, and good morning, everybody.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Hey. Dave, just an initial question on that Turbo move and Transport to Aero, how much
is cost a part of that? Or should I say, how much cost reduction are you expecting from delayering? Is there any in there
in addition to the technology justification?
<A - David M. Cote>: No, not really. In fact, our Turbo business is pretty lean already. And I'm hoping when we
reference operating practices in the release, I'm hoping for more leanness to transfer into the Aero business looking at
Turbo as a model.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. So the rationale here it sort of subscales an existing, a separate reporting segment
now, obviously, the technology is always overlapping, but you could have gotten that otherwise and maybe some
practice opportunities here. Is that how I should think about it?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, I might modify that a bit. I agree on size. Subscale, I don't know that I'd call it that,
because within that industry, their scale is quite good. On the technology side, it's one thing to tell two businesses that,
hey, would you guys cooperate? But I could say over 12 years, there's been an evolution there. It used to be the Aero
business wanted to charge the Turbo business $200,000 per person for cooperation. Yeah, you might remember those
days.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: I do, yeah.
<A - David M. Cote>: Things have changed a lot. And we've progressed to the point where we co-locate engineers, as
I've mentioned in the past. That being said, you still get a different dynamic when you put the businesses together. And
we're putting them together in a way that allows us to get much further advantage out of that technology benefit that we
have with aero technology, because turbos are just a derivation of jet engines. And we're the only guys who have that.
So we want to take further advantage of it, but I'm also hoping for a lot more of those Lean practices to transition into
Aero, because the aerospace industry is, let's say, rife with opportunity when it comes to running more leanly than it
does today. And while I'm pretty proud of what we've been able to do and where we've been able to get to, at the end of
the day, I think there's still one hell of a lot more opportunity there for us. And this is a good way to have best practices
in house that they can be looking at.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. And speaking of moving organizationally to drive better financial results, HPS
within PMT now, just maybe talk about the projects that are complete. It's down 1%, flat organic, but, again, that sort
of North American build out that's just at the very, very early stages, what are you seeing there? Any hopes that we
should anticipate a ramp-up soon?
<A - Tom Szlosek>: Yeah, Steve, like we said, the – first of all, there's a lot of excitement around the combination of
those two businesses, and we do think that market-wise, it's going to enable us to better serve the common customer
base that's there. I think you're referring specifically to HPS. I mean, the second quarter orders were very strong, up 7%
on an organic basis and that's another quarter of pretty good growth for them on the order side. And as I said, that has
been factored into our full-year guidance, UOP as well. As I said, both orders and backlog are strong, talked about the
lumpiness but the sustained trajectory for both of those businesses is really good. And unlike the TS one that Dave said,
I do hope we get a little bit of productivity out of that combination as well.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. And just lastly, you mentioned you just wrapped up the STRAP process. Again,
just remind me, what macro assumptions did you give the business – the SBUs to use for the five-year plan in terms of
top-line base growth?

Our next question comes from Steve Tusa of JPMorgan.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Hi. Hey, good morning.
<A - Tom Szlosek>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Hey. How bad is UOP going to be in the fourth quarter?
<A - David M. Cote>: What an interesting way to put it. I don't know that I would say it's bad. I would say it's all
contemplated within our fourth quarter guidance, which you can see turns out pretty well for the year.
<A - Tom Szlosek>: Yeah.
<A - David M. Cote>: I don't know, Tom, if there's anything else you want to share there.
<A - Tom Szlosek>: No. Full year UOP will be 5%, as I said, down 10% in the – or, sorry – 8% in the fourth quarter.
But first quarter was 9%. This past quarter was 17%. We'll see mid-single-digits in third quarter and probably 8% to
10% down in the fourth quarter, but full year, we're right on track and, again, with that order and backlog should be
very strong here.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Yeah, I don't think there's an issue with the trend in the business. I'm just trying to reconcile the
3% organic growth you did this quarter. And the only thing that really seems to be getting worse or is just on a
lumpiness or a quarterly basis – whatever just from the math, would be UOP. Everything actually seems to be looking
better, like accelerating. And so I'm just like the 3% organic, even with UOP, unless it's dramatic, which 8% is a pretty
big number. So I'm just trying to reconcile that 3% you did this quarter versus why with things getting better, why that
should be 3% in the fourth quarter?
<A - Elena Doom>: Yeah, I think – sorry.
<A - Tom Szlosek>: Well, I – go ahead, Elena.
<A - Elena Doom>: I was just going to add that I think we also mentioned that we do have other tougher comps, in
particular in [ph] Aero, Transport and OE (40:59) and also in Transportation Systems. Relative to both those businesses
were up mid-teens in the fourth quarter of 2013.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Right. But you didn't really grow in Commercial Aero this quarter. So are you going to be down
in Commercial Aero in the fourth quarter?

<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Oh. Okay. So there was the Bizjet stuff offset that?
<A - David M. Cote>: Right.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. And then...
<A - Tom Szlosek>: But your thesis, though, Steve, though, it's not – the way you're talking about it seems reasonable
to me.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Right. Okay. And then just – I guess I'm just going to ask this every quarter and this quarter was
particularly interesting because DuPont pre-announced negatively. And I got a flood of e-mails about R-22 pricing.
Getting – I don't really get chemicals – the questions around chemicals pricing for a lot of the other companies that I
follow and with the re-segmentation you just did, you went to a little less disclosure, which I don't particularly view as
a good thing. Is this is the final iteration of outside of acquisitions of what the portfolio looks like? Or could we maybe
break out the more process oil and gas-related businesses and maybe again at some point evaluate this chemical
business as a part of the Honeywell portfolio?
<A - David M. Cote>: I would say in terms of organization, I like it just the way it is now.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. So no change?
<A - David M. Cote>: No.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. Thanks.

Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Thank you. Good morning, folks.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Jeff.
<A - Tom Szlosek>: Hi, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Hey. How's it going, guys? Could we get a little more color on commercial building for U.S.,
specifically the color Tom gave I think was global and helpful, but a little lay of the land on the U.S. specifically, if you
have it?
<A - Tom Szlosek>: Yeah. I would say, Jeff, the growth in the Products businesses that are serving commercial
buildings are reasonable, I mean, mid-single-digits in the second quarter. And I expect that to continue for the
remainder of the year, if not accelerate a little bit more modestly. In terms of the pure Building Solutions business, the
sales – or the business in the U.S. was tempered a bit by the energy business. We had a number, a couple of really large
projects completed in 2013 that tempered the sales. In terms of the orders growth there, it's flat globally. But on the
America side, it's been picking up to mid to high single-digits is what I said.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: The mid to high single-digit U.S. energy retrofit, but global, flat on orders?

<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Okay. Thank you. And I was just wondering, Dave, if you could address Europe a little bit
more specifically. I think the plus 5% was an EMEA comment. How is kind of core Europe actually doing? And was
there any slowdown in Europe in the quarter or in June that you noticed?
<A - David M. Cote>: Overall, it's kind of interesting is our Europe orders have actually done okay, as you've been
hearing us say for the last two or three quarters. So I'm a little surprised, actually, given that there, the overall economy
doesn't perform all that well. And we don't have a lot of expectations for the economy to perform all that well over the,
say, next two or three years. That being said, our orders are okay there.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And just one final one for me and I'll move on. Perhaps too granular for this call, but are you
seeing any signs of kind of choppiness, pressure in the commercial helicopter market?
<A - David M. Cote>: I can't say – no, I don't think so. We actually think that's going to be a pretty good market for a
while.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Yeah. Just some cautionary comments out of Eurocopter this week in Farnborough and some
choppiness at Bell also. Maybe it's just noise in the quarter, but...
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah, I can't speak to that. I'm not sure what their expectation was either. But I'd say overall,
we still think that's a growth market.

<A - David M. Cote>: Good.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Numbers are nice.
<A - David M. Cote>: Thank you.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: A couple of things, you never stop pushing excellence and while Friction Material is the last
obvious divestiture, how do you think about keeping the guys at the back of the line equal with the people
outperforming at the front?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, that's something we pay a lot of attention to all the time and in several different ways.
One of the things that we'll be – one of the ways we'll be doing that more in the future is through this HOS goals effort
that you've heard us talk about. And especially as we go through the strategic planning or what we call STRAP
exercise, we spend a lot of time looking at that. And I can't say that we look at it and threaten to fail if they don't kind
of come up to par. But at the end of the day, I'd say there's – I'm really encouraged by the upside I see across the
portfolio in the implementation of HOS goals and the ability to raise sales growth and margin rates everywhere.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: And then kind of staying with that theme, you're spending a lot of money on new products
and you highlighted a couple of them in ACS. Can you sort of talk about are you getting the productivity you want?
And are there – how do you think about maybe how much of this is contributing to organic growth as opposed to just
the normal economy?

<A - Tom Szlosek>: Are you talking about new products or productivity, Howard?
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Well, I guess I mix them both. I mean, one is the productivity associated with new product
development and then second is how is that contributing to the organic growth, Tom?
<A - Tom Szlosek>: Well, first off, if you look at it in pure financial metrics, we're not decelerating at all on
investments in new products. So for example, if you look at R&D investments it's not – that's not per se generating
productivity. But when you look at productivity across direct materials and our people costs, I would say that has been
as strong as it's been in the last couple of years, is the way I look at it.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: And then last, on Intermec, looks like you're getting the top-line you expected. How would
you evaluate where you are in terms of the integration process? And when do we really see its profitability normalize
with the rest of the business units?
<A - Tom Szlosek>: Yeah, I would say, Howard, the way we look at that one is, a year ago, everybody, when we
closed the deal, it was a business that was not very profitable, if profitable at all. And you fast forward to now, and you
look at what we've done, I mean, just to look at the multiple that we paid and compare it to today, you would say we
are at 17, 18 times multiple. When you factor in the synergies we've gotten and that are in place, we're down to a
sub-five type multiple. That kind of gives you an idea that we feel like we've been successful. So when you look at the
plan itself and you look at both revenues and the income and the cash, all of those metrics we're performing a lot better
than the plans. John and his team at Scanning & Mobility, as well as the Intermec team, have really done a nice job
integrating those two businesses.

<Q - John G. Inch>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.

<A - Tom Szlosek>: Hi, John.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Morning. So how did you businesses – I realize it's not a huge exposure, but how did your
businesses fare in Latin America? And the crawl rate might be – does market weakness in Latin America, Dave Cote,
maybe provide you an opportunity perhaps with respect to capital and deployment, or step up some investment
spending there or something like that?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, we continue to do very well in everything south of the Rio Grande. You look at the big
ones, Mexico and Brazil, we continue to do well there. Mexico, we've got about 14,000 employees, and Brazil, we've
got about 1,000. And our sales have been quite good there. In terms of investing, I still think that there are places where
you think about it before you do it. It's not a no-brainer. But overall, those have been very good markets for us.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Were your Brazilian businesses up in the quarter?
<A - David M. Cote>: Yes.
<A - Tom Szlosek>: Yes, I'd say mid-single-digits.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Defense & Space, were there any pockets of Defense & Space, or expectations of Defense &
Space pockets, like within the framework of that business that you would expect to actually get better over the course
of the year? And I'm curious kind of how if anything has changed with respect to how you're seeing this business, how
you're going to manage it? I'm assuming it kind of gets managed down over time, but maybe not.

<A - Tom Szlosek>: Yeah, John, the way I think of the Defense & Space business is it has two pieces, the products
business, where we're dealing with the U.S. government and/or the prime contractors. And then there's a service
business that's largely unrelated to the aerospace industry. And that's where we're seeing the most pressure. Thankfully,
it's a lower margin business, but that's where the top-lines for Defense & Space are the most pronounced for us. We are
now approaching periods where we're going to start lapping comps. So that will – that pressure will subside.
The other thing that we've got going on there is the international side. You read the paper this morning. I mean,
unfortunately, those things happen, but that tends to bode well for military budgets outside of the U.S. And so we're
seeing an uptick, as Dave referenced, in sales on the international side of Defense & Space. So, you got some balancing
dynamics going there. And I think that they'll net to the positive as we head into the second half of the year.
<A - David M. Cote>: I think the other thing to recognize, John, is, as we've said before, Defense is really more of a
sales channel for us. It's not like we have – while the jet engine might be unique to a certain defense application, at the
end of the day, it's still coming out of a jet engine factory that's also producing commercial.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Right. And all incremental. Maybe one more. If global markets, Dave Cote, do not begin to show
more signs of life – I realize you're outperforming today, but let's call it over the course of the coming year, does that
cause you to perhaps modify or even accelerate aspects of your operating framework to hit your – hit or hopefully
exceed your five-year targets?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, as you know, I've been one of the guys who's generally been more negative on the global
outlook for the last four years. And so far, that's been a pretty good call. So I'd say the way we've forecasted this year
and the way we've looked at our five-year plan is pretty consistent with that. I've never counted on much. And so far,
that's been a good call. So I feel pretty good about where we are and what we're saying.

<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Thanks for passing that along. I got a text from him last night.
<A - Tom Szlosek>: I guess this is going be an easy question.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: So we'll see. So wanted to follow-up on the M&A and part of Roger's job now I think is
the opportunity to look at sourcing larger deals and we see the Intermec integration was pretty rapid fire with the
benefits. So I'm wondering, are you just starting to development the pipeline for larger deals? Or is that something
that's already established?
<A - Tom Szlosek>: I don't think there's been a concerted effort to find larger deals with Roger joining that area. I do
think that he has the tendency and the license and the idea of looking across Honeywell and trying to identify
opportunities that might touch on more than one business or that might be in an adjacent business – adjacent to the
three business segments that we have. That might lead you to think that there's larger deals in the making, but I would
say that's not the primary objective. I'd say the primary objective is to augment those existing portfolios and find good
growth ideas that are in industries that we like.

<A - David M. Cote>: I'd add, Chris, that while we did an okay job on origination, as Roger's starting to get into this
around the company looking at it within the businesses, across the businesses and adjacencies that might make sense,
he's really invigorating the overall origination process. So I think it's going give us a lot more ideas to work with than
what we've had in the past. And you've heard us talk about many times that we have and want even more of a robust
pipeline because the more ideas you have, the more stuff you can go after and the more opportunities it gives you and
also allows you to be more selective. You can end up being, I'd say, in a much better position to negotiate if you have
nine other good deals that you can do so that you don't do something silly when it comes to pricing.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Right. Well, we haven't seen that be a problem. So I think our bias then would be more
to higher frequency of deals in your accelerated capital allocation rather than seeing something larger?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, I guess it depends how you define larger, but I would say – you've heard me say many
times, we never say never on any of this, because it's going to depend upon the construct of the deal. But whatever we
do, I can promise you we'll be consistent with the financial and operating discipline model that we've talked about the
past and we'll have strong cost synergies that come out of it, consistent with Tom's point on Intermec, because that
certainly is one of the things that I think has helped define our track record.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Great. Thanks, guys.
<A - David M. Cote>: You're welcome.
<A - Elena Doom>: Leo, we have time for just one more question.
Operator
Very good. We'll take a question from Andrew Obin of Bank of America.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Yes. Good morning. Just a little bit more color on UOP and HPS. Could you just comment more
on petchem demand by region because we're hearing mixed commentary this earnings season?
<A - Tom Szlosek>: UOP by region?
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Yeah. And HPS, because it seems that some pieces of oil and gas and petchem industry are
moving in different directions by industry, just trying to get what you guys are seeing.
<A - Elena Doom>: It's pretty broad-based. If you look across all of the regions, oil and gas has been particularly
strong both in the U.S., the Middle East, China in particular. Anything, Tom, you would add there?
<A - Tom Szlosek>: Yeah, I would say the Middle East has been outstanding for both UOP and for HPS and China. So
those are really good. But it's not like the U.S. is [indiscernible] (58:03).
<A - Elena Doom>: No. Canada. [indiscernible] (58:04)
<A - David M. Cote>: [ph] Sold, yeah. (58:04)
<A - Elena Doom>: Yeah.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: And just a question on Aerospace, you sort of noted that RMU's growth is moderating and I
think you guys were positive. Can you just talk about what's happening then and any sort of broader trend that are
taking place?
<A - Tom Szlosek>: Well, I think on RMUs, the sales levels are very strong. It's just that we had such an uptick in the
early and middle part of 2013 and really even into 2014 that we're starting to lap periods that were really strong. But
we're sustaining the level of new product development there and the offerings that are going on to those platforms,
particularly on BPA side and particularly as it relates to software.

<Q - Andrew Obin>: Thanks a lot.
Elena Doom
Well, thank you for your participation today. I do want to turn the call over to Dave Cote for any final comments.
David M. Cote
Well, we're quite pleased with our second quarter results and our outlook for the year. And I think it's a good reflection
of our expectations for ourselves over the next five years. We have a great portfolio to grow with. Our process
initiatives continue to progress and our culture provides sustainability as we evolve and continue seed plantings. We are
building on a great base and with the addition of our drive for: HOS Gold; software, including CMMI Level 5; and
HUE, we see a lot of good things to come for Honeywell. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. [Operator Instructions] And have a wonderful day.
