MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to JPMorgan Chase's first quarter 2014 earnings call. This call is being
recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call. We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by.
At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon; and Chief
Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.
Marianne Lake
Thank you, operator. Good morning, everybody. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is
available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements, which is at the back of
the presentation.
So starting on page one, the Firm generated net income of $5.3 billion for the first quarter, $1.28 a share, with a return
on tangible common equity of 13%. Our revenue was $24 billion, down 8% year on year, driven by lower Markets
revenue, down 17%, and continued headwinds in mortgage.
Reported expenses for the Firm were basically the same as adjusted expenses this quarter at $14.6 billion, in line with
our expectations and our guidance for full-year adjusted expenses to be below $59 billion. Firm-wide legal expense for
the quarter was immaterial.

Of note, you will see that we didn't disclose any significant items this quarter on the front page of the presentation.
There were items in the quarter that we consider non-core or non-recurring. Each individually didn't rise to the level of
being disclosed on the front page. And importantly, the net of all such items across businesses was not significant to the
Firm's reported results.
To be clear, this means that our reported net income of $5.3 billion is very close to being a core performance number,
which we consider a solid result given the challenging environment for both markets and mortgage. Importantly,
underlying drivers across most businesses continued along impressive trends.
Finally, we're pleased that our capital plan was approved in the quarter and the board announced its intention to
increase our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.40 a share, effective in the second quarter, as well as the
authorization to repurchase a gross $6.5 billion of common equity or net a little over $5 billion. That's net of expected
employee issuance.
So skipping over page two and turning to page three, our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio was 9.5%, flat to last quarter,
being over 40 basis points of capital generated and run off in the quarter, largely offset by the impact of certain specific
risk models that were approved for use in Basel I last year but which our regulators disapproved for use under Basel III
effective at the beginning of this year. We believe this should largely be timing, with partial remediation in the second
half of 2014 and further remediation in 2015.
The impact of these models' approvals was contemplated in our Investor Day guidance of reaching 10%-plus by the
year-end. But it won't be in a linear fashion, and the majority of capital accretion will occur in the second half of the
year.
Effective this quarter, our regulatory reported ratio moves from a Basel I measure to a Basel III standardized
transitional measure. And having been approved to exit Basel parallel effective April 1, starting in the second quarter
the Collins floor would apply. This means that there are a variety of measures we could talk about, but suffice to say
that we're hundreds of basis points above the minimum for any of them. Therefore, our primary ratio will continue to
be the one we use to manage the price, which also happens to be our lowest, the fully phased in Basel III advanced ratio
of 9.5%.
Before we leave the page, I want to spend a minute on leverage. You'll notice that the Firm and the bank SLR
progressed by 50 and 70 basis points respectively and, importantly, that the Firm is above 5% today. The Firm's ratio
benefited from net retained earnings as well as from preferred issuance of close to $4 billion as we took advantage of
market opportunities in the first quarter. The bank's ratio benefited from both retained earnings as well as the impact of
actions taken including downstreaming and restructuring certain capital for the bank. Additionally, other leverage
actions taken across our businesses helped the Firm and the bank by 10 basis points.
We also analyzed the rule proposed by regulators this past Tuesday. In general, it was relatively consistent with the
Basel proposal, which is how we based our estimates. There were a couple of nuanced technical changes. The net of
those changes we estimated to add approximately 15 to 20 basis points to leverage, which is included in the ratios
reported on the page.
Turning to the business performance and moving on to page four, for Consumer & Community Banking, the combined
consumer businesses generated $1.9 billion of net income for the quarter on $10.5 billion of revenue and an ROE of
15%. Overall, revenue was down both year on year and quarter on quarter, driven by Mortgage Banking, which I'll talk
about later.
Despite margin compression across CCB, excluding Mortgage, revenue was flat year on year, as we continued to add
new customers and deepen our relationships with them. Deposits were up $30 billion year on year. We had record
client investment assets of $196 billion, up 16%. And credit card sales volume of $105 billion was up 10% year on
year, being the 24th consecutive quarter that sales outperformed the industry.
Expense was down $350 million year on year and close to $900 million quarter on quarter, despite the ongoing
investment in controls. The reduction was also driven by Mortgage as well as by the timing of certain investments in

marketing in Card. And across CCB, we are on track relative to our head count reduction outlined at Investor Day.
On page five, Consumer & Business Banking, the business generated $740 million of net income and an ROE of 27%
on $4.4 billion of net revenue, up 5% year on year and down 1% from the prior quarter seasonally. Net interest income
was up over 5% year on year, driven by deposit growth of 9%, among the highest in the industry. We saw strong
household growth and the lowest attrition ever this quarter. While the deposit margin flattened quarter over quarter, it
did decline nine basis points over last year, driven by lower reinvestment rates.
On the non-interest revenue side, we continue to see strong year-over-year growth in both debit and in investment
revenues, driven by the record client investment assets I mentioned. Expense was up 1% year on year, reflecting the
investments we've made in the business, including the costs relating to strengthening the control and compliance
infrastructure, partially offset by improving efficiency in our branches. CBB head count was down around 1,500 this
quarter.
On Business Banking originations, we're beginning to see stronger lending, with production for the quarter of $1.5
billion, up to 22% year over year and 16% quarter over quarter. We have the right team in place and targeted strategies
which have proved successful. We're also seeing improved banker productivity. So although some challenges remain in
the environment, the pipeline is strong and at the highest level since 2012, and utilization rates have stabilized. So we
are cautiously optimistic that improved lending trends will continue in 2014.
Turning to page six, Mortgage Banking, overall, Mortgage Banking net income was $114 million for the quarter. And
despite a relatively favorable rate environment, the market got off to a slow start in 2014. We're seeing tight housing
inventory in some markets, and the purchase market was affected adversely by the severe weather. This led to a
challenging quarter for the Mortgage business with production of $17 billion, down 27% quarter over quarter and 68%
over last year.
On the back of this lower volume, production pre-tax, excluding repurchases, was a loss of $186 million, consistent
with our guidance. We did, however, continue to make good progress on right-sizing capacity and reducing expenses,
with production core expense being lower by over $110 million quarter on quarter. Total Mortgage Banking head count
was down nearly 3,000 since the end of the year and about 14,000 since the beginning of last year.
Mortgage production also benefited from a repurchase reserve release. Repurchases for the quarter was positive $128
million, principally driven by a significant improvement in actual and projected cure rates for remaining repurchase
risks.
So before I move off of production, just brief note on market share; as we pointed out at Investor Day, we're pricing the
business to reflect the inherent risks. The risk of default and the costs associated with servicing defaulted loans is
significantly higher for high-LTV loans. As a result of pricing actions taken, we believe we may have lost some share
in the first quarter, but we will remain disciplined with respect to appropriate risk-adjusted returns. And this is
consistent with our objective to have a smaller, higher quality, less volatile mortgage business in the future.
Now on to servicing, excluding MSR risk management, pre-tax income of $131 million was favorable by over $100
million quarter on quarter. That was driven by the absence of an adjustment to compensatory fees which we incurred in
the fourth quarter. If you exclude this item, servicing pre-tax remains relatively flat, and we remain on track to deliver
servicing expense of $500 million plus or minus by the fourth quarter of this year.
MSR risk management was a net loss for the quarter of about $400 million. The loss was driven by a negative $460
million fair value adjustment, principally on higher allocated capital for the business, in line with the capital we showed
at Investor Day.
Lastly, on real estate portfolios, pre-tax income of $517 million includes $174 million of charge-offs and an NCI
reserve release for the quarter of $200 million, in line with guidance. You'll see that net charge-offs were broadly flat to
the fourth quarter, on flattening delinquencies at the end of last year and the early part of the first quarter. But we do
expect improvement in the loss trends to resume in the second quarter, as recent delinquency trends have been positive.
Lastly, on mortgage, the NCI portfolio remains flat. We added $3.5 billion of loans this quarter.

Turning to page seven, Card, Merchant Services and Auto had net income of $1.1 billion, down 15% year on year, with
an ROE of 23%, or 20% if you exclude reserve releases. Revenue of $4.5 billion was down 3% seasonally quarter on
quarter and 4% year on year, driven by continued margin compression from growth in transacted balances and from the
paydown of higher yielding runoff loans.
Underlying trends remain robust, strong sales and merchant processing volumes up 10% and 11% respectively and
gaining share. Total outstandings remained approximately flat for us and for the industry. And we have strong
momentum in new account originations in the quarter, up 24% year on year, and the quality of our new account
originations is very strong.
Expense was down $260 million or 12% quarter on quarter due to the timing of marketing spend as well as the absence
of remediation payments to customers that was recorded in the fourth quarter. The net charge-off rate has remained
very low at 293 basis points, picking up slightly quarter on quarter just on seasonality of loan balances. We released
$200 million of card loan loss reserves this quarter, in line with guidance, and $50 million of student lending reserves.
And before we move on, a few words on auto; we saw a very strong industry rebound in March with the highest new
auto sales since 2007, coming off of the slower start to the year, again, on a severe winter. This drove originations up
3% year on year and loan balances up 5%, gaining share, and it was the tenth consecutive quarter of auto loan and lease
growth.
Moving on to slide eight and the Corporate & Investment Bank, CIB reported net income of $2 billion on revenue of
$8.6 billion and an ROE of 13%. You'll see in the table on the top right of the slide that we've shown adjusted results
for comparable periods excluding DVA and FVA. The net DVA/FVA impact for this quarter was an insignificant loss.
Gross DVA would have been over $200 million negative on nine basis points tightening of CDS spreads. So as
expected, what we saw was sensitivity to our spreads significantly muted given the implementation of FVA. And you
should expect the impact of DVA/FVA in our results to continue to be modest going forward, all other things equal.
In Banking, total revenue was $2.7 billion, down 8% year on year. IB fees were $1.4 billion, up 1% year on year,
driven by higher advisory and equity underwriting fees but with lower debt underwriting fees. And we maintained our
number one ranking in global IB fees per Dealogic. Going forward, the environment remains compelling for M&A
with announced volumes up 20%. We have a robust pipeline of IPOs with a large backlog across sectors and regions,
and DCM activity is expected to be relatively stable.
Lending revenue was down $200 million year over year and down quarter over quarter. But mark-to-market gains on
securities drove the variance in both prior periods. We also had treasury services revenue of $1 billion, down 3% year
on year, with higher net interest income on higher deposits offset by the impact of business simplification and lower
trade loans and spreads.
Moving on to Markets & Investor Services, the challenging environment and lower client volumes we talked about at
Investor Day continued through the end of the quarter, ending with overall Markets revenues down 17% year on year.
And there was no discernible single driver of the weakness. It was across products and regions.
In general, it feels like the market consensus at the quarter beginning was for a growth story which didn't transpire. And
combined with several other factors, this led to generally lower levels of client activity across the board. We didn't see
a meaningful pickup in activity in March so it's reasonable to expect that some of this first quarter softness may
continue in April.
Security Services revenue of $1 billion was up 4% year on year, primarily driven by higher NII on higher deposits and
higher asset-based fees on higher assets under custody. And you see the credit adjustments and other line item, so the
negative $197 million, which includes the net DVA/FVA loss together with the impact of changes in CVA.
The credit environment continues to be benign, and we believe our exposure to Russia is manageable. We are
appropriately reserved based on what we know today, and we are closely monitoring the situation.

Expense came down 8% year on year to $5.6 billion, lower compensation given lower revenue driving the decline. The
comp-to-revenue ratio for the quarter was 33%, broadly in line with 34% in the same quarter of last year. And finally
on drivers, you can see client deposit balances were up 15% year on year but down 2% quarter on quarter seasonally.
Moving on to Commercial Banking on page nine, this quarter saw net income of about $580 million on revenue of $1.7
billion, with an ROE of 17%. Revenue was relatively flat year over year and declined by approximately $200 million
sequentially. The sequential decline was about two-thirds NII, driven by a large recovery we reported in the prior
quarter, together with lower day count. The balance of the decline was lower NII on seasonally lower fees.
A bright spot in the quarter was gross IB revenues of $450 million for the quarter, up over 30% year on year, a record
for a first quarter and representing nearly 35% of North America IB fees. Our credit book continued to show very
strong performance with a net recovery rate of four basis points. And expense was up 7% year on year, given the
investments we've been making in the business as well as the impact of cost of control and compliance.
Loan balances were up 7% year on year and 1% quarter on quarter. Consistent with recent trends, real estate growth
remains really strong at 15%. Both our commercial term lending and real estate banking portfolios grew in the double
digits, outpacing the industry.
In C&I, loan growth remains tepid and the environment remains extremely competitive. There were pockets of growth,
including the expansion markets, which were up 17%, and increased activity in healthcare, oil and gas, and technology
sectors. With respect to pipeline, we saw the pipeline trend up or strengthen a little from the lows of last year, trending
in the right direction but still relatively weak versus a year ago.
Moving on to page 10, Asset Management, the quarter saw net income of about $440 million, down 9% year on year,
with an ROE of 20%. Revenue was up 5% year on year, driven by flows and market performance, primarily Europe
and the U.S., off of a very strong first quarter a year ago.
Quarter-on-quarter revenue was down 13% despite continued inflows. Two-thirds of the decline was driven by normal
seasonality and performance fees. The remainder of the decline related to the change in the mark-to-market of a seed
investment. We did mention $100 million of a positive mark-to-market reflected in the fourth quarter's results. We gave
some of that back this quarter, driving the sequential variance impact to be over $150 million.
This was the 20th consecutive quarter of long-term inflows, $20 billion for the quarter, driving record AUM of $1.6
trillion, up 11% year on year, and we've seen a strong start to April.
Expense increased 11% year on year, given higher investments and cost of control; and decreased 8% quarter on
quarter, largely driven by lower comp on lower revenue.
Lastly, in banking, we continued to see strong loan and deposit growth with record balances up 19% and 7%
respectively.
Moving on to page 11 and Corporate and Private Equity, Private Equity net income of over $200 million included
approximately $400 million of gains on investments in the quarter. Treasury and CIO reported a net loss of $94 million.
NII remained relatively flat quarter on quarter at a negative $90 million, and we continue to expect NII in Treasury and
CIO to break even by the year end, driven by higher security yields as we benefit from higher rates. Additionally, we
deployed $25 billion gross of new investments in the quarter, with the portfolio being relatively flat less of maturities,
paydowns, and sales.
And before I continue, let me just tell you about NIM and NII for a second. The page is in the appendix. Total NIM
was flat quarter on quarter and core NIM was up two basis points, primarily driven by higher investment securities
yields, offset by loan spread compression.
Finally on this page, other corporate net income of a little over $200 million; included in this result is a $90 million
after-tax impact of writing down our deferred tax asset, following changes to New York State's tax, which was enacted
at quarter end. This upfront impact to DTA will be offset over time.

And as I said earlier, no significant legal expense to report for the quarter. It obviously feels good to have a quarter with
such a small number and to have put such large issues behind us. However, I want to remind you that we still expect
legal expenses to be lumpy quarter over quarter for the next couple of years as we work through the remaining issues.
Now on page 12, we've covered most of the outlook as we went through the presentation, just a couple of additional
things to cover. First, mortgage production, we told you to expect mortgage production to be negative for the year. We
do. And we expect it to be negative for the second quarter. Obviously, the final result will be market dependent.
However, at this point, our outlook is for production pre-tax, excluding repurchase, to be a loss of between $100
million and $150 million, slightly improved from the first quarter on higher volume seasonally.
Second, on releases, expect mortgage reserve releases to be more modest going forward, except for potentially PCI,
purchased credit-impaired loans, where we could see some lumpy releases if we have any. And expect card releases to
be essentially over.
So to wrap up, we feel good about the simplicity of the quarter and the solid core performance, given challenging
industry conditions. We are also pleased with the progress we've made on key items, including announcing the sale of
our physical Commodities business and our Retirement Planning Services business, passing CCAR both qualitatively
and quantitatively, exceeding 5% for the firm and bank leverage ratios, and maintaining strong expense discipline while
investing in growth and control. And perhaps most importantly, continuing to deliver outstanding customer service and
continuing to grow underlying performance drivers.
With that, operator, you can open up the line please for Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Glenn Schorr of ISI.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hello there.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Hi, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hello. Maybe with avoiding too much of the detail, stay at the high level and to talk about no
loan growth on a year-on-year basis. I know there's a bunch of much mix in there, and I guess I'm particularly
interested in the C&I bucket because that's the one area where we do see some growth in the industry. So A), there's a
little bit of the verbiage in your text on how you define C&I loan growth in the corporate bucket. And B), are there
areas where you just think pricing is getting a little high and you're purposely avoiding that growth?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So hey, Glenn. Just so I can give you the underlying core growth number of the Firm for the
quarter was 4% year on year, even though, obviously, if you take into consideration the runoff portfolios in Mortgage
and Card, we were closer to flat.
In C&I, you're right. The industry was up slightly; we were not. It's a continuation of the things we've talked about,
which is a combination of client selection of being very disciplined on credit, so not chasing growth at the cost of
liberal credit structures or overly aggressive pricing, and also the fact that we continued to see some of our criticized
and classified loans be refinanced away from us. So we're just going to hold the line on discipline. We are seeing the
ongoing aggressive competitive environment on both credit terms and pricing, and we'll do every rational and sensible
deal we can do, but we're not going to chase growth at the expense of discipline.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: I appreciate that. And then obviously over time we'll see that in both the steady or up NIM
and good delinquency trends, I guess.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, so a higher quality portfolio, higher quality clients.

<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. On the SLR that just came out, you gave us the expected impact, so I appreciate that. In
Jamie's annual letter, I think you said, "We began to make significant changes to the rates business and expect to
maintain decent profitability." Could you talk about what you've done in rates, how much through those changes we've
seen and what to expect on the other side?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I think very broadly, if you look at the numbers here, we've pushed down our capital leverage
SLR to all the businesses, so we're all making adjustments as appropriate. In the rates business in particular, we've seen
there's very few what I would call exotic rates products being done anymore, so it would be a rather large change. A lot
of things are going electronic which can reduce your expenses too. So we're pretty comfortable our rates business will
be normal profitability going forward. It may take a little bit of time.
<A - Marianne Lake>: And, Glenn, I just want to make sure that it was clear in my remarks that the impact of the new
proposal for leverage is included in the reported results.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Very clear. And normal profitability might mean lower revenues but normal profitability as
things change in that business?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: A little bit, yes. We all don't know what's going to happen to spreads going forward, so we're
comfortable. We want to stay in the business. We do a good job at it for our clients.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay, last one. Marianne, I guess next on the hit parade is the final rules on LCR and OLA.
Do you feel that's coming this year and do you expect – how do you feel you're positioned for that?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So with LCR, whether you take the Basel or the U.S. proposals, we're compliant at this point
with a margin. And importantly, we're also compliant with our own internal stress framework. So we feel good about
LCR. We're continuing to manage it, as you would expect.
Yes, I am expecting us to get long-term debt rules this year, but I don't know when and I can't control it. We feel with
over 19% available resources that we're in a good starting position, and so we're not really going to be in the business
of guessing where that ends up. We'll adjust accordingly if it's different from our expectations.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay, thank you both.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Good morning. Marianne, thank you for walking us through the progress on the leverage
ratio; I'm just wondering. Should we expect on the bank level that you'd be compliant to 6% at some point this year, or
was the quarterly progress this quarter or last quarter rather unusual?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So given that we did some restructuring of bank level capital, including some downstreaming,
that was a fairly sizable increase in the quarter, so you're not going to see progress be linear. But there are a number of
different levers that we have in our tool kit, so to speak, to get to 6% over time. Whether that's this year or whether
that's into next year, we're going to be measured about the progress. So whether that's retaining earnings, potentially
additional capital, we've been actioning leverage actions, both deposits as well as derivative actions.
And then ultimately, there's also the good guy when it comes. The timing depends; it may be a 2015 thing or hopefully
moving from CEM [Current Exposure Method] to the newly named SA-CCR [Standard Approach – Counterparty
Credit Risk] calculations for derivative potential future exposure. We did take a look at the information on SA-CCR,
and it hasn't changed our point of view that we would expect that to have a favorable impact for the bank of 40 basis
points plus or minus. So when that comes, that will be a nice boost. But through retaining earnings and the leverage
actions we have and potentially more capital optimization, we have a clear path to 6%, whether it's this year or early

<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Okay. And just the second question, given than you're already compliant in the LCR, is it
fair for us to assume that your core margin should continue to improve throughout the year at this measured pace?
<A - Marianne Lake>: I would say it's fair to assume that our core margin should be relatively stable throughout the
year, and I think plus or minus two basis points on a large balance sheet like ours with mix changes is relatively stable.
So our expectation is for core NIM to be relatively stable in 2014, to be stable to slightly positive in 2015, assuming
that the implied rate curve plays out the way it is.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Okay, and just a last one for me. In terms of your comments on card provision, help us think
about the balance of in terms of the catalysts for your guidance. Should we start to expect balance growth to come
back, or is this more of a comment that charge-offs are as low as they'll go and should normalize here?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So it's a combination of factors. We are seeing delinquency trends and roll rate charge-offs
flatten out. We knew that it would happen one day. That's what we're seeing at the moment. We'll continue to update
you through the quarters of the year. Based upon that, we're not expecting any more results.
In addition, you should know that – you saw our outstandings were flat. And underneath that, our core portfolio is
growing. We still do believe we are at that inflection point and that we should see some growth, but it will be relatively
modest.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Okay, thank you for taking my questions.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Thank you, Erika.

Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: Good morning.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Good morning.
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: If we look at the traditional bank fees, even outside of Mortgage, they were a bit weaker
year over year than I think most might have been expecting. I'm looking at the card fees, service charges. Do you think
that's all weather related or just weaker macro backdrop than maybe we were looking for?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So you're talking about interchange fees in card?
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: Just the overall credit card fee line that you gave us. That obviously would include the
interchange but probably some other things as well.
<A - Marianne Lake>: The sales volume obviously seasonally goes down quarter over quarter. I don't think that we
have perceived there has been a significant impact from weather on card sales in the first quarter for us. Our sales were
up 10% year on year, so pretty strong. No, I wouldn't attribute anything to the weather.
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: Okay. And then just separately, the expense guidance for this year I think is unchanged,
even though revenue is coming in a little bit weaker than expected. I realize it's just the first quarter and things could
change. But is there opportunity to adjust the expense base a bit more if revenue is light?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Obviously, you saw in the first quarter that on the back of lower revenues in the Markets
business we have lower compensation as an absolute matter, albeit the ratio is relatively in line. So you're absolutely
right. Depending upon how the rest of the year pans out will determine whether the compensation expenses inherent in
our outlook for CIB are up or down or flat, and that will adjust our ending results. We're not ready yet to declare a
position on the whole year. So less than $59 billion is still our guidance, but we intend to be very, very disciplined.

<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: All right. And then just lastly on the buybacks net of issuance being approved for greater
than $5 billion, any comments just on the timing or the likelihood of all that being used this year?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, so on the timing, I mentioned the fact that we aren't expecting our capital accretion of
10% plus to be linear. We're expecting it to be much more in the second half of the year, flatter in the third half. So it's
reasonable to expect that we will be covering employee issuance, plus or minus, in the first half of the year, with most
of our repurchase capacity being available for us in the second half. As to how much of it we'll use will be dependent
on a number of factors including, obviously, our share price at the time. But we do intend to take advantage of the
opportunity that we've been given to buy back and we'll see what the absolute level is when we get there.
<Q - Matthew O'Connor>: Okay, all right. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from the line of John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi, Marianne. In the mortgage area, the $400 million hit to the MSR risk management
results, just to clarify; that was a one-time hit related to your corporate reallocation of capital that you did earlier this
year?
<A - Marianne Lake>: That's absolutely right. So when we declared at Investor Day that we had increased the target
rates for that business, we pushed that down into the valuation of the asset one time.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And again, the reasons for the negative profit margin we're seeing on the
origination side, is it just the timing of getting expenses adjusted to a new base origination that it takes because there's a
lag, or is there also some investment expense that you're running through there that are also hurting your mortgage
profitability?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So it's three things. There is a little bit of timing in there insofar as we did make continued
improvement in expenses and we're going to continue to work what we would characterize as the fixed cost base. It's
definitely the case that we are building this business for the long run, and so we continue to invest in technology and
operations to make us more profitable and efficient through the cycle.
But it is also the case that is an incredibly small market. The market size was sub-$250 billion so annualized sub-$1
trillion, which is not something we've seen since before 2000. So the reality is, in a market that size, it's very hard to
have strong profitability or profitability when you have to have a core level of fixed expenses. And so we're thinking
about this business over the longer run to be as efficient and profitable as possible through the cycle in markets that are
on average bigger than this.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then on the Markets activity in the Investment Bank, I guess a bit
disappointing that activity levels didn't pick up in March where it seemed like overall rate volatility picked up as people
took different takes in the Fed statements. Do you attribute some of the weakness to the lower issuance compared to
last year which seems like that could continue? And what do you think is needed to stimulate better activity,
particularly in FICC this year?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So yes, I would say lower issuance was a factor, but there were very many, so I wouldn't say
that it was a single driving factor. Lower mortgages, lower debt issuance; there were a whole bunch of different things.
And then as to catalysts, more volatility, more growth, and we'll just have to wait and see.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: And do you – any sense of what kind of year you're planning for there, or is it really
just a wait and see how the environment unfolds and you react as it occurs?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: I think, John, we've always been very consistent on this kind of thing. You guys got to make your
own estimates because they're just as good as ours. Great business with great people, technology, sales, research, we
can't predict it going forward. It will be what it is.

<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay.
<A - Marianne Lake>: As similar to the mortgage comment, it's a long-term view that will affect the business and this
is one quarter.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Got it. Any impacts on the commodities sale that's planned or did you move that to
discontinued ops, or did that have any impact on the market or the metrics this quarter, Marianne?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, we've accounted for it in held-for-sale and no significant impacts to the results.

Our next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hey, good morning, a couple of follow-ups. One, on the commodities business that you are
in the process of selling, can you give us a sense as to what the impact is likely to be post-sale?
<A - Marianne Lake>: We've reflected any of the – obviously we looked at the bid and the valuation and any of the
difference versus book in our P&L and it's insignificant. And we are engaged in ongoing relationships with the buyer,
and we'll realize the amount over time, but it's not expected to be anything significant.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay, and then just a couple of clarifications. On OLA you mentioned 19% available
resources. I assume that's against RWA, but just wanted to clarify.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes. Correct. It is, yes.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then on SLR, on page three you show us the ratios. I just wanted to confirm. The
Basel III line says that it's on a fully phased-in basis, but we don't say fully phased-in on SLR. Does that imply it's
transitional?
<A - Marianne Lake>: No, it's fully phased in. It's our best effort at fully phased in, Betsy.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: On the SLR as well, right?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Correct.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: And then...
<A - Marianne Lake>: But remember that with the exception of the fact that we aren't baking in things that are not yet
certain so we haven't baked in the benefit that we would expect, for example, from SA-CCR because it hasn't yet been
acknowledged.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And that 40 basis point benefit there is both for the bank level and the HoldCo level?
<A - Marianne Lake>: The sensitivity is different in the bank and the holding company, so it's more like 30 plus or
minus at the holding company, 40 plus or minus at the bank.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay, great. And then lastly on expenses, you highlighted throughout all the areas where you
had the head count reduction. Could you just give us a sense as to whether or not the benefit to the expense dollars is
fully in the first quarter, or was there a negative from things like severance that then the benefit to the expense dollars
comes in Q2 and beyond?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So with respect to the head count reductions in the first quarter, the severance wasn't
significant, and the benefit is largely in. Remember, we said that overall the Firm is expecting to see head count go
down by about 5,000 for the full year, and it's down only by 2,000 so far, so we have another way to go.

<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: And the pace of that 3,000 from here is ratable or front-end loaded?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So if you think about it gross, Mortgage was 6,000 of the total growth and it's 3,000 in, so
another 3,000 to go I would say in the nearer, not longer term. And in the Consumer Bank, that was 2,000 with 1,500
in, and the remainder will just happen through time.

Our next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski of Autonomous.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Hi.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Hi. I just wanted to follow up on the SA-CCR; thanks for the guidance on the potential
benefit. Can you give us a sense of what specifically is driving that to be beneficial? I've gone through the BIS release.
But frankly, without understanding what the underlying is, it's really difficult to understand why it's a benefit. Just
maybe you can help us qualitatively understand it.
<A - Marianne Lake>: I'll give you a very short qualitative answer, and then if you want to really dig in, I'll do it
offline with Investor Relations. But the very short answer is there's an additional ability to recognize collateral
investing. That wasn't in the original CEM calculation. There are lots and lots of other complexity to it. We are doing
our best to estimate it. We haven't fully built the models to do it, so we're continuing to work on that. But if you want to
get into a very technical discussion on it, we can arrange that for you.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, I'll probably follow up, but that's helpful, thanks. You mentioned a number of times as
you went through, and we could see it in the slides, that a lot of the expense impacts, to the extent that expenses were
problematic relative to a year ago, a lot of it was because of the control agenda, which obviously we appreciate and
you've spoken to. But can we step back and talk about in a holistic Firm-wide way where are we with implementing
that? How much more impact do we expect to see? At what point do we lap on that?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Okay, so a couple of things. First is that if you remember from Investor Day, notwithstanding
the earlier comment about the volatility potentially in compensation in the Markets businesses, we said we would be
below $59 billion, and there were four principal things driving that. So in our favor, we have efficiencies in branches,
efficiencies in CIB and mainly mortgage down about $1.5 billion year over year. And against us we had the $1 billion
incremental cost of control and some growth, principally in Asset Management. So the net of all of those meant that we
were effectively self-funding through efficiency and reduced mortgage expenses, the incremental costs in control that
you're seeing come through.
It isn't the case that we have broken out as a macro matter how much of that $1 billion is in our run rate now, and
maybe we'll do that for you next quarter. I would say that we are adding heads, and so these things do take some time.
Even though I believe that there will be a chunk of it in our run rate through the middle of the year, it's not all in our
run rate yet.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: So if I can interpret that, that means that after midyear, we should have fully lapped. Is that
what you're saying?
<A - Marianne Lake>: I'll have to confirm it to you next quarter, but I would say that we would have a majority of it
in through midyear because we are obviously trying to hire up to be able to execute on the agenda. So if you think
about the impact where we're trying to add people to compliance, we are adding people to compliance, to legal, to
audit, to finance, to risk, and we're doing that largely in the first half of the year, but there will be a tail.

<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, that's also really helpful. In terms of FICC and the weakness that we saw, can you
comment at all and if it's possible even to quantify a little bit what the impact was of some of the adoption of SEF
mandates during the quarter? We certainly could see that SEF volumes themselves seemed to get disrupted at certain
points in the quarter when new mandates went into play. But if you think about the impact of that regulatory change on
the OTC derivatives markets, it would be really helpful to understand how much of the impact was just regulatory
change.
<A - Marianne Lake>: As you know, it's very, very difficult to decouple everything, and so it's not clear that there's
no impact, but it's not our sense that it was a significant driver of the performance in the quarter. There is a limited
amount of volume on SEFs right now, albeit increasing, and there has been margin compression but from tight margins
to start with. So it's not our sense that it was a significant driver, not to say that there was no impact.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: So it did come down a little bit, but it's back to where it was it was, the derivative trading, and we
wouldn't blame that for anything.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: So if one were to think that there was going to be spread compression over time as a result of
some of these things that might still lie in the future next to your $1 billion plus or minus revenue impact that you've
talked about?
<A - Marianne Lake>: That's right. So again, not to say there hasn't been any but volumes are relatively low. The
margins are relatively tight. The $1 billion we talked about, which is, by the way, our best estimate, so it could be better
than that, is something that would progress through time. It's not going to be a cliff.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Great. That's all very helpful. I appreciate you taking my questions.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Thank you, good morning. Can you guys share with us? On your loan loss provision this
quarter, obviously last year the provision was greatly affected by loan loss reserve releases. Should we anticipate the
provision reaching your net charge-off levels for this year to match them out?
<A - Marianne Lake>: The best guidance that I can give you is the guidance that we gave at Investor Day, which is
expect the Firm-wide charge-offs to be at or around $5 billion plus or minus. And then I would point you to the
guidance we just gave you on reserve releases, which is expect some more in Mortgage but modest. We might have
some in PCI but it's too early to know, and a little more in Cards. So net those two down. There may be some noise to
that, but that's our current best outlook.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Okay. Speaking of the PCI loans, they were down year over year about 10% to 12%.
Should we expect that type of run rate throughout the year as that portfolio continues to shrink?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, largely speaking. That seems about right, 10% or so, yes.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Okay. You talked about in the Mortgage business you're changing the way you're
approaching it. And the revenue run rate you had this quarter of about $160 million, can you size for us where you
think under the new approach that you're having with mortgages, what kind of revenues we might anticipate? Because
I'm assuming this was unusually low, this quarter's number.
<A - Marianne Lake>: So our production revenues this quarter, I'm just going to make sure we're talking about the
same thing, was just about $300 million. I told you that we're expecting the second quarter to be negative. You're going
to have higher revenues because seasonally have you higher volumes, but obviously it's market dependent. So I would
say given seasonality, the first quarter was small and volumes were depressed given the weather. We'd be hopeful that

the market would be above $1 trillion for the full year, maybe not quite as high as $1.2 trillion. So if you add
seasonality back and gross up the number, you can probably get quite close. But of course, it could all change
depending upon rates in the market.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Great, and then finally...
<A - Marianne Lake>: The current outlook for the market size was about $1.2 trillion. I suspect that will be revised
down slightly on the back of the first quarter. So we're going to have a small market; it won't be absolutely linear.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Okay. In the Institutional Asset Management business, you pointed out the decline
sequentially in the revenues because of some of the one-time items in the fourth quarter. On the year-over-year
declines, even though the inflows were up, any comments on the revenues for the institutional revenue part of that
business?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Year over year, revenues for Asset Management Institutional, no specific. We had some –
March was not strong, the first quarter, so Institutional was not as strong as were the other segments, so no specific
issues, but there's some lumpiness there obviously.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Okay. And then finally, it may just be market conditions or maybe something you can do.
When you look at your net interest margin and you look at the interest earning asset yields, the securities borrowed
number was a negative 30 basis points. It's been trending more negative each quarter. It was minus two basis points a
year ago. Can you point to anything you could do to try to reverse that?
<A - Marianne Lake>: The securities, that line item is a funky feature of the fact that in our Prime Services business,
our contractual income is LIBOR minus the spread, which drives that to be a negative number. I wouldn't read too
much into the trend in volatility there. The absolute economics of the business is still positive and the offset is in
trading liabilities. So that's not a line item in its own right and alone that is very constructive.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Derek De Vries of UBS.
<Q - Derek A. De Vries>: Thanks, I had a few questions. You had no significant items that you called to our attention,
but then you said there are a few non-core items and they broadly offset. As I'm looking at my notes, I see there's like a
$400 million negative in MSR, there's $90 million in tax, there's $200 million of DVA/FVA, all negative, and then
there's $400 million of private equity gains. I guess I'm missing another $300 million of positive. I just was wondering
if you can call out what that would be.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Reserve releases.
<Q - Derek A. De Vries>: Okay. The reserve releases. All right, understood.
<A - Marianne Lake>: And then we don't drill into every $50 million negative non-recurring item but there were
some of them too.
<Q - Derek A. De Vries>: Okay, that's fine. And then just on the tax rate, obviously I've stripped out the $90 million,
but it still feels like a high tax rate. Is there anything funny going on there?
<A - Marianne Lake>: No, it's not far off of 30% plus or minus, which is our generally expected effective tax rate.
<Q - Derek A. De Vries>: Okay.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Nothing else of any noteworthiness. Obviously, it's always going to be impacted by the
absolute level of pre-tax, the percentage of overseas income, the percentage of tax efficient income, but nothing special.

<Q - Derek A. De Vries>: Okay. And then the guidance on mortgage production has pushed out the losses and we
talked about it a lot. But just so I'm clear, the change in your guidance there is just essentially a change in your market
expectations. The $1.2 trillion coming to a lower number, that's the only real change you've got there?
<A - Marianne Lake>: We haven't really changed our guidance. To be fair, our guidance was always to be negative
for the year. We're just trying to be very specific about the degree of negativity in the second quarter to make sure you
have information for your models.

Our next question comes from Paul Miller of FBR.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Yes, thank you very much. You guys mentioned I believe in a report or in comments that you
want to get your servicing portfolio down from $800 billion to $600 billion on loans, I guess on just natural decay and
selling MSRs. When do you think the timing of those sales of the MSRs? And do you think that the – a lot of people
feel that you cannot transfer any MSRs anymore due to some of the headline risks. Can you add some color to that
also?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So obviously, the timing of sales is going to be a little bit opportunistic. So the best comment I
can make is that that $600 million number is two, three years away from now, not necessarily, but we'll try to manage it
the best way we can.
And then with respect to the ability to sell or sub service, there is still the opportunity to do it. It's just not necessarily
the case that you can diffuse your risk entirely, which I think is understood.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Can you add more color? You can't get rid of the risk. Can you add more color around that?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Insofar as I think that as we move loans to sub services, obviously, we retain the risk and have
had third-party oversight. To the degree we're selling them, I think the regulators are potentially looking at originators
to continue to bear some of the origination and other risks.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: We're going to run the MSR for returns and quality, so it's also a question of what you put into it.
So you should probably expect to see less FHA and things like that and you're going to see some runoff over time.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And then, Jamie, on the credit boxes not really expanding, what do you think – what kind of
impact do you think is happening on the overall mortgage market, especially the purchase market, as we're seeing
almost 14-year lows on the origination side?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: It's almost impossible to tell but there are – if you're jumbo you get loans. If you are GSE, you
get loans. But almost all the other stuff in between, anything with any hair on it, like if you ever had a credit problem, if
you're earning self-reported income, so a lot of people have overlays that are being tougher than is required by FHA,
GSE, or their own rules because of reps and warranties et cetera. And I don't know when it's going to go away. It's not
getting worse. It's just sitting there and probably holding back a little bit the purchase market.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Think about credit is available across the LTV spectrum but the bar to be able to document
income and prove ability to repay under QM is high.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Okay. Hey, guys. Thank you very much.

<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Good morning.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: You had alluded to some of the drivers of the RWA growth earlier. And I was just hoping
you could frame that in the context of your $40 billion targeted RWA decline from Investor Day and whether that's
potentially at risk, or is $1.55 trillion RWA level still achievable?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So the models that were just approved, we understood that we were going to have certain of
our models that needed additional work to be acceptable by the regulators of Basel III when we gave the guidance at
Investor Day. So as a large matter as we sit here today, that's been our best understanding of how things will work out
absent there being any new news or issues during the year.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: It's a timing difference as opposed to a target difference.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, the whole industry submitted a huge number of models under Basel 2.5 for the regulators
to review at the beginning of 2013. We had approval to use them for the year, whether they're being reviewed and
pending after the review. We got some feedback and we're going to remediate the models and resubmit them for
approval. So it will take us time but it is timing.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay, I understood. And then transitioning to OLA for a second, long-term debt outstanding
did increase modestly about 2% in the quarter. I just wanted to confirm how we should be thinking about issuance
plans over the course of the year. Are you managing it to a 19% bail-in buffer so we saw the modest increase in RWA
and then saw a commensurate increase in long-term debt, or should we be thinking about it entirely differently?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Just assume it's going to be fairly constant. When we know what the real rules are, we may
modify that.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, that's right. We're not managing to an OLA that we don't know it yet.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay, fair enough, and then last one for me. The high frequently trading review and market
structure, potential market structure overhaul continues to be an area of increasing focus. And I was hoping you could
speak to the Equities business and whether the anticipated SEC review and potential broader equity market structure
reform will compel any adjustments and how you're thinking about that at this juncture.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: We are firmly supportive of having proper and good markets for everybody, and we think we
have pretty good policies and protocols in place. But I don't know what it will do to our issues in market structures in
some pools et cetera. So we'll just have to let that review take place. I should point in Michael Lewis's book, which I
did not read, on page 231 they refer to us as one of the good guys.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay, fair enough. Thank you for taking my questions.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Jeff Harte of Sandler O'Neill.
<Q - Jeffery Harte>: Hi, good morning, a couple left for me. One, looking at Consumer & Business Banking,
essentially the Deposits business, the overhead or the efficiency ratio there has really trended up for a few years
straight. I know there has been some investment as well. But how should we think of that going from the 70%-plus it
has been now to back to the mid-60%s like it historically was?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So a couple of things, as you know, we have been investing and building our branches to the
place it is now where we're happy with the distribution capability we have. So that was driving a lot of the investment.

In 2014 we continued to invest, importantly, in digital and the cost to serve it efficiently so that can we drive the ratios
down.
We guided at Investor Day to expect expenses in the business to be up 1%, so a little but not the kind of increase that
we've been seeing, after which you should expect it to start to come down. And we said that the overall CCB business,
including mortgage, would be down $2 billion by 2016 over 2014, and a chunk of that is in CBB.
So we are very focused on it and investing, in fact, in the technology and processes to be able to be efficient. We started
to see the increased term as we stopped having to invest in branches because we're happy with the distribution and it
will start to come down next year.
<Q - Jeffery Harte>: So that getting better, to some extent those expenses going down, to what extent are revenues
getting better? Does the WaMu footprint factor into that, or are you waiting for interest rate help?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Everything that I talked about in terms of expenses going down is all on a dollar basis, not on
an efficiency ratio basis, so we're absolutely expecting dollars to come down after 2014 in the business.
With respect to the new branches, we said there are a third of our branches that are less than 10 years old and about
11% that are less than three years old, so we have a lot of branches in the deposit gathering phase. And deposit margins
are relatively flat. At the moment, we've reached the point where volume is providing support to NII but not strong
growth until we start to see rates continue to rise and be able to reinvest up the curve as deposit investments mature.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: And the underlying numbers are terrific, customer satisfaction, deposits, households, mobile,
Chase Wealth Management, small business, et cetera, but they are being squeezed by NII and interest rates. And we've
always told you, we're going to build for the long run, which is that we'll recover one day and you will see spreads go
up in this business. And when that happens, that happens. But we're not going to not grow deposits because of that.
And that will also affect obviously efficiency ratio.
<Q - Jeffery Harte>: Okay. And on the litigation side, it's nice to have a quarter where there aren't big charges. Who
knows what the market does, but in theory that's a good thing for the share price. Is there the potential for that to be a
good thing for the underlying businesses too? Have all the headline risks been a negative on some of the business lines
from a consumer customer perspective?
<A - Marianne Lake>: As much as I would love to be able to take a quarter that looks like this and say we could
expect more of the same, the reality is we still have issues open in front of us. We still have large reserves, and we still
are working through them. So we've been clear that while we can't predict legal expenses, we do expect them to be
lumpy. And for every zero or close to zero quarter, we could have a quarter that has several hundred millions of dollars
or more, albeit it should trend down and abate to something much lower over time. So I don't think you can read into it
that we're done. We're still working through issues. We're obviously glad to have some of them behind us and some of
the bigger and most difficult ones.
<Q - Jeffery Harte>: To the extent you're not looking hopefully at multibillion dollar quarterly settlements anymore,
does that help on the volume side in the businesses? Did that have a negative impact on customer interactions with
you?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: No. If you look at the customer flows, in every single business they were very good. And
customer sat scores were up, investments were up, assets under management are up. Market shares are up in credit
card, consumer deposit. That's all very good. I would completely separate out this litigation stuff. Marianne, you all
have averaged – your own estimates for litigation I think were $500 million a quarter.
<A - Marianne Lake>: On average across all our models, it's about $500 million a quarter, yes.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Make believe, use your number, nobody else's, it's not going to be $500 million consistent. It's
going to zero, something else, zero, $250 million. That's what it is until it goes away. It's not going to affect the
underlying business. And as you know, we also have one-time benefits from stuff that we don't anticipate too.

<Q - Jeffery Harte>: So you haven't noticed a negative reputational impact with customers? It's been okay, obviously.
Looking at the volumes, I guess it must be okay.
<A - Marianne Lake>: We're growing share. So I mean...
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Clients go with their feet and they seem to be coming to our branches and our bankers.
<Q - Jeffery Harte>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Yes, hey. Good morning, two follow-ups. First, on the expense side, I think if you look at the
run rate this quarter, you were at around $58.4 billion, so well below if you annualize that than your $59 billion target.
Seasonally this would be the higher expense quarter given Capital Markets revenue. Is there something we should be
thinking about in the out quarters, whether it's higher regulatory compliance spending, marketing spending, or is this
just something conservative because we don't know where Capital Markets revenues go?
<A - Marianne Lake>: It's a little bit of we don't know where Capital Markets revenues will go, obviously. And if
they stay low, we expect to pass that down to the bottom line. And it's also a little bit of there are sometimes positive
and sometimes negative surprises and issues in expenses, and we're just trying to be a little cautious. So there was a
little bit of cautiousness in there. We're going to obviously do everything we can to outperform that.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Okay, fair enough, and then make a quick question back on the SLR. You guys I think last
quarter, I think before the changes by Basel, noted that the Basel Committee's calculation would be a net drag of 10
basis points. This quarter, it's 15 to 20 basis points benefit, right? Is that simply the changing in the credit conversion
factors on the off-balance sheet credit lines, or is there anything else driving that improvement this quarter?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So most of the improvement this quarter was associated with the ability for us to net to
variation margin on derivative across currencies as allowed by contracts rather than having to only net in the currency
of the underlying transaction. So that was obviously sensible that you should be allowed to net margin across allowable
currencies, but that was not the provision of the Basel Committee. The U.S. proposal changed that and that's favorable.
That's driving most of it. There were other things, up, down, complicated technical things, but not big numbers.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Okay. And that doesn't include the benefit of moving to, say, the non-internal model
methodology, which could be another 40 basis points?
<A - Marianne Lake>: That's correct, but I'm not expecting that in the very near future.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Right. Okay, great. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Yes, good morning. As you mentioned, I'm looking at page 17 of your supplement, on the
credit card business. And as you mentioned, all the volume metrics all look great, sales volume up 10% and merchant
processing up 11%. But then when you look at the fees, it's down 4%. And I would have thought we've anniversaried
all the regulatory changes and so on. So I guess a big question for me is, in this business in particular, why aren't the
favorable volume metrics translating into revenues?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: Do you know the answer? We're going to have to get back to you.

<A - Marianne Lake>: Chris, I'll get back to you. I apologize.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Okay.
<A - Marianne Lake>: We'll get back to you.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: It probably has to do with awards, but we'll get back to you.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Okay. And then just secondly on a broader philosophical level, Jamie, a couple years ago
at Investor Day, you rhetorically asked the question about Capital Markets income, is it cyclical or is it secular, and you
said believe me, it's cyclical. And now you look industry wide, by my numbers, we're down on a year-over-year basis
13 out of the last 17 quarters, and it's sure as heck feeling secular, and I'm curious. One, have you adjusted your point
of view? Two, do you think there is some irreducible level of transaction volume business before the industry? And
three, how do we gauge how far we are on that glide path from where we used to be to where we stabilize?
<A - Jamie Dimon>: So there are certain things which are secular. People have gotten out, and I'm not talking about us
per se, but people have gotten out of or reduced dramatically credit hybrids, certain exotic derivatives, et cetera. I think
there may be additional secular change, but it's not the whole business. So the way I look at the whole business is we
have 120 trading desks around the world. We have 16,000 clients. And if you look at the fuel of the business, the fuel
of the business is investable assets and need of people to invest those, whether it's corporations, individuals, et cetera.
Those numbers will double over 10 years. They're going to triple in the emerging and developing markets. Spreads
themselves have been coming down fairly consistently for 20 years, and that's called capitalism that you're efficiently
using capital.
And so I look at it as a long-term business. It's going to be a good business. Shares are going to change. There will be a
whole bunch of adjustments. As you know, it could change on a dime. And so, I don't look at the $5 billion in Markets
revenue and cry in my soup. I think it's a pretty good business, and we have very consistent performance. Remember, it
is driven by technology, research, sales, ideas, cross-border flows. And last year, we didn't even have one trading day
loss, which I consider really spectacular. So it's a good business. It will grow over time, and it will have some secular
adjustments.
I don't know about your numbers being right, the 13 of 17 quarters. And I also wouldn't go back and look at the peak,
the really peak markets of 2007 or something, and I think you had some in 2009 and say that was a standard. I think
that was a little high, higher than normal.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: My numbers were industry from 2009 on, or 2010 on, so but anyway. But thanks. I may
have probably an unanswerable question. That's it for me. Thank you.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Okay. I have an answer to your other question. I apologize for not having it off the top of my
head. In the first quarter of last year in non-interest revenue in Card we had a one-time exit of a non-core product. So I
think if you go back and dig out that transcript or have a look at the supplement there, there was actually a one-time
item. So if we adjust for that, we would have been up more strongly.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Okay, all right. Thank you.
<A - Jamie Dimon>: One thing I'll mention in the Credit Card business, we have beta tests going of our ChaseNet.
You're not going to see in the numbers this year, but we think it's a pretty exciting thing that we can do for merchants
and customers over time.

We have no further questions at this time.
