question with one follow-up, please. If we are unable to get to your question during the call, please call our Investor
Relations department at 770-384-2387.
Before I turn the call over to Craig, let me remind you that today's press release and the presentations made by our
executives include forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our
expectations and projections. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those factors identified in the
release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Today's presentations may also include certain non-GAAP measurements. Reconciliation of these measurements is
provided on our website.
Now, let me turn the call over to Craig.
Craig A. Menear
Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. While I've spoken to many of you on past earnings calls, this is my
first call as CEO and I'd like to start by thanking Frank for his leadership and guidance over the years. Our effort as a
leadership team will be to continue to drive our strategic framework and to take on the opportunities that lie ahead for
our business.
Now let's turn to the quarter. Sales for the third quarter were $20.5 billion, up 5.4% from last year. Comp sales were
positive 5.2% and our diluted earnings per share were $1.15. Our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 5.8%. In the third
quarter, as we saw in the second quarter, we had broad-based growth across our geographies with all three of our U.S.
divisions posting mid single-digit comps. Every region positively comped in the quarter, as did 39 of our top 40
markets. We saw growth in ticket and transaction in the third quarter, and we were particularly pleased with the strong
transaction growth as each month in the quarter had positive comp transactions.
As Ted will detail, all of our merchandising departments positively comped, and we continue to see strength in the core
of our store. Our Service businesses had comps above the company average with strength in windows, countertops and
water heaters. Both our Consumer and Pro businesses grew during the quarter. The growth in our Pro business
continues to be anchored by our large spending Pro, which grew at approximately two times the company average. So
as we look at the trends across our business, broad-based geographical growth, strong comps and higher ticket install
projects, growth with both our Pro and Consumer, and strength in the core of the store, we continue to see a recovering
home improvement market in the U.S.
On the international front, our Canadian business posted comps above the company average in local currency for the
quarter, making it 12 quarters in a row of positive comps. Comps in local currency for our Mexican business were in
line with our company average, yielding their 44th consecutive quarter of positive comps. Sales from our online
channel grew almost 40% in the quarter, and this was particularly impressive as we anniversaried growth of over 50%
in the same quarter last year. We saw increased traffic to our sites, growth in online conversion and an increase in the
number of orders being picked up in the store in the quarter.
We continue to invest in interconnected retail. Across our online properties we improved navigation, enhanced search
capabilities and expanded chat functionality during the quarter, and our supply chain team opened our Perris, California
direct fulfillment center, the second of three planned direct fulfillment centers. These automated facilities will support
our online growth with a balance of cost efficiency and speed in shipping online orders to meet our customers' needs.
Interconnected retail also requires us to rethink space allocation within our stores. Almost 40% of our online orders are
picked up in the store, using our Buy Online, Pick Up In Store and Buy Online, Ship to Store capabilities. This year we
are installing dedicated storage bays in 550 stores to improve the customer experience.
The U.S. housing recovery continues to track in line with our expectations, with home price appreciation and housing
turnover being the drivers of growth for our business, and we have also seen improvement in GDP growth. As Carol
will detail, we are reaffirming our sales guidance and our diluted earnings per share guidance for the year.

Before I close, I'd like to briefly comment on the data breach. First, we apologize to anyone impacted by this. From the
start, our guiding principle has been to put our customers first. Our customers won't be responsible for any fraudulent
charges incurred through the breach, and we will continue to offer free credit monitoring and ID theft protection to any
impacted customers. We will continue to invest in enhanced security measures to protect our customers' information.
Finally, I'd like to congratulate Marc Powers, a 28-year Home Depot veteran, who was recently promoted to Executive
Vice President of U.S. Stores. Marc has been instrumental in improving customer service, making him an ideal fit for
the role. The power of The Home Depot begins with our company's strong culture and commitments to its values. I
want to thank our associates for their hard work and dedication to our customers. Based on this quarter's results, over
99% of our stores would qualify for Success Sharing, our profit sharing program for our hourly associates.
With that, let me turn the call over to Ted.
Edward P. Decker
Thanks, Craig, and good morning, everyone. We were pleased with our performance in the third quarter. Strength in
the core of the store, growth of our Pro customers, excellent execution of seasonal events, and the continued
implementation of our merchandising tools all contributed to these results. All merchandising departments posted
positive comps. Millwork, Tools, Kitchen, Indoor Garden, Lumber, Lighting, Bath and Plumbing were above the
company average. Flooring, Hardware, Building Materials, Decor, Electrical, Paint and Outdoor Garden were positive
but below the company average.
The core of the store continued to perform, and we saw comps above the company average in maintenance and repair
products like water heaters, light bulbs, power tool accessories, hand tools, cleaning, pipe and fittings and wiring
devices. There was also strength in simple decor with comps above the company average in plumbing fixtures,
decorative lighting, vanities and hard surface flooring. Pro heavy categories continued to grow, and we saw comps
above the company average in insulation, concrete, pressure treated wood, dimensional lumber, HVAC, and gypsum.
Our millwork categories also had another quarter of great performance led by comps above the company average in
interior doors, exterior doors, and windows. Our Labor Day, fall cleanup, and harvest events provided great values and
were well received by our customers, resulting in solid comps in outdoor power, storage, decorative holiday, and grills.
Using our merchandising planning tools, we were able to add innovation and localization within our fastener and
builders hardware categories. In fasteners, we recently completed a reset resulting in a more effective mix of our
private label brand Everbilt with national brands. With this reset, we also introduced a larger assortment of innovative
specialty fasteners.
In cabinet hardware, we adjusted the assortment throughout the U.S. to better serve our customers on a local level. As a
result, these categories comped above the company average in the third quarter.
Total comp transactions grew by 3.1%, while comp ticket increased 2.1% for the quarter. Our average ticket increase
was positively impacted to reflect approximately 10 basis points due to commodity price inflation from products such
as lumber. Transactions for tickets under $50, representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 1.9% for the
third quarter. Transactions for tickets over $900, also representing approximately 20% of our U.S. sales, were up 5.9%
in the third quarter. The drivers behind the increase in big ticket purchases were water heaters, flooring and
countertops.
Now let me turn our attention to the fourth quarter. Our strategy of partnering with suppliers to bring innovation and
value to the market has never been stronger. This quarter we continued to deliver on the promise with the addition of 21
new Kohler SKUs to our bath and kitchen faucet lineup. These faucets will bring the latest in innovation and style and
are exclusive to The Home Depot. For our Pro customers, we will be featuring an exclusive series of carbide-tipped
reciprocating blades from Diablo. These blades are designed for extreme metal cutting, including high-strength alloys,
cast iron, and stainless steel. This breakthrough technology provides up to 20 times the cutting life of standard blades,

saving our Pros time and money.
With the holidays nearing, we're once again offering an outstanding assortment of products in our gift centers. We will
feature great deals on hand and power tools, including amazing values from Milwaukee, Makita and DEWALT.
In holiday decor, we continue to bring innovation and the latest offerings to our customers. We have become a leading
destination for the category, both in-store and through our extended assortment online. We're excited about our lineup
of pre-lit trees and have added many new styles, including one that can change between 56 different light functions and
color options using a remote control.
Finally, I'd like to mention the outstanding special buys that we have planned for Black Friday and Cyber Week. We'll
have extreme values for the traditional DIYer and professional customers, including some amazing offers on
appliances. With all of these exciting products, events and great in-store execution, we look forward to driving
excitement this holiday season.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.
Carol B. Tomé
Thank you, Ted, and hello, everyone. In the third quarter, sales were $20.5 billion, a 5.4% increase from last year. Our
total company comp store same-store sales were positive 5.2% for the quarter with positive comps of 5.3% in August,
4.8% in September, and 5.4% in October. Versus last year, a stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted total company
comps by approximately $109 million or 60 basis points. Comps for U.S. stores were positive 5.8% for the quarter with
positive comps of 5.8% in August, 5.2% in September, and 6.2% in October.
Our total company gross margin was 35% for the quarter, an increase of 10 basis points from last year. Our gross
margin expansion is explained by the following. In the U.S., we experienced 5 basis points of gross margin expansion
due to three factors. First, enhanced productivity and lower fuel costs in our supply chain drove 7 basis points of
expansion. Second, lower deferred financing costs drove 4 basis points of gross margin expansion, and third, we had
higher shrink than one year ago, which drove 6 basis points of gross margin contraction.
Our international businesses also contributed 5 basis points of gross margin expansion in the quarter, due primarily to
higher levels of co-op and rebate than one year ago. For fiscal 2014, we would expect to report gross margin expansion
of approximately 5 basis points, in line with what we reported for the first nine months of the year.
In the third quarter, as a percent of sales, total operating expenses decreased by 56 basis points to 22.6%. Our third
quarter expenses included $28 million of net expenses incurred as part of our data breach. We carry a $100 million
insurance policy for breach-related expenses. The gross amount of breach-related expenses incurred in the quarter was
approximately $43 million. For the fourth quarter, we are projecting our known gross breach-related costs to be
approximately $27 million, and after insurance, a fourth quarter net breach expense of approximately $6 million. For
fiscal 2014, given our projected known net breach-related expenses of $34 million, we now expect fiscal 2014
operating expenses to grow at approximately 27% of our sales growth rate.
Interest and other expense for the third quarter was $113 million, down $75 million from last year. The year-over-year
decline is due to the following; first, interest and investment income increased by $102 million, reflecting a $100
million gain on sale of HD Supply common stock. During the quarter, we sold another block of HD Supply common
stock. This brings the total pre-tax gain on sale of HD Supply common stock this year to $212 million. We now own
approximately 8.2 million shares or 4% of HD Supply's outstanding shares.
Second, interest expense increased by $27 million from last year due to an increase in long-term debt outstanding and
some interest payments on state tax settlements. Our income tax provision rate was 37% in the third quarter and we
expect our income tax rate to be approximately 37% for the year. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were
$1.15, an increase of 21.1% from last year.

During the third quarter, we opened two new stores in Mexico for an ending store count of 2,266. At the end of the
third quarter, signed square footage was 236 million. Total sales per square foot was $348, up 5.8% from last year.
Now turning to the balance sheet, at the end of the quarter inventory was $12 billion and inventory turns were 4.7
times, flat to last year. We ended the quarter with $41.5 billion in assets, including $2.2 billion in cash and cash
equivalents.
Moving to our share repurchase program, in the third quarter, we received 4.5 million shares related to the true-up of an
accelerated share repurchase or ASR program we initiated in the second quarter. Additionally, in the third quarter, we
repurchased $2.24 billion or 24.2 million of our outstanding shares, all on the open market. For the remainder of the
year, we intend to repurchase approximately $1.26 billion of outstanding stock for total fiscal 2014 share repurchases
of approximately $7 billion. Computed on the average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the
trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was 22.2%, 250 basis points higher than the third quarter of fiscal 2014.
Moving to our guidance, for the first nine months of fiscal 2014 our sales growth was in line with the plan we laid out
at the beginning of the year. And as we look to the fourth quarter, nothing has come to our attention that changes our
point of view. So today we are reaffirming our sales growth guidance for the year of approximately 4.8% and
comp-sales growth of approximately 4.6%. This guidance suggests total company comps of approximately 5% in the
fourth quarter, consistent with our plan. But as you heard from Ted, we are ready for a strong Black Friday and holiday
selling season.
For earnings per share, remember that we guide off of GAAP. We are reaffirming fiscal 2014 diluted earnings per share
guidance of $4.54, an increase of approximately 21%. This earnings per share guidance includes the $5.74 billion of
share repurchases completed in the first three quarters of 2014 and our intent to repurchase approximately $1.26 billion
in additional shares in the fourth quarter.
Thank you for your participation in today's call. And, Audra, we are now ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.
<Q - Aram H. Rubinson>: Hey, thanks. I appreciate the opportunity to ask a question and welcome aboard, Craig.
We're glad to have you.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Thank you.
<Q - Aram H. Rubinson>: Was hoping you could outline some of your priorities at least to start. I don't want to put
you on the spot, but just kind of some broad brush philosophies and whether you think there'll be kind of subtle
changes that we'd expect, whether it's SG&A, whether it's capital allocation. How should we think about your outlook
on things like that?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: I mean I'd start with the comment that our strategic framework is really built from the
customer back in terms of what they expect from The Home Depot. It's clearly been a strength that we have pivoted off
of. It will evolve as the interconnected retail portion of our business evolves, but I wouldn't look for a dramatic
departure from any of the strategies that we've had in place. We think that framework works.
<Q - Aram H. Rubinson>: Okay, thank you. Well said. And if I could just follow up to ask maybe Carol or anybody
about the performance of the categories that you're kind of shrinking in-store to accommodate sales online. I think
maybe – or to accommodate sales, let's say. So cabinets shrunk to accommodate appliances and carpet shrunk to
accommodate hardwood, can you talk about the performance of the categories that have actually been shrunk to
accommodate other categories, whether you are seeing growth there or whether you are seeing a contraction there in
line with the footage?

We'll take our next question from Chris Horvers at JPMorgan.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Good morning.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Good morning.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: A couple questions. So can you talk about whether you've seen or you saw any impact from
the credit breach? What did you hear from stores? What was the Pro saying in September, October? September trends
did decelerate and then reaccelerate pretty nicely in October. So was curious if you thought any of that was the breach
and what you are hearing in the field around it?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: I mean, Chris, really it's very difficult for us to be able to determine if there was any impact.
We were very, very pleased with the fact that we had positive transaction growth in each month during the quarter and I
think that represents strength for our customers' confidence in The Home Depot, and we appreciate that.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: And don't mean this to sound defensive, but if you look at a three-year stack, September was
our hardest comparison.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: Understood. Right, okay. And no real like, I guess, your stores aren't communicating
anything up to you that's conclusive in either direction?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: No.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: Okay. And then as a follow-up, Carol, curious if you could talk about your thoughts on
November. Of course, I know you said nothing has come to your attention, but you've heard a lot of retailers speak to a
pickup or at least as good as sort of the trend from 3Q. So was curious how you would describe your view of
November.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Happy to talk about our perspective on November and the fourth quarter. As you know, it's
always tricky to forecast where sales will go in the fourth quarter, because we're heading into winter. And I don't know
about where you are, Chris, but it's mighty cold here in Atlanta. That being said, we're two weeks into November, and I
must say that I'm impressed with the sales that we've reported to-date. So if there's a bias in our forecast, I would say
the bias is to the upside.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: Thanks very much. We like the word impressed. Good luck in the fourth quarter. Thanks,
guys.

<Q - Brian W. Nagel>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Good morning.
<Q - Brian W. Nagel>: First off, Craig, congratulations on your new position.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Thank you.
<Q - Brian W. Nagel>: Just a quick question on expense growth, and I guess maybe this is more for Carol, and I know
there's a lot of moving pieces here with the breach-related expenses, but if I look at expense growth in the third quarter,
was there some other upward pressure there versus the prior quarters? And then if that be the case, how should we be
thinking about that as we go into the fourth quarter and even into next year?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Sure. So, Brian, as we said at the end of the second quarter, we've had great expense
performance this year. And at the end of the second quarter we said that we expected our expenses to grow at 23% of
our sales growth. But we also said that there would be quarter-over-quarter differences in that expense growth factor
because of year-over-year comparisons. So we always anticipated that expenses in the third quarter would be higher
than our guidance for the year, and that turned out to be true. So if I look at our expense performance pre-breach, we
were right in line, actually a little bit better than we thought. Of course the breach has distorted this a bit. So now as we
look at our expense growth factor guidance for the year, we're taking it up from what was 23% to now 27%. So it's just
a year-over-year comparisons that make some of the quarters look different. But for the year we're very pleased with
where we are.
<Q - Brian W. Nagel>: Got it. And then as we think about the breach, were there other expenses related to the breach
and how Home Depot had dealt with the breach that were not captured in those one-time callouts?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, I'll tell you, there's a handful of people who are working around the clock. And their cost
has not been captured. Their payroll is their payroll. But I would think if we actually put an hourly rate on that, maybe
you should have captured a little bit more cost. But really we tried to be as comprehensive as we could. It includes legal
fees, it includes the cost of credit monitoring, it includes the cost of IT. So we tried to be as inclusive as we could.
<Q - Brian W. Nagel>: Well, thank you and nice quarter.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Thank you.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Thank you.

We'll go next to Gary Balter at Credit Suisse.
<Q - Gary Balter>: Thank you. Welcome, Craig, to your new position.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Thank you.
<Q - Gary Balter>: Just a question on the fulfillment centers, you mentioned – I think, Craig, you mentioned or maybe
Ted mentioned that you opened the second fulfillment center at this point. Could you walk us through what you're
seeing from the stores around the two fulfillment centers you have to-date in terms of are you seeing a shift to more
Pro, are you doing [indiscernible] (25:12) quantity deliveries to job sites, et cetera? What's the impact of those
fulfillment centers?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: I'd start here with the – fulfillment centers being set up, in large part, are focused on being
able to have speed of parcel delivery to our customers. When we complete the full rollout of all three centers in 2015,
we'll actually be able to hit about 90% of the U.S. population in 48 hours or less with parcel shipment. That's the main
focus of those centers overall. We're still in the early days of both of the centers that are open, but pleased with what
we're seeing in terms of the order fulfillment and operations of those buildings.

<Q - Gary Balter>: So does that take some pressure off of the stores? Like right now, how is that being sent to the
customer?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Well, obviously, parcel shipment goes direct to the consumer from those facilities, but our
customers, we also ship bulk product as well. Our customers are choosing to engage with our stores, almost 40% of our
orders through HomeDepot.com in the quarter actually culminated in one of our orange box stores.
<Q - Gary Balter>: Okay. And then a follow-up on the pro, could you update on us like if you track this data or if you
share this data? But, last year, you talked about the average Pro doing $6,000 and a big effort was to try to increase that
number to become more relevant to the Pro as a first call rather than a second or third call.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: So the Pro customer, we have seen growth in the average in the Pro over the past roughly 12
months. That average has moved up to approximately $6,600 from the previous total, and it's an area that we continue
to focus on.
<Q - Gary Balter>: Thank you very much.
Operator
We'll go next to Simeon Gutman at Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Thanks for taking my question. Two higher-level ones. First, online growth, it's been
solid for a pretty good amount of time and it does not seem to be cannibalizing store traffic or sales, which is pretty rare
in retail these days. Do you have a sense of what your market share of just the online home improvement industry is
and then any update whether it's margin-neutral, the online business or better and how you look at it?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: We really don't have a good way to try to get at a full market share for the online space.
That's one we really don't have a good handle on. And then we look at the business in total on a portfolio approach, as
it relates to it being commerce. Again, customer – 40% or so picking up in store, we really look at it as a portfolio
approach in terms of overall profitability of the business and that's really how we look at it.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: And maybe another way to look at it is just the census data, because we do run it as one
business, and if you look at our market share from the census data, we increased market share by 23 basis points, now
at 27.07%.
<Q - Simeon Ari Gutman>: Okay. And then my follow-up is regarding merchandising and some of the scientific
sorting. And Craig, we used to hear from you when you were the head merchant about some of the enhancements that
were being made and then the ones still to come. But I guess when I hear localized sorting and some of the things that
are happening, I would've thought some of those were tackled already. So I guess granted that merchandising will
probably still evolve, can you just give us, or Ted now I guess, a high level of what the merchandising initiatives on the
table, what are some of the intriguing opportunities from here?
<A - Edward P. Decker>: Sure. I would say that we've made good progress on developing the tools. The tools can
always be enhanced, but foundationally they're developed and they've been rolled out to the merchant community. As
you know, we review about a third of the business each year, so while we've had these tools in place for a couple of
years now, we still haven't reviewed the entire store, utilizing, leveraging the new tools, and I would say that certainly
the second time and the third time that a business is reviewed with the tool, we're going to get better and better.
So when you think about localization, we start with our clustering tool where we're using our online sales data as well
as our store sales data to identify localized demand, then we assort the store using our new assortment planning tools to
that local demand and then a newer set of tools that we haven't talked that much about and where I do see promise in
the future is in space. So once you have your demand and your assortment, how do you best get the appropriate micro
space facings for rate of sale and we have tools for that that we're starting to use. And then in macro space, when we
think about businesses that are shifting online or more so than others, areas that we're trying to grow, continue to bring
excitement into the store, we'll be looking at a macro perspective in the store, utilizing tools of how best to find space

And we'll take our next question from Seth Basham at Wedbush Securities.
<Q - Seth M. Basham>: Good morning.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Good morning.
<Q - Seth M. Basham>: Could you give us an update on your Buy Online Deliver From Store initiatives? Where are
you piloting it, how the pilot is going, when do you expect to roll it out?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Mark Holifield is here, I'll let Mark address it.
<A - Mark Holifield>: Hey, Seth, Mark Holifield here. Yes, Buy Online Deliver From Store, we're in pilot at this
point in two stores, and the pilot is going well. It's a very small pilot at this point. Most important thing is that we get
the customer service experience absolutely right and once we are confident in that, we'll begin the rollout.
<Q - Seth M. Basham>: Okay. So the rollout is planned for later this year, or is it a 2015 event?
<A - Mark Holifield>: I'd look for that in 2015.
<Q - Seth M. Basham>: Great. And then as a follow-up, on the Services business, you guys are seeing very strong
growth in the installed services. Can you give us a sense as to what's driving that? Is it something in the back end or is
it just strong demand across the categories?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: I think we've seen, obviously, as home value appreciation has happened, customers are
certainly more willing to invest in their homes. I think you also see Services growing as a result of – you have an aging
population, and I know for myself, where I used to love to do things, I actually have Home Depot Services do things
now that I would've done previously. So I think it's a combination of that macro trend and the improvement in the home
values, and then we work hard internally to enhance the customer experience and make sure that we're monitoring how
we actually provide the experience to the customer. Marc, I don't know if you have any additional comments?
<A - Marc D. Powers>: This is Marc Powers. I just took over Services, so I can't claim all the progress, but have been
closely involved historically with this and driving the customer experience. So, we do follow-up surveys with our
customers to make sure we are improving the customer experience consistently and we see we're making strong
progress in that. We also interact strongly as you might imagine with our service providers and give them feedback on
their performance and hold them accountable to the standard of customer experience that we expect out of our brand.

<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. First one for Mark Holifield. Mark, it sounds like
transportation was a little bit favorable, at least Carol called that out. Just wanted you to maybe take a minute here and
talk about some of the puts and takes in transportation right now. You've got the port issue, you've got some driver
shortage issues. You've also got fuel obviously it's helping. So maybe just give us a sense of where you stand and how
you see transportation as you look out over the balance of the year.
<A - Mark Holifield>: Yeah, thanks, Peter. It's absolutely a very challenging environment with lots of disruption out
there, so we were very pleased to see supply chain contribution to gross margin given that. The disruptions at the ports
and general transportation delays have been pretty difficult the last few weeks, but thanks to a lot of hard work our
team has been able to land our Black Friday freight. We don't see any disruption to our supply chain for Black Friday.
But we are concerned over the long haul here. The West Coast ports, the rail situation, the driver shortage, all look to
create uncertainty in terms of transportation rates going forward. So that's definitely a concern, pretty hard to predict
though given the fluidity of the situation that's out there.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: I will say, Peter, we have put all of that into our guidance, this uncertainty. We factored some
of that in. The other thing that I would say is that the 7 basis points of margin expansion that we received in supply
chain, only 2 basis points was fuel related. So, Mark and his team are driving great productivity within the four walls of
our distribution centers. Last thing I would say is on inventory. We were pleased with our inventory performance
turned flat year-on-year given the disruption in the supply chain. Actually we've added one day of lead time and that
actually, if you back out that additional day, our inventory turns would've been up year-on-year. So we were pleased
given this challenging environment.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Good, that's great color. Thank you. And then, Carol, I guess just the follow-up would be for
you. Help us understand how you're thinking about the dividend payout ratio longer term. I mean are there any
developments out there that would compel you to maybe raise that a bit at some point or do you think 50% is where
you'd like to stay?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, we love paying out 50% of our earnings in a dividend, which means at the end of the
year, we'll look back at what we earned and cut it in half and that'll be the new dividend. So it looks like we'll have a
nice increase coming at us in February. As we think about this longer-term, Craig and I will be talking about what that
optimal payout should be. You can imagine in an environment of a company that's a maturing company, strong cash
flow, giving excess cash back to the shareholders in the most efficient way is something that we should try to do. And a
higher dividend payout may be on the agenda. But we'll be talking about that.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Clearly we'll talk about that and we'll talk about it with our board and make those calls.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay, terrific. Thanks so much, guys. I appreciate it.

<Q - Katharine McShane>: Thank you for taking my question. Good morning.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Good morning.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: My question was on the Pro sales that you mentioned that were very robust by comping 2
times the company average during the quarter. Can you remind us how much the large Pro grew during Q2 and if what
you saw in Q3 was a sequential acceleration and how do you think about your market share for this large Pro customer?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Kate, I think our comments were that the large spend Pro, which makes up about 13% of our
Pros, they grew two times the company average. Our Pro customer in total grew about the company average. If you
look at the large spend Pro that double-digit growth would've been the same in Q2.

<Q - Katharine McShane>: Okay, thank you. And then my second question was just on interconnected retail and it's
great to hear all of the new initiatives for that. I just wondered from a cost standpoint will we be seeing accelerated
costs for this initiative going forward.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, we run our business as a portfolio as we've talked to you all along. So, yes, there are
costs. We're standing up new distribution facilities, so we have costs associated with that, but we drive productivity and
other facilities to cover those costs. So it's all in the portfolio that we run to drive towards that 13% operating margin
target that we set forth last year, to reach that by the end of 2015.

We'll go next to Dan Binder at Jefferies.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Good morning.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: My question was related to the expenses in Q3. You mentioned that 99% of the stores
qualified for Success Sharing planning and I was curious if bonus accruals were in line or higher than expected in Q3
given the results thus far.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Right. So, Dan, we accrue bonuses based on a number of financial metrics. For the stores and
Success Sharing, it's based on sales. As we reaffirmed this morning, our sales growth guidance is the same now as it
was at the beginning of the year, which means the accrual isn't any higher than it would've been, actually less than last
year because last year we were blowing away our sales plan. So bonus expense actually was a bit of a help in the third
quarter.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: And then my second question was related to credit. You cited that is an issue for some of the
Pros in the past. Have you seen any improvement on that front?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: As we look at our private label credit card, we see that within our Pro segment, 71% of all Pros
who are asking for a new account are being approved. The average line that's being approved is about $6,900, so we
feel pretty good about the availability of credit for our Pros. Now not all Pros ask for a private label card, and so we
understand that providing credit to this important customer is really important, and we're looking at other ways in
which we might get credit to them besides just our private label card; is there some other sort of financing vehicle that
we should be providing? So we're exploring that.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Michael Lasser at UBS.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Good morning. Thanks a lot for taking my question. As you've seen really strong results in
categories such as appliances and flooring, which are areas that you've focused intently on in the last couple of years,
what have you learned that you can now extend to other areas that maybe you haven't previously shared about your
ability to take market share in new [ph] and up-and-coming ways? (40:43)
<A - Edward P. Decker>: Well, one of the key things, and maybe obvious, as much as we talk about interconnected
retail, but you'd never have thought appliances would be as strong as it is as an online category. Even flooring, one of
the key products that we're moving into our new DF facilities is hard surface flooring. The customer is quite happy to
order complete flooring jobs and direct delivery to the home. So I think that's a key learning that the interconnected, the

online experience can both be educational and inspirational, but also be used for commerce on big-ticket items like
flooring and appliances.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: I think the other comment I'd have is, really important for us to be working closely with our
manufacturers to continue to drive the innovation in the product that delivers value to our customers. And I think there
are opportunities around the store to continue to focus on that, and we will. We put pretty strong emphasis in a few key
categories that we put a stake in the ground, LED technology, lithium technology, we've seen great results in those
businesses as a result of that focus with our key suppliers, and I think that's something we have to continue to do.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Okay, that's helpful. My follow-up question is we've seen the results of some of your
competitors who are struggling, whether it's those that are specialized within the flooring category or those that are
trafficking in some of the categories that you also traffic in yet are attached to – predominantly attached to malls. It's
probably easy to assume that some of your strong performance of mid single-digit comps, along with gross margin
expansion is due to the results of those competitors. So, what are you expecting moving forward? Do you expect that
there will be any change in the competitive environment? Your strong performance is sure to attract some attention and
may influence some competitive response. Are you preparing for that?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: I mean, I think historically, candidly, in the retail business, the competitive environment
changes on an ongoing basis, and that's actually what's really fun about the retail business. And so we fully anticipate
ongoing that across multiple different segments that we compete against that the market will react and move and
likewise so will we. And we remain focused on continuing to take share.

We'll go next to Scot Ciccarelli at RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Hi, guys. You talked about – earlier in the call, you talked about some of the success that you've
had with your Pro customer and Carol, I know you just mentioned credit extension in another question, but what other
key initiatives are you guys implementing to drive share gains with the Pro customer, number one? Number two, are
you doing anything that's materially different today than you were maybe a year or two ago to drive those share gains?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: I'll let Marc.
<A - Marc D. Powers>: Hey. This is Marc Powers. So, we're focused strongly inside the store on building those
relationships with our Pros and making sure that we are taking some of the friction, if you will, out of their transactions
in dealing with us at, with Home Depot. You might have already heard about our program with Pro Xtra. Last quarter I
think we called out that we had 1.7 million members of Pros who signed up for Pro Xtra to receive special buys of the
week. Also, different services that we're providing to them, such as being able to return product in our stores without
any receipts, which takes a lot of friction out of their day-in and day-out transactions with us, and now we're up to 2.5
million, actually Pros who are participating in Pro Xtra. So we're very pleased inside the store with our focus with that
Pro customer segment and also outside the store we're seeing some strong traction in building relationships with our
outside sales force as well.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: And how big is that sales force at this point, Marc?
<A - Marc D. Powers>: Right now we're – I believe we're approximately 150 associates in our exterior sales force.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Those sales people who are really attached to our high spend pros are pretty dog-gone
important. The average spend for our high-spend pro on average is close to $30,000 a year.

We'll go next to Dennis Mcgill at Zelman & Associates.
<Q - Dennis P. McGill>: Hi. Good morning and thank you. First question just has to do with Canada. It looks like
you've posted pretty strong numbers there now for the last four to six quarters and just curious whether you think that
momentum is sustainable and how much of that would you attribute to market as opposed to market share?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: I think, first of all, Bill and his team in Canada have done an outstanding job of driving the
business in Canada. And we look to see that continue, that kind of performance. We think there's a lot of opportunity to
continue to bring great value to our Canadian customers and drive for share gains in the market.
<Q - Dennis P. McGill>: Craig, do you feel like right now it's share gain, any sense on how much of it is share versus
market?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: That's pretty tough to tell. I would say, I don't know that the Canadian market ever got quite
as difficult as the U.S. market, but certainly they had their bumps along the way as well. But it's pretty tough to tell the
difference on those.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: We felt so good about Canada though that we're opening another store in Canada this year. We
haven't opened a store in Canada for a number of years.
<Q - Dennis P. McGill>: Okay. And then, Carol, can you just review appliance performance in the quarter, however
you want to phrase it, relative to comps or just absolute?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Sure. Appliances grew at the company average for the quarter. For the year, appliances have
contributed 20 basis points of our comp growth.

And our next question comes from Matthew Fassler at Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks a lot, and good morning.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: Good morning.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Excuse me. My question is really focused on inventory. Carol, the inventory was up a bit
more than in the past. You talked about adding I guess a day to back-stock or having some planned increase. Can you
just kind of contextualize that for us? Talk to us about how long you would expect that to persist.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Right. Well, as Mark described, the challenges within the supply chain disruption are real.
They're real for all retailers. And so this additional day contributed probably $120 million to $140 million of inventory.
We also had some air movement inventory that we are carrying over; it's a small amount, less than $100 million. But
because of the cool summer we didn't sell through all of our air movement. We're carrying that over and we'll sell it
next year. There are no markdown risks. But as a result of these factors, we aren't going to get as much productivity out
of inventory this year as we had planned. But we feel great about our inventory position and as we look towards 2015,
we're planning for inventory improvement. And, Mark, do want to give any more color to that?
<A - Mark Holifield>: I think you said it pretty well, Carol. I think the most important thing about our inventory is
that customer service begins with us being in stock and we are always going to pursue that first and make sure that our

We'll go next to Mike Baker at Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Mike A. Baker>: Hi, thanks. I wanted to ask two questions, one on the appliances. You just said in line with
company average, but where are you on adding the jumbo resets and those types of things? Do you have more of those
stores than you did a year ago and where is that going?
And then my second unrelated question, if I could, is really just thinking about next year, and I understand from a
macro standpoint that you guys think a lot of the top line is driven by home price appreciation rather than existing
home sales, and I agree with that, but existing home sales have been down 11 months in a row. How long can you
continue to comp at 4.5% plus with declining existing home sales? Thanks.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, I'll ask or answer the last question and then, Ted, maybe you answer the first question. If
we think about our 2014 growth, it starts with GDP. The forecast for this year is 2.2%. We actually had about 200 basis
points of growth coming out of home price appreciation and housing turnover. That gets us to 4.4% and then there's
about another four tenths of growth coming from areas like appliances. And that gets us to the 4.6% comp that we
guided for the year.
As we look to 2015 then, we would look at GDP. GDP, economists tend to want to be at 3%. So that's what it's looking
like right now in the 3% area. We continue to believe we will get help from housing because it's not – turnover, while
down, is still up as a percent of units. 4% of units are turning. So we'll get help from the turnover. We'll get help from
home price appreciation, not as robust as it was last year, but it will continue to recover because it has not fully
recovered.
And then lastly, we are very encouraged by the recent news that's coming out of the FHFA, as well as the number of
regulators who are really trying to address mortgage financing reform. While this is yet to turn into additional liquidity
in the mortgage underwriting market, the news has been very good. And we believe that could be a real bolster to our
industry. If you look at homes that were sold or financed through cash, that dropped 24% in September, which means
more people need loans. They need mortgages and so mortgage financing reform really important for our industry and
very encouraged with the recent news. Now, Ted, on jumbo?
<A - Edward P. Decker>: On – yes, on appliances, so yes we comped in line with the company average but
third-party reporting would suggest we took some decent share in the quarter so we're pleased with that performance.
We have over 1,000 showrooms now that we've expanded the footprint. We started this over two years ago. About a
quarter of those 1,000 are the bigger showroom that we call jumbo and that's where we essentially doubled the space of
the appliance showroom. In the balance, 750-odd are a big foot where we only go up about 30%. So we've done about a
1,000. We may – we'll continue to look at the performance. And we won't certainly do every last store with an
expanded showroom, but we probably have a few more that we can take a look at.
<Q - Mike A. Baker>: Okay. Thanks for the color, very helpful. Appreciate it.

credit. Could you just remind us how many of your Pros have signed up for your traditional private label card and how
the pilot is going with the extended credit program?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: That's a very great question, but for competitive reasons, not going to share that number with
you.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: All right. Can I do it a different way?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: You can try.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: If you look at your large Pros and look at the ones that are spending that $6,600 right now,
what share of wallet do you think you have with your typical Pro?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: That's a pretty difficult number. We talk about it a lot, but it's a really difficult number to
quantify. We know there's upside opportunity, let's put it that way.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: I tried, Craig. Good luck, everyone.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: We've shared this data in the past, if we had – a 5% increase in the average ticket for Pros, or
three more transactions, that's a $1.2 billion opportunity. So maybe that helps size it.

<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Two things. First of all, in terms of the categories below plan – excuse me – not below plan, but
below average, any theme that you draw from those or any insights as you look at the ones that are below average that
you would conclude from that?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: I'll give you one data point perhaps, if I could, and then Ted can give you more color. If you
look at the selling departments that Ted talked about, 9 of 16 were with 100 basis points of the average comp, so it was
very narrowly bound.
<A - Edward P. Decker>: Yes. I wouldn't say there's a particular theme. Probably the category that is suffering from
the mild weather is roofing, so that would be a category, we're happy with the business, but there have been no storms,
there hasn't been a lot of inclement weather, so the demand in that is lower. And in live goods, again the drought in the
West Coast and the very mild summer in the North, so you didn't get a lot of burnout of lawns and reseeding et cetera,

those really are the only themes.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: And then, secondly, you commented or someone made a comment about appliances and
promotions during the month of November around Black Friday or Cyber Week. From a promotional standpoint, where
are you in that category or across the store? I can see what your gross margin expectations are, but anything different or
material going on in terms of your promotional intensity?
<A - Edward P. Decker>: No. The promotions are very similar to last year. We ran what we're calling a pre-Black
Friday appliance event for largely the month of November, and we're like for like to last year.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Perfect. Thank you.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Audra, we have time for one more question.

And we will take that question from Laura Champine at Canaccord.
<Q - Laura A. Champine>: Good morning. Carol, when you last spoke to the guidance level at $4.54 for the year,
were you already contemplating a $0.05 benefit from selling HD Supply shares, and if not, why not raise the guidance
by $0.05 other than maybe some wiggle room?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes, Laura, that was contemplated in the guidance that we've given. Now we've issued a lot of
press releases recently, but we've had the $4.54 in for a while, and that included the gain on sale of HD Supply.
<Q - Laura A. Champine>: Got it. Thank you.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: You're welcome.
Carol B. Tomé
Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to talking with you at the end of the fourth
quarter in February.
