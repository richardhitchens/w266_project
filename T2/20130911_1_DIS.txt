Thank you, Lowell and good afternoon, everyone. I'm very happy to report that Disney has delivered yet another record
annual performance. Driven by improved results in each of our businesses, in the fiscal 2012 year, Disney achieved
record revenue, net income, and earnings per share. Net income was up by 18% for the year, on a 3% increase in
revenue, and our earnings per share, adjusted for comparability, were up 21% over last year.
I'm also very pleased with our fourth quarter results, which were primarily driven by growth at cable networks and
Parks & Resorts. Net income grew by 14%, and revenue was up 3% for the quarter. And, our EPS for Q4, adjusted for
comparability, grew 15% to $0.68. These results once again demonstrate our ability to grow earnings in the near-term,
while investing for the long-term, and we're obviously proud of our performance.
Before I get into the highlights of fiscal 2012, I just want to mention the tremendous creative resurgence we are seeing
at Disney Animation. Building on the success of Tangled, our newest release, Wreck It Ralph, just had a phenomenal
opening weekend, bigger than any previous Disney animated movie.
With $58.6 million in domestic box office so far, Wreck It Ralph continues the creative momentum that started with
our acquisition of Pixar. The Pixar deal brought us more than just great Pixar movies. It also reinvigorated our entire
animation pipeline, led by the great team of John Lasseter and Ed Catmull.
Looking back, fiscal 2012 was a great year for Disney by every measure, creatively, financially, and strategically.
Marvel had a fantastic year, capped by the extraordinary success of The Avengers, which became the world's third
highest grossing movie of all time, a global phenomenon, and an incredibly important franchise for us. Pixar also
generated a great deal of value for us this year from the opening of the phenomenal Cars Land to transform Disney
California Adventure into an extraordinary park, to the opening of Brave, which became Pixar's 13th consecutive
movie to debut number one at the box office.
We opened two new lands in Hong Kong Disneyland, completed the first phase of our historic, multi-year expansion of
Fantasyland in Walt Disney World, and made significant progress in Shanghai to keep development on track to open by
the end of 2015. With the addition of the Disney Fantasy last March, we've now more than doubled our cruise business,
and this year we were named the number one Large Cruise Line by readers of Conde Nast Traveler magazine.
ESPN was a strong contributor for the year as well adding Wimbledon to its world class sports line up, along with
higher ratings, ad sales and affiliate revenue. ESPN also solidified its position in some critical sports, including college
football and basketball, and Major League Baseball.
Disney Channels Worldwide continue to be an important brand and business driver for our company reaching
approximately 425 million homes in 167 countries. In 2002 [ph], we introduced Disney Junior, and Disney XD to new
markets around the world, and also launched our first over-the-air Disney Channel in Russia. We also completed our
strategic acquisition of UTV, making Disney India's leading film studio and TV producer, as well as one of the
country's leading broadcasters, reaching more than 100 million viewers every week.
And looking ahead, our Shanghai development is moving into an exciting phase as the construction work starts to
define the shape of things to come, and our vision starts to become reality. We look forward to completing our Hong
Kong Disneyland expansion, which should only enhance the park's current strong performance. And we're also very
excited about the ongoing Fantasyland transformation at Walt Disney World. It's the largest expansion of the Magic
Kingdom since that park opened more than 40 years ago, and it's going to be pretty spectacular.
And also in Florida, we are very excited about the new technology roll out, designed to enhance guest experience, and
advance and expand guest engagement before their visits. We will provide details early next year, but among the many
features and benefits of this technology is giving guests the chance to plan their itineraries ahead of time, including
access to their favorite, and often our most popular attractions.
On the Studio front, we're going to follow the success of Wreck-It Ralph with four major films this fiscal year. Oz the
Great and Powerful opens on March 8th, and Marvel's Iron Man 3 will be in theaters May 3rd. And this coming
summer, Pixar's Monsters University will open on June 21st, followed by The Lone Ranger on July 3rd.

As all of you know, last week, we announced our acquisition of Lucasfilm, and upon closing, we believe, it will fit
right in with Disney, ABC, ESPN, Pixar, and Marvel in our unparalleled portfolio of phenomenal assets and world
class brands.
And when you look at all the franchises and IP ever created in the history of entertainment, and rank them in terms of
value, Star Wars is always at or near the very top of that list. It is the very definition of a franchise. It has global appeal,
stands the test of time 35 years so far, and we see great potential well into the future. It enjoys strong, unwavering
popularity with hundreds of millions of fans, even in the absence of a new theatrical release in the last seven years.
Star Wars is an incredibly relevant and vibrant franchise with tremendous opportunity for global growth, especially
with a new slate of feature films starting with Star Wars Episode 7 in 2015. The addition of Lucasfilm to our strong
portfolio of assets will continue to fuel Disney's creative engine across our entire company to create additional value
for our shareholders. We're obviously very pleased with what we've achieved in fiscal 2012, and overall, we believe
we're well positioned for continued strong performance and growth.
And, I'm now going to turn the call over to Jay Rasulo to go through the details. Jay?
Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Thanks, Bob and good afternoon everyone. We are pleased with our fourth quarter results, ending yet another record
year of financial performance for the company. We reported record revenue, net income and earnings per share in fiscal
2012, surpassing last year's record results.
Our performance is the result of relentless focus on maximizing the value of our existing assets, and realizing returns
from recent investments, while continuing to invest for future growth. We believe this balanced approach will deliver
consistent and attractive returns for our shareholders for years to come. I am going to spend a few minutes discussing
the fourth quarter in more detail, and then I'll highlight a few 2013 items.
In Q4, Media Networks was the largest contributor to our performance driven by growth in operating income at Cable
Networks, due to continued growth at ESPN and higher equity income at A&E Television Networks. Growth at ESPN
was due to an increase in affiliate revenue, which was driven by higher rates, partially offset by higher programming
costs for college football and Major League Baseball, as well as our new Wimbledon contract. Higher equity income at
A&E Television Networks during the quarter resulted from increases in advertising and affiliate revenue.
Advertising revenue at ESPN was flat for the quarter, as higher rates were offset by lower ratings. We experienced a
less robust marketplace around the Olympics, and we did not see a stronger pickup in demand as we expected after the
Olympics ended.
During the quarter, ESPN signed a new long-term agreement with Major League Baseball. This deal extends our rights
through 2021 season and significantly enhances our current deal with more games, greater co-exist rights, and an
increase in annual studio programming hours of more than 100%. Extending our partnership with Major League
Baseball further strengthens our unrivaled sports content portfolio, which continues to make ESPN, the number one
destination for sports fans, as well as cable television's most valuable network.
Operating income at Broadcasting was down modestly, compared to last year, due to lower advertising revenue at the
ABC network, partially offset by higher program sales. Lower advertising revenue at the network was driven by lower
primetime ratings. Higher program sales were driven by the sale of Castle and Wipeout in the quarter.
At the ABC Network, quarter-to-date scatter pricing is pacing mid-teens above upfront levels. ESPN ad sales are
pacing down modestly, and ABC Family ad sales are pacing up high single-digits. TV station ad sales are pacing up
mid-single digits as well.
Our Parks and Resorts segment delivered solid results with revenue up 9% and operating income up 18%. The increase
in operating income was due to higher results at our international resorts and Disney Cruise Line. Total segment
margins were up 100 basis points, compared to last year. Growth initiatives reduced segment margin expansion by

about 90 basis points.
Results at our international resorts were high, due to increased attendance at Hong Kong Disneyland and Disneyland
Paris. Royalties from the Tokyo Disney Resort were also higher versus prior year quarter. Higher operating income at
Disney Cruise Line was driven by the increased passenger cruise days due to the launch of the Disney Fantasy.
Results at our domestic parks were comparable to prior year, as growth at the Disneyland Resort was largely offset by
higher costs at Walt Disney World as a result of our growth initiatives. We are encouraged by Disneyland Resort's
overall performance in the quarter and are particularly pleased with its attendance and per capita spending results,
following the opening of Cars Land in June.
Overall, domestic attendance was up 3% driven by strong attendance at the Disneyland Resort. Per capita spending at
our domestic parks was up 7% on higher ticket prices and food and beverage spending.
Average per room spending at our domestic hotels was up 8%. The increase in per room spending was driven by higher
pricing and higher merchandise spending. Occupancy at our domestic hotels was down three percentage points to 78%,
due to an increase in available rooms at Walt Disney World. The increase in available room nights was driven by the
completion of the final phase of Disney's Art of Animation hotel. So far this quarter, domestic hotel reservations are
pacing up mid single-digits compared to prior year levels, while booked rates are also up.
At Studio Entertainment, the decrease in operating income was driven by lower worldwide theatrical results and higher
film cost write-downs, which were partially offset by stronger performance of our worldwide home entertainment
business. Worldwide theatrical results were lower due to the strong performance of Cars 2 and Lion King 3D last year,
compared to Brave and Finding Nemo 3D, as well as higher pre-release marketing expenses compared to prior year.
Worldwide home entertainment results were up due to higher unit sales and increased effective pricing driven by the
successful release of Marvel's The Avengers.
At Consumer Products, operating income was up in the quarter due to higher results in merchandise, licensing and
retail. Growth in licensing was driven by higher earned royalties due to the strong performance of Spiderman and The
Avengers merchandise. On a comparable basis, earned licensing revenue was up 5%. Higher retail operating income
was primarily driven by strong results in North America and Europe.
At the Interactive segment, lower operating losses compared to prior year were due to continued improvement in our
social games business, which benefited from lower impact of purchase accounting. Results in our console game
business faced a difficult comparison to the performance of Cars 2 and Pirates Lego in the prior year, with no
comparable titles in the quarter this year.
I would now like to turn to fiscal 2013. Overall, we feel great about our prospects for this fiscal year, but I would like
to discuss a few timing and comparability issues, particularly related to Q1, and provide some insight into a few cost
considerations for 2013.
At Cable, domestic sports rights costs will be $170 million higher in Q1 versus last year, driven by increases in College
Football, NFL, and NBA programming. The college football increase is due to our new deals with the Pac-12 and the
Big 12, along with the expansion of the SEC. Our Q1 NBA costs will be higher compared to last year, when fewer
games were played in Q1, due to the lockout. However, ESPN's full year results will reflect the benefit of several new
affiliate deals, one of which will commence in the second quarter.
At Studio, we face a very difficult home entertainment comparison in Q1 given strong operating income from Cars 2
and The Lion King last year. Specifically, we expect this comparison to drive a year-over-year decline in home
entertainment operating income of more than $150 million. Cars 2 delivered very strong home entertainment operating
income last year driven in part by lower cost allocations given the strength of its merchandise licensing revenue. The
strong performance of The Lion King was volume driven, as the title had not been available on home video since
January 2005.
Our Q1 Parks and Resorts results will be impacted by a timing shift due to our fiscal calendar, as a portion of the New
Year's holiday will shift from fiscal Q1 to fiscal Q2. We estimate this will shift about $30 million in operating income

from Q1 to Q2. 2013 will benefit from a full year of performance from both the Disney Fantasy and Disney California
Adventure. We expect these two projects to be accretive to operating income.
However, the gains will be offset this year by incremental spending for projects in Orlando and Shanghai. In Orlando,
we are continuing to work on the guest experience enhancement project, Bob discussed. In Shanghai, we are beginning
to ramp up spending for our new theme park.
So, in fiscal 2013, in aggregate, all of our growth initiatives, both launched and to-be launched, will contribute roughly
$500 million of both incremental revenue and expense. We expect these initiatives to be accretive to operating income
in fiscal 2014 and increasingly add to operating income each year thereafter, and each to deliver returns above our cost
of capital.
We expect the Q1 tax rate to be about two percentage points higher than last year due to the benefit of tax settlements
in prior year. Pension and post retirement medical expenses will increase by approximately $70 million in fiscal 2013,
due to a decline in discount rate. On top of these items, we do expect Superstorm Sandy to impact our Q1 results,
though it's a little too early to quantify that.
This list of comparability and one-time items that I've just shared with you will impact our Q1 reported earnings. But
rest assured, we remain confident that our operating performance for the remaining quarters will result in solid earnings
growth for the entire 2013 fiscal year.
We continued to repurchase our stock during the fourth quarter with 19.1 million shares repurchased for about $973
million. For the fiscal year, we repurchased 72 million shares for $3 billion. So far this quarter, we have repurchased
8.2 million shares for $419 million. Over the next two quarters, we expect to repurchase in the open market up to 40
million shares in connection with the Lucasfilm acquisition. And that's in addition to our regular share repurchase.
2012 was another great year for our company and in 2013, we expect to deliver another year of strong operating
performance.
Now I'll turn the call over to Lowell for questions.

Michael Nathanson, Analyst
Thanks. I have a couple of quick housekeeping questions for Jay, then one for Bob. Jay, could you just give a sense of
where affiliate growth was for this year for the cable networks?
Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, sure. The full year adjusted cable revenue was high mid-single digits. This adjusts for some -- high single-digits,
yeah. Isn't that what I said? I'm sorry. This adjusts for unfavorable FX impact, and also for the impact of Leap Day,
which I don't want to get into in great detail. But, it affects our revenue for the year. And reported cable affiliate

revenue mid-single digits.
Michael Nathanson, Analyst
Okay. And then, Bob, as you've been around broadcast networks a long time and it would just seem to make sense, if I
ask you this question, what do you think is happening to the start of the season? Everyone is worried about broadcast
over the years. Is this decline in kind of the ratings something that you think is going to be fixed over the course of the
season or are you more worried than that?
Bob Iger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Well, I think the story of the year are really two things. One, the greater penetration of DVRs and the greater usage of
DVRs, which clearly, have shifted the rating in the direction of C3 and ultimately, hopefully, C7. Because, I think, it
speaks for an expanded look from a Nielsen and advertising perspective at seven days versus three.
And I think, the other story is that, there seems to be somewhat of an absence of what I'll call new big, real sort of
buzz-worthy hits. And because of that, I would say that it would be premature to either write the epitaph or suggest
that, we're seeing a trend. We've seen years where the presence of a big hit -- by the way, as in the case with NBC, if
you look at the impact of The Voice on their schedule, it's improved their numbers dramatically.
So, I think -- I happen to believe that ABC's schedule is pretty solid. Their Sunday schedule with Once Upon a Time
and Revenge is working, and they've gotten Modern Family and Grey's, and other shows, some real strong base. And
their ratings from a C3 perspective without sports are down in the 7% to 8% range, which I don't consider to be that
noteworthy.
What I like to -- What I have liked ABC to put on the schedule a really big hit at the beginning of the year, of course,
but they put on a few shows that are, I think, quite serviceable and have potential, Nashville being one.
Michael Nathanson, Analyst
Okay, thanks.
Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Before we go to the next question -- this is Jay. Lowell, just handed me a note that I misspoke on the share repurchase.
I think, I said that we buy back the 40 million shares issued for the Lucasfilm acquisition in the next two quarters. I
misspoke. I meant the next two years, which we stated previously. Sorry, Lowell.
Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations
No worries. Thanks, Michael. Thank you. Operator, next question, please?

Thank you. Just on the domestic park business, you highlighted growth initiatives hurting profits in the quarter, and it
sounds like they'll continue into fiscal '13. Just want to clarify that any significant margin expansion towards your
historic levels we should now assume will happen more likely in 2014?
And then staying with the parks, I think you mentioned Disneyland drove the good growth in attendance in the quarter.
Can you talk about attendance trends at Disney World?
Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Hi, Alexia. Thank you. So, relative to the new initiatives and the ultimate impact, I said that they will affect, of course,
the rest of fiscal 2013 and begin to be accretive in 2014. I don't want to be -- I don't want to give too much guidance on
where that takes us from a margin perspective.
We have said for some period of time that there is no reason structurally including, by the way, what I just said about
these new initiatives that will ultimately keep us from reaching our pre-recession margin levels at the parks. So, I think
that is your -- I hope that answers your question.
On the attendance trends on the two coasts, obviously, the great success of Cars Land, both from a quality and from a
quantity perspective, in terms of attendance and pricing, has reflected itself in Disneyland Resort greatly outgrowing
Walt Disney World. I'll say that Walt Disney World attendance was down modestly, but Disneyland's attendance was
up substantially, resulting, if you add the two together, in domestic attendance being up 3% that I mentioned.
Bob Iger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
We also feel good about expected attendance at Disney World for the year. We have seen some pretty decent Christmas
bookings, although there's a quirk in the calendar in terms of when Christmas hits. So, if you look at it over a three
week period, it's the two later weeks of that three week period that are the strong weeks, because Christmas is on a
Tuesday. And that does bleed into what would be our next fiscal quarter, not our -- which is our second, not our first.
But the bookings are strong. We also feel really good about Fantasyland rolling out. It is, as I mentioned, the first big
improvement that we've done at the Magic Kingdom in about 40 years. The product is already, in some cases, open and
doing really well. And we think that's going to drive some attendance gains at that Park.
And then, lastly, we opened a big new hotel, Art of Animation, which features a family suite concept, which is growing
in popularity in the marketplace. And the bookings for that hotel have been great.
Alexia Quadrani, Analylst
And we saw -- recently I saw some reports that Hong Kong reached profitability for the first time. Have you really
turned the corner there? And given the success, are you likely to build out even maybe further than what you originally
had planned?
Bob Iger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
We're seeing really strong trends and we believe we have turned the corner there. If you just look at the attendance
patterns, particularly from the Mainland, for instance, we expanded with three Worlds; two of the three are open,
including a Toy Story Land. And that's doing -- they're all doing quite well. And, the third one is going to open
sometime this spring.
So, we feel really good about the trends at Hong Kong Disneyland. We always said that we were going to expand. We
have the land to do so. And, we have projects that are in varying stages of development, but we have nothing to

Thanks, Alexia. Operator, next question.

The next question is from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
Ben Swinburne, Analyst
Thank you. I guess a couple of parks questions. Jay, I don't know, if you'd be willing to give us the domestic
international park splits for the quarter? I think, we have to wait for the 10-K usually for that. But I thought I'd ask
anyway?
Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I'll tell you that I've talked for a long time about that range being, like, 18% to 22%, 23%. And, in this quarter, at
World, they were up at the high end of that range. We had a very strong fourth quarter relative to international
attendance. Fundamentally driven by Brazil and Argentina, but even the UK, which is, of course, one of our other big
markets, was up for the fourth quarter.
Ben Swinburne, Analyst
Okay. And then just staying on the parks, you mentioned in the release and on your remarks that operating income at
the domestic parks and resorts, so ex-cruise, was basically flat year-over-year. Was there anything unusual on the
expense side, because it seems, based on the numbers you gave us, that revenue growth was pretty solid. So I just
wanted to come back to that point?
Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. Ben, Bob mentioned in his comments, these enhancements that we are doing to -- what I would say is really the
essence of a visit to Walt Disney World, starting all the way back with planning, pre-reserving up through your
experience at the park, with the use of technology and the use of a bunch of enhanced services to make guests' visit
more efficient and enjoyable while they're there.
And, we will start to see revenue inure to us from that, but we are, like many things, just before you start, there are
costs. And those costs, in fact, have had -- are offsetting the revenue increases that are implied by our attendance and
per capita spending increases in terms of the quarter.

work, we've been hesitant to roll out more details to all of you and to the public, for that matter. There's been a fair
amount of chatter about the features of this technological advancement or investment. But we've been hesitant to give
details until we're ready to really basically -- before it's ready for primetime, so to speak. But we're getting close.
Ben Swinburne, Analyst
Maybe, I could just ask one more, Bob -- or to either of you, about the sort of list of items you named for us to think
about in '13, as we furiously write them down and try to digest them.
I'm trying to understand if you think this is a year, 2013, that's sort of an investment year for the company on the
operating side or where growth is going to be, kind of below the historical average we're used to seeing from Disney?
Or if these are -- it seems like every year, there are things going on at the company where you're investing, but you
seem to pump out 15% to 20% earnings growth every year. Any way to kind of put a bow on this for us and list these
things to think about?
Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Let me -- well, let me start by emphasizing Ben that almost everything that I did check through, we see as primarily a
Q1 impact, not primarily as an overall fiscal 2013 impact. And, we are still very confident that this will be a strong year
for us in terms of performance. Obviously, the comparability, just to go through it, the large items -- the one we just
talked about in terms of costs associated with these guest enhancements before the revenue comes in.
Secondly, the home video comparison, where we'll be off pretty substantially on a comparability basis there. Because,
if you think about Cars 2, which was not only a successful video title, but because of all of the merchandise success in
prior periods around that title, that bleeds off a lot of the amortization that goes with the making of that film. When you
-- because consumer product sales are part of the ultimate package in which the film is amortized against.
So a lot of that was bled off in prior periods, which made that a particularly profitable title a year ago in the home video
front. Brave was also a profitable title, but it doesn't have the benefit of bleeding off all of that amortization when the
units sell. So that has created a very tough comparison.
And then, I mentioned, Lion King versus Finding Nemo in terms of its release, where The Lion King had been kind of
in the vault since 2005, and of course, had enormous response in the marketplace due to that. Nemo was more available
on a regular basis in the market, and therefore, didn't benefit from that bump.
So those two factors are about $150 million, but that's a first quarter event. And that is not -- and that doesn't affect our
performance at the studio in the rest of the three quarters of the year.
The tax number I ticked off again is -- has to do with a tax favorability in the prior year. It's a first quarter event as well,
of course, because taxes tend to carry that for the whole year. We'll have a little bit up in our tax -- our effective tax rate
for the year, but not as much as in the first quarter.
So I tried to emphasize, and it's always difficult in prepared remarks, to kind of emphasize that these are really largely
comparability items that we're trying to give you info on, in the first quarter, and are not to lead you to believe we don't
have confidence in strong results for the whole year.
Bob Iger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
And Ben, as Jay suggested, we're not going to give you specific guidance for the year, but since you asked us to
characterize or categorize the year, I'd say that we are entering a phase of transitioning out of an investment mode, and
transitioning into a more compelling growth mode. But again, it is a transition year in that regard, because of some of

Ben Swinburne, Analyst

Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations
Okay, Ben. Thank you. Operator, next question, please?
Operator
Your next question is from Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
Jessica Reif Cohen, Analyst
Thanks. I was just wondering if you could address your boys -- the initiative -- your boys initiative. I'm not sure how to
phrase that. I mean, given the Star Wars acquisition, your Marvel acquisition, it seems like you really have a
completely different product to offer boys. And historically, the focus maybe has been more girls. So could you just
talk about how you're viewing that as a category, and what you can to do address that? I mean, you are addressing it,
but what's the opportunity?
Bob Iger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Well, I think the opportunity is pretty broad in terms of what it will ultimately present to the company. I can start with
our theme parks. While we haven't really had a gender problem at our theme parks, we've always been mindful of what
we're offering is something for everybody. And as some of the IP gravitated more in a girl's direction, it made us turn to
some other IP that maybe wasn't derived from movies or television series, for instance, in order to essentially deliver
against the -- basically, the interests of our guests.
Obviously, we've had Star Wars in the past. This gives us an ability to expand that presence in our parks. Marvel, in
certain circumstances -- because you may recall there are some encumbrances there, will give us an opportunity to
expand, but they are mostly internationally. So that's one way.
Obviously, on the TV front, we launched or we re-launched a channel a few years back called Disney XD, which had
other names in its past. If Disney Channel is focused a little bit more on girls than boys, this is going to be focused a
little bit more on boys than girls. We're starting to roll out Marvel shows there. We referenced in our comments about
the Lucasfilm acquisition that there are opportunities for television. One big opportunity for us in Lucasfilm's derived
IP is on that channel.

Again, it gives the ability to fulfill the promise of that channel that much quicker. The footprint from Consumer
Products, obviously, will give us much more of a blend. That enhances our relationship in the marketplace with
retailers and with licensees, as a for-instance, and just generally broadens the profile of the brand. The Lucas product,
by the way, will be co-branded with Disney's name on it.
And then, of course, on the games front, we also have that ability to turn more to Disney IP, particularly, since games
are a little bit more boys driven anyway. And so I don't want to -- we'll proceed with caution in this direction, but I
think it enhances our opportunity, particularly in the mobile space, which is very driven by boys.
Jessica Reif Cohen, Analyst
Great. And then I guess just -- I heard you on CNBC, this morning. So you'd stated on CNBC today is that there
probably are not big acquisitions or acquisitions of this size. Can you just give us your thoughts how you -- do you feel
like you're strategically complete? Or what other areas would you look at, even if they are smaller?
Bob Iger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Actually, we felt we were relatively strategically complete in the past. The Lucasfilm acquisition, even though, I just
responded to your question about boys in a manner that would suggest we might not have felt strategically complete
from a gender perspective -- imagine talking about being strategically complete from a gender perspective. I think, I
should be shot for that.
But we don't necessarily make acquisitions to fill in strategic holes and we didn't in the Lucas case. That was an
opportunity to buy IP that, as I described, is unparalleled, really, in terms of its value, the strength of its franchise, and
the potential that it represents, particularly or especially to a company like ours. And we're not looking right now at
anything from an acquisition perspective that is in anyway tied to something that we would consider a strategic hole.

Amazon deals? And I wondered if you could confirm that. And whether it was or wasn't, I would love to hear just an
update on how you're feeling about those services, and the role of them in your platform?
And then the question on the Consumer Products side, just given all the increased breadth of your franchises with
Marvel and now Lucasfilm, I wondered if that changes the way you think about your retail strategy at all, in terms of
the aggressiveness about what you might think about opening more store locations, or what the store concepts might be,
or square footage? Any comments on that would be much appreciated?
Bob Iger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Okay. The second part of your question, the impact of the Lucasfilm acquisition on our store strategy, it will not change
our store strategy. We've approached that, I guess, with some degree of caution, because of the obvious risks associated
with being the specialty retail bricks and mortar business. So it's not going to change our footprint.
It will change our SKU makeup at the stores as a great opportunity, as we saw with Marvel, to infuse our stores with
Star Wars merchandise, for instance. And we look forward to doing that. And also to grow our online retail or our
eCommerce business, which, by the way, has grown very, very nicely since the relaunch of Disney.com. And noticing
what we've noticed in terms of sale of Lucasfilm merchandise online, we think there's real potential there.
To the first question, we were not specific about the deal that we referenced that was -- that impacted, I guess, the
fourth quarter a year ago, and we won't be specific. You're pretty good at guessing. But, I'll leave it at that.
We feel very, very good about opportunities in SVOD and on digital platforms, as we've seen and other large media
companies have seen, the opportunities to monetize owned IP are only growing, not just because of new technology,
but globally. And I think you'll continue to see growth in both revenue and growth in bottom line in income from
output deals to these third-party or new platform owners. It's an exciting time for intellectual property owners.
Todd Juenger, Analyst
Okay, thanks. And just -- your content is still on Netflix -- a lot of Disney Channel content is still there. So, regardless
of the timing of specifics, it seems like you're still in business with them, clearly today, and it sounds like you intend to
be?
Bob Iger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
We're in business with Netflix. We're in business with others, and we'll probably continue to be in business with those
and new entrants in the marketplace. And we are engaged in discussions in a number of directions about that.

Doug Mitchelson, Analyst
Thanks so much. Bob, you've started to address this, but if I sort of think back a decade ago, you were -- you're always
brand focused, right, and you were running the brand committee. And there was an appeal of elegance to having two
umbrella brands, Disney and ESPN, and having the focus on those two brands seemed to be an advantage.
And now you've spread out with so many brands, with Pixar and Marvel and Star Wars and now ABC, as you
mentioned, pretty consistently is -- one, was there an underlying strategy to diversify or expand your brand portfolio
beyond those sort of two initial core brands? And then, what gives you comfort that you can successfully manage this
many brands when -- again, in the past, it seemed like focusing on just two umbrella brands was thought of as an
advantage?
Bob Iger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Well, seven years after the Pixar acquisition -- or I guess, technically, it's six -- sorry, six and a half years -- I think
there's ample proof that that brand has been managed very effectively. And during the period of time that we've owned
Pixar, the equity in the Disney brand, almost no matter how you measure it, has also increased. So I think we've
demonstrated our ability to be ambidextrous in that regard.
We also co-brand Pixar films with Disney. And we found in the process that that enhances both impression of the Pixar
brand and impression of the Disney brand. Marvel has seen, I think, real strong brand growth. That's largely been tied
to a couple of things. One, quality of their films, particularly the last three, Captain America, Thor, and obviously,
Avengers, but also, the growth of the presence of the brand, which is in part enhanced by self-distribution.
So when we take over the distribution of their films, for instance, and we are also the owner of the brand, we're much
more focused on growing the brand in the process than the third-party distributors that distribute their product before
were interested in. So there are opportunities there.
The Star Wars brand, I think, basically doesn't need much help, except obviously will, I think, benefit greatly from the
release of a film. We intend, in that case, to co-brand, as I mentioned just a few minutes ago, Disney-Lucas or
Disney-Star Wars in some form -- different forms. And I think that's again another opportunity like Pixar to enhance
both the Star Wars brand and the Disney brand. ESPN is doing just fine. ABC is also doing fine, although from a brand
perspective, we leverage the ABC name, obviously, in much more limited fashion than we do the other brands that
we've been talking about.
Doug Mitchelson, Analyst
Thanks for that. And, if Lowell will let me ask one for Jay, just a quick one. I want to take a shot at the park margins a
different way. Would you say that the growth initiatives you've been nice enough to give us the revenue and OpEx
impact for each of the past three years -- would you say those will prove margin accretive to the park division in time
or in line or margin dilutive?
So, not from today but in aggregate, will those growth initiatives be margin accretive or dilutive to the parks?
Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, margin accretive, Doug. We are very confident that if you -- if I check through the list quickly, the cruise ships,
the enhancement of DCA, the Magic Kingdom expansion, the Aulani hotel, and this new guest enhancement at Walt
Disney World that we were talking about, every single one of those was done with a strategic and financial -- pretty
tight strategic and financial goal.

And they will be in aggregate accretive, as will someday Shanghai. I didn't put that on the list, because it's much
longer-term than the rest of those things. But we think that all of these projects will be accretive to the ultimate margins
of the business.

The next question comes from Jason Bazinet from Citi. Please go ahead.
Jason Bazinet, Analyst
Just had a clarifying question for Mr. Rasulo. Going back to those -- the park investments that you talked about, were
you saying, I think you said -- I wasn't sure if you were saying you're going to invest 500 million in all of these
initiatives next year? Or you were saying all of the growth initiatives that you've done historically will generate $500
million of revenue at a certain margin, and whatever sort of incremental EBIT that generates, we'll be investing that
much in these improvements?
Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Okay. What I said was a little bit of all the things that you said.
Jason Bazinet, Analyst
Okay.
Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
So, let's start at the top. In aggregate, they will generate $500 million of revenue. Some of those -- incremental revenue
above our base business. Some of those that have been up and running for a while, like the cruise ship and DCA, will,
in fact generate -- will be accretive to earnings. They will generate positive operating income in the year.
The guest enhancement project that Bob talked about and Shanghai Disneyland are still in the investment -- not the
investment -- sort of generating operating income -- there is investment -- but generating operating expense that
exceeds any revenue that they will generate. So if you look at all these things in aggregate -- the Disney Cruise Line
expansion, the Fantasyland expansion, Disney's California, the guest enhancement program that we're talking about,
and Shanghai Disneyland, in aggregate, their incremental expenses will match the aggregate incremental revenue. So,
they will generate $500 million of incremental revenue and $500 million of incremental expense.

The next question is from Anthony DiClemente from Barclays. Please go ahead.
Anthony DiClemente, Analyst
Thanks. I don't think anyone's asked about advertising pacings at ESPN. And I guess -- I think you said in your remarks
that they were pacing down, which was a little surprising to me for a couple of reasons. First, I remember you guys had
a bullish tone about ESPN moving forward on the last call. So, I'm wondering what really changed during the quarter?
And then, secondly, just wondering, does that ad pacings being down include the return of the new NBA games? Or is
that normalized for the impact or normalized for the benefit of the return of the new NBA games?
Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
So, let me start out at the top and maybe Bob will want to jump in. Starting at the top, we did say that the pacings were
down modestly for ESPN. And some of that has to do, needless to say, with distraction from the elections, what that
implies on ratings, debates -- things that basically attract interest that are extraordinary. And sporting events are
sometimes, consequently, have lower ratings. But your question about the NBA, I'm sorry, could you repeat it?
Anthony DiClemente, Analyst
Well, the question is, really, for the 1Q, you talked about on the cost side, sports rights fees going up about 170 million.
And then, just trying to think about that in terms of revenue as well. And, if one of the reasons that the cost side is
going up, you said it's because of more NBA games. So are ad pacings going down despite the favorable year-over-year
comp, despite having NBA games where you had the lockout last year?
Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes, Anthony. Yes.
Anthony DiClemente, Analyst
Okay. Thank you. And then I just have a quick follow-up, which is, I never -- I didn't think that Hulu was a big driver
of broadcasting. But since you mentioned it in the press release, just wondering what was going on with the higher
equity losses at Hulu in the quarter? Just wondering if you could comment on that. And how should we think about
that?

Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. It's not a big effect. It did make it, because we ranked the impacts from largest to smallest, and at some point, we
cut them off. I would say this one -- we usually like to put two or three -- this one made it, in other quarters, it probably
wouldn't. But it's basically increased programming costs. It's above -- if you back Hulu out of the broadcasting numbers
-- in fact, broadcasting would have been slightly positive; it turned out to be slightly negative because of it. I want to
emphasize it's not a real driver for the quarter.

The next question is from David Miller from Caris & Company. Please go ahead.
David Miller, Analyst
Yeah. Hey, guys, I have one for Jay, one for Bob. Jay, you mentioned in the press release something about a film
write-down under the studio line. Could you just detail what you wrote down in the quarter? And I apologize in
advance if it was already in your prepared remarks. I had some technical difficulty on the call.
And then, Bob, on the Lucas deal, or on the ensuing conference call last week, vis-a-vis the Lucas deal, there was some
confusion after the call, particularly out of the buy side, about any legacy agreement with 20th Century Fox that
Lucasfilm has currently, and what you have to pay out, if anything, to extract yourselves out of that. Appreciate you
taking my question. Thank you.
Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
David, let me take the short answer. I think I mentioned at a conference, and it was broadly reported, that the
write-down was for a film that was in progress in stop action animation called Cinderbiter. And that was the vast
majority, 98% of the write-downs for the quarter.
Bob Iger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
And on Lucas, what we were referring to is the fact that Fox has certain distribution rights to films that have already
been made and released, and will be released in varying forms going forward, as they did recently with a 3D release of
one of the Star Wars films. In valuing Lucas going forward, we did not factor in any need on our part whatsoever to
acquire any rights back from News Corp. We may choose, at some point after closing, to explore that, but all the value
they were looking at is going forward value associated with all the rights that we've bought from Lucas and any new IP
that is created, which is not encumbered by any of the deals that Fox had.

Okay, great. And then, Jay, on the Hurricane Sandy impact, you said you couldn't really quantify it as of yet. But would
the majority of that impact, whatever it is, be due to disruption at the parks? Just because folks in the tri-state area
couldn't fly down to Orlando, obviously; may still not be able to fly down there. Or is it more of a make-good situation
at any of the networks? Or is it a combination of both? What is sort of the majority effect, if you don't mind me asking?
Thank you.
Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Not at all. Let me just tick off a list of things that we're looking at. Obviously, due to the hurricane, there were a
number of Disney stores in the Atlantic area that were closed. I think we closed over 40 stores for a number of days.
Secondly, when you don't have people with power, and you don't have people watching television, you've obviously
got some impact there on the broadcast side.
On the park side, there -- the Northeast is a good feeder market to Walt Disney World. We -- it's probably the toughest
to quantify. In the past, I will tell you that we have found, from natural disasters, that people make their way back in the
course of the year. So that could be a short-term impact. We have not seen a raft of cancellations, I will tell you that.
That much we know so far.
Bob Iger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Interestingly enough, this is a week that most New Jersey schools are closed for the week. And that is, as Jay
referenced, an important feeder market to Orlando. And obviously, New Jersey got devastated by the storm. We have
seen very little impact this week. I've talked to folks down in Orlando this morning, and it appears that the makeup of
attendance at Disney World this week from New Jersey is just as strong as it usually is. So that's a pretty interesting
sign.

How are you doing? Just a couple of questions in regard to CapEx. You guys have mentioned that you expect it to ramp
down in '13. Just in sizing that, should we attach some capital expenses to these enhancement projects in the
incremental costs and investments that you've articulated for next year? And then also, you mentioned this being the

to these peak levels during that time?

Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I'm happy to answer that. So, let me just set the table. So we said that 2012 would be our peak CapEx year for
some time to come. And that we would be ramping down significantly in parks capital thereafter, while Shanghai was
ramping up. So let me talk to that.
If you look on the domestic side -- domestic park side, we're probably down, will be down at the end of fiscal '13 about
$1 billion from where we were in fiscal '12, in terms of capital expenditures. A lot of the capital expenditure that is
behind what Bob talked about as guest enhancing technologies is behind us.
On a consolidated basis, though, it's only going to look like a $500 million decrease. And, in fact, the difference has to
do with investment in Shanghai Disneyland. But remember, as only 43% owners of that project, we only spend 43% of
the capital. So 57% of the capital spent on Shanghai Disneyland will make its way back to us in a financing line. So, if
you look at it that way, even on a consolidated basis, we're going to be down about $800 million for the year.
Michael Senno, Analyst
Okay. And is there any impact on the timing of that cash, that's flowing back? Or is it pretty much in synchrony?
Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I think there's paperwork that goes to it, but it's not like it's backloaded or it's a bullet payment. It's supposed to be
contemporaneous with the expenditures.
Michael Senno, Analyst
Okay, great. Thanks.
Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations
Thank you, Michael. Operator, we have time for one more question.
Operator
The next question comes from Vasily Karasyov from Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.
Vasily Karasyov, Analyst
Thank you. Jay, I have a couple for you. One, you mentioned that ESPN has a couple of affiliate deals coming up in the
year. And you said one will be done by March. Can you please remind us what percentage of subs will be covered by
that? And also, on film, you highlighted the tough comp in the first quarter, but if you look at the remainder of the
quarters, you have a major comp with the John Carter write-down, and then you have The Avengers for the next two
quarters. So when we try to estimate, is it going to be a up or down quarter -- year, sorry for the studio, what kind of put
and take should we keep in mind there?
Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Okay. Let me take your first question -- which I've already forgotten, I'm afraid to say.

The percentage of subs coming up.
Jay Rasulo, Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
What I said in my comments -- I'm sorry, Vasily -- what I said in my comments was that we were going to see the
kick-in from the revenue side of some new affiliate deals in the course of fiscal '13, one of which was going to be in the
first quarter. That's not the renegotiation of that deal, but that is, in fact, the realization of the revenue from the
negotiation of a prior deal. I don't want to -- we've kind of made a habit of not getting into the details about the timing
of our affiliate deals with our partners for all the right reasons of confidentiality, and not wanting to get in the way of
negotiation. So I'm sorry I won't be any more articulate about that.
Bob Iger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
And as to your question about the comps and our film slate, obviously, we'll have tough Q3 comparisons because of
Avengers. But we feel good overall about the slate and the year -- Oz The Great and Powerful in March, Iron Man 3,
Lone Ranger, and of course, Monster's University. So we think we've got a strong film slate coming up.
Vasily Karasyov, Analyst
Thank you very much.
Lowell Singer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations
