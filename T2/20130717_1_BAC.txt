MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to today's program. [Operator Instructions] And please note, today's call is being recorded. It's now my
pleasure to turn the program over to Lee McEntire. Please begin, sir.
Lee McEntire
Good morning to those on the phone joining us by webcast. Before Brian Moynihan and Bruce Thompson begin their
comments, let me remind you that this presentation, available at bankofamerica.com, does contain some
forward-looking statements regarding both our financial condition and financial results, and that these statements
involve certain risks that may cause actual results in the future to be different from our current expectations. Please see
our press release and SEC documents for further information.
With that, let me turn it over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan.
Brian T. Moynihan
Thank you, Lee. Good morning, everyone. And just to start off, let me remind you where our focus is and has been for
some time, on capital generation, on managing our risk, on continuing to reduce our costs, and on addressing the legacy
issues so that we can drive our growth strategy by simply doing more with our customers and clients. This quarter
shows very clearly how the focus is paying off, as we earned $4 billion.
We've built our company over the last several quarters to maintain stability while continuing to make progress, to
withstand the volatility that we saw at the end of this quarter, while delivering for our customers and shareholders, and

that came through. Even as mortgage demand has decreased, we still had a 40% increases in retail production over the
last year and an increases over last quarter. Even as interest rates rose, we were able to add to our capital ratios. And
keep in mind, with our trillion-dollar deposit book, rising rates will continue to increases the value of those over time.
We have leading capabilities in the areas where our customers want us to be. We do more business with them. We're
gaining momentum across every customer group we serve. And while we're doing that, our balance sheet continues to
strengthen, our capital ratios again move higher, and just as importantly, we've begun the process of returning capital to
our shareholders.
Our credit quality continued to improve. Expenses are down by $1 billion from a year ago. LAS expenses, or Legacy
Asset & Servicing expenses, excluding our litigation, are down by nearly $800 million on a quarterly basis from the
peak only a couple quarters ago, and are ahead of our projections. Our loans and our deposits continue to grow. All the
businesses produced solid, stable revenues, and in the focused areas where we are growing, they grew their revenues,
and we're seeing growing activity levels across all our customer and client groups.
So, as we look forward, we're closely following recent regulatory proposals around capital and leverage, just as you
are. Obviously, we have already taken significant steps in our company to build our current strong levels of capital and
liquidity, and we maintain a comfort level here that Bruce will take you through the numbers later.
The good news in all this is that we're seeing in our business is reflective of an improving economy. The economy
continues to improve across all areas. That benefits our company across multiple fronts. But most importantly, with an
improving economy, it strengthens and creates opportunity for the people, companies, and investors that we serve, and
that opportunity will continue to provide opportunity for to us capture as we connect all our capabilities to help those
that we serve realize their financial goals.
With that, let me turn it over to Bruce.
Bruce R. Thompson
Great. Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start on slide five of our presentation materials. Total
revenues for the quarter were very solid, at $22.9 billion, and we earned $4 billion, or $0.32 per diluted share, which is
up significantly both from the first quarter of this year as well as the comparable period in 2012. We made significant
progress in all of our primary businesses this quarter, and on a linked-quarter basis, we had growth in four out of the
five businesses.
Consumer activity levels were solid, as mortgage production increased, credit card loan balances stabilized, and both
deposits and brokerage flows increased from the previous quarter. Global Wealth & Investment Management reported
another quarter of record revenues as well as earnings. Global Banking revenue showed continued strength, driven by
increased lending in both our commercial as well as our corporate bank, and Investment Banking performance
remained strong and close to record levels.
Total noninterest expense of $16 billion represented a significant improvement in expenses both relative to the first
quarter of this year as well as the comparable quarter in 2012. And asset quality improved significantly, as our
provision expense declined to $1.2 billion this quarter.
On slide six, we give some balance sheet highlights. First, the overall size of the balance sheet came down this quarter
to about $2.125 trillion. Importantly, customer activity remained strong, with loans, led by our commercial loans, up
$10 billion. Period-end deposits were down, driven by seasonality associated with tax payments. However, our average
deposits did experience modest growth.
I'd also call out on the page that tangible book value per share remained relatively flat from the first quarter of this year.
That's significant in the context of our $4 billion of earnings largely offset the negative after-tax impact from
accumulated other comprehensive income, driven by the increase in rates that we saw during the quarter.

Also helping our tangible book value per share in the quarter was the return of roughly $1 billion of capital through the
repurchase of 80 million common shares at a price below tangible book value. And as we look forward, we have an
additional $4 billion available for common share repurchases. The combination of the earnings that I discussed on slide
five, as well as the work that we did on our balance sheet, led to a return on tangible common equity of just under 10%
for the quarter and a return on average assets of 74 basis points.
On slide seven, we walk through some of the different regulatory capital ratios as far as where we ended up at the end
of the second quarter. If we start with Basel I Tier 1 common ratio, we ended the quarter at 10.83%, up 34 basis points
from the first quarter of this year and 45 basis points on a pro forma basis at the end of 2012.
Moving to Basel III, on a fully phased-in basis under the advanced approach, and based on final rules, our Tier 1
common ratio was 9.6%, showing progress from the first quarter of 2013 despite a 32-basis-point negative impact from
the change in OCI during the quarter. Risk-weighted assets under Basel III were $1.31 trillion, or $43 billion lower than
the first quarter of 2013, due to an improvement in both the composition as well as the overall credit quality on the
books.
If we move to the proposed supplementary U.S. leverage ratio requirement which will kick in at the beginning of 2018,
our preliminary analysis indicate that, at the holding company, our leverage ratio for the second quarter of 2013 was in
the range of 4.9% to 5%, which positions us very well relative to the 5% minimum.
If we look at our primary bank subsidiaries, which we have two – BANA, our primary banking subsidiary, and FIA,
our card subsidiary – during the second quarter of 2013, both of those were in excess of the 6% proposed minimum. So,
net-net, from a regulatory capital perspective, we feel like we've made very good progress across all of the different
measures that we'll be required to operate within.
On page eight, funding and liquidity, you can see long-term debt during the quarter declined $18 billion as maturities
outpaced issuances during the quarter. Our global excess liquidity sources did decline during the quarter. It was
expected as a result of our reductions in the long-term debt footprint, our preferred stock redemptions, as well as the
seasonal deposit outflows that I referenced earlier from tax payments.
At the parent company, liquidity remains very strong, at $95 billion, due to capital returns from our subsidiaries during
the quarter. Time to required funding increased to 32 months, up from 29 months in the first quarter of 2013 and well
above our target of approximately 24 months. And as we've indicated before, over the next four to six quarters, we will
look to move that time to funding towards the 24 months as we repay the upcoming debt maturities in 2013 and 2014.
On net interest income, if you look at slide nine, net interest income on an FTE basis was $10.8 billion, down just about
1% from the first quarter of 2013. If you adjust our net interest income for market-related items, it was $10.4 billion,
which was less than $100 million below our guidance, as our trading-related net interest income declined as a result of
reduced balance sheet utilization in our Global Markets business during the last month of the quarter.
On the positive side, we benefited during the quarter from lower long-term debt, higher levels of commercial loan
balances, as well as one additional day of interest in the second quarter relative to the first. On the flip side, in addition
to the negative impact of lower asset balances on the trading books, we also had slightly lower consumer loan balances
and yields, driven by our runoff portfolios.
As we came into the second quarter of 2013, our interest rate sensitivity, as we disclosed in the first quarter 10-Q,
estimated a $1.6 billion annual benefit to net interest income from a 100-basis-point instantaneous long-end steepening
if rates remained at that level. During the second quarter, the 10-year rate did increases by more than 60 basis points,
and we realized $300 million of that benefit immediately through the impact on FAS 91.
We expect to realize the balance of the benefit, approximately $700 million, over the course of the next 12 months. As
a result of those different factors, we do expect net interest income, excluding any market-related impacts, to build off
of the second quarter of 2013's $10.4 billion adjusted level as we move forward during the balance of 2013 and into
2014.

If you look at the work that we did on expenses, on slide 10, total expenses were down significantly on both a
linked-quarter as well as a year-over-year basis, as we continued to deliver on the expense reductions that we've
discussed within our Legacy Assets & Servicing area, as well as the ongoing cost savings from our New BAC
initiatives that we're implementing in the other businesses that we operate.
Our number of full-time-equivalent employees in the quarter ended at just over 257,000, which was down 2% from the
first quarter of 2013 and almost 7% from the comparable period a year ago. Total expenses did decline $3.5 billion
from the first quarter of 2013, as we benefited from a $1.7 billion decline in litigation. Our LAS expenses, ex-litigation,
were down roughly another $250 million. Our retirement eligible costs, which we only incur during the first quarter of
each year, were down $900 million, and all other expenses were down approximately $600 million.
As we look at the progress that we make on our LAS expenses, from the fourth quarter of 2012 when they peaked at
$3.1 billion, we are now down approximately $800 million from that peak, and we did all of that within the last two
quarters. As a result, we previously had said that our LAS expenses, ex-litigation, would be approximately $2.1 billion
by the end of 2013 – meaning in the fourth quarter of 2013 – and with the progress that we've made, we now believe
our fourth quarter LAS expenses will be below $2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013.
And keep in mind that as we work through these, the realization of these savings can be somewhat lumpy. In addition
to our LAS expenses, the $600 million improvement in all other cost was driven primarily by lower incentive
compensation costs during the quarter as well as our New BAC efforts. We remain on track to achieve $1.5 billion of
New BAC quarterly savings by the fourth quarter of 2013.
On slide 11, we give some information on the trends from an asset quality perspective, and as you can see, credit
quality once again improved significantly during the quarter. Net charge-offs declined to $2.1 billion, an improvement
of 16% on a linked-quarter basis and 42% relative to the second quarter of 2012. Our second quarter of 2013 net loss
rate of 94 basis points is the first time that we've been below 100 basis points since 2006.
Given the improving trend in delinquencies and other metrics, we now expect our net charge-offs will come in below
$2 billion in the third quarter of 2013. Provision expense of $1.2 billion this quarter does reflect a reserve reduction of
approximately $900 million, reflecting improving credit trends. The allowance coverage remains strong, and given the
pace of improvement in credit quality, we do anticipate continued reserve releases, particularly in our consumer real
estate portfolios.
Let's now move to a discussion of the performance within our lines of business on slide 12. Consumer & Business
Banking, before we go through the results, I do want to highlight a technical change that this quarter we did move our
direct and indirect auto and other specialty lending into the CBB business from Global Banking, given that it more
closely connects with consumer lending activity. This book does include $37 billion of loans, and we have adjusted
prior periods to have this data be comparable.
Earnings in the business were relatively stable compared to the first quarter of 2013 and up 15% from the prior year,
driven by both expense improvements as well as lower credit costs. We do continue to do more business with our core
customers. Our average deposits were up almost $9 billion from the first quarter of 2013, excluding the transfers that
we had from the Wealth Management business. Loans declined a modest 1%, as a decline in our credit cards was
mitigated by a balanced growth in both small business as well as auto lending.
Been a lot of discussion on our U.S. credit card balances; those balances appear to have stabilized and at the end of the
second quarter were at $90.5 billion, up from $90 billion at the end of the first quarter of this year. Our card issuance
remained strong in the second quarter, and is at its highest level since 2008. U.S. consumer credit card retail spend per
average active account was up 9% from the second quarter a year ago.
We continue to optimize our delivery network, and usage within the mobile channel continues to increases. And lastly,
expense levels reflect both the benefits of the network optimization as well as the investments to build out our specialty
sales force.

If we move to Consumer Real Estate Services, on slide 13 we address home loans, one of the two businesses within our
CRES segment. First-mortgage retail originations were $25 billion, and were up 6% from the first quarter and 41%
compared with retail originations in the year-ago period. Our market share in the retail mortgage space improved. We
broke through 5%, versus below 4% just over a year ago. We do anticipate some slowdown in mortgage production
resulting from recent increases in interest rates, and that is seen by the 5% reduction in our mortgage origination
pipeline and at the end of June relative to what we had seen at the end of March this year.
While production has experienced a nice trajectory over the last year, we, not unlike the industry, have experienced
compression on margins that affect revenue. While these margins do remain high relative to historical periods, the
compression is most notable when you look at our year-over-year production revenue.
Though we continued to add mortgage loan officers during the second quarter, primarily in the banking centers, as well
as other employees in our sales and fulfillment area in order to deliver a first-class mortgage experience for our
customers, these actions did contribute to higher expenses in the quarter.
On slide 14, we move to Legacy Assets & Servicing, which still did report a loss in the quarter but showed significant
improvement from the first quarter which included the MBIA and RMBS litigation settlements, as the reduction in
expenses more than offset a decline in the revenues. Revenues were negatively impacted by a servicing revenue decline
of $175 million, as the servicing portfolio declined 17% and we had less favorable MSR hedge performance. That was
partially offset by higher sales volume of loans that returned to performing status.
As you look at LAS, several key takeaways from this slide. The first is our level of 60-plus-days-delinquent loans,
which is one of the primary drivers of the elevated cost, dropped below 500,000 units at the end of June, a 27% decline
from the results at the end of the first quarter of 2013. Recall, our number of 60-plus-day-delinquent loans peaked at
almost 1.4 million units at the end of 2010.
Looking ahead, we now expect our amount of 60-plus-day-delinquent loans to come down further than we originally
expected, to below 375,000 units by the end of 2013. As we continue to reduce these loans, the number of employees
and contractors will come down, and you can see that by the decrease of 5,000 people during this quarter. Expenses,
ex-litigation once again, were down roughly $250 million from the first quarter, to $2.3 billion.
Global Wealth & Investment Management, on slide 15, had a great quarter, with our results once again reflecting
records in revenues, earnings, as well as pre-tax margin. Year-over-year, revenue increased 10% and net income grew
by 38%. Our second quarter pre-tax margin of about 28% benefited from strong revenue performance as well as
improved credit costs during the quarter.
Long-term AUM flows were solid, at nearly $8 billion in the quarter, more than double the flows that we saw in the
prior year-ago period. Ending loan balances grew $5 billion in the quarter, to record levels, while ending deposits
declined $5 billion due to the seasonality of tax payments.
Global Banking, on slide 16, experienced strong loan growth and slightly higher Investment Banking fees compared to
the first quarter of 2013, both of which helped drive $1.3 billion in net income and a 22% return on allocated equity.
The Investment Banking strength kept fees near record levels, and we retained our second-place ranking in net
investment banking fees.
Within the investment bank, underwriting fees continued the momentum from near record levels during the first quarter
of 2013 and were up 53% from the second quarter of 2012. Equity underwriting fees grew 10% relative to the first
quarter of 2013 and up 86% from the comparable year-ago period due to the strong global IPO market as well as our
focus on continuing to grow capabilities within this space.
On the balance sheet, average loans increases by almost $12 billion from the first quarter, driven by growth in both
corporate C&I as well as commercial real estate. As you look at that loan growth, I think it's important to note the
strong diversity in lending to our global customer base, as the U.S. represented approximately 40% of the growth, with
the balance outside of the U.S.

If we switch to Global Markets on slide 17, we earned roughly $1 billion during the quarter on revenue of $4.2 billion,
which is up significantly from the second quarter of 2012 results, but down from the first quarter of 2013. The business
during the second quarter generated a 13% return on allocated equity. Sales and trading revenue, if we back out DVA,
was $3.5 billion, solidly above our 2012 results.
Fixed sales and trading was down versus the second quarter of 2012 as well as the first quarter of 2013, given the rate
volatility and spread widening that we saw during the last month of the quarter. Equity sales and trading had a very
strong quarter, actually the best that we've seen since the first quarter of 2011. Results, ex-DVA, were up 53% from the
second quarter of 2012 and 4% over the first quarter of 2013, as we continued to gain market share in cash equities,
improved our performance in equity derivatives, and had higher client balances in our financing area.
If you look at the balance sheet, trading asset levels did decline, as we reduced risk during the end of the second
quarter. Average VaR, at a 99% confidence level, was $69 million in the quarter, down from $80 million in the first
quarter of last year.
On slide 18, we walk you through the results of our All Other segment, which includes global principal investments,
our non-U.S. consumer card business, our discretionary portfolio associate-d with interest rate risk management,
insurance, as well as our international Wealth Management area. Gains on the sales of debt securities were $452
million in the second quarter of 2013, compared to $67 million in the first quarter and $354 million in the second
quarter of 2012.
That, coupled with the prior-quarter costs for retirement-eligible compensation, lower litigation expense, higher equity
investment income, and lower provision for credit losses due primarily to the improvement in the residential mortgage
portfolio, drove the significant improvement in earnings in this segment compared to both the first quarter of this year
and the prior year-ago period.
Before we leave this slide, two things I would note for modeling purposes as it relates to preferred dividends and taxes.
The first, preferred dividends, we expect our preferred dividends to drop from $441 million this quarter to about $280
million in the third quarter, and then settle in around $260 million per quarter as we move forward. These declines are
the result of the redemption of the $5.5 billion of preferred stock this quarter.
If we move to taxes, the effective tax rate for the quarter was 27%. As we look out during the balance of the year, we
would expect the rate to be approximately 30%, plus or minus any unusual items like the UK tax rate reduction. As
we've disclosed previously, this year, as expected, UK corporate income tax rate is likely to be reduced by 3%, and will
be enacted in the third quarter of this year.
As a result, for modeling purposes, you should include a charge of approximately $1.1 billion associated with the
write-down of our UK deferred tax asset in the third quarter of this year. But keep in mind, given where we are from a
DTA disallowance position, this will not impact our Basel I or Basel III capital ratios.
And before we wrap up and take questions, I'd like to leave you with a couple of thoughts about the second quarter
performance. We achieved many of the objectives that we laid out for the quarter Revenue was solid, costs came down
significantly, credit continued to improve, and our capital ratios remained strong and improved despite the change in
both OCI as well as the initiation of our share repurchase program during the quarter.
The higher rate environment, to the extent it stays with us, allows us to improve our net interest income going forward,
and we plan to continue to drive forward, execute on our strategy, and deliver on the earnings capability of our
company.
And with that, Operator, we'll go ahead and open it up for questions.

Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] With that, we'll go first to the site of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your
line is open.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Good morning. Thanks.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning, Betsy.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: A couple of questions on improving RWAs – you mentioned that credit helped drive the
RWAs down a little bit. Could you give a little bit more color on how much of the HPI improvement has already come
through the RWAs or any more to come from what's happened so far in your 3Q and 4Q outlook?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure. When we reference, Betsy, the improving credit quality, you can look at it in three
different buckets. The first, which you already pointed out, clearly, HPI under Basel III, as home prices go up, there's
benefit to that, and that improvement accounted for roughly a third of the improvement we saw during the quarter. The
other two things that we benefited from was, at the end of the quarter, we had less risk on the books, so that obviously
the reduction in risk provided some benefit; and then, third, the overall credit quality of the wholesale book that we had
seen also improved. So within that credit quality characterization, it was those three things.
As we look forward, any improvement, any further improvement that we have with respect to risk-weighted assets is
going to be a function of home prices. Obviously, the [ph] prints (30:48) that we've seen during this quarter continue to
be strong, and to the extent that the improvement continues, we would expect to benefit from that. The other thing that
is noteworthy, and you see this, is that we do continue to run off a fair bit of legacy positions within the consumer
mortgage portfolio, and you saw that the home equity lines of credit reduced by about another $3.5 billion during the
quarter, and that obviously provides some benefit as well.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Okay, thanks, and then a follow-up on your comment regarding the outlook for NII
where you indicated that NII, excluding market-related items, could build from the $10.4 billion at Q2 2013. Could you
describe how you're thinking about that? I've had a lot of conversations over the last quarter about what you put in your
Q, which is [ph] a 100-basis-point [indiscernible] (31:42) meaningful increase in EPS. That's got to come more from
reinvesting the cash flow of the securities portfolio. So could you give us a sense of how you drive higher NII?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure. Well, in the Q, we put out two different numbers. The first is that we put out is the
100-basis-point parallel shift, which at the end of the first quarter I believe we had said was either $3.6 billion or $3.7
billion. And then we had the steepening, where just long rates went up and we had had the $1.6 billion that I
referenced. Obviously, as we look at and look at net interest income in the future, we've not seen a parallel shift at this
point; we've just seen a steepening, and that's why, in my comments, I referenced the $1.6 billion. But as we look
forward and look at the – and look forward from a net interest income perspective, to the extent that long-end rates are
higher and we are investing excess liquidity at the company, we will benefit from being able to invest at higher rates.
The other two items that we have that will benefit net interest income going forward is we do continue to take down the
debt footprint, and you can see that commercial loan balances are moving up as well, and we'd expect the combination
of those things to more than offset some of the declines in both balances and yields we've seen on the consumer side.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yeah, Bruce, I just would add, Betsy, if you think about over the last several quarters,
we've been fighting the runoff portfolios, and the impact of those going forward continues to mitigate. So if you look in
some of the information was in the card balances actually growing quarter to quarter, whether – even the home equities,
the size of the runoff portfolio of mortgages is lower, you assume those that had higher yields as a general case, so the
stuff coming on, replacing now helps replace those yields and is better in securities. So that gives us confidence that
we're starting to see the growth that helps drives the core NIM up.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: And would you be looking to shift some of the liquidity pool into securities? Obviously,
it would be longer duration than the liquidity pool.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: As we've always said, the first place as we continue to build liquidity that we're looking to
place it is within the lines of business...

<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Sure
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: ...to fund loan growth from those customers, and if you look at this quarter and you look
at the balance sheet, you saw some of that in that our overall securities balances, I believe, were down about $18 billion
whereas our average – overall loans were up. So, clearly, the lines of business, to the extent that we continue to
originate well-structured, well-priced loans that return the way that we'd like, that's where the liquidity is going to go
first. The excess liquidity is invested, and in this environment we continue to be very mindful of the OCI risk and will
manage with the mindset of mitigating that risk.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Okay, great. And then just lastly on the WIM pre-tax margin, pretty strong number this
quarter, and I know last quarter you called out some one-timers. Were there any one-timers in that this quarter?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: The only one-timer that I think jumps out is, if you look at it, you can see that we actually
had a negative provision of about $15 million for the quarter. A more normalized provision number within that
business is probably $25 million to $50 million. But not unlike the balance of our consumer real estate portfolio, the
consumer lending, with respect to mortgages in that segment, benefits from the increasing home prices that we've seen.
That's probably the one anomaly that merits mentioning.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Betsy, John Thiel and David Darnell – John runs the business- and along with Keith
Banks, U.S. Trust, have done a good job. If you look at the revenue year-over-year – I think there's a 10% in expenses
– it went up 3% in the business, which, as you know, has high sensitivity to compensation increases. So they just have
been doing all the hard work in the New BAC work like everybody else, and so as the markets rose, they benefited
dramatically from it.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: And so what's the targeted pre-tax margin there?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think, over time, as we look at where we are – and I want to highlight, over time, we
think that can get to a margin of 30%. But at the same time, I think you've called out we were at 28% this quarter, and
we did have some benefit from the provision line.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Okay. Over time includes a higher interest rate environment?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yes.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yes.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Okay.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Remember, they've got a lot of loans, deposits, and lending in there, too, that benefits as
rates rise.

we factor in some the charges that you had in the first quarter.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure. A couple things on the fixed income business – if we look at the – and let's look at it
year-over-year because this business probably has the most seasonality with respect to the first quarter. If you look at
year-over-year and if you looked within the businesses, within both the rates and currencies area as well as the different
credit trading areas which we look at investment-grade, high-yield, as well as our loan sales and trading, the
performance-year over-year was actually pretty good. Where we had weakness in the second quarter of this year was in
three areas. The first is that we continue to run off the structured credit trading book, and you had a pretty significant
decline during the second quarter of 2013 relative with the prior year from the continued runoff of that book. From a
P&L perspective, it's largely run off at this point, so we're not going to have to discuss that much going forward.
The other two areas on a relative basis that were weaker, we have a very significant business that's got number-one
market shares in the municipal finance space, and if you look at the prices and the spread widening, it was very
dramatic during the month of June in the muni space. That negatively affected us. And then in the mortgage space,
obviously the market widened out significantly there, and we had some lumpy items in the second quarter of 2012 as
well. So I think, as you look at the quarter and you look at the fixed income business, once again, we run it as a holistic
business between new issue and sales and trading. The new issue business had a great quarter. Those areas where the
markets were good, rates and currencies; credit trading across the board actually performed pretty well in the three
areas that I mentioned – one, because it's running off, and two, given the market dynamics didn't perform as well as we
would have expected.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay, that's very helpful color. So just as we think about FICC going forward, maybe a
little bit of a lower run rate as you're running down the – or ran down the structured trading, but also hopefully less
volatility, given that?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think that's fair. And just to give you a sense, Matt, the structured credit trading book
this quarter was less than $100 million, so as you look at the go-forward basis, there's just not much left.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. And then separately -
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Matt, just on that – just as you look at slide 17, what Tom Montag and team have been able
to do is to continue to take advantage of opportunities. The equities business, last year, we were still in a work in
progress, but they have rebuilt that business and it's doing well. The fixed income, Bruce just ran you through that, but
look at the ability to drive the profit by getting the expenses lined up well, so on the year-over-year basis, the profit
increased by $450 million, $460 million because we were able to maintain the expense discipline at the same time as
the revenue went up.
And so I think the key there is that we're trying to manage that business in the context of who we are as an entire
company in the markets business, and Tom and his team continue to drive where the opportunities are. And, FICC
aside, I think he had a very good quarter, but when you step back and look at it holistically, their ability
quarter-after-quarter to drive profit growth – or a good return on capital even in the more volatile spaces, where we got,
obviously, hit a little bit in FICC, in the latter part of the quarter is pretty solid.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay, that's helpful color. We do see good core trends in the I-Banking fees and of course
the equities business, as you mentioned. And then, just separately, if we look at loan loss provision expense going
forward, you gave us some components of charge-offs, and then just kind of big-picture, some more reserve release, but
any thoughts on just a specific level of provision expense going forward? I think you had been targeting $1.8 billion to
$2.2 billion, which obviously you broke through that now for a couple quarters.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, I think – it's a good question. What I would point to is that credit quality across the
board, and particularly as you look at early-stage delinquencies, as well as what we're seeing as we move some of the
consumer real estate out, is quite strong. As we've said, we think the charge-off number will come below $2 billion in
the third quarter. And as you look at the reserve release, the reserve release this quarter, roughly $650 million of it was
from core reserves and roughly $250 million of it was from PCI. We can't project PCI, but I think if you look at the
core $650 million and take the charge-off guidance that we've given, absent any change in home prices, you get a sense

We'll go next to the site of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is open.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Good morning. Bruce, I was wondering if you had any sense of where we might think
of legal expense going forward. It came down a lot this quarter. You got some things behind you. How should we think
of that number going forward?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, I think, John, as we look at legal expense, it's always a little bit difficult to predict,
but the just under $500 million that we saw this quarter is clearly at an elevated level from what we'd expect long-term.
At the same time, within the $500 million, there was nothing lumpy from the quarter. So it's – I always hesitate to say
too much on that because it is lumpy, but the $500 million number as it relates to a base level, at least what we can tell
in the near term, is probably not a bad level to keep.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And putting expenses altogether, the $16 billion is probably a pretty good
jumping-off point for us to think going forward starting in the third quarter?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: That's correct.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then, on the quarterly LAS trend, you mentioned getting below $2 billion
by the end of this year. Any thoughts on what your destination for that might be by the end of 2014? Ultimately, you
want to get that number down to $500 million, right?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, I would – as we make progress, we'd previously said we'd get $1 billion out this
year and $1 billion in 2014. We will be at a lower level at the end of 2013, as we said today, and I don't think it's
unreasonable to think we'll get another $1 billion out in 2014 relative to that lower level.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Just separately, you mentioned the DTA. I assume the DTA consumption is
still helping drive up your capital ratios. Could you remind us how much DTA you have right now and how much is
disallowed?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Right now, on a disallowed basis under Basel 1.5, it's in the ZIP Code of $15 billion to
$16 billion. I think the important thing to keep in mind is, during the quarter, we didn't get the benefit that you would
think from DTA because the impact of OCI offset that.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. But, normally, you'd probably be building at close to the pre-tax rate you've
said before?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Absolutely.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Last thing for me, on the NII, could you just review that again? The benefit
you've talked about, that's a benefit from the 10-year moving up, and did you say that you received $300 million of that
benefit that's already in the $10.4 billion that we see this quarter?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: No, the $300 million was in the $10.8 billion. The $10.4 billion backs out the $300
million.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay, so the benefit, the $700 million, that's to come over the next 12 months?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, the $700 million would be the benefit, all other things being equal, off of that $10.4
billion number, and that's just the benefit from the move in rates, not anything else to do with the balance sheet.

<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay, but you're thinking of that as helping the core number grow, right, not the
[indiscernible] (45:05)?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: That's correct. The $700 million that's left is all core. The $300 million was in the
pre-adjustment number that we reported of $10.8 billion this quarter.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Oh, okay, that $300 million wasn't core, but the next one to come is. Okay, got it.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Correct.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay, thank you. And, Bruce – yeah, and you have additional benefits beyond that if
short rates rise? Is that the point you were making earlier?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, that's correct. And I think that's the important point as you look at – and I'm going
to speak to what we had in the first quarter Q, the difference between a 100-basis-point parallel shift and a
100-basis-point on the long end is an incremental $2.1 billion, which is to your short-end question.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: John, the power of the deposit franchise and the short rate rise to the mix is so
transactional and core-oriented, it's just – that's where there's a lot of lift left. It's not showing up yet, obviously,
because of the steepness of the curve.

We'll take our next question from the site of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Your line is open.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Good morning.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Quick question, I just want to confirm – I believe you guys said in the past that there's –
when we look at the revenue decline from the sales in the MSR and LAS business versus the corresponding reduction
in expenses, we should count on a lag on that front. Is that right?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, there's always a lag of three to six months from when the work goes away to when
the actual employees that are working on that as well as the expenses associated with it leave the income statement.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay, great. Thanks for confirming that. And in your experience, generally, how sensitive –
what is the MSR purchase market like at this point? Are you guys still out there shopping MSRs, and how sensitive are
those buyers to home prices?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure. I want to make sure we clear up one question that we get a lot on this. We worked
hard to enter into the MSR sales that we entered into at the end of 2012, and a lot of the goal associated with that was to
be able to reduce the work so we could take the expenses out of our Legacy Assets & Servicing area. We entered into a
number of transactions in the fourth quarter of 2012, and those will close throughout 2013. The most significant sales
have already closed, and there will be some smaller sales that close during the balance of this year.
Outside of the closing of those sales, any activity that you see from an MSR perspective will only be because it makes
so much sense and it results in getting out loans that are very difficult to work out. But, going forward, you should not
expect to see any incremental MSR sales, and all of the guidance we've given you with respect to expense, as well as
60-plus-day delinquencies, is solely based on us doing the work that we control.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay, that's clear. Thank you.

<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Thank you.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: And then on your AFS portfolio, I think you guys have indicated in the past it was a roughly
two-year duration. Given your allocation to RMBS in that portfolio, did we see an extension of that duration? Can you
kind of help us get an idea about what the impact might have been during the quarter?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah. As you look at that – and at one of the conferences that we spoke at, the comment
that we had made at that point was that, as you look at the impact of OCI relative to net interest income, that it took
between two-and-a-half to three years to be able to earn back the OCI that's lost through net interest income. And
you're absolutely right that durations do widen in mortgage-backed securities, so as we leave 2012, it's more in the
context of three years to earn it back as opposed to the two-and-a-half to three years that we've spoken about
previously.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Terrific. Thanks for that. And then last one for me, the results in GWIM have definitely been
impressive. Can you guys speak to any change we've seen in the high-net-worth risk appetite or behavior over the last
roughly year or so and how sustainable you view that?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Well, I think, a year or so – I think if you went back a little shorter than that, in the first
quarter as the markets moved, people started putting money back in the market on the retail level – on a high-net-worth
retail level, and I think that trend has continued. But there's still a lot of cash out there. And so if you look at some of
the deposit dynamics, you can see that repositioning, and so [ph] we feel (50:24) people are constructive. We've got our
research experts that could give you their view of the S&P levels and things like that, but from a general trend from
both – in our private banking clients and the willingness to borrow money and put it to work for private banking and
wealth management clients and their investment patterns, we've seen their willingness to take risk go up. And so you've
seen growth in our lending across the board, and that indicates that people are willing to take risk. I think if you look
back a year ago, people were not using lines and weren't asking for a lot of lines, and that's changed in the last couple
quarters.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Cool. That's helpful. Thanks.

We'll go next to the site of Paul Miller from FBR. Your line is open.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Yeah, thank you very much. Switching to the mortgage banking side, you've got 5% market
share, which you've really built back your market share over the last year, year-and-a-half, but most of them are refi's.
With the refi – with rates going up, what do you think that market share goes to, or do you think you've done a pretty
good job building up your purchase sales force to maintain that?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Bruce, why don't you hit on some of that, and then I'll give you some broader color.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure. So I think, as you step back this quarter, our purchase percentage of our overall total
went up to 17% from what I believe was right around 7% during the first quarter, so we've started to see the purchase
share go up. And as we look forward, we have roughly 12% deposit market share throughout the country, and if we're
doing this business as well as we believe that we can, we clearly would expect over time that that mortgage market
share can grow from the 4% that we started at a year ago, to the 5% that we're at today, up to a high-single-digit market
share. And as we look at where we are today relative to going forward, and as we look at what some of our peers have
said, the 5% decline in pipeline [ph] end of (52:35) second quarter this year – or [ph] in the (52:38) second quarter
currently versus the first quarter, is reflective of the fact that we are picking up share because the pipelines aren't down
as much as some others.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Paul, the other thing is about 70-odd percent – 72%, 74%, I think it is – of the activity that
we do in mortgage is really off the customer base. And so we now have more than half the mortgage loan officers that
we have working through the branch – the retail stores on teams of people, along with the financial advisors, what we

call FSAs, in the branch and personal bankers and small business bankers. And so that business system is really taking
hold and the amount they're producing continues to grow. And that's where we've placed a lot of the growth
year-over-year – I think we're up to [ph] 7,800 (53:21) or so mortgage loan officers and mostly in that platform. That
platform performs well from both realtor referral basis plus direct-to-consumer basis.
And so we think that serves us well as the market ebbs and flows between refi, purchase. And then when you look at
our purchase statistics, you also have to remember that we still have, probably more than other of our peers, a lot of the
government-related refinancing business going through, which we identified for you, so if you sort of back that out,
you see a more representative picture of how we're doing in the purchase market. But we've got to make that transition
happen, and the team will work hard at it.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And then can you add some color – we've been in the – rates have really moved up. Gain-on-sale
margins you know are coming down. But can you give some color where [ph] you're seeing (54:10) gain-on-sale
margins so far into the quarter, or it is too early to tell?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: For the third quarter?
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Yeah.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think it's too early to tell because we've only had a couple weeks of activity, obviously,
but they came down in the quarter. Bruce, why don't you...
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, they were down roughly, Paul, 50 basis points during the second quarter relative to
the first, and as Brian indicated, it's too early to tell this quarter.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: But I think, Paul, generally in this business, remember, this business is a business which
ebbs and flows, and you know it as well as anybody. Our goal in this business is to serve our customers well, and I
think we've rebuilt the platform to do that, and that's why we're having success. And so as the margins have come in,
they're still strong, and we still make money in the business, but we've got to monitor it as we go forward. It doesn't
mean that – we'll have to take expenses down, like everybody else will, if the volumes are [ph] not there. (54:55)
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And did you disclose what your HARP percentage is? If you did, I missed it.

Do you happen to know, Bruce?

on. There are obviously some different views that were put out in BIS, but we don't have a number for you on that.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay, that's fair. I know that's early days. How will you – and stipulating to the fact that
clearly, based on what you've told us and some stuff that we've done, you are pretty much where you would need to be
on the supplemental leverage ratio per the U.S. take – how would you think about managing your off-balance-sheet
lending commitments to the extent that they do drive the denominator there?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: It's one of the questions, and as we have different discussions that you raise, that as policy
gets set on this, there is a concern of do some of the policies out there possibly have an impact on the availability of
undrawn credit. And so, directly to your point, to the extent that, over time, you're required to hold capital, in this case
in the form of a leverage ratio, for committed undrawn facilities, by definition, the cost of those facilities to have truly
committed facilities will need to migrate up over time so there's a fair return that's generated on the capital that needs to
get [ph] held (57:22) for those. To the extent that they're not committed, obviously the percentage that you need to hold
is much less. But, across the industry, to the extent that you need to hold capital for those in greater amounts, the costs
will need to change over time. Keep in mind that doesn't kick in until 2018.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Yeah, fair enough, and to the numbers you gave, you obviously don't have a lot of pressure
to do anything there. But you're right. It would seem like pricing of those facilities probably have to get rationalized.
On the shares, you did initiate the share repurchase, and you talked about that. But there was still a fairly meaningful
amount of share creep in the quarter. Was that just employee grants – although I would have expected to see those more
in the first quarter – and should we expect that we're, at this point, kind of at a high for the year in terms of the share
count? Should it head back down to where it was, say, in the first quarter?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, Guy, I'd ask you to take a look at, and if you flip back to the balance sheet data that
we present on page six, you can see that the actual number of outstanding shares for the quarter came down by 80
million, which is the 80 million shares that we told you we repurchased. The only variation in the share count on a
fully-diluted basis is the treatment of the 700 million shares that were associated with the Berkshire investment. And
depending on the price of the stock, as well as where the preferred shares are, that fully-diluted share count can bounce
around a little bit, but on a pure shares outstanding, we came down by the 80 million that we show on slide six.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Fair enough. Okay, I just have one more question. Thanks for the clarity on that. When do
you expect, at this point, to have completed the rationalization of the branch system?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: As you go back through in the guidance and what we've spoken about is that we wrapped
up and did the New BAC for the consumer businesses at the beginning of 2011, and we had had a plan to work through
and to rationalize that branch network down to in the ZIP Code of 5,000 branches by the end of 2014. And beyond
2014, at this point, we'll continue to evaluate and optimize the branch network going forward. What we've been very
pleased with is we look at that optimization of the network as two things. The first is we've rationalized the network in
the markets that we operate. We've been very pleased with our retention of both consumer deposits as well as overall
relationships in that, as we've rationalized that network, our customers have continued to do business with us and just
use a different branch.
And the second thing that I would mention is that you've seen some announcements that in some of the more rural
markets, we've actually been able to sell those branches and generate decent premiums as we've sold those. But in the
near term, we've got the plans through 5,000, and we'll continue to look to optimize based on the environment that
we're operating in.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: But it almost sounds like, based on the success that you've had that you outlined, that might
encourage you to take it a little bit further, or would that be reading too much into it?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: No, I think, if you look at page 12, you have to look at all the dynamics in there – so
deposits up $50 million from last year second quarter, the branch count down about 270, and the rate paid on deposits
from 19 basis points down to 12 basis points. But, importantly, we look at the mobile banking customer and look in the
uses behind that. So this is a matter of continuing to optimize, as you said, Guy, the distribution system, but it's going to
be led by the customer behavior change. In other words, we are seeing, because of our customer base and because of

our capabilities, like our online banking system is rated best in the business ninth year in a row and things like that, the
mobile banking systems gets great feedback from our customers seeing constant improvement, that our ability to do
this is still in front of us because we've got to watch the customer behavior and how we change.
There'll be some point where the core store level will probably settle in, but you're seeing it work through that if you sit
there and have 10% more deposits and 5% less branches 30% more mobile customers, that's a pretty good dynamic as
far as the expense base of the platform. And so we'll continue to optimize it, but it's going to be led by our customers.

We'll go next to the site of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is open.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Yeah, hi. I'm looking at the supplement on page 23 where you go through the consumer
real estate services, and looking down the column that says home lending, and year-to-date you have nearly $2 billion
of revenues, and only $94 million drops to the bottom line. And I'm wondering, is that lack of profitability some vagary
of segment accounting, or is it that the business is just – or is the business just kind of so marginally profitable, and if
so, then why be in it?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, the big thing there, Chris, is, remember, in the home loan space that the only
activity that's reflected within that is the front end or the origination side, as well as a small amount of the home equity
book that's held there. Keep in mind, relative to our peers, all of the servicing asset and the profitability that comes out
of the servicing asset for what I would characterize as the "good or current servicing" is all based within the Legacy
Assets & Servicing segment. So it's a little bit of apples to oranges relative to our peers as to how we report it.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Right, so I'm sorry, the servicing revenues are in the LAS?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: That's correct.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: And this is just origination?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Correct.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Okay. And is that kind of historically the norm, that origination is sort of a loss leader
almost?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I wouldn't say loss leader. You've got to do it to make some money, but the value tends to
be extracted through the servicing over time. But I think the reality is that we've been building this up and investing in
it, and as we reach a level to where the investment's paying us back, we still have a lot of efficiency to get in this
business, too, on the front end.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Okay. And then, overall, in terms of liquidity, it looked like your non-loan earning assets
were down by almost $40 billion this quarter. How much further do you suppose you can run those down as you reduce
your debt footprint?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Well, the liquidity, I think – let me go back, and you have to be careful with – are you
referring to – on the liquidity side, keep in mind, a big chunk, $18 billion of what you saw was a result of what we saw
in running down the debt footprint. And as we said, we've got $13 billion of maturities left in the balance of 2013 and
just under $40 billion during 2014. So we will continue to be a net reducer of our debt balances, and we'd expect that to
continue to benefit the net interest income line.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Okay, great. Thank you.

We'll move next to the site of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Great, thanks. Could you talk a little bit about whether you either have – it doesn't look
like it, but whether you have or are planning to retain mortgage loans in the second half of the year? And I've got a
follow-up question, too.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understood your first question.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Well, when you think about – you said in terms of the investment portfolio you'd be
cognizant of the AOCI impact. You could achieve a similar objective without that by retaining residential mortgages.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure. Okay. So we would expect – and if you look at during the quarter and you look at
the composition, and keep in mind, Moshe, that you do have loans repaid, but during the quarter, as it relates to the
origination activity that we had with our core clients, that there were about $13 billion of residential mortgage loans
that were originated through the core platform, roughly a third of which were through our wealth management area and
the balance through our CBB segment. So there is an origination of activity. And as I said, the investment portfolio is
there to invest the residual of what's used. There will be some incremental investments during the year, but I don't
think, in the aggregate, you should expect to see the overall level of securities balances change dramatically between
now and the end of the year.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Got it. And maybe, given that you've been ahead of or meeting, at least, regulatory capital
levels faster than some of your large peers, what are the areas that you think could benefit from incremental capital
investment or where they might be divesting? Are there any opportunities there?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: What we're focused on – and you've seen two different levels of activities amongst our
peers. You've seen some looking to deploy and to invest in those areas where there are things that are being sold. What
you're going to see us – and I think you see some of it as you look at our commercial loan activities – we're very much
focused, given the capital and liquidity that we've built, and using that capital and liquidity within our core customer
segments. And so when you look at that liquidity, if you look at our wealth management business, you'll see that the
loan balances were up $5 billion Q1 to Q2 because of what we're doing from a securities lending perspective and a
mortgage lending perspective.
You look at the commercial loan balances, and so they were up $10 billion. That's not from buying loans or doing
anything else. I do think, though, to your point, some of that comes from being able to lend where other people are
pulling back. So you're not going to see anything inorganic that we're doing. What you will see and what you should
expect of us is to continue to drive that growth in those customer areas where, because of the dynamics that you've
mentioned, other people may be doing less.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Okay.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: So if you link this question to the last question about the efficiency of the mortgage
business, year-over-year we've deployed about 5,000 people, about a 25% increase, to make sure we can close
mortgage on time and meet the demand of the customers. So, at the same time, the head count of the overall company
is down significantly, we've had that kind of investment go on. We have more commercial bankers today than we had a
year ago. We have more small business bankers, financial service advisors, branches, so we continue to make the
investment.
It's not really about capital, I think, because we still have so many loan portfolios that are running off that, if we replace
them, it'll be good core growth to replace them. It's more about expense dollars and redeploying them, and that's where
we make the judgments right now. And so the business of returning our cost of capital on the allocated capital which is
regulatory minimums or above, but it's really the question of where we put expense dollars, and that's where we're
focused on the core businesses we have the best opportunity.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: And so maybe just to follow up on that, Brian, do you have a number in mind as to how
much you would look to reinvest of the expense savings that you're generating?

<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: It's a net number, so we don't give you a number that doesn't take account. But for this
year, just to give you an example, we'll spend $1.1 billion in connection with the New BAC ideas, which are expense
revenue and improving our company basis that is on top of the $2.5 billion we spend otherwise in systems development
work, and that's pure systems development initiatives to help drive this company. So there's investment going in, but all
the numbers we give you are net of all the investments we're making. So we're giving a net number, but we are
investing significantly at the same time. And that was what Bruce and the management team set out a few years ago,
was we had to make sure we progressed the core franchise at the same time we brought the expense base and head
count down.

We'll go next to the site of Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Good morning.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Two questions for you. You've made gains in market share in mortgage, and you said that
you had stabilized the credit card. Are you going to be able to gain share in credit card, and how do you look to do that?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Well, I think we're in a position, Nancy, for the first time in a long while to – we've been
saying stabilizing credit card for a couple quarters because we've seen it settle in. We divested some portfolios, as you
know. We sized out of some of the business that we didn't find attractive. In this quarter we saw it increase for the first
time, I think, in almost five years. And so the team produced about 975,000 cards through the – new cards this quarter,
up from 950,000-ish last quarter. That is the multi-year high in production, I think, goes back to 2008. So we should see
this go on.
Now, you have activity levels you've got to be careful of in the summer and things like that, but overall, the baseline is
set now. That restructure portfolio which we've shown you guys, I think, started at $15 billion, $20 billion several years
ago and is now down to a few billion. So the underlying dynamics are there that we should be able to grow the business
and hold our share. And if you look over the last couple quarters, we're basically flattish share-wise and card balances a
little bit down, but in line with the peers. And so we feel good that we finally have reached this point after five years of
hard work of restructuring that business.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: So do you feel that – is it a business where you want to gain share, if you could just give
your overall philosophy on the credit card business right now?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: We will continue to drive share among our customers. We have low penetration in certain
segments and low usage of our cards in other segments, and so we're driving it through the three or four core products,
the Cash 1-2-3 product, for people that feel that's what they want in a card, through the Travel Rewards and other
rewards products, and we're seeing the cards come in through those core products, and we're driving them. And, yes,
we want to grow share in the context of our customers and in [ph] select (72:20) affinity teams that we work with
across the country.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: The second question I have is somewhat imprecise, and I apologize in advance. But I think
what everybody is waiting for with your stock and with the earnings outlook is for this massive deposit-gathering
network to get profitable. And we understand that that is a function of short rates going up. Is there an ideal – can you
walk us through this? Is there an ideal yield curve? Is there an absolute level of short rates? What do we have to see to
begin to see the branches get massively profitable?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Well, the first thing, to your point, if we look at, and if you go to the supplement, that
during the second quarter, the deposit segment within CBB did make $0.5 billion during the quarter. As we look
forward, though, more directly to your point, to the extent that the overall yield curve shifts up – and this is, once again,

in our first-quarter Q – that the benefit from a net interest income perspective, on a 100-basis-point parallel shift, as of
the end of the first quarter it was over $3.5 billion, the lion's share of which is going to flow through the consumer
segment. So, as it relates to where we are now, it is profitable. We've made almost $0.5 billion. We continue to
optimize and to reduce the expenses to make it more profitable. And you're correct; once rates go up, it will become
much more so.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: If I could just, finally, ask a corollary to that question – because of all the issues that you've
had in the past few years with closing branches, changing the branch models, several different programs to change the
retail footprint of the company, is there going to be a need, as rates go up, to give more of that benefit to your
customers? In other words, are you going to have to act differently in deposit pricing this time around than you have in
previous rate cycles?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think – Nancy, if you think about it, a lot of the adjustments we made on the fee side for
the general consumer customer have already been made, and I think the customers have benefited dramatically from
our position in how we – overdrafts and other types of fees. So I think that that will be – that is the – following off your
point, the payback to the customers. As deposit – as rates rise, we will meet the market and grow with the market, as
we've been doing. But, interestingly enough, you remember the constitution of our deposits, across the last three years,
we have run off a lot of CDs and other things which are not [ph] advantaged (75:11) products, and it's really become
more and more core every single quarter, and that will play to our benefit because transactional deposits, checking
accounts [ph] are (75:19) noninterest at this point, so as rates rise, there's no extra cost.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Thank you.

And we'll take our final question from the site of Mike Mayo from CLSA. Your line is open.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Good morning. I have three real small questions, and then one bigger question. What tax rate
should we assume to be normal?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: At this point, as we've said, 30% is a reasonable effective tax rate for the last two quarters
of the year, realizing that you need to add about $1.1 billion to that for the UK tax. And as we go into 2014 and 2015,
that 30% migrates into more of a 32%, 33% effective tax rate, based on what we think we will be earning as we go into
2014 and 2015.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right. And then, secondly, the GWIM margin of 28%, I'm just trying to compare that to the
old Merrill Lynch Wealth Management margin, and you have the Asset Management and U.S. Trust in there. Can you
just give us some estimate where that 28% margin would be? Would it be 26% or 25%?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Where it would be, I'm not sure, Mike, what...
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Excluding U.S. Trust and excluding Asset Management – in other words, just the pure
brokerage business, what kind of margin did that have? I'm trying to see if this is the highest brokerage margin ever,
perhaps, if you can go back to the old Merrill Lynch.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, we don't disclose the difference between – I think what you're asking is, is the
margin in U.S. Trust materially different than what it is in the traditional Merrill Lynch Wealth Management model.
And you should not assume that the margin improvement and the 28% is driven by a mix. Virtually all of that margin is
driven by, overall, what we're seeing within what you characterized as the traditional wealth management business of
Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay, thank you. And then as far as net interest income, you said you had a $300 million benefit
this quarter from the increase in the 10-year, so am I just doing the math right? You had $10.5 billion of net interest

income, so it added 3% just this last quarter, or really in the last month? It just seems like a lot. That's a nice benefit.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Well, keep in mind, Mike – and if you flip to slide nine, we show both the reported as
well as the actual number, and the reason why that increase in interest rates led to the improvement in NII is because
you need to adjust the way you look at premium securities when rates go up to reflect the slowdown in the rate at which
you'd expect to be paid back. So that is more of a life-of-loan type adjustment, and that's why it's $300 million. It's the
reason why we show you the number both ways.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. And then lastly, the legal expense came way down. You expect to stay around $500
million. But I'm still focused on the $8.5 billion settlement, and I go down to the courthouse in Lower Manhattan, and
what I think I hear – and again, correct my thinking – what I think I hear some lawyers say that Bank of New York
rubber-stamped the $8.5 billion agreement; therefore, throw the $8.5 billion deal out. And what I think I hear the Kathy
Patrick side say is, accept the $8.5 billion deal; it's the best economic alternative out there. So my question is: you have
$8.5 billion in reserves, the $8.5 billion settlement. Your disclosures say, if the judge does not approve the deal, your
reserves would go higher. So my question is how much higher would your reserves go if the judge does not approve the
deal, and what part of my logic would you like to, perhaps, correct?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: The first is that we're not going to comment on the ins and the outs on the $8.5 billion
because, as you know, technically, we're not a part of that. The second thing as it relates to that I would say is – and I
think if you go back and look at one of the comments that was made, we accrued the $8.5 billion assuming that all 424
trusts were at the point where they got to the 25% to where there was a negotiation. So, at this point, to comment
whether or not we think the reserves would be higher or they could be lower is really not appropriate because, right
now, there's an $8.5 billion settlement that's going through the process, we've accrued based on what 22 of the largest
investors said was a fair deal, and as you know, when we set up the reserves, we applied that same methodology to a
variety of our other exposures. And to speculate or comment before then, given where we are in this, I just don't think
is appropriate, Mike.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Sure. I think, last quarter, you thought it would all be wrapped up by now. Any sense of when
this might be wrapped up, when you might have this behind you?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I'm not sure that we ever said that we thought it would be wrapped up in the second
quarter. What we do know is what you know now, given how you've followed the case, that I believe that there's a
court schedule set up through the 26th of July. It's not clear whether or not it will be wrapped up by the 26th or it will
go beyond that, and we'll have to see how the process unfolds.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right, thank you.
Bruce R. Thompson
Thank you. And I believe at this point that we're through all the questions, so thank you very much for joining us this
morning, and we'll look forward to talking to you next quarter
