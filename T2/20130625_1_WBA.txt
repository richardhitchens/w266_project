Now, I'll turn the call over to Greg.
Gregory D. Wasson
Thank you, Rick. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call. Today, I'll begin with the
highlights of our results for the quarter. Second, I'll update the steps we're taking to improve our daily living business,
expand our role in the changing healthcare system, and advance our long-term strategic growth drivers. Then, I'll turn
the call over to Wade for a more in-depth look at our results and key considerations for the remainder of the year. We
recognize our business has become more complex with a number of moving parts, and we do want to help you get to
the underlying performance of our business, as we remain confident in our long-term strategic direction.
Starting with their financial results, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $0.85 and GAAP diluted EPS of
$0.65. In the quarter, along with Alliance Boots, we announced a strategic long-term relationship with
AmerisourceBergen, one of the largest pharmaceutical supply chain companies in America. Through this relationship,
we have formed a collaborative integrative wholesale/retail model here in the U.S. with a 10-year comprehensive
primary distribution agreement for our branded and generic products. Combined with our partnership with Alliance
Boots, Europe's leading fully integrated wholesale/retail model, we are now best positioned to drive efficiency and
innovation throughout the entire pharmaceutical supply chain, harnessing the benefits of global sourcing and making it
easier for manufacturers to bring products to market and providing patients with better access to healthcare. Cash flow
from operations was $1.4 billion, with $1.1 billion in free cash flow, which is one of our strongest quarters for both.
Earlier this month, we launched the Boots No7 men's product line in more than 5,000 stores across the country. We've
already introduced, with great success, the No7 women's skincare line and other Boots products in four of our flagship
locations, with more expansion planned. And, finally, our joint synergy program with Alliance Boots is meeting our
expectations. We're on track to deliver $125 million to $150 million in combined synergies, compared to our previous
target of $100 million to $150 million.
Now, let me walk through our quarterly results on a GAAP and a non-GAAP adjusted basis. Sales came in at $18.3
billion, up 3.2% from the same quarter a year ago. GAAP operating income for the quarter was $991 million, up 13.5%
from $873 million for the same period last year. Non-GAAP adjusted operating income for the quarter was $1.2 billion,
up 22.9% from just over $1 billion in third quarter 2012. GAAP net earnings for the quarter were up 16.2% from $537
million or $0.62 per diluted share last year to $624 million or $0.65 per diluted share. The non-GAAP adjusted net
earnings for this quarter were a record $812 million or $0.85 per diluted share, compared to adjusted net earnings of
$628 million or $0.72 per diluted share in the same quarter last year.
Turning to trends in gross profit dollars and SG&A dollars; in the third quarter, on a GAAP basis, our gross profit
dollar growth increased 4.1% or $208 million from a year ago. SG&A dollar growth increased 5.3% or $221 million
compared to a year ago. Now, on a non-GAAP basis, adjusted gross profit dollar growth increased $268 million, or
5.3% year-over-year. Non-GAAP adjusted SG&A dollar growth was up $182 million, or 4.5%. During the quarter, the
rate of growth in adjusted FIFO gross profit dollars exceeded adjusted SG&A dollar growth by 80 basis points. As you
can see, this was the first positive spread in six quarters and we're pleased that this is moving in the right direction.
Now, let me update our progress on the three key strategic growth drivers we put in place last year to position our
company for long-term growth and value creation. First, on creating a Well Experience; while we're seeing several
positive indicators in our daily living business such as increases in customer delight, basket size and gross margins, our
front-end sales and traffic are still not up to our expectations. Now, there are certainly factors that affected our results
this quarter. As with other retailers, the weather had a negative impact on seasonal sales in the third quarter. We also
continue to face a soft economy, especially in our lower-income communities where our stores on a comp basis are
performing on average below our stores in middle or higher income neighborhoods.
That said, we're taking steps to balance our investment in sales and margin. We're focused on a clear three-point plan.
First, we're making further adjustments to our pricing and promotions, implementing a number of meaningful changes

to our weekly ad. As you know, we began those changes in mid-May, and you'll see more throughout the fourth
quarter. We're applying what we're learning from our Balance Rewards program to ensure we have the items that are
most relevant to our customers in both assortment and price to meet their daily living needs.
Second, we're focused on maximizing the value of our Balance Rewards program. With 75 million people signed up,
we're turning our focus from enrollment to redemption and rewards. For example, as shoppers earn points, we're
highlighting the dollar value of points earned in both our stores and in our circulars.
Third, we're enhancing our store segmentation to better meet the local needs and preferences of our communities,
whether they're in the inner city, suburbs, or rural communities. We're customizing our advertising circular according to
individual community needs, especially in the hardest hit communities where our customers are working hard to stretch
their paychecks. We are also working to ensure we have the right products and targeted promotions in our communities
across the country.
I can assure you that improving our front-end is a high priority, and I am confident that the teams' plans will strengthen
performance and drive profitable growth over time. In fact, we're beginning to see just that. We reported a positive
front-end comp this quarter, with progress over the previous quarter. We're also beginning to see sequential
improvements in market share over recent periods.
Finally, our flagship locations continue to give us a platform for innovation and to showcase the best of our brand. This
quarter, we opened flagship stores in the Empire State Building in New York City, Washington, D.C., Boston, and San
Francisco, bringing our total to 10 across the country.
Now, turning to our second strategic growth driver: transforming the role of community pharmacy; here, we're
beginning to hit on all cylinders. Our script comp for the quarter was 7.1%, compared to 5.7% in the second quarter.
We gained 80 basis points in market share, from 18.4% to 19.2%. 90-day prescriptions continue to grow, increasing
19% year-over-year, while IMS continued to report slowing growth of mail. All this comes in an environment where
physician visits are down 2.7% year-over-year in May according to JPMorgan's monthly tracker and this follows
year-over-year declines February through April.
With that said, we're positioned extremely well to continue driving market share and profitable growth. First, we now
have long-term contracts with predictable rates in place with many of the major commercial payers in the market.
Second, we're capitalizing on our preferred position in Med D plans. Our increase in Medicare Part D volume has
exceeded the market every month since January. And, with 10,000 people turning 65 every day and signing up for
coverage, we have tremendous opportunity to continue growing our volume over time. Third, with healthcare reform
moving forward, Walgreens – with our 8,000 locations and 70,000 healthcare professionals – is increasingly well
positioned to meet the growing demand for convenient, affordable non-emergency care.
During this quarter, we announced that most of our more than 370 Take Care Clinics now offer an expanded scope of
healthcare services. These new services include diagnosis, treatment, and management for hypertension, diabetes, high
cholesterol, and asthma as well as additional preventative health services. We're also moving forward with expanded
plans to play a central role in emerging care models such as accountable care organizations. With our leading role in
three ACOs and our strategy to service many others, patients, providers and payers are recognizing the value of
community pharmacy as part of the solution to meet the triple aim of improving the patient experience, driving better
health outcomes, and lowering overall healthcare costs.
Regarding our third strategic growth driver – establishing an efficient global platform – we're pleased with the progress
we're making with our strategic partnerships with Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen, which collectively are
creating an unmatched global pharmacy supply chain.
First, on AmerisourceBergen, our teams are on track to ensure a smooth transition of our branded goods distribution on
September 1st and the transition of generics over the next 12 months. With these relationships, we're piloting new
delivery models with our stores to optimize frequency and putting in place new inventory management processes and
metrics to improve local assortments.

Second, as I mentioned, we're meeting our expectations for Alliance Boots synergies. We're on course to deliver $125
million to $150 million in combined first year synergies. Alliance Boots contributed $0.10 per diluted share to our
adjusted results this quarter and we expect the contribution to be $0.08 per diluted share to fourth quarter adjusted
results.
Finally, we're pleased with Alliance Boots' performance in their fiscal 2013. As I am sure you saw, trading profit was
up 7.4% in constant currency. Underlying profit after tax was up 12.7%. Cash generated from operations was £1.6
billion and they reduced their net borrowings by £1.1 billion pounds.
So, summing up, we have worked hard over the past year to crystallize our strategies and ensure we have the growth
drivers in place to support long-term value creation for Walgreens and our shareholders. We're now focused on the
execution that will propel both day-to-day performance in the short term and the growth we expect over the next two to
three years.
Thank you, and let me turn the call over to Wade.
Wade D. Miquelon
Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. This morning I will take you
through our quarterly results as well as update you on our investment in Alliance Boots.
As Greg noted earlier, for the quarter we reported a GAAP EPS of $0.65 per diluted shares based on 959 million
shares. This GAAP EPS bridged to the adjusted EPS of $0.85 for the quarter is illustrated by this chart with a LIFO
provision of $0.08 per share; acquisition-related items of $0.12 per share consisting of $0.05 of acquisition-related
amortization costs, $0.02 of acquisition-related costs, and $0.05 for the Alliance Boots Step 1 related tax deferral.
Special items netted to zero cents per share with $0.05 related to the DEA settlement, offset by the $0.05 related to the
warrants issued by AmerisourceBergen.
As you can see, the settlement with the DEA we announced earlier this month is treated as a special item. This
settlement reflects the final reserve accrual as well as some tax impacts related to the terms of the final settlement.
Looking back on the first two quarters of fiscal 2013, prior accruals related to this matter had an adverse impact of
around $0.03 per share in Q2 and certain litigation matters, including an accrual related to the DEA matter, and had a
positive net impact of around $0.02 per share in Q1. These items reflected in both our reported GAAP and adjusted
earnings in the first two quarters and were not treated as special items.
Let me now provide more detail on our comparable store sales for the quarter. Comp prescription sales increased 2%.
Comp front-end sales increased 0.4%. Total comp sales increased 1.4%. And comp prescriptions filled increased 7.1%
versus a script comp of negative 9.1% in the year-ago period. With respect to our front-end, in the third quarter the
front-end comp increased 0.4% and traffic decreased by 3.9% while basket size increased by 4.4%. We achieved stable
front-end margins in the challenging promotional environment.
As Greg discussed prior, moving toward, we are increasing our ads and promotional focus concurrent with other
initiatives intended to increase store traffic. Still, we will continue to work to strike the optimum balance between sales
and profitable growth as our underlying front-end business continues to make progress.
Looking at comp store script numbers, our retail comp scripts were up 7.1%. This continues to reflect the fundamentals
of our underlying business, our win back of Express Scripts customers, and our continued progress in winning new
Medicare Part D customers.
Turning now to margin. Our FIFO gross margin was 29.2% in the current quarter compared to 28.6% last year, a 60
basis point improvement. Pharmacy margins increased as a result of the ongoing impact from generics and the increase
was partially offset by market reimbursement pressure and the continued growth of our 90-day retail program. The
front end was positively impacted by candy, non-prescription drugs and personal care categories, which is partially
offset by costs associated with points earned from the Balance Rewards program.

Taking a look at our longer-term FIFO gross margin trends, this quarter's 60 basis point improvement was up against a
30 basis point increase a year ago. The continuing generic wave, which temporarily peaked last quarter, was the
primary driver of margin lift in this quarter. Moving forward, we expect margins to be negatively impacted by a trough
in the generic wave expected to continue to the latter half of fiscal year 2014 when we expect to experience another
peak in the wave, albeit smaller than the fiscal year 2013's peak. And again, as I mentioned, the front end was slightly
positive for the quarter.
Margins may also be impacted as we become more aggressive with our new promotion and price initiatives to drive
traffic and front end comps. As I will illustrate in a few minutes and as we have stated on many occasions, we are more
focused on driving gross profit dollar growth than margin growth.
This chart illustrates our two-year stacked SG&A dollar growth trends on a GAAP basis for the last nine quarters. Now
let's review the trends on an adjusted basis. Two-year stacked adjusted SG&A trends improved versus a year ago with
2.3% growth in the third quarter of 2013, down from 5.1% last year. This is certainly the lowest two-year stacked we
have had in recent history.
To get to adjusted SG&A dollar growth, you can see that our reported SG&A dollar growth was 5.3%, which included
60 basis points of the DEA legal settlement and 20 basis points of acquisition-related costs. Backing these out resulted
in adjusted SG&A dollar growth of 4.5%. Shown here are the SG&A dollar growth trends for the past seven quarters
on a GAAP basis. And a follow-on slide shows the trends on an adjusted basis. As I mentioned earlier, the adjusted
SG&A dollar growth for the quarter was 4.5% year-over-year increase versus the 2.2% decrease in the third quarter of
fiscal 2012.
Looking at adjusted SG&A dollar growth on a two-year stacked basis, as you can see there was a 560 basis point
sequential step-down from the second quarter of 2013. We are pleased with the SG&A dollar growth in the quarter,
especially given the very tough compare in the year-ago period when we were not an Express Scripts pharmacy
network.
Transitioning out of gross profit, this slide illustrates our quarterly gross profit dollar growth trends for the past seven
quarters on a GAAP basis. Adjusted gross profit dollar growth increased from positive 4% in the first quarter of 2013
to a positive 5.3% in the third quarter of 2013. The positive trend in the adjusted gross profit dollar growth is a result of
the underlying strength of the business combined with the generic drug benefit. On a two-year stacked basis, gross
profit dollar growth stepped down sequentially as we lapped the 2.5% decrease in the prior year's third quarter when we
were out of Express Scripts network. Also recall that the second quarter benefited from stronger generic wave in an
unusually strong flu season.
Now looking more broadly at our income statement, this quarter included the LIFO provision of $120 million versus
$60 million a year ago, driven primarily by significantly higher prescription drug inflation in the quarter. Our effective
LIFO rate for the year was 3.5%, up from 2.5% a year ago. Net interest expense was $50 million, up from $17 million a
year ago. And the increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to the $4 billion note issued in association with
the Alliance Boots transaction, but it also includes a $7 million non-cash expense from a fair market value adjustment
to the company's outstanding interest rate swaps. Our effective tax rate was 38.7% versus 37.2% last year, primarily
due to the non-deductible nature of the DEA settlement.
Average diluted shares outstanding were 959 million shares versus 865 million shares last year. The change is due to a
combination of the impact of the 83.4 million shares issued due to the Alliance Boots investments and the impact of a
higher stock price on the in-the-money options counted in diluted shares. This options impact increased our diluted
share count sequentially by 5.6 million shares in the third quarter.
In order to give some perspective on Q4, please note the following; we expect the LIFO provision in the fourth quarter
to be approximately $85 million. We expect net interest expense to be $57 million to $60 million including the negative
impact of $16 million from a non-cash fair market value adjustment to the company's outstanding interest rate swap.
Based on the swap accounting treatment we put in place in 2009, when we first swapped our $1.3 billion notes to
floating, we are now reserving the positive accounting impact that has gradually offset interest expense over the past

four years. We are very pleased with our hedging strategy as the fixed and floating swaps on our $1.3 billion notes have
generated over $100 million in pre-tax cash savings since 2009.
Going forward, our true cash interest expense will benefit from our planned repayment of $1.3 billion in notes in
August. We expect the effective tax rate to be about 38% and note our adjusted rate is anticipated to be better due to
both the DEA impact as well as the adjustments for Alliance Boots benefit not captured by our effective GAAP rate.
And finally, we expect the diluted shares outstanding to remain around 950 million shares but, as mentioned, it is
subject to the impact of changes in our share price.
And lastly, please keep in mind that we provide monthly sales on the third business day of each month, so we kindly
ask you to remember to update your models for actual sales at the end of each quarter. Cash and cash equivalents were
$3 billion in the third quarter versus $2 billion a year ago. $1.3 billion of this cash is earmarked to retire outstanding
debt due in August 2013. Net working capital decreased by 2% versus year ago. Accounts receivable increased by
5.4% while accounts payable increased 2.2%. And LIFO inventories were down 1.8% and FIFO inventories were up
2.9% year-over-year versus a sales growth of 3.2%.
During the third quarter, we generated $1.4 billion in cash from operations versus $1.9 billion a year ago. Free cash
flow in the quarter was $1.1 billion versus $1.5 billion a year ago. And roughly $300 million of this year-on-year
difference was driven by the timing shift in our annual profit share plan payment. As a company, I think you can see we
remain very focused on cash flow.
Let me transition now to our accretion to adjusted EPS for the quarter as a result of our partnership with Alliance
Boots. The third quarter accretion was $0.10 per share, which fell two to three pennies short of the $0.12 to $0.13 range
we forecast last quarter. To be clear, we are very pleased with both the operational performance of Alliance Boots and
the combined synergies we are achieving. As noted, this shortfall is due to a number of non-fundamental factors,
primarily the greater than expected impact of IFRS to GAAP conversions.
We now expect the accretion for the fourth quarter to be about $0.08 per share, which is less than our prior guidance of
$0.09 to $0.10 per share with the primary difference driven by the foreign currency translation impact of a slightly
weakened pound relative to the dollar in our initial forecast. Consequently, we now estimate the adjusted EPS accretion
for the year to be $0.16 rather than the previous estimate of $0.18 to $0.22, primarily for the reasons I just outlined.
Shifting to our quarterly Alliance Boots accretion walk; as shown, we realized $28 million before tax and synergies
during the third quarter and $25 million after-tax. Amortization adjustments amounted to $3 million for the deal
amortization and $13 million for brand amortization. After-tax Alliance Boots equity earnings were $131 million for
the third quarter on a GAAP basis. On an adjusted basis, the income from Alliance Boots investment was $147 million
as noted and the incremental after-tax expense to Walgreens was $13 million. After the impact of share dilution, the
accretion equaled $0.10 in the third quarter.
I'd like to close by reviewing our fiscal 2016 goals: $130 billion of combined revenue, $8.5 billion to $9 million of
combined operating income, $9 billion to $9.5 billion of combined adjusted operating income, $8 billion of combined
operating cash flow, a total synergy goal of $1 billion, and $11 million of combined net debt, all by 2016.
When analyzing 2016 revenue, adjusted operating income and cash flow goals and netting the impact of our stated
combined synergy goal of $1 billion, combined CAGRs from the base year of 2012 to our goal year of 2016 would
need to be 5% for revenue, 9% for adjusted operating income, and 4% for cash flow in order to reach our goals. To the
extent we end up exceeding or falling short of our combined synergy goals, the CAGR required to meet our 2016 goals
will be impacted accordingly.
With respect to synergies, we are off to a good start in our 2016 goals and, as we noted earlier, we are narrowing the
range of combined synergies for the fiscal year 2013 to $125 million to $150 million from the previous range to $100
million to $150 million. Each of the six primary synergy work streams are producing results, and we are confident we
are on the right track to now meet our fiscal year 2014 synergy objectives.

Also recall that Alliance Boots retired $1.7 billion in debt in their fiscal year ended March 2013, exceeding their goal of
$1 billion. And as I mentioned earlier, we are planning to retire $1.3 billion in Walgreens debt in August. As we
progress, once a year on a quarterly earnings call, we plan on going into a deeper dive on our 2016 goals with respect to
our progress, our risks and opportunities across each of these measures.
We remain confident with respect to our strategic long-term relationship with AmerisourceBergen as well, and our core
work streams are progressing and are on track. In addition to the planned domestic supply, sourcing and international
opportunities and benefits, we continue to identify areas where all three partners can work together to build on
capabilities and competencies.
Now in closing, let me share a few final thoughts. I realize that in the past few years we've made several strategic and
transformational moves that at time make our company more than challenging to model. Having said that, I'd like to
talk a bit about how we think about our business. At a strategic level, we have continued to refine our journey across
three key planks and several related initiatives that we expect to greatly enhance our customer experience, allow us to
participate profitably and more broadly in the challenging healthcare landscape and let fully leverage efficiency and
scale all the while.
The groundbreaking and transformational partnerships enhance these strategies, and we believe will enable us to unlock
significant value and competitive advantage. Still, I believe we are just scratching the surface of what we can do
working together longer term across both the supply chain as well as across geographies. Now it all comes down to
executing with excellence as we effectively balance both the long- and short-term. I'm sure we'll have some ups and
downs along the way, but we remain very confident in our long-term strategies and prospects.
I want to thank you again for your kind attention and support and now I'd like to turn the call back over to Rick.

Thank you, Wade. That concludes our prepared remarks. We're now ready to take questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Great. Thanks very much, and good morning. I just had a couple of questions on the generic side.
So, Wade, I heard you talk about the $125 million to $150 million of synergies. Can you talk about where you are in
this new JV purchasing as far as contracting with the manufacturers and how much of the synergies are coming from
that side, would be by first question. And then secondly, I think, Greg, you talked about market pressure and
reimbursement but on the other hand you also talked about long-term contracts. Where are you seeing the market
pressure on reimbursement today? Is that coming from Medicaid? Is it coming from the commercial market? How
should we think about that?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Okay. So I guess I'll hit the JV first. The JV is up and fully running and operating. We have
our two Presidents, Jeff Berkowitz and John Donovan, who are working – one of the key work streams that's residing
there is our generics and we're off to a very good start. Without giving information that we consider too competitively
sensitive, I guess what I would say is that given the scope and breadth of what we're doing together, I think we're
working with most of the key manufacturers already in terms of understanding how we can bring volume benefit
through better long-term planning and create, I'd say, a real win-win.
I think that win-win comes just again because of the size and scale and breadth of the business that we can do with all
the key partners that want to partner with us. But we're off to a good start. It is a significant part of our early synergies
and, as I said before, we expect it to be a significant part of the going ones as well.

And, Greg, I'll let you comment on...
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yeah, Lisa, on the market pressure and reimbursement, I guess I don't think that there's
any one segment that we're seeing. I think we're seeing reasonable reimbursement pressure and focus from any payer
whether it's government, commercial, on controlling cost. I think certainly as Medicaid in some states move from state
Medicaid to managed Medicaid, you certainly see some movement there. But when we look at those commercial
arrangements, as we have in the past, we look at the individual plan and we look at all the variables, whether it's days
of supply, generic utilization rate, we make our decisions. But I don't think that there's any one area that we would call
out. I think that we're just seeing continued as-expected focus on healthcare costs from all payers.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: And, Greg, just to follow up on that really quickly on Medicaid, if we think about the initial impact
of the Affordable Care Act, we would expect it's primarily going to come from Medicaid expansion. Can you talk about
if that's primarily where it comes from, do you have excess capacity in your stores today so that even if the
reimbursement rate is a little bit lower with Medicaid that you're going to be able to lever that incremental volume and
it should be still a positive as we move into calendar 2014 for Walgreens?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Well, Lisa, I don't know if I'd really take it down to the variable labor perspective. But I
think with movement from growing Medicaid, whether it's managed or state, again, I think that we look at that as we
have any commercial arrangement. And some of those it depends on the market share in the state that we're in, it
depends on – as I said earlier, a lot of these with more and more folks coming into Medicaid population that are
conducive to, say, 90-day supplies of chronic medications, there's opportunities for us to work with states in ways we
haven't in the past, there's ways to work with them to drive adherence. So I don't think that it's really whether we have
the capacity to make it work. I think it's really focusing on the reimbursement and the value we bring to begin with.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: And, Lisa, one last thing I'd say is just bundling the two together, apart from making sure
that we have the most effective cost buying structure, with respect to things that are happening that we're doing, like
driving 90-day, which is I think you can see is really accelerating in terms of some of the automation that's happening
with respect to our stores and streamlining of the processes as well as things like e-prescribe. We'll continue to find
ways to be more efficient and effective on all aspects of cost, which will allow us to play more broadly in expansion of
healthcare and beyond.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Okay, great. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Tom Gallucci>: Thank you very much. Thanks for all the color. I guess my first question was just sort of on the
front-end. You mentioned some of the pricing and promotional strategies that you're sort of adjusting. Can you remind
us what you're doing there and sort of the impact that we should see as you mentioned on the call, sort of gross profit
dollars versus gross profit margins?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yeah, Tom, Greg. Certainly we're focused on, as we've said several times, on gross profit
dollars versus margin and I think what we're beginning to do, and we talked a little bit probably on last call, is trying to
strike the right balance between price and promotion. I think, as we talked about, we made a strategic shift when we
rolled out our Balance Rewards program to shift some of our promotional effort and focus from our roto, primarily our
print circular, to more digital and Balance Rewards. I think that absolutely was the right strategic move for us to make.
Along the way, I think we probably got a little less promotional in that Sunday circular. So what we're doing is we're
really focused – based on some of the data that we're getting and insights from our Balance Rewards program to make
sure we've got the right items at the right price in that circular to drive comp and traffic. This is something you want to
tweak that dial ever so slightly, and we feel that we're making the right adjustments and we're beginning to gain some
momentum. We want to continue to do that in our Sunday circular and utilize our Balance Rewards program to

continue to move that in the right direction.
<Q - Tom Gallucci>: Okay. My other question was on the pharmacy side. With respect to specialty, not so much in the
quarter but obviously all we hear from payers out there is troubles with the specialty trend that are only going to get
worse over time. So can you just update us on your latest initiative on the specialty side? So your growth expectations
and maybe some of the unique things that you think you're doing in the marketplace in that area?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yeah. Great question. I think that we have a great position to begin to provide more value
to both patients, payers, and pharmaceutical companies as we go forward. We think that our differentiating model
allows us to focus on what we would call specialty retail to make sure that patients are indeed eligible to pickup and
receive specialty medications from their retail pharmacists that they've been using for years. AmerisourceBergen, the
relationship we have with daily deliveries will help us drive that even greater. We have a central facility that will allow
us to either mail to stores or mail directly to the patient's home based on where they'd like it. We're really driving
sophistication there.
And finally, our infusion business, we think, is truly a differentiator for us because as more payers look for a single
solution for the pipeline of drugs that are coming out that are either going to be injectable or infused, we think that
looking for a one-stop solution that we can offer will help us win in the marketplace. We're working with – the last
thing I'd say is our – Jeff Berkowitz and our team that's focused on bringing solutions to the pharmaceutical partners
that we have are really working with them in ways to help them launch and drive the value that they're looking for with
their specialty products.
<Q - Tom Gallucci>: Okay.

Our next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Hi. So two things. So, Greg, when you think about getting the front-end traffic back.
Digging into that a little deeper, how confident are you – traffic is fairly negative, you obviously don't want to do 12
packs of Coke for two bucks because that really doesn't accomplish that much. How confident are you you can do that
in a relatively – get back closer to flat in a relatively quick period of time without hurting gross unnecessarily? And do
you think it's sort of a trial here? Maybe you go a little too far, hit gross a little bit and then have to bring it back or you
think you can manage it in a more consistent way than that?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yeah, John, it's a great question, and as I've said several times, that's the balance of retail,
right? I think our approach, as I said, is going to be a prudent approach to investing where it makes sense in order to get
the results we're looking for traffic and comp. We're focused on gross profit dollars, as I said.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Yeah.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: And I think the adjustments we began to make with our circular in mid-May – as I said,
we're beginning to make progress. I want to continue to take the approach we're talking about. I'm extremely confident
that we will continue to make progress and gain momentum in that trend for several reasons.
I think our folks are doing the right things with the circular. They're making the right adjustments. As I said, we have a
lot of insights now a year into the Balance Rewards which helps us do a better job of understanding what should we be
putting in the front page and back page of that circular at what price to be able to drive profitable sales.
And then also with 75 million members now enrolled in Balance Rewards and the insight we have, we're able to now
strategically drive promotions through Balance Rewards to drive traffic and sales as well.
And then the third point is, and it's interesting, I think we have, as you know, a lot of our stores are located in
underserved or lower income communities. And one of the things that we've done extremely well in the past and we
want to enhance is making sure that we're tailoring our merchandising mix, our price and promotion to those stores. All

those are in motion, I think we've got a great plan, great team, and it's all about executing. And I'm confident we can do
that.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: And then secondly, if you look at SG&A run rate, up 4.5% adjusted, you've got a lot of the
ESRX business back. Are we sort of steady state now where whatever you're going that add back you've added back
and that's kind of a steady state run rate going forward? Or is there more yet to head back?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: No. I think I'd say that because you're cycling sort of an unusual base period, it looks
choppy, but in terms of how we run our business I'd say we're pretty steady state. And we run algorithms every day to
understand the incremental volume, scripts et cetera that we have and how to tweak labor up or down accordingly. Also
as we cycle Express Scripts, we have things like a little beefier profit sharing and things like that that are in the
underlying base that are just structural and the right thing to do, but the fact it gets washed through. But I think you're
seeing in our to our two-year stack right now, I would say really just a lot of great effort and focus on SG&A control.
And that's not going to change. I think moving forward to be effective and hit our goals in anyone to be successful is
going to have to have a relentless focus not only on the customer but also on the cost side.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Okay, thanks.

Our next question comes from Ajay Jain with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your lines open.
<Q - Ajay Kumar Jain>: Hi. Good morning. I wanted ask about your front-end performance as well. I think there's
been some mention in the past that there was maybe a more margin-driven promotional strategy from last year, which
you've – it looks like you've fully cycled at this point. So just based on the loyalty card and the high level of enrollment
that you have now with the Balance Reward card, when do you expect to start getting the customer insights through the
loyalty card that would have the effective increasing customer traffic and higher average ticket?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yeah, Ajay, as I said on the earlier question, I think the good things were getting those
insights now. And that's why we're so excited about having 75 million people already enrolled and the reason now we
can begin to not only drive enrollment but really focus on the effectiveness of that program. The insights that we're
getting are frankly just incredible and will allow us to get more efficiency out of our marketing dollars and our
promotional dollars. So we're getting those insights and the data now to help us continue to drive traffic in a prudent
and a reasonable way.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Just a couple of factoids, already about 60% and growing of our purchases made in store
are now with the card. We are seeing a significantly bigger basket of those that have a card versus all others. Now the
key will be as we move forward call it longitudinally to make their baskets bigger than they were prior, and that's the
work to be done. So I think as Greg said, in the end, the magic comes from redemption and building critical mass,
critical points and being able to use that as a lever so people can really understand the currency and the value of it is the
next phase that we're just now moving into.
<Q - Ajay Kumar Jain>: And just as a related question I'm assuming that there is some derivative impact on front-end
due to the legacy issues with Express Scripts. So do you think it's reasonable to expect that we're going see some
improvement in front-end when you anniversary the new Express Scripts agreement in a couple of months?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yeah, I mean I think as we've also said before every day, we are kind of moving forward in
getting more and more Express Scripts customers back. I think that trend is going to continue, and so I think those two
to some small degree will go hand in hand as well.
<Q - Ajay Kumar Jain>: Okay, thank you.

Our next question comes from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks a lot. Just a little more detail if we could about the components of the change in the
Alliance Boots accretion. I know you spoke about the IFRS and then FX, any way this sort of disaggregate those
impacts and quantify them?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Sorry, Matt, could you clarify again the question?
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Sure. Just if you could – if you think about the reduction in the guidance for Alliance
Boots, if you could quantify how much is attributed to each of the drivers that you identified?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yeah, there's roughly $0.02 in this quarter, thereabouts, which is just IFRS to GAAP
conversions, and again, a lot of it until you really get into it and understand things like how the leases actually work,
their kind of retirement programs, et cetera. You just don't know until you get into it. So that's $0.02 in the quarter.
Next quarter is roughly about $0.01 of currency. Again I think it's about a $1.52 versus the $1.58 in the pound. But I
think you've seen from their annual results that they've had a – all things considered in a tough environment, a very
successful year in trading profit and underlying profit are really two measures that they're focused on.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Got it. And just one other follow up kind of a high-level strategic question. I know we've
spoken a bit about the Balance Rewards program already. If you think about sort of its net economic impact since
launch and when you would expect the program to start to deliver, earnings benefits in aggregate in your view, is there
any way to kind of identify the timing if you could simplify it down to that level?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: I mean, I guess I'd put it this way, because you never really know until you get there. But
we were in pretty heavy investment phase last year not only from the systems but also in terms of just the employees
signing up between 100 and 200 people per store per day and the effort that takes. And all the while people start
building points but until they actually have enough to redeem, you can't really use it as a lever. It's more of just kind of
an investment from that point of view. We've now got critical mass of people enrolled, critical mass of points, we also
have critical mass of what I would call data analytics and insight.
So I think as we move forward here, we should just get progressively better. I'd also say that the way we executed it,
which was, as I like to say, we put teeth into it by making sure to get our discounts and promotions you need to have
the card. In effect, it's sort of a two-tier pricing system, which allows us to generate incremental funds to invest even
more heavily in the people that are truly our most valuable and most loyal customers. And so, economically, I'd say
from that point of view it's a positive. But I think really the real heart of it kind of starts about now.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: And, Matt, maybe I'll – I think there's two ways to look at Balance Rewards. The insights
and the data that we are capturing now with the 75 million people is helping us make adjustments that drive even more
relevancy with our circular, the way we merchandise our stores, et cetera. We're beginning to use that data now. The
second part would be, as consumers begin to understand the value of the currency and the points, then we begin to get
the traffic and the basket and the trips that we want to begin to see out of it. So we're already – to your question, we're
already beginning to use a lot of the data and the insights to drive decisions across our entire system.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Ross Muken with ISI Group. Your line is open.

flow-through. The comments that you made in terms of being back to 2014, I'm assuming that's your fiscal year versus
the calendar. So maybe talk a bit about how that differential works and where you're focused in terms of what's going
to be a bigger contributor from a category perspective or maybe from a specific launch perspective.
<A - Kermit R. Crawford>: So, Ross, this is Kermit. Let me – what I would tell you is that, as we look at our fiscal
year, our second quarter our generics peaked in our fiscal year. Certainly, we're going to see a trough in the third and
fourth quarters as Greg said but we anticipate it coming back up in Q4. We did – we have said in the past that 2013
would be better than 2012. We consistently are seeing 2013 better than 2012 and somewhat a little bit better than 2014.
<Q - Ross J. Muken>: And maybe just on the traffic piece again, I don't mean to beat a dead horse but, if you look at
the components of it in terms of the declines, if you look at in terms of what you've strategically done to improve
margins and what percentage impact you think that's had versus just the impact of maybe the Express lag or anything
else going on in the business, is there any way even quantitatively you can compartmentalize how you would think
about that metric just so we can assume, as we start lapping it, what traffic could look like on the upswing?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yeah, I'll give you a rough feel. This will probably be close but not perfect. It's hard to
understand exactly what's happening. But, if you think about that 400-basis-point traffic step-down we've had over the
past year, which is now starting to improve, I'd say that a couple of things have happened. Number one is with Express
Scripts probably between 50 and 100 basis points of traffic. As you know, it's not one for one; there's a number of trips.
But that's the range that we have seen. And so, as the customers come back, we see some benefit but it's in proportion
to that. The second thing is the promotional shift we had, which I think was for the right reasons, to keep moving
money into more strategic marketing mix like loyalty, equity-building campaigns. Probably it was around 200 to 250
points. And, again from a profit point of view, I think the team did a great job of holding margins but it wasn't as many
hot items at cost or below but we did see that shift. And then the last piece is roughly almost 100 basis points of traffic
from cigarettes and I said the primary driver there was we saw of 15,000 to 20,000 dollar stores introduce cigarettes.
We haven't seen outside the cigarette category much hit, if any at all, versus any other competitors in the other
categories but I would say that, from a traffic driver, we did see something there. So that's how we break it down.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yeah. And the only other bucket I'd probably add and I hate to because I'm a three-bucket
guy, but the fourth would be weather-related economic and certainly we'll come around that but I think Wade did a
great job breaking it down.
<Q - Ross J. Muken>: And maybe just one last one. You guys have obviously done a lot of interesting strategic things
in the space of the last 12, 24 months. Now, with the relationship with Alliance Boots and Amerisource, it seems like
the synergy flow-through you guys are executing well there. How do you figure out where the synergies get allocated
in terms of is this an Alliance Boots synergy, is this something that Amerisource gets to keep? Is it sort of a corporate
lag synergy? How do you figure out what goes into what bucket, just big picture?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yeah. I'd say, well, first we think of them separately. With respect to Alliance Boots, we
both have our baseline projections of what we think we do otherwise independently. As we work together and drive
synergies, effectively we for the most part split them. And, because we have a 45% ownership stake in them, it means
that we get our half, plus their 45% which is 72.5%. It's probably not perfect plus or minus where it goes, but in the end
because we're ultimately planning on becoming one company, it's not worth arguing about as much as making sure we
maximize them because in the end it will all go into the same place. I think it's a little more complex with
AmerisourceBergen because they're – we are a small investor, and we plan to just be a partner versus anything grander.
So we really have to make sure that we have mechanisms to understand each year not only what is a synergy, but we
also have mechanisms in terms of how we equitably share those based upon agreements that we have. So we haven't
talked any more about that but I'd say that these are a little bit different in the two constructs. But I think that we have
pretty good models understanding what we would do on our own if not in partner with someone else and that for all
cases is used as the baseline.
<Q - Ross J. Muken>: Thanks, guys.

Our next question comes from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Andrew P. Wolf>: Thank you. Good morning. Just a few follow-ups, first around the sustainability of this
improvement in the SG&A stack. You've cycled the Balance Rewards investments, credit costs. Was that something
that was meaningful to helping the SG&A improvement and – so that would obviously carry forward, right?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: We haven't called out what we did in terms of investing in systems for Balance Rewards
and also for people. I wouldn't say it wasn't not meaningful, but it wasn't unusually meaningful either. I think the key
thing is just, if you think back to last September and all that was going on, not only were we trying to sign up 100, 200
people a day in loyalty, we were welcoming Express Scripts customers back. We had all of our competitors that were
launching promotional campaigns to try to keep them. This was all in the context of probably lower overall investment
and promotion activity. So I think that's probably more the – the more thing to watch for now, as Greg said, is we
sharpen our focus, make incremental investments where it makes sense to do so, seeing how we round the horn and
what that looks like.
<Q - Andrew P. Wolf>: By using the word investment, I meant hard costs going through SG&A, let's say
programming costs that you couldn't capitalize. I think you have at least qualitatively said that that was....
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: There was some of that but I think the bigger thing, as we alluded to a few quarters ago, is
we had some SG&A that was attributed to loyalty sign-ups, attributed to....
<Q - Andrew P. Wolf>: Okay.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: ...and Express welcome-backs because there was a lot – and also to Med D signups. There
was still a lot going on at the same time and that really was important but in some ways a distraction from taking care
of the core customer every day.
<Q - Andrew P. Wolf>: Okay. What – the other part on the SG&A, was there anything unusual in some of the major
line items that can swing quarter to quarter? Sometimes you hear healthcare costs were – or workmen's comp was
particularly good or bad. Was there anything like that this quarter?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: There's tons of moving parts under the hood in the way that they get treated for but I would
say there's no anomalies in this quarter really.
<Q - Andrew P. Wolf>: Okay.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: I think what you pretty much see is our performance exactly as it was and, as I said before,
it's more normalized out now the way run our business even if the base period and then two periods ago have anomalies
in it.
<Q - Andrew P. Wolf>: Okay. So moving on to gross margin, at least versus my expectations that's where things came
up light. And then sequentially, just looking at your FIFO gross margin, the expansion was about half of last quarter's.
And I'll give you three buckets, Greg. Generics, was the sequential contribution less so in generics? Was it – you
started ramping up promotions, just my hearing; there may be something else. Or was it just also just the flu was so
profitable? How would you think about sequentially having less gross margin expansion?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: There's probably a little bit of generics. I think you're right; the flu was a big boost to the
prior quarter, but there's also a lot of other things going on under the hood that you won't see at the surface. So, for
example, to the extent that our pharmacy business outpaced our front-end, our front-end has a higher gross margin on
average; you get mix effects in that regard. You also have other mix effects from business like specialty that have a
very low margin but have had a lot of inflation and, therefore, to some extent growth.
So I think the key thing – I know we say it all the time, but I think the key thing is the way we really run our business
as a business model is to try to maximize gross profit dollars. And in the end, even with generics ever increasing, our

margins would probably over time look good, but if we can't keep the gross profit dollar engine going, that's not going
to help us. So, again, I think there's just a lot of static. I think you probably hit on some of them but there are mix
effects and other things that can make a difference quarter to quarter, too.
<Q - Andrew P. Wolf>: Okay. And just on the promotional posture of how the company is going to market, clearly the
press release stated that that's going to increase. Was that part of that increase during the quarter or is that all post
quarter?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Was part of the what...?
<Q - Andrew P. Wolf>: The increase in promotionality because I'm trying to....
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: In the back half of May, we started to make some of the tweaks and modifications. Those
will continue. Again, we're going to be smart about what we do, and we're a lot smarter now that we have a lot of the
loyalty data we didn't have prior.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Andy, yes, with the lead-time in circulars, it was mid-May by the time we truly made
these adjustments and....
<Q - Andrew P. Wolf>: Got it. I was late on the call so I didn't hear that comment.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yes.
<Q - Andrew P. Wolf>: Okay. And just lastly, Wade, on this Alliance Boots trend on expectations, so it's $0.03 of
currency. How much is the miscalc on the IFRS to GAAP...?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: For this quarter, we're about $0.02 versus the bottom of our range and that was really IFRS
to GAAP adjustments. So really no change in how they view their performance, only a change in terms of as we get
into the methodology and the differences in IFRS and GAAP, knowing those. And the $0.01 is currency we're
predicting for the next quarter. And, because of the three-month lag, we know a lot about next quarter already. There's
still audit process and things to happen. So there can be some final adjustments in IFRS and GAAP. But I think that, for
the most part, things like currency are baked in, so we know that and that's why we're calling that out.
<Q - Andrew P. Wolf>: So, in the current quarter, was there any operational miss from Alliance Boots?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: No, the current quarter, they're pretty much right on path. And I think you probably – if
you look at their equity income recorded, it's probably pretty close to what we've seen on aggregate, most people here
on the phone, and modeled.
<Q - Andrew P. Wolf>: Sure, okay, just double-checking it. But it looks like given the range for your fiscal year that
you're not so sure about this quarter. Or why is there $0.04 – if you have explained $0.03 and you've given a $0.02 to
$0.06 range for the year, it sounds like you think Boots could either add $0.01 – be a $0.01 above plan or $0.02 below.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: No, we're predicting I think $0.08 for the next quarter and we just said that prior we had
thought it would be a little higher than that and the primary driver of difference is foreign exchange.
<Q - Andrew P. Wolf>: Okay.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: If you look at this quarter, a couple of things just again; we don't obviously manage to
consensus. We manage to our internal target and I would say there – if we look there, probably the front-end was the
key thing that we were working against from our original projections but if I look at this externally, I think a couple of
things happening. One, our tax rate is a bit different than was assumed by many and there is a lot of complexity in that
tax rate this quarter. Second thing is share count. Again, I think there was probably 7 million shares or 8 million shares
or 6 million shares associated with options. It sounds like a small number but it actually does move the needle on an
EPS basis.
<Q - Andrew P. Wolf>: So there's going to be a $0.02 currency hit based on current currency rates to your prior
expectation for the current quarter, is that right?

<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: For the current – in the current quarter we just put out, there was $0.02 difference and that
was primarily almost all IFRS to GAAP adjustments. For the next quarter, Q4, it's about $0.01 which is all currency.
<Q - Andrew P. Wolf>: Okay.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: And because we have a three-month lag, we effectively already know what the currency
will be in three months.
<Q - Andrew P. Wolf>: Okay. So, for the quarter we're in and the quarter – and Boots is reporting on a lag so you
already know how that ended.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: That's right.
<Q - Andrew P. Wolf>: Did they – how was that quarter operationally? Was there a miss in the – not the quarter you
just reported but the quarter that you'll be reporting. The Q4 quarter you're reporting, I think Boots already concluded
because they're reporting with a lag, does that meet expectations?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: We know a lot, but if we told, we'd have to kill you, Andy. But honestly, until we get to
next quarter, we can't divulge that. I think what you did see is you saw the last fiscal year for Alliance Boots. So,
hopefully, you have confidence that they've run their business very effectively in very challenging times and I don't
expect that that would change anytime soon.
<A - Rick J. Hans>: Hey, Andy, it's Rick. We'll have to move on.
<Q - Andrew P. Wolf>: That's fine. Thank you.

Our final question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Zachary William Sopcak>: Hi. Good morning. This is Zack Sopcak for Ricky Goldwasser. Thanks for the
question. I want to ask, first, real quick about your gross margin progression going forward. And I know you talked in
quite a bit of detail about some of the headwinds being generics and 90 days at retail and Balance Rewards. Can you
talk about any of the tailwinds that we might be seeing or that you can talk at a high level, other than synergies from the
Alliance Boots deal?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yeah, I think the tailwinds that we have, frankly, are the price and promotion and the
adjustments we're putting into the front-end. I think we'll continue to see more and more people coming in from
Medicare Part D plans that we've put in place. I think that with healthcare reform, as we talked about, and millions of
people coming in, gaining insurance coverage, we're beginning as a company to benefit from that.
I think certainly, as we continue to gain strength certainly with the consumer, I think that we'll see lift in our
discretionary categories which is where see probably be the biggest impact. So thanks for that question, Zack. We do
think we have ample tailwinds. We're really focused on what's currently in front of us. But we think longer term and
even short term there's a lot of opportunity behind us.
<Q - Zachary William Sopcak>: Okay. And then a separate question on – within the quarter you received regulatory
approval to start buying shares of ABC. Can you comment on if you started on that at all or what your thoughts on that
are?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: We are in the market, we are buying, and beyond that I can't say much more.
<Q - Zachary William Sopcak>: Okay, great. Thanks for the questions.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Thanks, Zack.
