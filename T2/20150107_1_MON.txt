Our first quarter call continues to be the first data point on our business for the year and includes the annual update of
our R&D pipeline. This call is being webcast and you can access the webcast, supporting slides and the replay at
monsanto.com.
We've provided you today with EPS measures on both a GAAP and ongoing business basis. Where we refer to
non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to GAAP in the slides and in the press release, both of which are on the
website.
This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on
assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a
material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may
cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language in our most recent 10-K and in today's press release.
First and foremost, let me anchor today's review on a brief overview of our first quarter results as shown on slide four.
Our first quarter ongoing EPS was $0.47, which is ahead of the expectation we outlined with our full year outlook and
earnings flow at the beginning of the fiscal year. Our free cash flow for the quarter was $969 million, which is within
the range of expected operating and investing cash flows built into our full year guidance. Both measures are consistent
with the growth plans we have for fiscal year 2015, as well as our ongoing commitment to continue to invest in our
new platforms.
So with that, let me hand it to Hugh for the strategic view at the close of our first quarter.
Hugh M. Grant
Thank you, Laura, and Happy New Year to everybody on the line. While many in the industry are more near-term
focused, we continue to keep our view on the horizon, unwavering on our vision for growth. We acknowledge that
there are near-term headwinds in the current agricultural environment, yet with our balanced portfolio, we believe we're
well-positioned to withstand those challenges.
Taking a longer view, we continue to view agriculture as a very attractive space given the continuing long-term
demand projections shown on slide five and our commitment to innovation that so effectively aligns with that trend.
With annual projections for corn and soybean demand increasing by an estimated 500 million and 200 million bushels
respectively in each of the next five years, the world will need considerably more yield. This scenario is already
playing out in the very near term corn environment, where the estimated oversupply of 700 million bushels is being
quickly whittled away with recent USDA estimates for corn demand increasing by nearly 300 million bushels in just
the last six months.
Through our innovation, we're uniquely positioned to deliver the yield that this demand requires. Innovation has
propelled our growth to-date and we expect the trend to continue for years to come.
Our R&D pipeline is critical to maintaining that momentum and today, I'm pleased to say that this year's annual update
from Rob will once again highlight significant progress. We continue to maintain the deepest most valuable pipeline in
the industry, providing six fully operational platforms, including three new transformational growth platforms as shown
on slide six.
Breeding, biotechnology and crop protection form the foundation of the core R&D efforts and continue to deliver a
yield performance advantage across our key crops and regions, as well as the next generations of weed and insect
control in the industry's most productive biotech platform.
Beyond this core, there are three transformational new growth platforms beginning with microbial seed treatments and
our BioAg Alliance, RNAi pest control solutions via our BioDirect platform and finally, our evolving Climate
platform, which is the ability to integrate all of the platforms through the application of digital agriculture. So while the
rest of the industry promotes one-off solutions, we stand alone in our ability to advanced technology that powers an
integrated approach to improving yields and helps the grower reduce inputs.

Today is about more than the update for pipeline, as critical as it is to our future. It's also about providing insights into
where we stand in our current year and long-term plans. And even though our first quarter is financially a smaller
quarter, it's one in which we delivered on critical milestones that reinforce the outlook for fiscal year 2015 and more
importantly, the key drivers of our five-year plan to more than double our ongoing earnings per share.
First and foremost, if you look to slide seven, we expect to be above the high end of our target of 10 million to 12
million acres of Intacta in South America, with a record second year ramp.
Secondly, we received USDA recommendations for deregulation for both Roundup Ready Xtend Soybeans and
Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton and that brings us a step closer to the planned launches.
Third, the U.S. order book indicates that there's likely continued acre shifting this year, as soybeans are well ahead of
the prior year pace, while corn was tracking at a slower pace. This points once again to the power of a balanced
portfolio to better withstand the year-on-year vagaries of agriculture.
Importantly, the overall order book confirms that our grower customers continue to seek out our newer, higher value
seed and trait offerings. And last but certainly not least, we remain diligent on our capital allocation targets and the $6
billion accelerated share repurchase which is the initial step in our two-year $10 billion share repurchase authorization,
which continues on pace.
So across the board in this opening quarter for fiscal year 2015, we've touched upon every critical long-term growth
driver and we've made significant progress on key milestones that will propel us forward.
Overall, our performance in Q1 reinforces our confidence and on slide eight, we're confirming our ongoing EPS
guidance of $5.75 per share to $6 per share, albeit against a near-term backdrop that's increasingly more difficult. The
currency and acreage headwinds that we faced in fiscal year 2014, they remain, and yet we stand firm in our ability to
grow while investing in new platforms in this environment. But we won't get ahead of the business, as the most
significant seasons in the Northern Hemisphere are yet to come.
And so I'll hand over to Brett to provide further insights in our performance in Q1 and how we see the year shaping up.
Brett?
Brett D. Begemann
Thanks, Hugh, and Happy New Year to everyone. Our first quarter results came in ahead of guidance, with excellent
results from Intacta in Brazil. While it is not a perfect hedge, overall, our soybean portfolio will help us withstand what
appears to be a more discernible global acreship to soybeans from corn, more so than we had originally anticipated.
Our balanced portfolio has never been more important or more of a differentiator than now. And I'm pleased to say that
the decade of the soybean that began with a record year in fiscal year 2014 remains in full swing.
Our plan to more than double ongoing earnings per share by 2019 is anchored on more than $4 billion of gross profit
growth we expect in our core businesses, as outlined on slide nine. Milestones critical to this growth began in our first
quarter. Let's start with our fastest growing growth driver, soybeans. We're off to a great start with Intacta, as we now
expect to be above the high end of our range of 10 million to 12 million acres across South America, and the early read
on product performance has been quite strong.
Our value proposition held as growers embraced the technology across multiple growing regions in South America as
shown on slide 10. And in parallel with the second year of commercial ramp up, we expanded our production of
varieties for 2016 from roughly 66 varieties to more than 100 varieties in Brazil alone. This allows us to prepare for an
even more meaningful ramp in year three when we expect to be able to serve all of the maturity zones in the country.
Fiscal year 2016 then becomes the tipping point for broad scale adoption of the technology and a 100 million acre
opportunity in South America.

Beyond Intacta is the continued step-up of Roundup Ready 2 Yield in the U.S. The early read on our U.S. soybean
order book is very strong and we expect growth in soybean acres this season that we are well positioned to serve. Rob
will highlight the performance, which really cements this as the platform of choice in the U.S. and as the foundation for
our next-generation technologies.
With regard to Roundup Ready Xtend, the next generation weed control technology layered on the Roundup Ready 2
Yield platform, we're making excellent progress in our pre-commercial activities with an unprecedented bulk up of
varieties planned this summer. As shown on slide 11, our class of 2016 has been selected and we now have an
impressive 63 varieties across our brands and corn states licensees, covering all maturity groups and six times the
number of varieties for the launch of Roundup Ready 2 Yield.
This looks to be the largest biotech trait launch in our history. Receipt of the USDA recommendation to deregulate in
December was a critical milestone, and now, we look forward to the next steps in the U.S. and import approval
processes.
Let's move to corn next, which is expected to deliver two of our $1 billion-plus gross profit drivers in our five-year
plan. Quite simply, here's how I think about the state of our business. Our corn yield performance advantage has never
been better. Our go-to-market strategy is far-reaching and fundamentally sound, and the combination of the two
resulted in leading positions we delivered around the globe in fiscal year 2014, as shown on slide 12.
We ended the year in number one position in nearly every major corn market, including the U.S., Brazil, Argentina and
Eastern Europe. And within Western Europe, we earned a respectable second place as we performed well in both the
grain and silage markets. This global performance sets us up well for continued momentum in fiscal year 2015, albeit
on a smaller acreage base.
And this is where I take a very clear-eyed view. The long-term demand fundamentals for corn and soybeans are intact.
Our products are best-in-class. However, the currency and acreage headwinds from fiscal year 2014 continue into fiscal
year 2015.
First, in Latin America, the corn acres were softer in Q1 than we originally anticipated, with Argentina down an
estimated 20% compared to last year and Brazil down 10% in the summer season.
In the U.S. corn business, the order book indicates a downward trend from the prior year, pointing to the expectation of
lower corn acres and what many now believe appears to be a protracted purchasing cycle, given the ample corn seed
supply across the industry. We do, however, continue to see demand for our newer hybrids in our portfolio and the
continued trade up to the reduced refuge family of products.
In addition, our orders for DroughtGard hybrids are nearly sold out in some regions, following a year of very strong
performance, which is particularly compelling given the favorable growing conditions from last year.
And finally, in the Ukraine, with our strong corn product performance, we moved to the number one share position this
past season, but with the unfavorable political climate and the economic disruption, it now appears likely that acres will
be reduced in that region.
Despite these headwinds, performance remains the most important variable that a grower considers when making his
seed decision, and we are still expecting growth in our corn business for the full year. From a combination of share
gains and price/mix lift in our portfolio, we remain disciplined in our commercial corn strategy and we're leveraging
our strong next-generation soybean portfolio to mitigate some of the near-term acreage headwinds in corn.
Before we leave our core growth platforms, let's take a quick look at our cotton business. Pre-commercial plans are
well underway for Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton in the U.S. with the potential for a limited introduction on roughly 0.5
million acres in FY 2015, pending receipt of regulatory approvals.
Pricing will be announced closer to the selling season and will be influenced by the timing of the receipt of the
remaining U.S. regulatory approvals. Ultimately, once growers are able to experience the benefits of the full system, we
believe the value of the improved weed control and Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton system will allow for a mid

single-digit step-up in price per acre.
Finally, Australia wrapped up its critical first quarter at about half of its prior year performance, as expected, simply
because of fewer planted acres as a result of less water in a highly irrigated market.
Let's move on to ag productivity. In Roundup, we continued to maintain our strategy of pricing at a small premium
over the generics, which have held their pricing in the market through the first quarter. We do, however, continue to
plan for an approximate 10% decline in Roundup gross profit, as we guided at the outset of the fiscal year. This is
primarily driven by price with a modest offset from the increase in branded volumes expected to be sold in Q2 and Q3.
Moving beyond Roundup, as we anticipate the launches of Roundup Ready Xtend systems, we recognized that the
industry will need an additional dicamba to meet the requirements of a platform that will have a fit on nearly 200
million acres.
To ensure the success of this platform, we are developing our strategy to ensure there is an ample supply of dicamba for
use in our new Roundup Ready Xtend systems. We have plans in place for formulation expansions over the course of
the next several years at our Muscatine plant to produce XtendiMax and Roundup Xtend with VaporGrip formulations.
And finally, we are simultaneously evaluating options to either source externally and/or build internally for the active
ingredient. We will continue to evaluate our own novel chemistry solutions, those of our partners, as well as current
and emerging capacity in the industry. That balanced approach gives us confidence that our growers will experience the
value from this technology and drive the fastest-growing portion of our business, soybeans.
I'd like to close out the business overview with a look at our newest platform, Climate, on slide 13, which we expect to
be a meaningful contributor to our gross profit by the end of our five-year plan. Consistent with the integrating
principles of the platform, we folded our former FieldScripts and precision ag equipment products under this Climate
umbrella and now plan to offer a host of digital ag advisory services from this platform.
Under this new umbrella, our key priority continues to be to increase our active users in our Climate basic by 50% to an
active base of 45 million acres. In addition, we are now targeting to double the acres of Climate paid premium services
for products like Climate Pro and FieldScripts, from a base of more than 1 million acres in fiscal year 2014. Both
targets support our strategy of driving trial and on-farm use for what we believe to be a high-value system integrating
technologies.
To further drive this adoption and trial, I'm pleased to announce that we recently signed long-term distribution
agreements with GROWMARK, Helena, and WinField and extended our operating agreement with Agrium's Crop
Production Services and with Wilbur-Ellis. Their commitments to distribute our Climate advisory services through
their combined retailers and selling agents who touch nearly every acre in the U.S., acknowledges the potential of this
technology. Their local agronomic knowledge and expertise, along with our technology is a powerful combination and
will better serve our grower customers.
Our first quarter is solidly behind us, underscored by the delivery of several key milestones that propel us into what
looks to be a very promising long-term plan. I can assure you, however, that we are keenly focused on delivering fiscal
year 2015, while we continue to invest in our newest platforms. Our global reach, our balanced portfolio, and our
innovation will continue to serve us well.
With that, I'll pass it to Pierre for the financial update.
Pierre C. Courduroux
Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everyone joining us in the new year. Even though Q1 represents a smaller portion
of our earnings, there are several indicators that confirm our confidence in our full year business performance and
allow us to confirm our initial EPS guidance range of $5.75 to $6 per share, as shown on slide 14.

First, soybeans in South America came in better than expected in Q1, and Intacta performance now appears to be above
the high end of our range of 10 million to 12 million acres. Second, our U.S. order book reflects delayed farmer
decisions and the shift in acres from corn to soybeans, so accordingly our prepays are down, but with our balanced
leading portfolio, we are well-positioned to manage the variability across the acres and as has been the case in prior
years, for every 1 million acres shifting from corn to soybeans in the U.S., we see roughly a 3% decline in our earnings
per share. Third, crop protection was above expectations through the close of Q1, largely due to timing. And finally, we
were very disciplined in the management of our spend in the first quarter.
However, with the backdrop of expected lower corn acres, we now expect our total seeds and traits gross profit growth
percentage for the year to be more in the range of high-single-digits. Our next generation of soybean technologies will
be a core driver in delivering this growth, with the key proof point coming from the more than $100 million in gross
profit growth and the seven points of margin lift that we saw in soybeans in Q1.
We also continue to see full year growth coming from corn from a combination of share gains and price/mix lift,
despite the decline in gross profit in the first quarter. This decline in corn gross profit in Q1 was largely South America
volume driven, but we also experienced higher COGS from a combination of items including the higher cost of
inventory resulting from the flood in Argentina.
This was further compounded by the continued effect of the price reduction we took last season in our corn traits in
Brazil, which was in direct response to a leading competitor's price drop, as a result of their corn borer resistance issue.
Finally, we do see currency as a continued headwind. We factored into our guidance the headwind of approximately
$0.15 to $0.20, which was roughly the same rate of devaluation we experienced in FY 2014. And despite continued
strengthening of the dollar against several of our key currencies including the Brazilian real, Argentine peso, and the
euro, at present, we still believe this is adequate.
This brings us to the next financial measure to weigh in for the year, which is our operating spend. First, we remain
committed to incremental spend in our climate and biological platforms, to ensure that we deliver on the long-term
growth prospects for these opportunities. But to ensure the incremental spend is available for the new platforms and to
address continuing headwinds in the business, disciplined plans are in place, and we now expect our core operating
spend to be flat to slightly down, which was already reflected in our first quarter results.
Let's move next to how our projections play out by quarter. Following a stronger than expected first quarter and with
what now appears to be lower corn acres, we now estimate that Q2 EPS will be down in the range of 5% to 10% versus
prior year, leaving growth in the year to Q3 and Q4, the latter of which ranging from breakeven to positive.
With the change to [indiscernible] (23:40) brand direct to farmers in the U.S., we now expect a shift of approximately
$200 million to $300 million of gross profit from Q2 to Q3, which we expect to be partially offset in the second quarter
by the continued growth in our soybean platform in the U.S. and South America.
Finally, our cash flows for the quarter were on target, and as outlined on slide 15, we still expect our free cash flow to
be in the range of $2 billion to $2.2 billion reflecting a more normalized level in FY 2015. Our $6 billion accelerated
share repurchase remains on track and is expected to close sometime in the third quarter, giving us the net boost in our
earnings per share we indicated after considering the interest on the incremental debt we took on to fund this
repurchase.
We began the year with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.2 times, and we continue to target being in the range of 1.5
times, maintaining the capital allocation strategy we outlined just six months ago.
As expected, we are seeing significant headwind in fiscal year 2015, but we also see confirmation of the long-term
growth drivers that support our gross profit expansion through a global, balanced portfolio. When combined with our
disciplined and balanced approach to funding our growth platforms and our continued commitment to effective capital
allocation, I am confident we are on track in the first year of our five-year plan to at least double our ongoing earnings
per share by 2019 and effectively return value to our owners.
With that, I will hand it over to Rob to provide us with this year's annual update on our pipeline.

Robert T. Fraley
Thanks, Pierre, and good morning to everybody on the line. Over the last couple of years, I've talked to you about the
evolution of our pipeline, where we're able to enhance yield from more angles than ever before. If you go to slide four
of the Annual R&D Pipeline Update Presentation, which by every measure, this is the deepest and most valuable
pipeline in Monsanto's and the industry's history.
First, we've graduated from the days when the pipeline reflected just breeding and biotechnology. Today, our R&D
approach marries our core pipelines with three transformational growth platforms, allowing us to talk about a truly
integrated approach to yield. Second, this is a pipeline that consistently delivers progress and sustained waves of
advancements.
I'd like to highlight the breadth and the quality of this progress on slide five, so let's begin with the core platforms. First,
we've made significant progress in our next generation of weed control platforms in both soybeans and cotton, as
underscored by the recent USDA recommendation to deregulate our Roundup Ready Xtend systems.
Second, we've made several advancements in highly relevant disease-resistance breeding traits in corn and in
vegetables, while continuing our impressive breeding performance advantage in corn, soybeans, and cotton.
Third, we now have several next generation insect control products in Phase 4, including the advancement of our
third-generation of above ground insect control in corn.
Fourth, we have an exciting new seed treatment nematicide advancing in crop protection, our first derived from the
application of genomics to chemistry. And not to be outdone in our new growth platforms, we're delivering upgrades
across the advisory services in Climate, we have delivered our first Phase 2 product in BioDirect, and we advanced 50
microbial hits to Phase 1 in The BioAg Alliance. I think put quite simply, we're seeing incredible progress across
several dimensions of our pipeline, across multiple crops in both core and new platforms. And that's important because
it defines the commercial opportunity.
So not only is this the broadest pipeline, but it's the most valuable, reflecting up to $25 billion in peak sales opportunity
from the core alone, as shown in slides six to eight, and considerable upside potential coming from our new platforms. I
think it goes without saying that this is our competitive advantage. There is a steady wave of innovation that delivers
meaningful solutions to our farmer customers to improve their productivity, and grow the value of our commercial
portfolio.
So let's start with the core platform updates to show you how that works. Breeding is clearly our cornerstone.
Monsanto's biggest commercial advantage comes from the differential performance created by the leading breeding
engine in the industry.
If we move to slide nine, I'm pleased to share with you that for more than a decade, DEKALB has been delivering a
yield advantage of seven bushels to 10 bushels in the U.S. across a gamut of growing conditions. And for the second
consecutive year, DEKALB has reached record levels of yields, north of 220 bushels per acre, with a strong
performance advantage of nearly eight bushels per acre. I could not be more pleased with the sustained superior
performance of our U.S. corn breeding program.
And moving to slide 10, this yield advantage is not limited to the U.S. In Brazil, we see an advantage of five bushels
per acre in the tropical hybrids. In Argentina, the advantage continues to exceed 10 bushels per acre. And finally, in
Eastern Europe, the advantage is similar to that of the U.S. with a seven bushel to 10 bushel advantage.
Let's look at soybeans next on slide 11, which is the single largest core gross profit driver in our five-year plan. For the
fourth consecutive year, we saw more than a four-bushel advantage in Roundup Ready 2 Yield soybeans as compared
to Roundup Ready varieties. This performance cements the Roundup Ready 2 Yield platform and establishes it as the
foundation for the next generation technologies like Roundup Ready 2 Xtend.

Finally, the real proof of the performance is in the widespread adoption of the technology. In 2014, across our branded
and licensed customers, the Roundup Ready 2 Yield platform expanded to 53 million acres in the U.S., an increase of
10 million acres in just one year.
Moving to cotton. Our leading Deltapine Land cotton varieties on slide 12 demonstrate nearly 70 pounds of lift per acre
performance advantage for the fifth consecutive year. This leadership across the three primary crops grown in the U.S.
gives us the opportunity to withstand the inevitable shifts between acres like no one else in the industry can.
Moving to slide 13. Let me share with you some of the highlights into the recent advancements in breeding technology
that we expect to allow us to widen our competitive advantage. First, we pair the largest and most diverse germplasm
library with industry-best discovery technologies utilizing advanced high throughput screening and advanced markers,
and then we factor in the biggest global testing network to identify, select, and deploy the best performing seeds across
the globe. Further, the application of data science and advanced algorithms allows our breeders to focus on the highest
probability segment of our germplasm library.
Our recently announced $20 million investment into global integrated breeding centers further leverages these
advantages. Through genome-wide selection built on a foundation of 15 years of marker research, we will be able to do
yield testing in the lab, significantly increasing the size of our screening program and enable complex trait stacks and
new genetics at the same pace.
By 2018, we expect our new hybrid testing should be more than six times our current rate. This capability provides the
horsepower to upgrade our global germplasm portfolio every year, allowing us to introduce new higher-yielding seeds,
and it allows us to unlock specific targeted breeding opportunities.
So let's look at how our breeding engine is making significant breakthroughs in our disease resistance program. Today,
I'll share insights into two of the advancements in corn disease, depicted on slide 14, as well as in our vegetable
program on slide 15. Gray Leaf Spot and Goss's Wilt Resistance are significant diseases in the United States and can
cause catastrophic losses, upwards of 30%. With this year's launch of improved Gray Leaf Spot resistant and Goss's
Wilt resistant germplasm, we are helping to mitigate those risks for our grower customers.
In our 2014 R&D trials, we demonstrated an impressive 30-bushel to 40-bushel advantage in low to high Gray Leaf
Spot disease pressure environments respectively. And our Goss's Wilt Resistance research trials were even more
impressive with resistant hybrids demonstrating a 50-bushel to 100-bushel per acre advantage over the susceptible
varieties in low to high disease pressure.
For vegetables, the advancements are in our two largest, most valuable crops, tomatoes and peppers. In peppers, we are
launching Phytophthora-Resistant Peppers. Our new resistant hybrids demonstrated an increase from six tons to 11 tons
per acre of production in our R&D field plots. In tomatoes, we are advancing Bacteria Wilt Resistant-Tomato to Phase
4. Tomato Bacterial Wilt is the disease that affects tomatoes in hot, humid growing conditions. And in 2014, our
Bacterial Wilt Resistant-Tomato hybrids demonstrated nearly an 80% improvement in yields in our R&D field plots,
reinforcing the advancement decision.
Let's move now next to our biotech platform, which continues to be a significant differentiator with our focus on third
and fourth-generation upgrades that we expect really to define the next decade. In fiscal year 2015, we're planning for a
limited introduction of Bollgard II XtendFlex Cotton on approximately 0.5 million acres, pending receipt of regulatory
approvals.
As seen on slide 16, this system will provide outstanding control of resistant and tough to control weeds, making it a
step-change in weed control. To further enhance growers' experience with the technology, in 2014, we trained over
3,800 growers, retail partners and stakeholders on key areas, such as weed management and application systems.
This sets up the Roundup Ready Xtend Crop System in soybeans, as shown on slides 17 and 18, which combines the
benefits of breeding, biotechnology and crop protection into one seamless system of outstanding weed control. With the
USDA recommendation to deregulate, we continue to work towards a planned 2016 commercial launch. We just
completed our deployment process, and the yield performance of this Xtend class of 2016 is on parity with the latest

class of Roundup Ready 2 Yield varieties and spans all the maturity groups in the United States. This is an amazing
accomplishment for a planned first year launch.
Switching to insect control, with the advancement of our third-generation of above ground insect protection to Phase 4
this year, we now have four next-generation insect control technologies in Phase 4, as shown on slide 19. By the end of
the decade, we expect to launch all of these products from SmartStax PRO across the Americas to our
second-generation of Intacta for South America and these target some of the most significant pests in agriculture.
Our third-generation of above ground insect control in corn adds a mode of action for fall armyworm and corn earworm
and expands the spectrum of control to black and Western bean cutworms, all on top of the proven performance of our
VT Double PRO.
Further, it has a target market across the southern U.S. and Brazil where insect pressure is top of mind. We understand
the criticality of continuingly upgrading insect control to anticipate the evolution of the insect population.
The other advancement in insect control I'd like to highlight, on slide 19, is cotton lygus control, now in Phase 3. This
product is the first to target a piercing sucking insect and it is expected to be commercialized as a stack with Bollgard
III XtendFlex. Through our field testing, it continues to provide excellent control of lygus, thrips, and leafhoppers and
it's expected to significantly reduce insecticide use in cotton production systems, where farmers are spraying for lygus
between five times and 10 times a season in the delta.
Within yield and stress, we are adding DroughtGard SmartStax PRO, our first broad acre drought project to Phase 3.
This product combines 10 different biotech genes to bring the benefits of improved yield potential in water stressed
conditions from our DroughtGard gene and drought resistant germplasm with the benefits of our third-generation of
below ground insect control from SmartStax PRO.
In head-to-head comparisons of fiscal year 2014, as shown on slide 20, we saw more than a five-bushel advantage from
DroughtGard hybrids as compared to competitive drought products. Our ability to marry our proficiency in breeding
technology and biotechnology is allowing us now to expand DroughtGard hybrids beyond the Western Corn Belt, with
the market fit on nearly 25 million acres across the broader U.S.
Although the work in yield and stress is clearly complex from a technical perspective, the strong grower interest and
market need demonstrated by our DroughtGard hybrids performance highlights the importance of our long-term
collaboration on yield and stress with BASF.
Moving to our final platform in the core, crop protection, we recognized that to fully serve our customers with
integrated yield solutions, we need to selectively provide in-season control of pests, whether through our long-standing
Roundup franchise, our emerging Xtend system, or through novel new solutions.
Today, I will highlight one of several of our advancements in crop protection. This is an exciting new Nematicide Seed
Treatment that just moved into Phase 4. So nematodes are persistent pests across several crops with annual losses
estimated to be nearly $3 billion. On slide 21 I'm pleased to share that this highly novel seed treatment has
demonstrated broad spectrum control of nematodes in corn, cotton, soybeans, and has promised for vegetables as well.
Our 2014 trials demonstrate a yield advantage of six bushels per acre in corn and an advantage of two bushels per acre
in soybeans when compared to the competitive standard. And most exciting, this demonstrates the first ever application
of genomics insights into the synthetic chemistry use in seed treatments. We expect this technology will be a key
component of our Acceleron seed treatment portfolio, as well as attract licensing interest from numerous third-parties.
From breeding to biotech and crop protection, our core platforms continue to deliver sustained ways of innovation that
translate into advancements that power our growth both near term and longer term. And with three fully populated new
growth platforms, I believe we will continue to lead well into the future with these transformative technologies.
So shifting to our new growth platforms, I'll begin with microbials. With the formation of the BioAg Alliance with
Novozymes just under a year ago, the progress has been truly impressive. With our collective microbial discovery, field
testing capability and fermentation production expertise, no one has as compelling a capability as we've assembled in

this alliance. Together in our first year, we conducted over 170,000 plots across hundreds of strains.
And as shown in our first ever pipeline for the BioAg Alliance on slide 22, we've generated 25 hits in soybeans and 25
hits in corn moving into Phase 1 for bio yield. This really demonstrates the power of the field testing capability on our
footprint, with the explosive expansion in trials in year one to unveil these hits.
Further, with the combination of Monsanto and Novozymes, we already have two projects in Phase 2 of early
development, as well as numerous current commercial products from Optimize in soybeans to Torque for corn, and
those existing products continue their global expansion, leveraging Monsanto's footprint.
If we move to slide 23, we can see the results from our first year of collecting testing. The average yield advantage in
the top hits in corn was four bushels per acre and in soybeans was two bushels per acre. In 2015, we plan to move to
500,000 plots and thousands of strains leveraging our industry-leading field testing network to bring scale to microbial
testing that's simply never been done before.
An additional untapped new growth opportunity is underway with our breakthrough technology in our BioDirect
platform on slide 24, where we're developing new topically applied RNAi based tools to target plant disease, insect and
weed control, as well as targets that enhance bee health. This year, we have our first BioDirect concept advancing to
Phase 2. This first advancement of early development is a non-transgenic topical technology with broad acre potential
in the control of Colorado Potato Beetles, which infest numerous specialty and row crops and are particularly
devastating in potatoes.
On slide 25, you can see the latest field trial data demonstrating that the BioDirect solution has insect control efficacy
results closely aligned to the chemical standard. As well, the technology demonstrates reduced levels of larval
infestation and plant defoliation.
One of the keys to the success of this platform will be determined by our advances in the area of production
technology. Since the announcement of this platform, we have already driven an 80% improvement in the cost of
production of RNAi, which is significantly below current market rates. You know, of all of our platforms, this is the
one that reminds me most of our early days in biotechnology, where the application of sound breakthrough science
ultimately delivered game-changing sustainable solutions for improving yields and reducing inputs in agriculture.
Rounding out our new R&D growth platforms is the opportunity with the Climate platform. Through the application of
data science and precision agriculture, this platform has the unique ability to integrate all of our technology platforms,
connecting farming as has never been done before. With a rapid innovation cycle, unlike our other technology
platforms, our pipeline phases on slide 26 reflect this higher pace, aligning more with software engineering than our
traditional core platforms. With only a little over a year since the acquisition, we have already integrated key existing
products and services to provide greater unique value and more unified service offerings to growers, including the
combination of software, connectivity, in-field solutions, and equipment.
As covered in further detail on slide 27, in 2015, the nitrogen advisor for corn producers is expected to incorporate our
newest, best-in-class soil hydrology model and our over-winter simulation of soil temperature. These upgrades, in
addition to other unique features, improve the estimates of nitrogen leaching and volatilization, allowing farmers to
more effectively track and manage their field nitrogen levels. Our Climate Pro service in 2015 will also incorporate
newly enhanced satellite imagery feeds that increase the frequency and analytics to improve usability and accuracy of
the service, allowing farmers to more quickly and precisely identify and treat in-field pest, disease, water, and fertility
issues.
Software-as-a-Service is a new domain for Monsanto, but the application of data science to our extensive field trial and
genetics data is allowing the development and application of unprecedented value creation for agriculture delivered
through software.
I'll end as I began. By every measure, this is the deepest and most valuable pipeline in Monsanto's history and in the
history of the industry. This is our competitive advantage. We alone consistently deliver sustained waves of
advancements across a breadth of platforms, crops and geographies, and we bring those to the market with an

Laura Meyer
Thanks, Rob. With this extended conference call to accommodate the R&D update, we've planned for some additional
time for questions as well.
With that, we'd now like to open the call for questions. As we typically do, I'll please ask that you hold your questions
to one per person so that we can take as many questions as possible. As always, you're welcome to rejoin the queue for
follow up.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first
question comes from the line of Don Carson with Susquehanna. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Yes. Thank you. Rob, a question on Roundup Ready Xtend. On slide 18, you talk about how
the launch is going to be bigger than even Intacta was this year, at 12 million-plus. Can you sort of size that? And more
importantly, talk about sort of the value proposition for the grower in terms of dollars per acre and how much you
intend to capture of that value proposition?
<A - Robert T. Fraley>: Thanks, Don, and Happy New Year. So let me begin with the first part, and I'll let Brett talk
about the value side of it. So with the extra time we've had in the breeding program, our breeding team has done a
terrific job. As I highlighted in the talk, we'll have probably six-plus times the number of varieties that we had with our
original Roundup Ready 2 launch, and importantly, those will cover the U.S. geography, literally going from the
Canadian border down to Louisiana, and the yield performance of those varieties is truly exceptional.
So we've used our time carefully to breed and advance the trait. We'll be using most of this year's summer season for
seed scale-up and ramp-up, so we expect the potential for our largest biotech launch.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah, good morning, Don. This is Brett. Just adding a little color to what Rob already
described about the 63 varieties that we'll have available for bulk-up this year, which is really unprecedented for us.
We'll use that as an opportunity for show-and-tell across the market with our farmers, and we need another round of
evaluation with them to get a look at what the overall value creation is going to be for the product. It's really clear
there's high demand in the market. There's challenging weeds out there that farmers need help in controlling. The
product has a great fit for that, but we won't get ahead of ourselves on looking at pricing until we have this last big
opportunity to take a look.
That being said, as we look at extending cotton this year, we will have a few hundred thousand acres out there this year
that we'll look at in cotton. And I still think once the system gets fully valued by a farmer, gets to see it throughout the
year, we're thinking in mid-single-digits values on cotton. But we'll get a chance to look at that this summer in the
south.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Vincent Stephen Andrews>: Hi. Thanks and good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about Intacta and the
upside that you're seeing this year, where, in particular, is it coming from? Meaning is it coming from the large
corporate farmers or are you seeing better buy-in than you anticipated from the smaller guys you probably have less
visibility from in Ground Breakers. And just on top of that, could you just talk a little bit about it sounds like you're
going to be unlimited in terms of supply for next year, so how should we be thinking about sort of a reasonable range of
acreage potential for next year?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yeah, Vincent, thanks for the question. I think at this stage, I'd say it's pretty much across the
board. We don't see the difference between the big corporate farms and some of the smaller ones. I think we're seeing
the performance and the buzz in the market has really lifted interest across the whole range, and Brett, I mean we will
be unlimited next year I guess.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah, as we look at next year, I think the way – the third year has a history of being the
year when we have the opportunity to go pretty big. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we'll have over 100
varieties next year, which really covers the entire Brazilian market. We'll also be expanding in Argentina, but primarily,
it'll be driven by Brazil. So that gives us the opportunity to expand pretty rapidly.
I look back at our history with Roundup Ready 2 Yield and with Intacta, we've been tracking every year about double
what we were able to do. So if you go back and look at the third year of where we were with Roundup Ready 2 Yield in
the mid-teens, you start looking at that for next year being able to double that for South America. I kind of think that's a
reasonable range to be at.
We'll know a whole lot more when the harvest comes in and the multipliers have harvested their seed and they get the
varieties and we quality check, et cetera. That's all stuff to come yet. But I think it's reasonable at this time to be
thinking in that kind of a range.
<A - Robert T. Fraley>: Just one last add-on not to belabor it, but what's also exciting is we have the
second-generation of Intacta ready to go by the end of the decade and that's going to be important both to continue to
differentiate the pipeline well into the next decade, but really give us a better tool for durable insect resistance
management.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah, that's a good point.
<Q - Vincent Stephen Andrews>: Thanks very much.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Robert Koort with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Robert Andrew Koort>: Thanks very much. Hugh, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the
$1 billion you expect to see in the corn business over the next few years. It seems like you've been stuck in the mud a
little bit here in the last few years about getting any growth in those earnings. So can you talk more specifically how
you're going to do it? And then do you think you'll go back to that 5% to 10% price/mix lift over that horizon to get you
there?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yeah, Bob, thanks for the question. I would say I think the headline in this is I'm very – I
continue to be very bullish on corn. I think that when you look at the cards that we hold today, I wouldn't trade any of
them for anybody else's. I think we're in really good shape in corn. It's been a challenging year, but this is the issue that
we're facing really is reduced acres. If you look at performance, you look at the velocity that our newer hybrids are

being picked versus some of the older ones in our order book, I continue to feel bullish on corn.
And then if you look to the long-term – well actually the next season or two, we think that there's going to be a
continued acceleration on demand. So the pile that has been built at the moment, the amount of grain that's out there, if
you look at China coming on, the increased demand for DDGs coming out of China, you look at ethanol and you
combine that with the crimping of acres in Latin America, I think we're going to see pretty rapid drawdown as well,
Bob.
So, Brett, I don't know if you'd add anything, but I'm pretty optimistic on how we see corn playing out.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah, I would just add that I echo that I feel really very good about our corn business and
I'm really confident that the pile is shrinking at an accelerating rate. And then I look at where we sit. We've got the
best-performing portfolio we've ever had. We've got the strongest position in all the major corn markets in the world
that we've ever had. We've got a year that's really challenging that we're faced with this year, but our footprint is still
growing. Our corn business will grow, even though acres are down substantially that we're seeing this year. So I still
feel really good.
And I look specifically to your point on can we get price lift? Absolutely. We're getting price lift this year and this is a
really tough environment. And you mentioned a couple of years of having that challenge and corn has been coming
down for a couple of years. And then I think one of the factors that often gets missed is when a farmer doesn't plant
corn, they still plant the acre. And most of the time they plant that acre to soybeans. And particularly so in the U.S. and
developing in South America, we have a great hedge. It's called soybeans.
And when they plant soybeans, we have a great soybean portfolio that's really starting to kick in and we saw that last
year as acres started to soften in corn, we saw it with Intacta kicking in. We're seeing it again this year with Roundup
Ready 2 Yield in the north and then I think we'll see that even more with Xtend kicking in. So it's a great hedge.
<A - Pierre C. Courduroux>: Just as a precision actually regarding the hedge that Brett mentioned, during my read of
the prepared remark, I said 3% decline for each million acres in EPS. This is $0.03, not 3%. Just to clarify things there.
<Q - Robert Andrew Koort>: Good clarification.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Thanks, Bob.

Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Good morning.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: ...Hugh and Brett, can you discuss what you're seeing this year from farmers as they may not
trade down on corn seed, but definitely a little more careful? And just on the corn share issue, Hugh, can you confirm
that you were flat in U.S. corn share last year and you expect to be flat to up this year?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yeah, if you look at the trade down, what we would say based on the order book so far, Brett,
we continue to see growers looking for those newer and better performing hybrids even in a really tough year. I think
they've been a lot more careful and a lot more measured, and they've been slower in that purchase process than we've
seen in previous years.
And I'd say in most [indiscernible] (01:01:46) areas as we came out last year – and Brett mentioned this in his prepared
remarks – we either held or ascended to the number one position in pretty much every major world market, Brett, with
the exception of Western Europe. I don't know if you'd add anything to that.

<A - Brett D. Begemann>: No, I think you covered it well. The farmers are in a tough spot with the commodity prices
what they've done, and we've tried to be considerate of that in working with farmers and you can completely
understand the indecision that they're going through. They know there's a big supply of corn out there, so they're not
forced to make a decision. They're still trying to make the trade-off on how many acres of corn and beans they're going
to plant. And the good news is, we're in a great position to supply corn or soybeans.
What we see in our order book right now is a lot of strength in soybeans, not only from increased acres, but also what
we believe to be shared growth. And we see a lot of strength in our corn orders, albeit lower because of acres being
lower, but they are buying our newer hybrids as we would have anticipated.
So I feel good that by the time they get planted, we'll be in a really good place. And then as you step back and look at
this over the longer period, we're in a really good place to continue to grow our corn business. And I think we're very
much on track for our five-year plan to double our earnings, because corn is a big chunk of that and we're in a good
place to do that.

Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Zekauskas with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Hi. Good morning.
<Q - Jeffrey J. Zekauskas>: Hi. In your release, you spoke about keeping your overhead spending on a base level flat,
and you have some new product initiatives. So I was wondering how much you expected your overhead to rise in
absolute dollars this year?
And secondly, in your results, your inventories were up about 10%. They're about $400 million year-over-year even
though your sales were down about 10%. Can you talk about what's going on in your inventory levels?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Jeff, thanks for the two questions. I'll maybe ask Pierre to say a few words. We've – and Brett's
led a lot of this effort. We've taken a really disciplined view on our expenses, given the fact that corn makers have
contracted and we've seen a pullback on commodity prices. We've been talking about that across the organization, and
the teams have been really, really, really responsive to that.
So it's the sensible thing to do, and the business now is at a size where we do have that leverage. But to your point,
we've been really careful that we don't short future growth, as we look at managing our day-to-day expenses. So the old
analogy of seed corn is alive and well. So this is a pipeline review. We continue to spend on future growth in the
anticipation that markets are efficient, that demand will eventually overcome two years of bumper harvests and that
we'll see this thing spooling up again, but we're leveraging SG&A.
And, Pierre, maybe a word on expense and on the inventory?
<A - Pierre C. Courduroux>: Yeah, obviously, we are monitoring our expenses right now and adjusting as well to the
evolution of the business. We don't want to miss an opportunity. But right now, we're thinking about our base spend as
basically flat to slightly down, knowing that we are also investing, as we mentioned earlier on, in our two new growth
platforms, the microbials and the Climate platform.
But as far as our base business is concerned, we are definitely taking a number of actions just to make sure we are in a
good place there. So the way we think about it right now, and it's going to evolve over the year, but flat to slightly
down is the way we think about the core of our spending.

As far as inventories are concerned, this is the combinations of two things that have led to this increasing the inventory
at the end of the first quarter. The first one is obviously I mean, as you know, in South America, with a reduction in
acres, we sold less than we anticipated, but more importantly, if you remember over the last two years, we have tried to
rebuild our inventories, and that was the plan from day one. We wanted to rebuild our inventory in the Northern
Hemisphere to be able to face the market. And what you see today is this rebuild of inventory because over the last two
years, we were in a slightly too low positions in terms of inventories.
So those two combined factors is what has led to where we are right now. We don't have any concerns about those
inventory. The good news about having been short over the last couple of years is these are very fresh inventories, and

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Christopher S. Parkinson>: Perfect. Thank you. Regarding the Intacta ramp-up for next year, you mentioned
you plan to have over 100 soy varieties next year in Brazil alone. Can you offer a little more color in what regions those
are in? Are those mostly existing states where you have a large presence and it's more penetration or some of the newer
ones? And then also, a quick update on Argentina would also be appreciated. Thank you.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah, good morning, Chris. I'll talk first about Brazil and then a little bit about Argentina.
So first of all, as we're going from what we had roughly 66 to 100, so call it an additional 30 varieties, I think you
should think about it as they're spread across the entire market. So in areas where we were weak or didn't have varieties
to introduce, we'll have new varieties. So it will look a whole lot like the first year or second year of Intacta in some of
the core areas.
And then in the core areas like the big Midwestern market, if you will, of Brazil in the south, it'll be adding to the
portfolio. So a farmer is going to have more choices of more varieties in those areas. But it will be evenly dispersed as
we move across. So the new areas we're going into, still be short on varieties. The areas we've been in for a couple of
years, they're going to have a lot of choices to make in Brazil.
In Argentina, we're really – I look at Argentina, as we're starting to ramp up in the northern part of Argentina, that feels
and looks a lot like Brazil and similar varieties, et cetera, in the central part of Brazil, it's maybe call it a little bit of an
expanded Ground Breakers. We don't have a lot of acres there and a lot of varieties. We had to build those varieties and
get ready to go there. And as you know, we started slower down there, so we're still working on that.
Most of it's in the north. The product performance has been really good in the northern part, and we're just now getting
a good look at it in the central part. The central part of Argentina is a little slower as you can – from a planting
standpoint. They don't plant till later in the year, so we're just now getting a good look at it and everything looks very
good. So I'm excited about Argentina. It's just a year or two behind Brazil.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: [indiscernible] (01:09:11) with a delayed start in these markets, we are running more varieties
earlier than we've ever done before.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Absolutely. And that's kudos to the breeding team that continues to ramp these faster than
we've ever seen, being able to bring those in. And it really helps the farmer, giving the farmer choices, so they end up
placing these varieties appropriately on the farm.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yeah.

Our next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar with Citi. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Yes, hi. Good morning.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Good morning, P.J.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: So I know you don't break out the exact acres of corn between Doubles, Triples, and SmartStax,
but can you qualitatively talk about what you're seeing in each product? And then secondly, just related to that, you've
got drought-tolerant corn in its second year. What would be the bottom line impact of drought in 2015?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: P.J., thanks for the question. Rob mentioned drought, so we started smaller drought products.
We now have the luxury of doing head-to-head comparisons with other products in the industry. And we've seen really,
really stellar performance, which I think will continue to leverage as we bring in the SmartStax platform as well as it
creeps across the country. But Rob, maybe a word on?
<A - Robert T. Fraley>: Yeah, just a little bit more detail of what's going on there, P.J., and Happy New Year. We
originally planned DroughtGard to be a Western Corn Belt product, and it was largely populated in our Double PRO
background. We've been so pleased with the performance of the product and there's a great deal of interest from the
grower community. I think Brett mentioned in his talks that we're basically sold out of DroughtGard. We have made
the decision to breed the DroughtGard trait into our core Midwestern genetics into what will be a DroughtGard
SmartStax PRO combination. And I mentioned in my talk that that will be a 10-gene biotech trait stack. So it's a great
feed of both breeding and molecular breeding to make that happen.
But there's a lot of interest among Midwest growers to have that drought protection. And one of the things we saw this
year that was so important for us was this was not a droughty year across the Corn Belt and we saw outstanding top-end
performance from our DroughtGard hybrids. So that interest and those results are what's enabling us to make the
decision to expand it across the Midwest.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: So, P.J., this is Brett. Just a little bit of color on the portfolio on how we look at it. Here's
the way I would frame it. Now that we've been at this refuge-reducing family for a number of years now, Triples
continued to shrink. Doubles and SmartStax continue to grow. And I would anticipate that that is exactly how it'll start
to shape up. Farmers that have significant insect pressure are looking for multi-traits to discourage resistance. Those
that don't have a lot of pressure, they're into Double. So that's why you keep seeing SmartStax grow and Double PRO
grow and Triples will get smaller.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: That's a good summary. Thank you, P.J.

Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McCarthy with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Yes. Good morning. A few questions on Roundup Ready 2 Xtend. Historically, if we
look at your new trait launches, I think it's fair to say the P&L impact in the launch here has been rather small due to
low acreage and the launch cost. I'm wondering how the increased scale of the Xtend launch might alter that equation.
Perhaps you could comment a little bit on the net effects there.

And then second, if we look a few years down the road, to what extent might potential success of this product displace
demand for glyphosate? And if that's material, how do you plan to manage through that?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yeah, Kevin, thank you. The first year I think will still be small, and we've learned over the
years, that first year, the name of the game in that first year is farmer trial, farmer exposure, and making sure that the
grower has a really great experience with the new product. So it's the P&L impact in that first year I think is small, but
the goodwill and the experience that we build really is the flywheel that generates growth in the second year and the
third year, and this one will be big. There's a lot of pent-up demand there, so where goes Intacta, there goes Xtend. It's
going to be a similar kind of ramp. Glyphosate, Brett, I mean it's...?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah, I think the way I look at it, Kevin, is I anticipate that every acre that has Xtend will
have Roundup on it, because Roundup still controls most of the weeds out there, and the value of Xtend is going to be
to help the farmer with the whole system control the more difficult to control weed. So I'm not looking at it from the
standpoint of how much Roundup gets displaced; I'm actually looking at it from the standpoint of how much more
Roundup gets sold as a system in the Xtend system where the farmer is getting superior weed control across his
cropping system.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Thanks. You touched on the issue of pest evolution earlier and farmers in Brazil are telling
us that they've been surprised at how fast some of the new pests are filling in for the ones you're controlling with
Intacta and Bollgard and that they're spraying more than they thought they would. So does that mean that the value
proposition in Brazil is different than it is in the U.S.? And does it mean that you need to introduce new products in
Latin America faster than you introduce them here?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Rob, maybe you could say a few words on evolution?
<A - Robert T. Fraley>: Yeah, I would say you're exactly on track and that's one of the reasons I emphasized in my
prepared remarks the fact that we now have four brand-new insect control technologies in Phase 4. Clearly, in the
South America environment, where you don't have the cycle between crops and the winter cycle, the evolution of pests
is a key challenge. And that's why I always emphasize our focus on not only the success of Intacta, but the
second-generation Intacta that has another mode of action, and then literally, we're working on the third-generation of
Intacta.
And similarly in corn, having multiple above and below ground technologies will be key for durable insect control in
those areas, and I think frankly that plays right into our power area. I mean I've mentioned all the phase advancements
in the pipeline. We have literally an explosion in our discovery program of new modes of action for insect control that
include not only the Bt-based products, but increasingly, the RNAi-based products that represent a new mode of action.
And so I see that as both a key enabler for our own seed portfolio, but also as a very attractive upside in terms of
licensing opportunity to other companies. And I think those are very significant. Thanks for the question.

<Q - Sandy H. Klugman>: Thank you. So a follow-up question on Xtend. Could you tell us where you are in terms of
receiving import approvals from China? And then with regard to a potential Xtend launch in Brazil, what's the outlook
for dicamba herbicide gaining regulatory approval in the region?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: [indiscernible] (01:17:50) Rob, on regulatory?
<A - Robert T. Fraley>: Yeah, so as we celebrated over the new year, the USDA recommendation, and that's exciting.
So we'll go through the normal process that you're familiar with. We'll be getting final USDA approval, EPA approval.
We'll be getting the approval over the top of the chemistry from the variety of states, and then we'll begin the
international approval.
So we've already received a number of international approvals. China will be among the last, because as you know,
their process starts later, but we've had great success over the history of our program in obtaining those approvals in a
timely fashion just like we saw with Intacta a few years ago, which I think puts us in the position in soybean to support
our commercial launch in 2016.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Brazil?
<A - Robert T. Fraley>: Yeah, and then in terms of the international opportunities, dicamba is already approved for
use in Argentina, so that will represent an attractive early opportunity as well as Canada and some of the other markets.
In Brazil, we're working closely with our partner, BASF, to move up the regulatory process and we actually have
Intacta 3, which will be the combination of yet another mode of action for bug control, plus the Xtend trait targeted for
about the right past the end of the decade in Brazil. So we're making lots of progress. We clearly see the Roundup
Ready Xtend soybean platform as really having the opportunity to fit across the 200 million acre base across the
Americas for soybeans and that's really exciting.

Our next question comes from the line of Frank Mitsch with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Yes. Good morning, folks. I was going to wish you a Happy New Year, but thinking that's
probably more appropriate greeting for you guys on September 1. So I'll make a mental note of it. Hey, Hugh, you
spoke about the near-term headwinds in ag persisting, but I guess on a positive front, we've seen a corn lift about 20%
since your last conference call. Have those headwinds lessened somewhat over the past three months? And what would
you term would be your greatest headwind or concern as you look out at the ag environment today?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yeah, Frank, thanks for the correction on September 1. I'll hold you at that Happy New Year.
Just for the record, I mean it's a tough environment, because acres have shrunk. But as I said earlier, we're bullish in
agriculture, I'm bullish in corn. And although we've seen two years of bumper harvest and the surplus there, the
markets are efficient and if you look at the drawdown on ethanol, especially with oil prices coming down and more
miles traveled, and you look at consumer behavior and increased consumption, I think we're going to see a faster
drawdown on those demand curves than we've ever seen before.
So between [ph] herbicides going (01:21:37) up, ethanol ramping, and China, the recent news on China consuming
more DDGs, I'm – if there's such a thing as a Scottish optimist, I'm fairly bullish on this one. The watchouts, Pierre, I
mean in terms against that optimism the continued watchouts.
<A - Pierre C. Courduroux>: So definitely, as Hugh was mentioning, I mean the key question is going to be around
the acres and definitely as you mentioned, Frank, I mean the evolution of the commodity price over the last couple of
weeks has been really helpful, but it's still a late season. So that's one we are watching extremely closely.

The other one from a macro perspective that we're watching and that we have integrated in our thinking obviously is
currency. We've integrated $0.15 to $0.20 of headwinds in our projections. We are pretty much there now. So at
present, we are in a good place versus our scenarios. However, that's something we are definitely watching on a daily
basis and something that's maybe a further headwind. But so far so good I would say.

Our next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson with BMO Capital Markets. Please state your question.
<Q - Joel D. Jackson>: Hi. Good morning. A question on Climate. You had a recent acquisition of 640 Labs. Should
we expect similar small dollar precision ag acquisitions going forward? And what are the largest gaps you see right
now in the current Climate offerings? Thanks.
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Thanks for the question. Yeah, I think we'll continue to see bolt-ons as we feel really good
with the establishment of the platform and the team in San Francisco has done really stellar work. We're busy on
integrating our machinery, the precision piece into The Climate and the 640 Labs is another extension of that. If you
look to the coming years, Rob, the remaining gaps, there may be a better sensor technology, perhaps?
<A - Robert T. Fraley>: Yeah, I mean this is obviously a super-exciting area and there's lots of innovations coming in,
spectral analysis and sensors that we will want to participate in, either through acquisition or through partnership. And
then I think the other important dimension is the opportunity for international expansion. This is a technology that's
going to move very, very quickly, driven by grower demand both by large farmers in South America, but small farmers
and small holders around the world, and we're going to want to, again, participate through acquisition or through
partnership in that space. And so, this is a transformational technology in agriculture and we want to drive it very hard.

Our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - John E. Roberts>: Good morning. Since this is a longer-term call, there's two big public policy debates that
maybe one of you could comment on. One is moving the food labeling out of the states. I mean, moving the food
labeling out of the states and into the federal regime, and the debate over in Hawaii about production over there, as well
as some of the testing plots and whether they can do state-level regulation versus again moving that to the federal?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: John, thank you. I'll maybe ask Rob to say a few words on Hawaii. On the labeling piece,
we've been really clear from the get-go in this, a voluntary program, we would completely support and have done from
the start. If there's a labeling initiative, we strongly believe that should be run as a federal program rather than a
patchwork quilt where you've got individual states applying their own benchmarks and thresholds.
I grew up in Europe before we saw one European Union, and it's really hard to move goods between the community.
And my worry would be if you have a disaggregated or a fragmented labeling program, it leads to increased expense
and cost of food for the consumer. So we continue to hope that we see some kind of consistency in a federally applied
program here.
<A - Robert T. Fraley>: Sure. And then regarding your question on the Maui County ban on GMO cultivation, just a
couple of background pieces there. So as you know, we filed litigation just before the holidays, which I think will be

decided somewhere in the late spring or early summer. We're very confident that we will prevail in that, and a large
part of that confidence is based on the fact that similar actions have been upheld in both Kauai and in the Big Island
and basically, deal with the fact that these are federally approved products and that states and counties can't ban.
Just a couple other things, just to maybe add a little bit more color since we do have the extra time. First of all, in an
absolutely worst case scenario where we didn't prevail, which like as I said, we expect we do; I just remind you that the
research that goes on in Maui is our early-stage breeding program, so there'd be really no near-term disruption on the
breeding program, and particularly, our commercial efforts.
Hawaii is a special place where we can plant corn most days during the year. It would be difficult and expensive to
replicate, but there are other parts of the world that we could make the decision to invest in and advance. But I don't
expect that to happen, because I think we've seen the precedent set from the past litigations. But thanks for the question.

Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - George J. D'Angelo>: Hi. This is George D'Angelo on for Laurence today. Just with the new price point on
Climate, can you sort of outline the strategies to sort of gain as much share as you can early on? And then how do you
eventually raise price?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Yeah, I think you just summarized it, George. It's driving grower experience, building
exposure to the platform, and I think once we have growers there and they become believers, then we can continue to
add value and bring more and more functionality to the platform. So Rob talked about the nitrogen advisor and a bunch
of work that the team has been doing this year. I think that becomes the next big add-on to those programs. So it's very
much a grower experience, and kind of what we talked about earlier on Xtend, so making sure that growers really
appreciate and build trust and confidence in the platform.

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Piken with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Michael L. Piken>: Yeah, hi. Good morning. Just wanted to dig a little deeper in terms of the Channel and the
shift. I understand you guys are moving maybe about $200 million in expected profits from 2Q into 3Q, but how do
you see Channel sort of evolving over the next couple of years as a percentage of your corn and soybean seed business?
And how much of this is being driven by your desire to grow the Climate platform and interact more directly with the
farmers?
<A - Hugh M. Grant>: Thanks for the question. We've done a lot of work with the Channel team in the last few years.
And, Brett, I guess you'd say that the performance has never been stronger.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah, we feel really good about our position with our Channel brand in the U.S. And the
way I always look at this is our goal is to sell farmers seed the way farmers want to buy seed, not the way we choose to
sell it. And that's why we have a large retail presence with our DEKALB brand that gives that choice. We've continued
to evolve the Channel brand, which has really found its place in the marketplace and it's getting stronger every year.
Yes, we do expect the Channel brand to continue to grow and grow as a larger part of the market.

As I think about it from the relationship with Climate, Climate creates a whole new relationship with the farmer on its
own. And I think what's important to think about what Climate is, it has the potential to be the integrating force across
the entire portfolio of all 40 decisions that the farmer makes, regardless of whether we sell the seed or the crop
protection, et cetera, there's a systems approach there that we can participate in.
Of course, we will do our best to have the best hybrids and the best choices with traits, et cetera, to be part of that
integrated package with the farmer that we would be selling and Channel would fit right in the middle of that. But
Climate goes well beyond our own seed footprint.
Laura Meyer
Okay. And I think we're right at time with that, so we want to be respectful of everyone's time. I'm going to pass it over
to Hugh for some closing comments, but thank you for all the questions today.
Hugh M. Grant
Yeah, thank you. Thanks, Laura. So as Laura said, thanks very much for joining us on this extended call this morning.
This became a tradition where we update the pipeline every single January.
I'd say there's no doubt that the first quarter affirms our confidence in our 2015 opportunity, and more importantly, it
reinforces the confidence that we have in our five-year plan to at least double our ongoing earnings per share as we
delivered on several key milestones including a record second year ramp with Intacta and continued progress towards
our capital allocation target.
Beyond this year with the R&D update that Rob walked us through, you can see that we're in a better position than ever
to deliver sustained waves of innovation across our multiple platforms and geographies, and that's innovation that
delivers value to our grower customers and our owners. And quite simply, that sets us apart in this extraordinary ag
space.
So from the team here in St. Louis, all the very best to you and yours as we start this new year. Thanks very much for
your support.
