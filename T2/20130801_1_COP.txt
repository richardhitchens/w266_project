MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the Q2 2013 ConocoPhillips earnings conference call. My name is Sherry, and I'll be your operator for
today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer
session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.
I will now turn the call over to Ellen DeSanctis, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. Ellen, you
may begin.
Ellen R. DeSanctis
Thank you so much, Sherry, and of course thank you to our listeners for joining this second quarter earnings call. I'm
joined in the room today by Ryan Lance, our Chairman and CEO; Jeff Sheets, our EVP of Finance and CFO; and Matt
Fox, our EVP of Exploration & Production. It's a very busy day for earnings activity. I know all of you are pressed for
time, so we're going to jump right into the material today.
Really quickly before we get started, if you would please turn to page two, you'll see our Safe Harbor statement. That
of course describes the risks and uncertainties in our future performance. Those are also described in our periodic
filings with the SEC.
I'm going to turn the call over to Ryan now.

Well, it's been just over a year since we launched the independent ConocoPhillips as a new class of investment. We've
laid out a plan that would deliver growth in volumes and margins with a compelling yield. I think as you'll hear and see
today, the key pieces of our strategy are falling into place. For the second quarter in a row, organic volumes net of
dispositions and planned downtime are growing. Margins are improving. We're maintaining our commitment to a
compelling dividend, reflecting our confidence in our plans, and our financial position remains strong.
So the theme of today's call is pretty simple. We are successfully executing on our business plan. We're doing what we
said we would do. We continue to keep our eye on the ball. And the top priority for all of us at ConocoPhillips is to
operate safely and execute our plans and programs.
So let's get started on slide four. Operationally, our business performed very well this quarter. We produced 1.552
million BOE per day on a total company basis and 1.51 million BOE per day on a continuing operations basis.
Adjusted for dispositions and planned downtime, this represents 4% organic growth compared to a year ago. Last
quarter, we grew 2% on the same basis, so the organic growth is showing up in our performance.
This quarter's volume performance exceeded the high end of our guidance range, and this was primarily due to two
things: better than expected performance at Eagle Ford and in our Europe and Asia-Pacific regions; and our seasonal
maintenance and planned downtime was executed ahead of plan. Based on this quarter's stronger than expected volume
performance, we're raising our third quarter and full-year volume guidance, which Matt will cover in more detail.
As you know, the second quarter was a very active period for planned maintenance, and we successfully executed key
turnarounds. That's essential to protecting our base assets. In addition, our development activities also performed well
this quarter. And remember, these are our lower risk programs with years of inventory that completely mitigate our
base decline. Of these, the Eagle Ford stood out in the second quarter. Production averaged more than 120,000 BOE
per day, almost double last year's second quarter rate and up 20% sequentially.
Our major growth projects are also on track. These are projects that will generate step function growth during the next
several quarters and years. And we have several near-term startups that Matt will also describe in detail. So
operationally, we're hitting the milestones we set for ourselves.
Now moving to the financial results, adjusted earnings were about $1.8 billion or $1.41 per diluted share. Adjusted
earnings were up 17% year over year. Excluding working capital, we generated $4.4 billion in cash from continuing
operations and ended the quarter with $4 billion of cash and short-term investments. On a year-to-date basis, our cash
from continuing operations plus our proceeds from asset sales have covered our dividend and capital programs.
Cash margins grew compared to last year's second quarter, reflecting the impact of product mix, prices, and location.
And strategically, this is one of the keys to achieving our value proposition is high-grading our portfolio by selling
non-strategic assets and redeploying those proceeds into organic investments that will drive future growth, and we're
making good progress on our announced divesture program. Since the beginning of this year, we have received
approximately $1.7 billion in proceeds from asset sales. And we expect to close Algeria, Nigeria, and Kashagan by year
end. These would add approximately $9 billion of additional proceeds in 2013.
As we have previously discussed, our portfolio efforts will now shift toward pruning and rebalancing the asset base.
We'll take opportunities to divest our smaller non-strategic assets such as the Southwest Louisiana conventional assets
that we sold in the second quarter. And we'll also look for ways to rebalance our interest in assets like the oil sands.
These are great assets but one where we believe we're a bit over-weighted in our portfolio today.
At the same time, we're monetizing assets, we're also adding to our conventional and unconventional exploration
inventory globally, and we're running this program at a high level of activity. Exploration success like we've recently
seen at Coronado and Shenandoah is key to sustaining organic growth longer term.
Despite this high level of activity, our 2013 capital outlook is relatively unchanged. We expect to spend about $15.9
billion on our continuing operations and $600 million on discontinued operations. That's a total of $16.5 billion, which
is an increase of about 4% compared to our announced total company budget. Of this 4% increase, about half reflects
our updated expectations around completing the sales of Algeria, Nigeria, and Kashagan. So this is capital that will

come back to us as adjustments at closing. The remainder of the increase, or about 2%, reflects various adjustments
across our asset base, including high-quality additions to our exploration portfolio.
Finally, we remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders. Right after the quarter ended, we increased our
dividend by 4.5%, reflecting confidence in our growth plans, and we remain committed to consistent dividend increases
over time.
So in summary, we had a strong year operationally, financially, and strategically.
So next you'll hear from Jeff and Matt, who will give you all the details, so if you'd please turn to slide five and let Jeff
begin his comments on our financial performance.
Jeff W. Sheets
Thank you, Ryan.
This quarter's adjusted earnings were $1.75 billion, or $1.41 per diluted share. This was above consensus, driven
primarily by the higher than expected volumes that Ryan just mentioned. Second quarter adjusted earnings were up
17% compared to last year's second quarter. And on earnings per share basis, adjusted earnings were up 19%, reflecting
the impact of our 2012 share repurchases. The year-over-year increase in adjusted earnings was primarily driven by
higher margins. The higher margins reflect the continued shift to higher valued liquids in the portfolio as well as a shift
to more favorable fiscal regimes. Average realized prices were flat and total company volumes were up modestly.
Now I'll cover our production performance for the quarter. So if you'll turn to slide six, total company production in the
second quarter was 1.552 million BOE per day. These results included 42,000 BOE per day from discontinued
operations. This chart shows the change in both continuing and discontinued operations compared to the second quarter
2012, but I'll focus on the continuing operations. Second quarter 2012 production from continuing operations was 1.489
million BOE per day. Adjusting for dispositions of 33,000 BOE per day, normalized production from continuing
operations was 1.456 BOE million per day in last year's second quarter, and that's the middle blue bar on the chart.
During the second quarter of 2013, planned downtime was 10,000 BOE per day higher than last year's second quarter,
which was mostly due to downtime in the North Sea. Growth of 219,000 BOE per day more than offset declines of
155,000 BOE per day. So normalized for 2012 dispositions and planned downtime, our production from continuing
operations increased by 64,000 BOE per day, which I'll explain more in the next slide. Year over year, this represents
4% organic growth and the second consecutive quarter on this upward trend.
Let me take a moment and talk about cash margin trends on slides seven and eight, starting with contributions from our
production group. So this chart on slide seven is a new one. It shows how our second quarter growth and changing mix
drove cash margin improvement compared to last year. As I just mentioned, volumes from our continuing operations
were up 64,000 BOE per day year over year, adjusted for dispositions and planned downtime. This chart shows the
change in this quarter's volumes by segment and product compared to last year's second quarter. So as you can see, the
relative growth, which is shown on the green bars, is primarily from higher value liquids. In addition, it's occurring in
areas with more favorable fiscal terms than the company average, and this isn't by accident, as we're focused on shifting
our portfolio and our investments to places with higher margins and better returns. Normal field declines in Alaska,
Europe, and North America natural gas somewhat offset the growth.
The impact of this shift on our cash margins can be seen on the next slide, slide eight. This slide shows sequential and
year-over-year cash margins both on a reported basis and a price normalized basis. As you can see on the chart on the
left, cash margins grew on a reported basis despite flat overall realized prices compared to last year's second quarter. In
terms of prices, we generally saw North America natural gas prices being offset by decreases in Brent crude prices. So
the chart on the left reflects the impact of product mix, prices, and location. And you can see from the chart that cash
margins grew both sequentially and year over year.

What the right side of this chart shows is an estimate of what our cash margins would have been if we had the same
pricing in all quarters. And we've used the second quarter of 2012 as a baseline, so that's pricing of $93 at WTI, $108
Brent, and $2.20 Henry Hub. You can see that on this price normalized basis that cash margins grew significantly year
over ear and also grew sequentially. So this metric will tend to be volatile on a quarter-by-quarter basis. However, we
expect this trend to continue as we shift our production towards higher value products in places with more favorable
fiscal terms. We'll continue to periodically track and report this metric as growing both production and margins is a key
aspect of our value proposition.
So now I'll turn to the segment slides, beginning with Lower 48 on slide nine. Production in this segment was 491,000
BOE per day. That's up 11% compared to last year's second quarter and up 3% sequentially. We saw this improvement
despite the sale of the Cedar Creek Anticline assets in the first quarter of 2013. Total liquids production in the segment
increased 20% compared to the same period a year ago and now represents 48% of the total mix for this segment, and
we expect our liquids percentage to continue to grow.
During the quarter, combined production from the Eagle Ford, Bakken, and Permian Basin averaged 203,000 BOE per
day, and that's up 47% from a year ago. These assets made up less than 9% of our total company production a year ago.
And today these assets comprise 13% of our total company production, and we expect they'll continue to grow.
Segment adjusted earnings this quarter generally reflect higher realized prices compared to the same period a year ago,
but they also include the Thorn dry hole cost and leasehold impairment of approximately $70 million after tax.
Excluding that charge, segment adjusted earnings would have been almost $250 million, so you can see the leverage in
earnings due to the growth and the shift to liquids.
Now let's cover the Canada segment on slide 10. Production in this segment was 271,000 BOE per day, roughly flat
compared to last year's second quarter. Liquids grew 12% year over year, while gas production declined 9%. This shift
has increased segment margins and should continue to improve margins over time. Production was impacted in the
second quarter by 9,000 BOE per day as a result of planned downtime at Christina Lake.
Canada's adjusted earnings of $5 million this quarter reflect stronger product pricing compared to last year and
sequentially. And as a reminder, the WCS prices in our supplemental information represent a one-month lag, which
better reflects our pricing for bitumen.
Now let's move to the Alaska segment on slide 11. Production in Alaska was 197,000 BOE per day this quarter. This
was down sequentially due to planned downtime at Kuparuk and Prudhoe Bay and normal field decline. But despite
lower sequential volumes, adjusted earnings were $585 million this quarter, which is up compared to last quarter.
Differences between the timing of production and sales explain much of the variance. The first quarter of this year
included an adverse impact to earnings of approximately $50 million from these lift timing impacts, while this quarter
included a benefit of about $25 million, a positive swing of $75 million. We continue to analyze the impact to our
business related to the recent passage of Senate Bill 21, and we expect to pursue additional opportunities for
investments over time.
I'll turn now to slide 12 and talk about our Asia-Pacific and Middle East segment. Production in this segment was
324,000 BOE per day during the second quarter, up 20% compared to a year ago and up 2% sequentially. Key drivers
of year-over-year performance were the resumption of normal production and growth at Bohai Bay, growth at the
Panyu project in China, and early production from Gumusut in Malaysia, which started late last year. Adjusted earnings
this quarter were unfavorably impacted by weaker prices, and impacts from lift timing were minimal this quarter.
Europe, the next segment, is found on slide 13. Production for the Europe segment was 173,000 BOE per day for the
quarter, a decrease of 34,000 BOE per day sequentially. This was driven by significant downtime in the Greater
Ekofisk Area in Norway and the J-Area in the UK. Compared to a year ago, lower production is driven by higher
planned and unplanned downtime, normal field declines, and dispositions. Second quarter adjusted earnings for the
segment were $261 million. And segment performance should improve when major projects startup occur in the UK
and Norway.

Before I wrap up the financial section of today's call with a discussion of cash flow, let me provide an update on our
corporate segment. Our corporate segment adjusted earnings were negative $164 million in the quarter. We are
updating our annual guidance for this segment to be $750 million after tax. That's a $150 million improvement
compared to our prior guidance. Additional information for the corporate segment and other international segments are
included in the supplemental information that we provided with the earnings release.
If you turn to slide 14, I'll cover our year-to-date company cash flow waterfall. Through the first half of 2013, we've
generated $8 billion in cash from continuing operations, excluding working capital. Through June, working capital was
about a wash for the year. Year to date we've generated $1.7 billion in proceeds from dispositions, primarily from the
sale of the Cedar Creek Anticline assets and partial working interest in the Browse and Canning Basin. So far we've
funded a $7.5 billion capital program for continuing operations and paid out $1.6 billion in dividends. Note that cash
flow from operations and proceeds from dispositions have covered our dividend and capital program.
The $1.3 billion in debt and other reflects the repayment of approximately $900 million of debt at maturity during the
quarter as well as capital associated with discontinued operations. Something to note, although we paid down $900
million in debt during the quarter, our debt balance was unchanged, as we recorded a $900 million capital lease
obligation for Gumusut's floating production system. We have $4 billion in cash and short-term investments on hand,
which is just slightly lower than where we started the year.
So in summary, our balance sheet and financial position remain strong, and we believe we're well positioned to execute
our investment programs and our value proposition for the company.
I'll now turn the call over to Matt for an update on our operations, beginning on slide 15.
Matthew J. Fox
Thank you, Jeff.
As both Ryan and Jeff mentioned, the main theme of this quarter's operational performance is that we're on plan, just
like last quarter. So I'm going to cover the operations material by our capital categories, beginning with our high quality
base assets. And as a reminder, our base assets refer to the assets that were producing at the end of last year.
During the second quarter, these base assets performed very well across all of our operations, and we had minimal
unplanned down time. So that means on average everything ran better than expected because in our forecasts we
actually assumed some unplanned down time.
We protect the operating integrity of our base assets through planned maintenance. As we discussed in the previous
quarter call, we had significant planned maintenance and tie-ins scheduled for the second and third quarters of this year.
In our operated assets alone, we noted that downtime would be 30% higher than our five-year historical average.
The chart on the lower left shows the major planned events for 2013 and their duration. As you can see, many projects
commenced later in the second quarter, and a couple of these are still underway. And others are scheduled to start in the
third and fourth quarters. I'll note a few highlights. In the North Sea, turnarounds were successfully completed ahead of
schedule at Ekofisk, Eldfisk, and the J-Area. These activities included tie-ins for the major project startups at Ekofisk
South, Eldfisk II, and Jasmine. Turnarounds in the Lower 48 were successfully completed as was the planned
maintenance at Christina Lake. We have additional planned downtime scheduled during the third and fourth quarters in
Alaska, the UK, Foster Creek, and Qatar. So our base operations are running well and our turnarounds are on or ahead
of schedule.
Moving on to our development programs on page 16, these development programs consist of lower risk drilling-led
activities around the world that completely mitigate our base decline and generate higher margins and attractive returns.
These programs remain on track to deliver about 600,000 BOE per day of production by 2017, as shown on the top left
graphic.

Our legacy conventional field development programs are on track. For example, in places like the Kuparuk field in
Alaska, our coiled tubing drilling sidetracks continued in the second quarter. In Western Canada, we continued to see
good results from margin enhancing drilling programs in the liquids-rich plays we're focusing on.
Results across our Lower 48 development programs are very strong. We produced 491,000 BOE per day in the second
quarter, and our high level of drilling activity continues. A couple of highlights, Bakken produced an average of 30,000
BOE per day, up 15% compared to the first quarter last year and up 3% sequentially. Heavy rains and flooding in the
area impacted our second quarter activity, but we're getting back on track with 11 rigs running.
The Eagle Ford exceeded our expectations in the second quarter of production and averaged 121,000 BOE per day,
almost double the same period last year and up 20% sequentially. During the second quarter, we brought on 65
operated wells, including catching up on some of the well backlog we have.
We continue to believe that our Eagle Ford position is truly best in class. The charts on the lower left of this slide
shows third-party data on our well performance compared to the top competitors in the play. We are one of the top
producers overall and we're producing higher oil volumes per well, more than 50% higher than the competitor average.
So clearly, we had identified the sweet spot when we established our position for only $300 an acre. We're currently
running 11 rigs in the play. We're on track to complete the drilling phase of acreage capture this year, and we're
transitioning to multi-well pad drilling for our more than 1,900 remaining identified locations.
Now let's discuss our major projects on slide 17. Our major projects remain on track to deliver about 400,000 BOE per
day of production by 2017, as shown on the top left graph. Our oil sands assets are performing as planned. The
combined oil sands properties averaged 100,000 BOE per day during the quarter, up 14% year over year. Currently we
have seven major oil sands projects in execution, and these projects are progressing on schedule. Christina Lake Phase
E started up in mid-July, slightly ahead of schedule. And we should ramp to about 20,000 BOE per day net from
Christina E within six to nine months.
Our Surmont 2 project is about 40% complete by the end of July and is on track for startup in early 2015.
In Alaska, our CD-5 project is on track. And we're progressing engineering work on additional satellite projects for
sanction in 2014. With the passage of SB21 in Alaska, we believe some of our Alaska projects are now more
commercially viable, and we expect to invest more capital in Alaska over time.
In Asia-Pacific and Middle East segment, our major projects are also on plan. Performance from our Panyu growth
project is running ahead of expectations. We had 23 wells online at the end of June versus 19 planned. And these wells
contributed about 7,000 BOE per day net in the second quarter. In Malaysia, key loadouts and lifts were achieved
during the second quarter. The floating production system from Gumusut is now in place. The Siakap North-Petai
project is on track, and we expect production from both projects to begin ramping up at year end.
At Curtis Island, module installation continued at APLNG during the second quarter. In June we raised the roof of the
first tank, a big milestone for the project, and we're still on schedule for first LNG for 2015.
Activity in both the UK and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea is very high. At Ekofisk South, we installed the new
project top-side facilities during the second quarter. And the project is on track to achieve first production by the end of
2013. Also during the quarter, we installed the jackets and bridges at Eldfisk II in preparation for first oil late next year.
At Jasmine, key installations were completed in the second quarter, and offshore hookup and commissioning work is
fully underway. First production from Jasmine is expected early in the fourth quarter.
The graphic on the lower left shows the expected production startups during the third and fourth quarter of this year.
And as you can see, the projects we've been talking about for a while are now coming to fruition. And we have more
projects scheduled to start up next year, including Eldfisk II in the North Sea, Kebabangan in Malaysia, additional
phases of the oil sands, Britannia long-term compression, and the South Belut project in Indonesia. So the delivery of
new production from major projects will start later this year and continue through 2014 and beyond.
Next, I want to briefly cover our exploration programs, starting on slide 18. Our exploration momentum continues on
several fronts. We're building inventory of both conventional and unconventional opportunities. We're advancing

several opportunities to the drill-ready stage, and currently drilling several operated and non-operated prospects.
There's a very high level of activity in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico program. The lower tertiary Ardennes well is
currently drilling. We have a 30% interest in this well. During the quarter, we acquired a 20% working interest in the
Gila prospect in the six-plus-block Gila JOA. This is a very large prospect that's also currently drilling and should reach
TD this quarter. And we have additional 100% ConocoPhillips leases within the Gila structure, so this is an important
well for us. The Deep Nansen wildcats and Tiber appraisal wells are expected to spud this quarter, and we have a 25%
and 18% working interest in these wells respectively.
In the Browse Basin of Australia, we're currently drilling the Proteus wildcat on an untested structure to the southeast
of the Poseidon discovery. We expect to reach TD soon. We completed our sale of our partial interest in the Browse
and Canning Basins in June as well. If you recall, this was part of a deal to gain access to potential shale opportunities
in the Sichuan Basin in China.
In Europe we were awarded one operatorship and three partnership licenses in Norway's 22nd licensing round in the
Barents Sea. This represents attractive future conventional inventory in a legacy area for the company. And we expect
to start testing our acreage in the Barents in 2014.
In the Kwanza Basin in Angola, we completed our 2013 3D seismic acquisition program in early April. Also, we
recently acquired an additional 20% working interest in Block 36, bringing our equity to 50%. We also have a 30%
interest in Block 37, and we're in full planning mode to begin drilling early next year. In addition, we've completed a
farm meant to see offshore blocks in Senegal. These blocks provide attractive acreage to test the West African
Cretaceous pinch-out play. And drilling in these blocks will start next year too.
Globally, we have activities underway in several unconventional plays. We expect to be drilling in Poland and
Colombia by year end. We also continue to drill and appraise the Duvernay and Montney plays in Canada. And we
continue to test plays in the Permian and Niobrara in the Lower 48.
So that was a pretty quick overview of our operations and exploration activity, so the key takeaways are this. The
operations are running well. The development programs are delivering. The startups of several growth projects are
imminent, and we've got a high level of exploration activity.
I'll wrap up my comments on slide 19 with a quick review of our 2013 production outlook. As Ryan mentioned in his
opening comments, we're raising our production outlook for 2013. This slide shows our actual 1Q and 2Q volumes and
our forecast volumes for the rest of the year on both a continuing and discontinued operations basis. The bottom line,
we're tightening our ranges in 3Q and 4Q. And we're bringing up the midpoint of our full-year range by about 20,000
BOE per day, or just over 1%.
As you can see, we expect third quarter volumes to be lower than second quarter, driven again by significant
turnaround and maintenance activities, in this case dominated by Alaska and the UK. Fourth quarter volumes should
ramp up from there as our planned downtime reduces and major projects start up. And we should see a strong exit rate
going into 2014.
Now please turn to slide 20 for Ryan's summary comments.
Ryan M. Lance
Thank you, Matt.
We're at the halfway mark for 2013. But more importantly, we're in the home stretch of a multiyear effort to transform
ConocoPhillips into a unique, compelling, independent E&P company.
So let me also summarize the key takeaways from this call. Operationally, we're approaching a very significant
inflection point for the company. We have several important milestones to achieve in the next two quarters, and we
should see good momentum coming out of 2013. We're building our inventory and delivering visible results from our

conventional and unconventional exploration programs that will sustain our growth well into the future. Importantly,
we expect to deliver our operational performance safely and efficiently.
Financially, we're committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet, and that can provide our financial flexibility. We're
seeing the early stages of cash margin improvement, which should continue as our volumes grow. And as always, we'll
maintain our focus on improving returns.
Strategically, we're delivering on our value proposition. We expect to complete our announced asset divestures in 2013.
And this will provide the financial flexibility to fund our investment programs, which are on track to deliver volume
and margin growth. And our dividend remains a top priority.
The bottom line, we're committed to creating long-term value by delivering 3% to 5% growth in both production and
margins with a compelling dividend.
So I hope Jeff, Matt, and myself have given you confidence that our plans are on track for delivering key milestones in
2013 that will certainly position the company for a very strong finish to the year and an exciting 2014.
So now with that, let's turn it back to the moderator and take your questions.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Faisel Khan.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Good afternoon, Faisel with Citi.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Hey, Faisel.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Hey, Faisel.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Hi. Just going to some of your comments on the transactions that you planned to close before
the end of the year, can you just give us an update on when you expect precisely when those transactions will close,
Nigeria and Algeria and Kashagan versus what you guys had expected when you announced those transactions earlier
on?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yes, thanks, Faisel. When we set up our plans last year, we were thinking towards the latter
half of the year, midyear, for some of the transactions maybe a little bit later. It looks now to us that we'll probably –
we'll complete all those transactions by the end of the year. They're complex, full country exits with respect to Algeria
and Nigeria and Kashagan, so you can probably appreciate the complexity that's there. But we're on track to finish
those by the end of the year, which is what we've said all along. In terms of planning, we were thinking maybe a few of
them would be done by midyear, but they'll stretch a little bit into the third and fourth quarters.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Is that influencing at all the guidance, the change in guidance at all, on a both continued
and discontinued ops basis?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yeah, so on the capital that we talked about, it is impacting the discontinued operations. About
half of the capital that we've talked about, the $600 million, roughly half, $300 million of that is due to those –
extending the dispositions, but we get that back through post-closing adjustments on each one of the transactions.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay, understood, and just one last question from me. In the Eagle Ford, a lot of industry
publications are talking about lower condensate pricing and lower realizations because of the, I guess, inability to move
all that condensate to market or to consume it in market. Any issues, can you elaborate a little bit more on how you're
seeing the pricing of your Eagle Ford crude versus some of these industry publications that are talking about it in terms
of discounts on some of those lighter grades?

<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yes, we don't sell our Eagle Ford crude as condensate, Faisel. It's a black oil that we are
selling. Others may be experiencing those sort of discounts; we are not.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Just to add on that a little bit, back when there was more of a spread between WTI and Brent
and LLS, our Eagle Ford oil tended to price between WTI and LLS. As that compressed, it's trading more towards a
WTI type number. But still, as Matt is saying, a full price, full oil price for that product.

Thank you. Our next question is from John Herrlin of Société Générale.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Yes, hi. I have three quick ones. Ryan, you mentioned rebalancing your oil sands exposure.
Should we expect this to happen over the next few years, or are you going to monetize, try to swap? What are you
going to do?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yes, thanks, John. We've got a very large position. We've got 100% acreage. We've got joint
ventures at Surmont and at FCCL [Foster Creek and Christina Lake]. We're looking at a number of different ways to
rebalance that portfolio. I wouldn't get specific on any one way. We're trying to do what's best for our shareholder,
what's best for our company. We want to maintain some exposure to the oil sands but rebalance what we do have. I
would say this year you ought to see some efforts along those lines, but that will continue probably well into next year
as well.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay, thanks. With respect to the Bakken and Eagle Ford, Matt, are you comfortable with the
degree of activity, or should we expect further acceleration in terms of your exploitation efforts?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: John, we're quite comfortable with the strategy that we have just now, which is 11 rigs running
in both the Bakken and Eagle Ford. We're running that in a pretty efficient way just now. We're well lined out to do
that. We're continuing to learn from pilot tests, for example, in the Eagle Ford. And we're keeping pace with the
infrastructure development, so I think we're going to keep on that sort of pace for some time to come yet.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay, last one for me. In terms of burgeoning plays or newer plays, Permian and Niobrara,
should we expect to see acceleration there in activity?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Well we have actually increased our activity there this year. We have three rigs running in the
Permian just now, testing the plays in the Delaware Basin and in the Midland Basin, and we're getting encouraging
results there. We've got one rig running in the Niobrara just now, and we're continuing to test that play across the pretty
extensive acreage that we have. So we're pretty active in both the Niobrara and in the Permian.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Thanks, I was just wondering if it was going to be incremental to where you were. That's all,
thanks.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Thanks, John.

<Q - Scott Hanold>: In the Eagle Ford, it sounded like you said you'd tied in 65 wells that you drilled during the
quarter and you had some backlog you put online. How many wells did you get online during the quarter? And you had
a pretty nice production bump. Was there any infrastructure that was added specifically in the quarter that also aided
the increase?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: So it was 65 in total that we put on in the quarter. About 20 of those were from the backlog
and the backlog reduction.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Okay. What is your backlog right now [indiscernible] (38:50)?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: It's about 85.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: About 85, yes, running 11 rigs, what is a normal backlog you'd expect to carry, and is there any
more opportunity to trim off that in the coming quarters?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yes, we're going to reduce that backlog as we work through the year. Of course, there's always
a backlog almost by definition. It takes time to hook up. But by the end of the year, we'll probably have 50 or 60 wells
that are drilled but not tied in.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Okay, got it. And then your 1,900 locations that you talked about drilling yet in the Eagle Ford,
remind me. What is the spacing that you assume there, and what are your thoughts on where that can go?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: That assumes 80-acre spacing. And we have pilot tests running, testing taking spacing down to
40 acres. But we don't have conclusive results yet as to what the optimum spacing might be. So those 1,900 continue to
be based on the 80-acre spacing.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Okay. How long will – or when should we hear about the more conclusive results? Is that an
end-of-year thing? Is that more 2014?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: That's more 2014, really, before we – information continues to come in. But before we would
draw any definitive conclusions, it's probably sometime next year.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Okay, any early thoughts though? Is it pretty encouraging so far?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: It really is too early to say, Scott. I don't see us increasing the spacing from 80 acres, but we
continue to look to see if there's value optimization in reducing that spacing.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Okay, and then one other thing on the oil sands plays. You talked about rebalancing that. Can
you remind me, so within your guidance for 2013, is there any effect of this rebalancing effort for the oil sands yet?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: No, there's not, Scott.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Ed Westlake of Credit Suisse.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: Yes, I guess continuing on the theme just around the shale portfolio, it feels like
obviously the Eagle Ford has been great for some of the companies who have been there, including yourselves. Do you
feel that your shale production, particularly in the liquids, will slow a little bit in 2014 and then reaccelerate as you add
activity to these other plays? Maybe give us some color about how you see the evolution of that.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: We expect to see production to continue to grow in the Eagle Ford, the Bakken, and the
Permian over the next few years. The Permian from an unconventional perspective, we're seeing a lot of potential there.

We're seeing probably at least two producing intervals in the Avalon, two or three in the Wolfcamp. So we continue to
be encouraged by the unconventionals in the Permian. And so time will tell just how much that contributes to growth in
the long term, but we do expect to see growth in the Eagle Ford, the Permian, and the Bakken for several years to
come, frankly.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: And then a question for Jeff, diving into the weeds on the cash flow statement.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Sure.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: Two line items, so this will be fun. Two line items that are difficult for us to forecast, one
is deferred taxes. And then there is a [ph] catchphrase (42:15) you have, which is other. Obviously, as we focus on cash
margins at the E&P level, obviously it has to translate into cash flow for the group. So on deferred taxes, is that
predominantly U.S., or is there some international component in there, in the 2013 number so far?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Yes, there is. A big part of it is U.S., but also Norway and the UK are pretty substantial
contributors as well. If you think about the tax, what deferred taxes is, it's just where you're able to take more rapid tax
depreciation than financial depreciation. And the UK and Norway both have fairly accelerated tax depreciation. And of
course, the U.S. has some IDC [Intangible Drilling Costs] benefit as well.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: And then on the other line, it was a $500 million swing first quarter to second quarter.
Can you just talk – that is in that other line? Thanks.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: That is a difficult one because there are a lot of things that go into the other line. Maybe just a
little bit of – if you think about how to think about all the things that go into the cash flow statement for us overall,
when we talk about cash margins, we take a very simplified approach and just have net income plus DD&A and talk
about that as our cash margin. But for us going forward, deferred tax is probably a pretty substantial positive for us this
year and probably on into next year. But a lot of the other items on the cash flow statement are going to generally offset
each other. You'll see that cash flow from operations other line, it's going to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. Probably
for the year, that's probably a couple hundred million dollar negative typically.
In particular, though, if you looked at the first quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of last year, those are
unusually negative numbers, and those were both the results of some special items which had positive effects to income
but were non-cash impacts, where the offset to that is in the cash flow from other line. So I would say the fourth quarter
and first quarter were pretty anomalous numbers for that line item. And you should think of that line item as being
more of a few million – few hundred million dollar negative for the year for most years.
<Q - Edward G. Westlake>: That's very helpful, thanks, Jeff.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Thanks, Ed.

Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Cheng of Barclays.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Hey, guys.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Hey, Paul.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Hi, Paul.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Hi. Matt, in the Eagle Ford, you're saying that you're going to move into pad drilling. How
many rigs are actually already in pad drilling at this point?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: We've got four or five that are currently pad drilling in the Eagle Ford.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: And so as we move, I presume that by mid of next year, the second quarter or so, you're going
to be 100% in pad drilling. And at that point, what is your best guess in terms of your unique costs would change, 10%

– 15%, of the improvement, or do you think that you may be able to drive better than that?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Time will tell. We know that we'll see improved efficiencies from the pad drilling with fewer
rig moves and all the other benefits that come from pad drilling. But I think it's too early, Paul, to put a number out
there. We know we'll see efficiencies, but I wouldn't put a number on it just now.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: And I'm not sure that – maybe I missed it. I have to apologize if that's the case. Are you guys
ever coming out with maybe a longer-term production or resource target for Eagle Ford and Bakken, let's say by 2017?
How much do you think that those two areas will be able to produce at?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: We haven't come out with any updated view of that yet.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: But we've got it in the analyst meeting material both for Bakken and actually for all the
Lower 48 plays in the analyst meeting materials...
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: That we put out last year. So, Paul...
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: ...in February.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Any kind of update?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: No, we're really working through that process now. The great part about getting to the position
now where we've got the Eagle Ford acreage primarily held by production is we've got a lot of flexibility to step back
and ask ourselves what is the optimal way to develop that field. And we've got a lot of work going on to do that right
now.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Right. And, Jeff, along that line, Matt painted a pretty rosy picture in terms of all the
opportunity. So from a CapEx standpoint, are you guys still looking at around in the $16 billion a year over the next
several years, or does that also start to – may need to see some adjustment?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: No, Paul. We're targeting that $16 billion annual number, so we see some changes in the mix as
we go forward over the next five years. We've got some major projects that start ramping down. And we see some
opportunities in our base plans, as Ellen described, that ramp up some of the unconventional North American stuff. But
no, we still think $16 billion is the right number to use.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Ryan, since you guys are up this year production target a bit, how about next year? Is there any
change?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: No, not at this point.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Not at this point. And then finally, Matt, in the Eagle Ford, you're running 11 rigs. In the
Bakken you're also running 11 rigs, but it does look like you have a stronger position in the Eagle Ford. Is there any
reason why you're running a similar number of rigs? I presume the CapEx – I'm not sure that if you run over 11 rigs
that the CapEx program on the two basins at this point are dramatically different for this year. Is there any particular
reason why you haven't shifted more of your effort into the Eagle Ford?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: We're managing the pace of activity to make sure that we don't get ahead of infrastructure, to
make sure that we're able to run safely and efficiently. And the reason you don't see so much production appearing in
the Bakken from the 11 rigs we have running is we've got – probably our average working interest in the Bakken is
50% or less, whereas in the Eagle Ford it's in the high 80% to 90%. That's why you're not seeing the same on the
bottom line. The underlying rates from the Eagle Ford are better than the Bakken as well. We're really trying to make
sure that we're managing and running an efficient, safe program with these rigs.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: So we should assume the 11 rigs for each basin is at least here to stay for the next one or two
years?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Certainly the intention is to stay around that level for the next year or so, yes. And we'll learn
as we go. We'll learn from our pilot tests and we may adjust that. But right now, yes, for modeling purposes, that's what

Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Leggate of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Hi, thank you, guys. I appreciate you taking my questions. Hi, guys. I've got a couple of quick
ones, please. So you have mentioned that you might consider having a look at an Alaska in terms of perhaps
incremental investment. You've also got interests in what is a growing suite of exploration success. In terms of
long-term capital planning, how should we think about balancing those two items? Does the CapEx go up to
accommodate those incremental projects, or does it get reallocated away from different areas, if you could help us with
that? And I've got a follow-up, please.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: So the $16 billion number includes assumptions about major capital projects that will come,
for example, from our exploration program. And any increase that we see in Alaska is also included in opportunities
that we're modeling within the $16 billion overall program. And so you shouldn't see an increase from $16 billion to
accommodate those.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay, and those major capital projects, are they also included in your production outlook, Matt?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yes, they are, yes.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Just to be clear, they're not in – when we talked about our production outlook out through 2016
and 2017 at the analyst presentation, those are not – we don't have anything for the Gulf of Mexico discoveries in that
production outlook. But we have had some assumptions that as we get toward the end of the period we are going to
start spending capital there. And you'll see that production probably show up outside of the time period we've talked
about, where we've talked about production guidance.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: That makes sense.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: So there's capital going into those projects in the Gulf of Mexico, for example, but no
production. In Alaska, we were not assuming in our plans last year that we would see incremental production in Alaska.
That incremental production will be tied to activity associated with SB21. But we do have the capital flexibility to
accommodate that.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Got it. My follow-up, Matt, is maybe just on some of the well results you've had recently on
both the Bakken and the Eagle Ford. We're monitoring this stuff, and it looks like just in the last couple of months
you've had some pretty stellar well results. I'm just wondering if you can confirm you're seeing that in your production
trends and if you could maybe help us understand if something has changed. Are you drilling a particular area? Are you
changing well design? What's going on there? And I'll leave it at that, thank you.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yes, we're continuing to evolve, for example, our frac design in places like the Eagle Ford, the
number of stages that we pump, the volume of proppant that we pump. And we're doing that as we learn from our pilot
tests, and what we're learning is that more stages and more proppant makes a difference. So going forward, we're going
to be continuing to optimize that.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: So are you seeing your 2013 vintage wells delivering better than let's say 2012 – 2011 wells?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yes. On average, that's what's going on, yes.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Okay, great. I'll leave it there, thanks.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Thanks, Doug.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Thanks, Doug.

Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Good afternoon, guys.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Just can I clarify on the disposal program? I think you said you expected it to be complete by
2013. I assume you're referring to Nigeria and Algeria. Could you just repeat – excuse me if I missed it – what you said
about Canada as well? I know that things changed there a bit versus your expectations. I wanted to just understand how
you're thinking about that going forward. Thanks.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yes, thank you, Paul. In terms of Canada, we're continuing to look at the opportunities. We
may see a little bit before the end of the year, but most of what we're trying to do in Canada will stretch well into 2014.
Now if you're referring to Kashagan, you probably have seen the news. We were notified in early July by the
Kazakhstan government that they've elected to preempt on the arrangement that we had with OMV, and we're in
conversations and discussions right now with them on a purchase/sale agreement, and those are going quite well. So
that's progressing along.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Okay, because my understanding was that in the likely order of events, it would be first
Nigeria, then Kazakhstan, and – excuse me, first Algeria, then Kazakhstan, and Nigeria was difficult to second-guess.
In terms of the Kazakh agreement, I would assume that's fairly straightforward. They would pay the same price that
was offered by ONGC?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yes, that's correct.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Right, so that should go pretty quickly, and then obviously the other two. I guess that you're
finding these deals are highly accretive to you, right?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yes. No, you're absolutely right.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: So it would be logical to consider further disposals for next year to continue the accretion?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: I think as I tried to explain, I think when we get done with the three that we've described here
today, we've got some rebalancing we want to do in the oil sands that we talked about. And then I think it's healthy and
prudent to continue to prune the portfolio on the low end. So there's some modest level of divestures that we see out
over time in the portfolio, in the $1 billion to $2 billion range or something like that. But we don't have any large ones
that we've talked about other than looking at trying rebalance in our oil sands position.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Yes, I understand. And then obviously, the 3% to 5% double target that you've got, as I think
Paul Cheng highlighted, is basically unchanged by today's better outlook for this year's volumes.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Yes. No, we're sticking to the 3% to 5%. Again, we pinned that back when we came out a year
and a half ago. So you can do the math and do different numbers, depending upon when you pick your starting point
and ending point. But I'm anchored back to when we came out as an independent company in May of last year. And
that's our commitment over the next four to five years is you'll see that kind of growth in both margins and volumes for
the company.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: And just to completely reiterate what's been said before, you're basically saying that at that
point you would be covering the dividend and the CapEx annually based on I think it was $110 oil, is that right, by
2017?
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: it's probably a little bit lower oil price. We don't assume $110 oil. We're probably more like
$90 to $100 prices and middle-$3 Henry Hub prices. And yes, we start fully covering our CapEx and dividend in the

next couple of years, but that deficit starts shrinking pretty quickly over the next couple years. So it's very manageable
with the proceeds that we estimate we'll have by the end of this year, the cash we'll have on the balance sheet. That's
the plan and we can cover it very easily at that point.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Okay, great. I understand that. And sorry again, I apologize if I missed this. But was there a
specific update on the progress in Australia and where your project stands relative to the other two major projects going
on down there?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: The APLNG is in good shape. The project just now is about 45% complete, and we are making
good progress. We're still on track for starting up in 2015.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: And there was a cost review, I believe, that came through with some new numbers.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yes, and we reviewed the results of that at the analyst meeting earlier in the year, and there's
no change from what we described then.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Other than we've seen some fairly significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus the
Australian dollar, which has probably mitigated some of the cost increases we thought we were seeing in U.S. dollar
terms.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Yes, what I think we said was a 7% increase in the underlying cost in the as-spent currency,
and that was looking like a 20% increase in U.S. dollars. Depending on how FX goes, it might not be quite a 20%
increase on a U.S. dollar basis now.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Great. Thanks, guys. That's helpful. Thank you.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Thanks, Paul.

Thank you. And the final question we have time for is from Kate Minyard of JPMorgan.
<Q - Katherine L. Minyard>: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question.
<A - Ryan M. Lance>: Hi, Kate.
<A - Ellen R. DeSanctis>: Good morning, Kate.
<Q - Katherine L. Minyard>: Hi, just a quick question for Jeff. Thanks for providing the color on slides seven and
eight. Can you talk about the cash margin improvement that might be stemming from a difference in cash taxes
between 2012 and 2013 just as you've changed some of the geographic distribution of production? Is there any impact
there that you can help us extract?
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: So you're trying – the question was whether deferred taxes are a part of that?
<Q - Katherine L. Minyard>: Right, just different cash tax rates between the regimes, exactly.
<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: Really, the benefit comes from just pretty much – the cash margin benefit comes from where
we've added production. And we've added production primarily in Canada and the Lower 48 and in Asia. And those are
all at tax rates which are less than our current average tax rate.
When we do this cash margin calculation, we do a simple calculation so we can have some comparability to other
companies, where we just take net income plus DD&A and call that our cash margin. So deferred taxes don't come into
what we talk about when we talk about cash margins.
<Q - Katherine L. Minyard>: Okay.

<A - Jeff W. Sheets>: As I mentioned, as you're thinking about cash flow models and things like that though, you
should think of deferred taxes as being like you've seen in the first couple quarters of this year that that is going to
continue on because of where we're spending our capital dollars.
<Q - Katherine L. Minyard>: Okay, all right, thanks, and then just another question on Alaska. As you guys look at
evaluating additional investment opportunity, you specifically talk about the evaluation in light of SB21. How are you
taking into account potential marketability of the crudes as well? And what specific type of crude would your
investments be targeting? Is it light or is it heavy? And how does marketability play a factor?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: I'm assuming the opportunities that we're looking at are predominantly light oil opportunities
with production similar to the API that we have just now. We also see opportunities in heavy oil in Alaska. But that
would be a bit further out and before we would see a significant increase in that.
<Q - Katherine L. Minyard>: Oka, and no long-term concerns around marketability?
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: No.
<Q - Katherine L. Minyard>: Okay. All right, great, thanks very much.
<A - Matthew J. Fox>: Thanks, Kate.
Ellen R. DeSanctis
Thanks, Kate. Why don't we go ahead and wrap it up? We're a little past the hour. And again, we really appreciate
everybody's time and attention on such a busy day. We will have a replay of this call on our website shortly. And of
course, you're always welcome to call anyone on the Investor Relations team for further color. Thanks so much. Have a
great afternoon. Sherry?
