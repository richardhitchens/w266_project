Ursula M. Burns
Good morning and thanks for joining us today. During the fourth quarter, we delivered results that reflect consistent
progress on our strategy. Our shift to a Services-led growth portfolio is paying off. Services revenue now represents
52% of our total revenue and is growing at a steady pace. Through improved margins, our bottom line is benefiting
more from this top-line growth. We have a clear understanding of the market dynamics in our Document Technology
business. It remains a very profitable, cash generating operation. We're maximizing good profit by lowering the cost
base and shifting investments to focused areas of growth and we're generating strong operating cash flow, $2.6 billion

in 2012. This gives us flexibility to invest for growth and build shareholder value. We bought back more than $1 billion
in Xerox stock in 2012 and share repurchase will remain part of our balanced approach to capital allocation.
Xerox is a company that is going through a seismic transformation. 2012 was a year of alignment. Getting our costs
aligned with a Services-focused business model, getting our investments in line with key priorities, getting our diverse
portfolio aligned with market opportunities and getting our operations in line to address these opportunities. We're
doing this through a customer-centric approach that takes full advantage of our brand, innovation and global scale. I
feel good about our progress and I am confident that we will deliver strong results in 2013.
Here is a closer look at Q4 results. We reported adjusted EPS of $0.30. As planned, adjusted earnings include $0.05 of
restructuring. Adjusted EPS excludes $0.04 related to amortization of intangibles, resulting in GAAP EPS of $0.26.
Total revenue of $5.9 billion was down 1%, or flat, in constant currency. Growth came from our Services business, up
7% in the quarter and reflecting solid results across the board.
Business process outsourcing revenue grew 8%. IT outsourcing was up 15% and document outsourcing was up 2%.
Segment margin also improved in Services. At 11.2%, Services margin was up 90 basis points. This is very good
progress and puts our margins right in the range of our expectations.
Signings in Q4 were lower year-over-year. With the nature of our business, any 90-day cycle will bring ups and downs,
especially factoring in prior-year compares and long purchasing cycles. Considering the nearly $11 billion in total
business signings during 2012, I remain confident that our pace of signings today aligns well with our future revenue
growth expectations.
In our Document Technology business, revenue declined 8%. We made disciplined decisions in 2012 to be
conservative in how we manage this business. Because of economic uncertainty across most regions, we put our focus
on reducing the cost base, while expanding distribution through indirect channels. As a result, segment margin in
Document Technology improved. At 12.3%, it's well above our target range and gives us flexibility to make important
investments this year.
We're about to launch a refresh of products in the first quarter and we are ramping up marketing investments while
broadening our channel partnerships, positioning us better to pursue the growth opportunities in small and midsize
businesses. As a result, we expect to see improving trends in install levels and equipment sale revenue this year.
Operating margin in the fourth quarter improved 30 basis points to 10.3%. Gross margin was 31.5%, selling,
administrative and general expenses were down $56 million and represent 18.5% of revenue. We generated $1.8 billion
in cash from operations during the fourth quarter, $2.6 billion for the year, including the sale of certain finance
receivables and we allocated $334 million of that quarterly cash to buy back shares.
The fundamentals of our strategy are delivering as expected. We're managing our Services business for growth. In
Document Technology, we're maintaining leadership in a profitable growth segment, while benefiting from the overall
profitability of this mature business. As a result, Services now represents 52% of our total revenue, up from 48% just
one year ago. This mix shift will continue, with Services growing to two-thirds of our revenue by 2017. That growth
then fuels our annuity stream, which is now 83% of our total revenue. It's up 3% in constant currency during the quarter
and during 2012, we generated $18.9 billion in recurring revenue.
Equipment sales are becoming a much smaller percentage of our business, down 13% this quarter, they're the most
impacted by economic and industry trends. We expect the equipment sales trend to improve modestly this year. We're
launching new products and we're targeting investments that will boost our share of the digital color and SMB market.
Summing up the quarter, the strong growth in Services and consistent profitability of our Document Technology
business, generated significant operating cash flow and contributed to earnings that met our expectations.
Before I turn it over to Luca, let me take a moment to offer my thanks to him. As you know, Luca is leaving Xerox on
February 28. He's been a fantastic business partner and is a steadfast supporter of our business strategy. I know his
contributions to Xerox will serve his successor, our company and our shareholders well for long term.

Thank you, Luca.
Luca Maestri
Thank you, Ursula, for the very kind words and good morning, everyone. I will begin by reviewing earnings and then,
will cover our two segments' cash flow and capital allocation. During the quarter and also for the full year, revenue was
flat at constant currency. We continue to see good growth in Services, up 7% in Q4 and, as Ursula said, now
representing 52% of total revenue, while Technology remains pressured and was down 8%.
An area of focus for us during Q4 was Services margin and we made really good progress. This improvement in
Services also drove overall margin improvement. In total, operating margin of 10.3% was up 30 basis points
year-over-year. Gross margins were lower because of the higher mix of Services revenue, but this was more than offset
by continued improvement in SG&A and R&D.
As planned, restructuring in the quarter was higher year-over-year and came in at $93 million, as we initiated actions to
improve the Services cost structure and maintain Technology profitability. For the year, restructuring of $153 million
was $120 million higher than in 2011. The 2012 actions have been taken in order to position us for margin
improvement in 2013 and we'll continue to manage our cost base proactively going forward, with ongoing modest
restructuring initiatives.
Equity income grew $9 million, driven by profit growth at Fuji Xerox and adjusted tax rate was 23% in the quarter,
lower by about three percentage points year-over-year. Adjusted EPS of $0.30 in Q4 was lower than in 2011 by $0.03
cents. And full year adjusted EPS of $1.03 was lower by $0.05. These results reflect the negative impact of the higher
restructuring in 2012 and the pension curtailment gain of $107 million which we recognize in Q4 of 2011.
Moving onto the Services segment. Revenue growth came in at 7% in Q4, BPO was up 8%, ITO was up 15% and
document outsourcing up 2%. We have seen steady growth in BPO all year and in Q4, we are seeing results in
customer care, state government and transportation. ITO revenue really accelerated this quarter, as we began to see the
full benefit from the very strong 2011 signings.
Document outsourcing growth was somewhat lower in Q4, impacted by some decision delays in the enterprise space.
Signings in the quarter were lower year-over-year. This was fully expected, as ITO had two mega deals in 2011 that
made the compare extremely challenging. BPO and document outsourcing signings were essentially flat
year-over-year. And in total, Q4 had the highest new business signings of the year from an annual recurring revenue
perspective.
The average contract length was approximately three years for BPO and ITO, considerably lower than our historical
average of approximately five years and dampened the signings number when looking at total contract value. The
BPO/ITO renewal rate in Q4 was below target of 79% and reflected some timing factors in price discipline. For the
year, however, renewal rate was 85%, which is in our target range and five points higher than 2011.
We remain confident that we will continue to see mid to high single-digit Services revenue growth in 2013. As we
discussed at our investor conference, our recurring revenue model provides us with good line of sight to expected
revenues. And even though overall signings this year have been lower, we have achieved what we expected from new
business signings and renewal rates in order to support our growth plans going forward.
Turning to margins. Services segment margin of 11.2% increased 90 basis points year-over-year and 180 basis points
sequentially, ahead of our expectations. The sequential margin increase was driven by the initial benefit from our cost
actions, the absence of negative one-offs, improvements in document outsourcing and some level of seasonality.
Year-over-year, the improvement came mainly from document outsourcing, where we benefited from lower SG&A.
We also had good margin improvement in a number of BPO lines of business, including state government services,
customer care and transportation.

We continue to expect to be in the 10% to 12% range for the full year and we expect Q1 margin to be lower than Q4,
but modestly better on a year-over-year basis. So overall, a good quarter for Services with welcome progress on
margins and continued strong revenue growth, which positions us well as we enter 2013.
Let's now turn to the Technology segment. Technology revenue was down 8%. The revenue decline continued to be
driven by lower equipment revenue, which was down 14% and was impacted by the soft micro-environment and
continued focus on segment profitability. As we look ahead, we have a significant Mid-Range and Entry production
color product announcement coming next month and we fully expect activity and equipment revenue to show
improving trends as we move through the year.
In terms of product segments, good growth continued in Entry A4 products as more purchasers are moving to
multifunction devices in this segment. Mid-Range activity was down in the quarter, partially because the upcoming
product launches are centered around this category. And High-End continued to show good color growth, driven by
Entry production in iGen, which offset the secular decline in black-and-white.
Segment margin of 12.3% was up 60 basis points from 2011, well above our target range, reflecting cost and expense
control and a gain that we realized as the result of the sale of a portion of our finance receivables.
As we transition in 2013, we believe we have set reasonable expectations for Technology with mid single-digits
revenue declines and margins within our target range of 9% to 11%. We believe there are opportunities to support these
objectives, including new product launches, recent favorable currency trends and easier compares in Europe.
Turning to the key metrics slide. I've already commented on much of this data, but in summary, total Services signings
for the year have been clearly lower, but the underlying trends are more positive than the decline would imply. We
actually signed 7% more deals in BPO and ITO than in 2011, but there were fewer mega deals and contract lengths
were shorter. This, combined with lower renewal opportunities, resulted in lower signings. However, as explained
before, we did meet the new business annual revenue and renewal rate targets needed to support our 2013 revenue
plans and our pipeline remains very strong and it is up 6% year-over-year.
Document Technology metrics remained relatively stable, in line with annuity revenue. Install growth was softer in the
quarter, but should improve with the new product launches. MIF continues to grow and page volumes are still relatively
in check. Color revenue was weak, driven by lower equipment revenue mix.
If we now turn to the next slide, I will take a moment to review cash flow. Cash from operations in Q4 was strong at
$1.8 billion, in line with seasonality, and resulted in $2.6 billion for the full year. This exceeded our guidance of $2
billion to $2.3 billion due to an additional finance receivable sale in Q4, which contributed a net $269 million to cash
flow when considering the natural runoff of the sold receivables.
Cash contributions to our global pension plans were $54 million in Q4, $364 million full year, a $62 million reduction
versus 2011. We expect pension contributions in 2015 to be more than $100 million lower than in 2012, driven by the
change in funding requirements brought about by recent pension legislation in the U.S.
Working capital was a significant contribution to cash in the quarter, in line with usual seasonality. In particular,
inventory was a source of $128 million for the quarter and flat for the year. Accounts payable was a source of $346
million in the quarter and a use of $86 million for the year. And accounts receivables was a source of $365 million in
Q4 and a use of $306 million for the year, which was $390 million worse year-over-year. This reflects lower
contribution from factory compared to 2011 and growth in our Services business.
Finance receivables generated $947 million in 2012, $580 million of this contribution comes from the two finance
receivable sales that we did in the year, one in Q3 and one in Q4. The remaining $367 million comes from the runoff of
our finance portfolio due to the lower equipment revenue.
We spent $513 million on CapEx for the year, which is fully in line with our guidance and we deployed $276 million
towards acquisitions. Dividends paid were $255 million for the year and we repurchased $1.05 billon of stock during
the year.

For 2013, we continue to expect $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion in cash flow from operations. We expect lower pension
fund requirements, but finance receivables will be a lower contributor to cash by approximately $500 million, due to
fewer collections associated with the 2012 finance receivable sales and a lower natural runoff of the portfolio, given
our expectation of better equipment activity. We expect the rest of working capital to be essentially flat year-over-year.
The next slide covers in more detail our capital structure and capital allocations plan. We ended the year with $8.5
billion in debt, about $100 million lower than planned. Our cash ending balance was over $1.2 billion, $344 million
higher than at the end of 2011. The greater debt reduction and higher cash balance from the strong cash flow in Q4
position us well to meet our capital structure objectives for 2013, which include retiring the $400 million senior note
that comes due in May.
Turning to capital allocation. We met our 2012 objectives with the largest portion of our cash flow going to share
repurchase. For the year, we spent $1.05 billion on the repurchase of 146 million shares, reducing shares by 114 million
on a net basis. This represents a 9% net reduction in common shares outstanding for the year.
We are maintaining the 2013 capital allocation guidance that was provided at the investor conference in November,
which includes at least $400 million in debt reduction; up to $500 million in acquisitions, which will be largely focused
on the Services business; dividend payments of $300 million, which reflects the planned 35% dividend increase
beginning in April; and share repurchases of at least $400 million.
So in conclusion, overall, a very good quarter across the board. I have great confidence. Great confidence that Xerox is
very well positioned, both strategically and financially, to take advantage of the growth opportunities in Services and to
strengthen our leadership position in Technology during 2013.
With that, I will hand it back to Ursula.
Ursula M. Burns
2012 [ph] delivered (20:14) its share of challenges. Thank you, Luca. But it also gave us an opportunity to refine our
business model and improve operational efficiency, all while growing our Services business. This progress gives me
confidence in our ability to deliver a strong 2013.
For the first quarter, we expect adjusted earnings of $0.23 to $0.25 per share. Our guidance for the full year remains
unchanged. We expect adjusted EPS of $1.09 to $1.15 and our strategy remains very sound, we're shifting to a
Services-led growth portfolio. You see it in our results every quarter. We're maintaining our leadership in Document
Technology. Product and platform news next month will demonstrate our commitment to this profitable business. With
improving margins, cost controls and steady growth, we'll consistently expand earnings and generate strong cash.
With that, we'll continue to take a very balanced approach to our capital allocation, which creates value for our
shareholders. That's a good place for me to end.
Before we open it up for questions, let me turn it over to Jim Lesko, the Head of Investor Relations.
James H. Lesko
Thanks, Ursula. Joining Ursula and Luca today, is Lynn Blodgett, Head of Xerox Services. Also let me point out that
we have several supplemental slides at the end of our deck. They provide more financial detail to support today's
presentation and complement our prepared remarks. At the end of our Q&A session, I'll turn it back to Ursula for
closing comments.

Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Shannon Cross of Cross Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much. Ursula and Lynn, can you talk a bit more about the Services
business? Where you think you are with restructuring? Maybe some comments about your conservative outlook on deal
pricing? And then I'm curious, especially Lynn, given your history, if you think the trend is – the lack of mega deals is
something that is just sort of cyclical? Or is this a change in how customers are thinking about things? And then, I have
a follow-up on Technology.
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: Thanks, Shannon. As far as the restructuring activity, we've made some good progress in the
fourth quarter. We're not finished, as we said in the investor conference, we're really focused on costs. We have a great
revenue model and just need to make sure that our costs stay in line. So we have more work to do and we'll see that
through the balance of 2013. But we've made really good progress in this quarter.
As far as deal pricing, there's always downward pressure on deals. That's just part of our model. We know that when
we come up for renewal, or when we're bidding a new deal, that the pricing will be down and the percentages that we
have seen in the past aren't changing dramatically, so there hasn't been a significant change there.
As far as mega deals, we didn't see – last year, we had eight mega deals, excuse me, in 2011, we had eight mega deals,
in 2012, we had three. And that was a significant change, as primarily in the ITO business as Ursula pointed out. But
we are now seeing mega deals in the pipeline. Last year was a little bit of an anomaly and they're starting to
materialize. So we expect that we'll see strong bookings growth next year. We expect to see that, where we return to
plus 10% bookings growth, so we're optimistic about that. And some of that will be driven because we'll have more
mega deals.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Okay. Great. And then, Ursula, if you could just talk a little bit on the Technology side. I'm
curious as to what you're thinking about for 2013 in terms of competition and especially when you factor in what's
going on with the yen? Do you anticipate a more competitive environment? I know several of the competitors have
launches coming; you guys have a launch coming. Just if you could give any color on how you think the world shapes
up, especially given the yen depreciation? Thanks.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: I think that our position for 2013 is very strong. We spent 2012 in a very methodical way,
assuring that we positioned ourselves for what we saw were the growth areas in this business. Color, SMB, developing
economies, et cetera. So we managed our cost base, we were very conservative about how we went after deals given
that our product portfolio wasn't refreshed. We positioned ourselves for 2013 refresh which will come next month. And
so I'm actually feeling pretty good about our ability to meet our expectations, improving activity levels, stabilizing of
revenue from an equipment sales perspective and total perspective and I think that we're positioned well against the
competition.
But we are offering – that will offer – that will launch next month are not just about products, they're also about the
software and services surrounding the products. Positioning us well to expand our document outsourcing business as
well. So I think that it'll be a reasonable year and we're positioned well against the competition.
As far as the yen goes, the good news about the yen is that it gives us a little bit of tailwind, but it also gives our
competitors tailwind. So we're going to have to pay attention in the marketplace. We're going to have to price to win
where it's smart for us to go after it. We have a big focus on profitability. Most of the yen benefit for us because we
hedge comes in the latter half of the year, but we'll keep an eye on the marketplace and make sure that we are
aggressive and win where it's good for us to win.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Shannon. If we could have the next question, please?

Our next question comes from Keith Bachman of Bank of Montréal.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi. Thank you. Ursula, I wanted ask you about leadership and I'll frame it in two different
ways. One, how are you thinking about filling the very big shoes of Luca, in particular, the background that you're
looking for? And I'm not necessarily looking for internal versus external, but skill sets, particularly as you think about
the benchmark of growth is Services? And then, two, where you think the leadership – do think you need more depth in
Services, given relative inconsistency in performance since the addition of ACS?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Thank you, Keith. So first, on the CFO replacement. You are correct, that the next CFO has
some pretty big shoes to fill. Interestingly enough, Luca had some big shoes to fill as well. And I am very, very
confident that we'll find a more-than-adequate replacement for Luca, very confident. The search has already started. I
am, in some ways, overwhelmed with the number of candidates that I have to look through. So I think that we'll end up
with – in a good place, in a very good place with the CFO. What I'm looking for is someone who has global experience,
someone who's strong, fairly aggressive in their approach. We have a strategy, it is not going to change because Luca
left. So I want someone who can actually implement the strategy that we have in place and then, think on a go-forward
basis of some of the new things that we have to do.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: And I guess just to tease that out for a second, Ursula, would you tilt toward somebody with
Services experience, given the importance over the next three years of Services to Xerox?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yes. As we look for – when we're looking for Luca, we wanted someone who had some
background in a large, global, complex business, but also someone who had some Services experience. So the answer is
yes.
But it won't be on only a Services play, we have a big business to run, it is all around the world and I need someone
who can actually play well and understand well, all of those markets. Like I said, I'm confident that we'll get somebody
very, very, very, very good.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: As far as leadership in general, whenever we replace a leader, I look for certain general
tendencies. I need someone who is extremely flexible, but strong. Someone who actually can implement well, I need an
operator in the business. And someone who is prepared for the way that the business is going on a go-forward basis.
And that, obviously means, people who have more history or knowledge about Services. So the answer to your general
leadership question has nothing to do the inconsistency of performance, it has to do with future growth and how I see
the business going on a go-forward basis. So I need people who have good Services knowledge and background. And
that's what I'll look for across the board when we hire.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay. Well let me just sneak in a follow-up and then, I'll cede the floor. Just on bookings,
Lynn mentioned that you thought Services bookings would be a positive number in calendar year 2013, bookings
growth, I should say. Is that confidence, driven by the fact of the pipeline? Or the compares? Or just a little bit more on
why you think the bookings will turn the corner here from a negative to the positive?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yeah. Let me start and this is probably a question that will happen – a lot of people probably
have, so we'll spend a little bit more time on this, on this one.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: It turns out that in 2011, we signed, in our ITO business, an amazing amount of business. If
you look at the absolute number, we actually doubled a normal signing year in 2011. So the total TCV in 2011 was
about $3.5 billion and in a normal year it would be about $3 billion in ITO, ITO. This is in ITO, obviously the rest of
the business is bigger. In 2012, we went back to a normal pace and a normal growth level. So what we're saying is that
we are absolutely confident, very confident, based on the pipeline, based on the billings, based on everything, that we
will be able to grow over 2012 in ITO and therefore, in the total Services business on a TCV basis.

So I don't want – it's interesting when you look at this, this is not a point of weakness. We had a phenomenal year in
one line of business and a very good year in the rest the businesses in 2011. 2012 is back to a normal growth cycle for
us and 2013 will be back to that again. So that's the short of it.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Keith. Can we move to the next question, please?
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes of Barclays Capital.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Yeah. I wanted to ask about cash flow for next year. Your expectation for share
repurchases goes down quite a bit. Is there any upside to that $400 million? And how are you looking at that? Is that
something that is dependent on who you – who succeeds Luca? Are there any puts and takes on how you look at the
flexibility of that number? And then, I have a follow-up.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: First of all, Luca will answer the rest, but it has nothing to do with who succeeds Luca. As I
said earlier in answering the CFO question, we have a strategy and the strategy has been vetted across the management
team. We spent a lot of time on it and so I am – it is independent of the individual that sits in the chair. And Luca, why
don't you...
<A - Luca Maestri>: I would also argue those are my strategies, I hope that doesn't change. And on the numbers, $2.1
billion to $2.4 billion, it's the same number that we mentioned in November, Ben. It's a bit lower than this year because
we're going to have some positives, it's the pension contributions are positives and obviously earnings are going to be a
bit positive, because your EPS number is higher.
The effect of the finance receivables, will – they're not going to be the same level of contribution that we had in 2012
for obvious reasons. But we're confident with the range, $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion.
In terms of capital allocation, we talked in November about having some level of flexibility in the numbers to start the
year and that's why we said, at least so much for repurchase, we said, at least $400 million for repurchases, at least
$400 million for debt. That level of flexibility has increased a bit, because cash flow was so strong in Q4. So we came
in with a bit more flexibility and how much we're going to dial-up repurchase will depend, frankly, on two factors.
One, earnings as we go through the year and if earnings are strong there's an opportunity. And we always watch interest
rates, because they drive discount rate for the pension calculation, right? But yeah, there is a bit of flexibility and it's
increased a bit with Q4.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Okay. Then just my follow-up, as another way of asking a Services question. With
trailing 12-month booking down 26%, you've said that you can still grow and hit your targets for revenue growth for
2013. Another company we cover, IBM, had bookings down 2% and they're looking for Services growth next year of
flat. And that obviously makes intuitive sense to us, just given where bookings were the year before, it's a much
different business. But when we hear bookings down 26% and then hear revenues are going to be 7% or so growth, it
begs the question, just can you give us a little bit more math?
For example, IBM, again, they give you the 70% of their base contracts that they know they have and the revenue
growth off of that and then that kind of thing. Can you just give us a little more support so that we can go from down
25% to plus 7%? Is it duration? Do you actually have that 70% visibility and then you know the duration et cetera, so
that we know you can do it based on the bookings trends?
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: Yes. Absolutely, Ben. The things that enter into the math are the bookings number, as you
pointed out, and as Ursula said, this year was much more kind of a normal year, especially in the ITO business. So we
have a threshold that we use to calculate our minimum in order to hit the growth targets that we have and we met that
number.

The second piece that factors into the growth is the renewal rate and our renewals for the year were 85%, which is 5%
higher than they were in 2011. If you take the positive impact of the higher renewal rate, it offsets pretty close the
lower bookings. Does that make sense?
They both contribute. And we also have a higher recurring revenue rate than I think what you were talking about, ours
is about 85%. So that helps us in terms of the predictability of the revenue stream.
<Q - Ben Alexander Reitzes>: Thanks. Can I just sneak in one more and I'm done? On supplies, what trends are
seeing there for channel inventory in the trends into 2013?
<A - Luca Maestri>: Yes. So we have – 2012 was, I think, a fairly typical year. When we talk about supplies, Ben, we
talk about unbundled supplies, it's a small percentage of our total revenue. It's less than $2 billion a year. We've seen a
development on supplies which is very, very consistent with annuity revenue in general in 2013 – in 2012, so 2012 was
down about 3%. We expect for 2013, something in the mid single-digit decline for supply in line with the overall
Technology business. So again, also on supplies, we do not have unreasonable expectations as we enter the year.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Ben.

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz of JPMorgan.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Yes. Good morning. Thank you. I want to follow-on the previous question's line of
thought around just the signings velocity. Was 2011 really just the big peak, if you will, or everything come together in
terms of ACS, Xerox synergies and that's as good as it gets? I'm just trying to understand why we've never really seen
the follow-through in terms of the potential cross-pollination?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yes. 2011 was a good year, but you are seeing the follow-through. First of all, 2011 in one
line of business, in the ITO line of business, was an exceptional year. We are seeing growth and we'll continue to see
growth in 2013 in BPO as well and document outsourcing is doing its normal thing. So this is not the end of the line by
any stretch of the imagination. It's kind of hard to downplay 2011, which was good, but this is – we continue to sign,
we continue to sell, we continue to cross-pollinate, we continue to get new business. We had 7% more deals signed in
2012 than we did in 2011. Contract length is a little bit shorter and there were fewer mega deals. But our signing
velocity continues and we have 7% more revenue.
So the business is – this is not the end of the line by any stretch of the imagination. It's performing fairly well. The
math that Lynn just brought you through, which is the math of renewals, a math of signings, we have a strong pipeline
that continues to keep that up 6%, shows and should give some confidence that the revenue numbers that we have, we
take into account price declines, everything. The revenues numbers that we have for 2013, which is mid to high
single-digit revenue growth for our Services business is pretty solid.
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: If I can just add also, the number, bear in mind too, that the number that we give is the
annual recurring revenue number and many times I think people get confused with the TCV, but this is an annual
recurring revenue number. And so it's very predictable. The math is easy to calculate and we feel comfortable.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Thank you. As a follow-up, if I could, when I hear about shorter-term contracts it does
start to beg the question, are we going to see a heightened level of pricing pressures down the road, if the contracts are
shorter and they're going to be coming up for renewal faster maybe there's more and more vendors fighting for less and
less business? How should we think about that pricing slope over time? Is it going to start to get more severe?

<A - Ursula M. Burns>: I actually – I'll take it. The contract length on average has gone from five years to three years.
First of all, shorter is not a year. Shorter is three years. Absolutely you will see, at the end of three years, people
competing for the contracts and they would have normally have competed it at the end of five years. And price, as
Lynn said, is something that is clearly a part of the negotiations when you come up for renewal.
So the answer is, will you see pressure at three years? The answer is yes. One of the questions and drives that we have,
one of the things I push Lynn for, is we interact with clients in a way that penetrates the account and then, expands our
position in the account. We intend to continue to do that. It's proven successful for us in the past and will prove
successful, I think, in the future.
The shorter contract and less mega deals is a sign of the times today. We had significant pressure in both government
and large enterprises given a very weak macro-economic environment. That is what I, Xerox Corporation, and all our
vendors are going to deal with. We'll deal in the marketplace, be very aggressive and continue to win, I think, like we
win now.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Mark. If we could have the...
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: Can I add just one other piece of comment. The other thing is that many of the lines of
business, customer care for example, a three-year contract life is the normal contract life and if we don't sign as many
ITO deals, which are longer typically and mega deals which are longer, that doesn't mean that the entire portfolio is
shrinking in contract length. The other factor is that the discounts that we are required to give at renewal time, tend to
be driven by an average annual discount rate.
So if we have a five-year contract, you can take what that annual discount rate is times five. If it's a three-year contract,
you times it by three. So the net overall discount is not significantly different. And we have a large part of our portfolio,
you're seeing it, is a three-year deal. It's what we – and we'll build around that, so I wouldn't say that just because we
don't have as many five-year ITO deals or mega deals that the discounting pressure is going to be significantly
different.
<Q - Mark A. Moskowitz>: Okay. I appreciate that. If I could real quickly, just shifting gears, Ursula, I have to say as
an observer, you really sound pumped up today and your cadence, everything sounds very positive. But yet your
guidance isn't changing for 2013. Is that just measured conservatism, just because it's kind of early in the year and you
want to see how these new products roll out next month? I do say, you sound a lot more confident and upbeat versus
the prior few calls?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: I am upbeat, I'm hoping in every call. I'm happy I sound better today than I did in the past. I
am very confident in the guidance that we have. We've studied the business a lot. We're on a cadence now that is a
good rhythm. And so, yeah, I'm confident in what we've laid out for 2013. This is not going to be a walk in the park.
The environment hasn't changed that dramatically to make it that much better around the world. But I think that we
know how to operate it in I think. I know we know how to operate it. So yeah, I'm confident.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Mark. If we could have the next question, please?
Operator
Our next question comes from line of Bill Shope from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay. Great. Thanks. So you guys obviously had a nice recovery here in the Services margin and
I think you laid out the drivers there pretty clearly. Could you just help us understand how we should think about the
quarterly swing factors here throughout the year? And basically, how we should think about the overall drivers of the
seasonality from a margin perspective within this range you've provided for the year?
<A - Luca Maestri>: Yeah. So Bill, we said margin range 10% to 12% for Services. Clearly, you know that from a
seasonality perspective, Q1 and Q3 are lower than Q2 and Q4, particularly in document outsourcing, where we've got
more fixed costs attached to the business. For end, we've launched a number of restructuring actions. They will

progress and provide more and more benefit as we go through the year. So you should be thinking about it in terms of
Services margins growing sequentially from Q1 forward and clearly, Q1 lower than the Q4 that we just had, just
because of seasonality. But we expect already for Q1 improvement year-over-year. I think that should give you enough.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay. Great. And then, you mentioned hitting the – your targeted renewal rate range for the year.
Can you talk about the renewal rate dynamics exiting the year? Again, the unusual seasonal aspects to consider there?
And then, how you're thinking about your renewal rate management plans going into next year, given obviously, we
don't want to see too many surprises there?
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: Yeah. The renewal rates are, they are pretty sensitive and the sensitivity is driven by the
timing of particular renewals. And here's why. When we calculate the renewal rate, we look at the total universe to be
renewed and then take what percentage of that was renewed. If you have a large contract that you expect to renew, that
happens to slip from one quarter to the next quarter, that lowers the overall number and therefore, a loss has a more
dramatic impact. Hopefully that makes sense.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Yep. Absolutely.
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: Yeah. And so in the fourth quarter, we had a couple of deals that we had expected to renew
that slipped into the – we believe, that will happen in the first quarter. We're very, very focused on – we know what
those renewals are. We're very, very focused on winning those renewals and that's why we're not overly concerned
about it. We're confident that our renewal rate for 2013 will be in the range, but we can't call, with absolute precision,
what happens from quarter-to-quarter, because the timing of – an individual customer, we can really believe that we're
going to get them signed and they can shift one week and that can make a big difference in the renewal rate. So that's
why we're not overly concerned about it. We don't see a drastic falloff in renewals. Most of this is timing.
<A - Luca Maestri>: What we really liked is the fact that for the year, we were five points up in renewal. And that is
very, very important for revenue growth going forward.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Bill.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Thank you.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Next question, please?
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva of Citi.
<Q - Jim Suva>: Thank you and congratulations to you and your team there at Xerox, first of all. A quick question, is
in your prepared comments you mentioned about 2013, a much more healthier year for signings and things. Can you
help us better understand about – are these that you're already talking with companies and they're just really putting out
the formal proposal and just has yet to happen? Or is it, any type of real cement or granularity behind that as opposed to
just hoping for a bigger market? And did some slip from Q4 into Q1? Or just help us understand those dynamics?
Thank you.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Right. So it's a little bit of all that you said, which I knew you don't like that answer, but it's
true. Some of the signings are things that we know. We are already engaged with clients and we're working through the
details of the engagement. We don't – until we get them, I can't count them and I don't actually feel comfortable until
we actually get the signing, but yes, some of it is that.
Some of it is, we have some lines of business, state, transportation, that has – customer care, that have good offers out
and are engaging clients, but some of it is yet to come. And our pipeline grew in 2012 by 6%, so we have more in the
hopper, more engagements in the hopper. It's kind of a normal year. 2013, we're viewing as a normal year. Growth
across the portfolios, nothing too unusual, leveraging the synergies of having our two companies together and
therefore, growing in a fairly normal range. Nothing too exciting or too special but still good, but very good.

<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: The one shift that we've seen that's different, that was the same in 2011, different in 2012, is
the appearance of more mega deals as we said. And we have more of those in the pipeline now than we did halfway
through 2012, for example.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Jim.
<Q - Jim Suva>: Was there any slipping from Q4 to Q1?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Were there any, excuse me?
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: Slipping.
<Q - Jim Suva>: Slipping of deals?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Oh for sure. For sure. Lynn talked about it a little bit. There were a couple of deals that we
thought we would be able to ink in Q4, these are generally renewals, these are not generally, they are generally
renewals, and they slipped into Q1 or whenever the customer decides to sign it.
Oftentimes, that's actually not bad news for us. If you can keep the client with the same terms and conditions, because
as you know, when you renew you usually lower cost a little bit, price a little bit, it's not a bad thing to actually have it
moved. But we would prefer to have them sign, but we have to wait for the customer. We can't force them, sometimes
it is comfortable or want a delay. Nothing unusual, though.
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: And I think on the bookings, on the new business side, we do have deals that slip, they
always slip, and then the next quarter, some slip from the next quarter. So I'm waiting for the day when everything that
slipped from the previous quarter gets closed in this quarter and we have no slips to the next quarter. But yeah, we had
a couple of deals and things were a little lighter than we expected because of that. But nothing that was grossly out of
order.

Our next question comes from Chris Whitmore of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Chris K. Whitmore>: Thanks very much. I wanted to approach the bookings, maybe from a little bit of a
different angle and specifically wanted to ask about BPO bookings. If I look at the trend line in BPO bookings over the
past couple of years, it's been down two years in a row from fiscal year 2010, $10 billion to $6 billion in fiscal year
2012. Understanding the ITO is strong, et cetera and contract durations are changing, but nonetheless, I'm trying to
understand, what are the implications for the mix in your revenue as you roll forward into fiscal 2013 between BPO,
ITO and document outsourcing? Do you expect a significant change in mix, or rates of growth between the segments?
And does that have implications on margins?
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: Yeah. I think that right now, we're expecting that ITO, because of the strong bookings from
2011, ITO is going continue to grow and its growth rate will be a few points higher than the BPO rate. But BPO is a
much larger business than the ITO business, so just don't do direct math to say that's going to necessarily drastically
change the overall growth rate.
But BPO is, if you think about it, in the last year, governments have been under extreme pressure. I mean, it's been as
tough a time for states and local entities as I can certainly remember. And so some deals and BPO, government deals

are almost, not always, but 80% of them are BPO, there's been a lot of pressure. And we're seeing, as Ursula
mentioned, some lightening of that pressure, right? We're not ready to say that it's drastically changed, but we're
starting to see a little bit of lightening there. So we're hopeful that, that will help to spur BPO bookings.
I think most of the downward pressure that you've seen over the last couple of years has really been driven through the
various aspects of the government business and we're seeing some improvement there.
<Q - Chris K. Whitmore>: Does that changing mix impact the profitability? In other words, are ITO margins vastly
different than BPO?
<A - Luca Maestri>: ITO margins are slightly lower than average. We've talked about it in the past, but really it's not a
massive shift. Keep in mind that revenue growth, which then drives margins, right, was significantly higher in BPO in
2012 than the other lines. And so I don't see much of a mix impact from the increased growth in ITO, it's extremely
manageable.

Our next question comes from the line of the Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thanks. I just have a question really on the direction of Services margins and more about
the cost cutting that you guys are doing. In the event that, let's say, this is a more secular drive towards smaller deal
sizes, do you have to do more restructuring to hit your margin targets? Don't you see it that way? And could you
remind us of what further cost downs we might see in that business segment as we go through 2013? Many thanks.
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: Yeah. The restructuring efforts, as we said at the beginning, of our – we made some good
progress in the fourth quarter. We're not through by any stretch and we will continue to do things that we think are
prudent and as aggressive as we think are prudent over 2013.
The other side of the coin, relative to the deal size, is that typically smaller deals have slightly higher margins. So even
though the deal size may be coming down, that is not a downward pressure on margins. That actually helps lift them a
little bit.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Okay. Just on that point, though, how much more in terms of dollar cost would you say
year-over-year you've got to yet reduce in 2013? Can you give us a number around that?
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: I think what we would like to do, is an amount similar to the amount that we did in the fourth
quarter.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Okay. And just a question on acquisitions. On the $500 million that you might spend, is
that a very firm number? Or is there a chance, for example, you get to the end of this year and you spend $100 million
and the rest can be put into buybacks for shareholders? Or how should we think – is that how we should think about
how firm that number is?
<A - Lynn R. Blodgett>: Can you repeat the question? What number are you referring to?
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: I'm referring to the amount that you might spend on acquisitions this year? How firm is
that $400 million or $500 million? And whether you could actually use that for further distribution to shareholders?
<A - Luca Maestri>: I think you need to step back for a second and think about our strategy and really, acquisition
we've always said is an important part of our strategy. And part of the growth that we're going to be experiencing in
Services will be driven by acquisitions. We said up to $500 million. It really will depend on the type of companies that

are available. And so I would say, the flexibility that we have, it's more around the fact that we've got good cash
generation from Q4, some level of flexibility and if earnings progress the way we expect them to progress, there will be
an opportunity to do both. To do more repurchase and to stick to our acquisition number.

Our final question will come from the line of Ananda Baruah of Brean Capital.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Hey, congrats on a solid quarter by the way. Two if I
could. Luca, just a clarification, did I hear correctly that you said selling of receivables would contribute $500 million
less in 2013 than it did in 2012? And if I did hear that correctly, is that a gross number or a net number?
<A - Luca Maestri>: It's a gross number, I would say, because it's essentially and under the combination of the fact
that we do not expect the portfolio to run off as much as it did in 2012. We believe that equipment activity is going to
be stronger in 2013, new products and so on. And the fact that, of course, we have accelerated the collection of certain
receivables from 2013 in 2012. Right? So it is the amount of lower contribution that we expect from finance
receivables in 2013.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: Got it. So is it comparable to numbers of that in 2012, the $625 million or the $502 million?
<A - Luca Maestri>: The comparable number is $947 million. It's the amount of cash that we generated in finance
receivables in 2012, which was $947 million.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: I got you. That was helpful. And then just a follow-up is, Ursula, did I hear you correctly, that
you expect equipment sales to be up or to grow in 2013?
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: They won't grow. I said that we expect total revenues to be, in the Technology business, to be
down in the mid single-digits. We expect some softening of the decline that we saw in 2012. We saw a double-digit
decline in 2012. I expect that we'll continue to see declines, but it will just be moderated a bit as we launch new
products.
<Q - Ananda Baruah>: Got it. I was asking, that's specifically about equipment sales?
