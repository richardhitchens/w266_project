O. B. Grayson Hall
Thank you, List and good morning and welcome to Regions' fourth quarter 2012 earnings conference call. We certainly
appreciate your participation and respect your time. We view 2012 as a transformational year for Regions with fourth
quarter results reaffirming our positive momentum and providing a solid foundation for the future growth of our
franchise. During 2012, we achieved a number of key milestones through the successful execution of our capital and
business plans. We completed the Morgan Keegan divestiture, we issued approximately $900 million of common stock,
redeemed the preferred stock issued to U.S. Treasury and repurchased the related warrant. We significantly improved
asset quality, our risk profile, and strengthened enterprise risk management. Our credit ratings improved. We further
enhanced our technology platform. We issued $500 million of preferred stock and redeemed $345 million of trust
preferred securities. And most importantly, we achieved sustainable profitability.
On a continuing operations basis, full year 2012 net income available to common shareholders of $1.1 billion or $0.76
per diluted share. Lower credit related expenses driven by significant improvement asset quality benefited 2012's
results. Let me point out just a few notable asset quality metrics. Non-performing assets, including held for sale,
dropped $1.1 billion or 36% year over year, the lowest level in four years. Net loan charge-offs declined 47% for the
full year, the lowest annual level since 2008.
In addition, results also reflected successful efforts to expand and deepen customer relationships, increase prudent loan
production, strengthen expense management disciplines, and improving funding mix and costs. Our emphasis on
customer service and customer loyalty along with enhanced product offerings and delivery channels enabled us to grow
and deepen our customer relationship. As a result, non-interest income on an adjusted basis increased despite a number
of business headwinds. Mortgage banking revenue was especially strong in 2012, as mortgage production totaled $8
billion. This includes $1.6 billion in HARP II related production. Throughout 2012, approximately 50% of HARP II
applications involved customers new to Regions mortgage, which allowed us to introduce new customers to Regions
Financial and expand our business opportunities across all our lending segments in both wholesale and retail.
Total new and renewed loan production across all customer segments was a strong $57 billion for the full year. New
production totaled $28 billion in 2012, up 14% from the prior year. Unfortunately, our strong production results have
not yet translated into balance sheet growth as period end loans outstanding were down, reflecting the continued
deleveraging actions of our customers and further de-risking of our investor real estate portfolio. However, we did
demonstrate favorable balanced growth in our commercial and industrial portfolio and our indirect auto portfolio. In
2012, we also continued to improve our deposit and funding mix, lowering both average deposit and total funding costs
19 basis points. As a result, we were able to expand our net interest margin 4 basis points for the year, despite another
challenging year of low interest rates.
From an expense management perspective, full year 2012 expenses excluding goodwill impairment in 2011 were down
2%, in line with expectations, and included net reductions in staffing of about 1%, or 280 positions. In the current
challenging revenue environment, effective operating expense management is critical. As a result, we remain
committed to generating positive operating leverage. At the same time, we must continue to invest appropriately in
people, technology and products to ensure that we have the best team, the right technology and competitive products to
improve productivity and efficiency.
Again, 2012 was a transformational year for Regions. We clearly demonstrated that we have a viable business plan in
place and that we are successfully executing on that plan to build a strong foundation for prudent, profitable and
sustainable growth. I'll turn it over to David for a discussion of fourth quarter 2012's financial trends. Afterwards, I'll
return to spend a few moments discussing 2013 growth opportunities. David?

David J. Turner
Thank you, Grayson, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin on slide three with a quick snapshot of our fourth
quarter 2012 financial results. We reported net income available to common shareholders from continuing operations of
$273 million, or $0.19 per diluted share. Adjusted net income available to common shareholders from continuing
operations was $311 million, or $0.22 per share. Pre-tax, pre-provision income from continuing operations was $493
million on an adjusted basis. Net interest income was $818 million and the resulting net interest margin was 3.10%.
Non-interest revenues were up 1% from prior quarter while non-interest expenses were down 2% on an adjusted basis
from the prior quarter. And from a credit standpoint, net charge-offs decreased 31% linked quarter while total loan loss
provision was $37 million.
Let's look at some of the details, starting with the balance sheet. Regions experienced continued growth in our
commercial and industrial and in indirect auto loan portfolios, however, this growth was offset by declines in
real-estate related loan portfolios. As a result, average total loans for the fourth quarter were down $1.1 billion or 1.4%
linked quarter. That being said, we expect to see growth in loan production and anticipate this production will outpace
attrition by the second half of 2013. As a result, based on what we know now, we are projecting loan growth in the low
single-digits for 2013.
For the quarter, total ending loan balances were primarily impacted by a decline of $991 million or 11.4% in the
investor real estate portfolio. At quarter end, investor real estate ending balances stood at $7.7 billion, down $3 billion
from one year ago. This portfolio now comprises 10% of our total loan portfolio, compared to 14% a year ago. We
expect this portfolio to continue to decline at a moderate pace over the next couple of quarters and more specifically,
we believe that we have approximately $1 billion of investor real estate that we will de-risk and then grow from there.
Our owner-occupied commercial real estate portfolio, which is comprised primarily of community banking and small
business, which tends to exhibit the same behavioral trends as consumers declined this quarter due to customer
deleveraging and lack of demand. Linked quarter, we experienced an average loan decline of $203 million or 1.9%,
although price competition has increased, a majority of the decline was related to prepayments and scheduled pay
downs. However, as noted, commercial and industrial loan demand remained solid in the fourth quarter, driven in part
by our integrated approach to specialized lending where our local bankers work with experienced lenders to meet
customer needs.
Total production for this portfolio was a solid $10.4 billion. Pipelines remained solid, and are slightly above the same
level at this time last year, as our clients' fund expenditures, capital expenditures, working capital needs and
increasingly M&A activity. Commitments have increased 4.2% linked quarter and 12.2% from the prior year.
Our consumer services portfolio, which makes up 39% of our total loan portfolio decreased by $352 million, or 1.2% as
consumer deleveraging continued. As you may recall from prior quarters, our strategy has been to sell our fixed rate
conforming mortgages. Late in the fourth quarter, we began the process of retaining our 15-year fixed rate conforming
mortgages. We believe this strategy supports our overall efforts to grow the balance sheet and effectively manage our
exposure to interest rate risk.
Declines in our home equity portfolio continue as customers take advantage of opportunities to refinance. However, we
recently launched the new home equity loan product to attract a new set of customers. Results have been encouraging
thus far as loan production for lines and loans increased 23% over the prior quarter.
Average indirect auto loan balances increased 6.7% quarter-over-quarter. We expect the indirect portfolio to continue
to grow at a steady pace throughout 2013, driven by expansion in the dealer network from approximately 1,900 dealers
to 2,400 dealers, as well as by increases in auto sales volume.
Total loan yields were up 3 basis points linked quarter to 4.21%, primarily due to interest recoveries on non-accrual
loans.

Moving on to deposits, as shown on slide five, deposit mix and cost continued to improve in the fourth quarter and total
low cost deposits increased $2.1 billion from last quarter. Time deposits fell to 14% of total deposits down from 16%
linked quarter, as a result of our continued success in re-pricing and growing low cost deposits. This positive re-pricing
and mix shift resulted in deposit costs declining to 22 basis points for the quarter, down 6 basis points from the third
quarter. And we expect to drive additional improvement deposit costs.
Looking ahead to 2013, we currently have $8.3 billion of CDs that will mature. Of that, $5.4 billion matures in the first
half with an average rate of 1.51% and $2.9 billion in the second half with an average rate of 53 basis points. This
compares to our current average going on rates for new CDs of approximately 20 basis points. Further, our overall total
funding costs improved to 50 basis points, a decrease of 6 basis points linked quarter.
Now let's turn to net interest income on slide six. Net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis was $831
million, or relatively flat linked quarter. The resulting net interest margin was 3.10%, up two basis points from third
quarter's 3.08%. We were pleased with the performance of the margin; however, there were some temporary positive
impacts from interest recoveries and acceleration of deferred fees related to loan pay-offs. Together, these items added
about two basis points to the margin. So really you should level set our margin at 3.08%. However, even without these
impacts, margin remained stable and in line with our expectations. Even though the low rate environment continued to
push on portfolio yields with pay downs and higher yielding securities being reinvested at today's low levels, that effect
was largely offset by the improvements in deposit costs and the lift from our trust preferred securities call.
In a continued low rate environment, we continue to see opportunities to protect the margin through a number of factors
including continued reduction of deposit costs, and our retention of 15-year mortgages. These factors support our
outlook for a relatively stable margin in 2013. Of course, a rise in interest rates would further benefit the overall margin
and net interest income.
Let's look at non-interest revenue on slide seven. Fourth quarter non-interest revenue from continuing operations was
$536 million, a 1% increase linked quarter, primarily related to an increase in service charge income. Mortgage
banking revenue, while down $16 million from third quarter remained strong and continues to be driven by new home
purchases and refinances aided by the government's HARP II program. Approximately 63% of mortgage loans were
refinances and 37% were new home purchases. 20% of total loans were HARP II related and importantly, as of the end
of the fourth quarter, less than approximately 20% of our loans eligible under the HARP II guidelines have been
refinanced. As a result, we expect mortgage revenue to remain strong for the next few quarters.
And moving on to expenses on slide eight, non-interest expenses totaled $902 million, an increase of 4% linked
quarter. However, excluding the expense associated with the termination of a third-party investment in a REIT
subsidiary, which I'll speak to shortly, and debt extinguishment cost related to our trust preferred call, non-interest
expenses were $849 million, representing a $20 million or 2% decrease over the prior quarter. Additionally, during the
quarter, professional and legal expenses benefited from a $20 million decrease in legal reserves.
As we have previously communicated, we remain focused and disciplined on expense management and constantly
challenge all of our associates to be mindful of every dollar they spend. Additionally, we expect further improvement in
credit-related expenses. As a result, we anticipate 2013 expenses from continuing operations to be below those of 2012.
Let's look at some of our credit metrics on slide nine. We continue to make progress with respect to asset quality in the
fourth quarter, as several credit metrics improved, including criticized loans, non-performing loans and net charge-offs.
The provision for loan losses was $37 million or $143 million less than net charge-offs. Total net charge-offs decreased
linked quarter by 31% or $82 million to $180 million. Net charge-offs as a percent of total average loans dropped
below 1% for the first time in over four years. Inflows of non-performing loans decreased to $350 million from $463
million linked quarter. Non-performing loans decreased 11% from prior quarter to $1.7 billion, the lowest level in
almost four years. In total non-performing assets decreased $296 million, or 13% linked quarter. Notably, one of the
best and earliest indicators of asset quality, that's business services criticized and classified loans, continued to decline
with criticized loans down 12%, or $639 million from the third quarter.

Our coverage ratios remained solid at quarter end, our loan loss allowance for non-performing loans stood at 114%, or
1.14 times. Meanwhile, our loan loss allowance to loans remained solid at 2.59% at the end of the fourth quarter. Now
based on what we know today, we expect continued improvement in asset quality going forward.
Let's take a look at capital and liquidity on slide 10. Our capital position remained strong, as our estimated Tier 1 ratio
at the end of the quarter stood at 12%, and our estimated Tier 1 common ratio increased approximately 30 basis points
to 10.8%. Additionally, in the fourth quarter, the company successfully issued preferred stock totaling $500 million and
part of the proceeds were used to redeem $345 million of trust preferred securities.
Also in the quarter, we extinguished a $203 million liability associated with an investment by a third party in one of our
REITs and we incurred $42 million pre-tax, $38 million after tax and early termination cost. This redemption removed
approximately $28 million of associated annual expenses. We will continue to prudently evaluate liability management
opportunities as we look to efficiently manage our liquidity, debt and capital positions.
Tangible common book value reached $7.11 per share in the fourth quarter, up from $7.02 in the third quarter, an
increase of 1.3%. Based on our interpretation of Basel III, we estimate our pro forma Basel III Tier 1 common ratio will
be approximately 8.9%. Liquidity at both the bank and the holding company continues to remain solid with a loan to
deposit ratio of approximately 78%.
Lastly, based on our understanding of new amendments, Regions remains well-positioned to be fully compliant with
respect to the liquidity coverage ratio upon its implementation. Overall, this quarter's solid results provide positive
momentum as we head into 2013 and provides a foundation for sustainable growth.
With that, I'll turn it back over to Grayson for his closing comments.
O. B. Grayson Hall
Thank you, David. And just let me make a few brief closing comments and then we can open up the lines for your
questions. As I indicated earlier, 2012 was a year of progress for Regions. As we look ahead to 2013, we expect to face
a business environment that in many ways resembles the year just completed. The pace of the economic recovery
continues to be positive, but incrementally slower than desired. Our industry, our customers and our economy continue
to deal with substantial level of both global and domestic uncertainty. But overall, our confidence is building.
As a result, we do anticipate a stronger second half in 2013, as the economic and fiscal uncertainty abate and our
markets continue to strengthen. The Regions team is focused on growing our customer base and generating positive
operating leverage. Our efforts to de-risk have begun to moderate. Our expectation is that business should stabilize and
begin to grow this year. We have demonstrated growth in some customer segments such as commercial and industrial
and indirect auto. Additionally, we have experienced strong growth this year in our mortgage business, but the growth
needs to be balanced across all of our lines of business. We continue to be encouraged by our level of loan production,
but we need to begin to realize net growth in our outstandings.
Our confidence is growing and our business continues to strengthen across the organization as we see improved
pipelines, applications and originations. We remain disciplined in our efforts to control expenses and continue to see
opportunities to improve efficiency, but we are committed to a balanced approach that invests in technology, people
and products where the opportunity to grow revenues or improve efficiency exist.
Our capital position and capital management process are much improved, and we are committed to returning an
appropriate level of capital to shareholders as our performance dictates, subject to supervisory review.
In closing, our business model is relationship banking strategy. It works to build deeper and more productive banking
relationships by addressing the specific financial needs of our customers. We believe this approach will build shared
value for our customers, communities, shareholders and associates.
Now, let's open up the line for your questions. Thank you.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Erika Penala of Bank of America.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Erika.
<Q - Erika Penala>: Good morning. My first question is one on your margin outlook. You've spoken in conferences in
the past about being open to using some of your excess capital to call some of your long-term debt. I guess the first
question today, are you still open to that in 2013? And B, does your margin guidance for stability include potentially
calling some long-term debt?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, Erika, this is David. We have consistently wanted to put ourselves in a position to
optimize our balance sheet structure in terms of its cost on the liability side. We've been doing that through our deposit
side as you've seen and from a debt side, you've seen some of our utilization of our excess capital, if you will, to
right-size and adjust the funding.
We do have other opportunities. Without going into specifics, I think if you evaluated what we have outstanding, you
could probably glean what would be some potential targets. We do have elements of that, not all, but elements of
right-sizing our liability structure baked into our margins, but we want to see how things play out during the year.
There is still uncertainty with regards to the economy. So we hadn't baked in all the potential opportunities that we do
have, but some are.
<Q - Erika Penala>: Okay. And I'm sure you'll be asked this question several ways, but let me be the first to attempt it.
Your adjusted expenses were $3.471 million this past year. And I guess, as we're thinking about the magnitude of
decline, will it be similar to the 2% decline that you talked about in 2012 or is there an efficiency ratio that you could
point us to as a target? I guess it's the one question I'm getting from investors in terms of magnitude of that outlook.
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, we have not quantified that yet. We kind of gave broad guidance that we would be
down in 2013 from 2012, just like the guidance we gave you last year at this time. Things that we can point to, there's
no one particular silver bullet in that expense number. If you look at our expense run rate, you'll see that actually our
largest expenses end up being salaries and benefits and occupancy and we think those are two areas that we will
continue to work on to bring those down even further.
We moved our credit card servicing in-house from paying a third party that we think will have some savings. I talked
earlier about the savings related to one of our REITs. So, again, there's no one place that we can point to. Credit-related
expense is another that as we continue to improve non-performing balances and levels, we have some opportunity
there. So I think net-net, we can see that being down. As we get closer and go through the year, perhaps we can put a
finer point on that.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Erika, we've really tried to build a strong expense culture over the last few years, and have
– to David's point, when you look at our two predominant expenses which really been personnel and also in facilities,
we've continued to rationalize both. Last year we were down on a net basis some 280 positions but we actually had
added back over double that number that we had added back as we brought in our credit card processing. We had to
have a number of people added there as well as we've added people in risk management. And we – quite frankly, we've
added people, bankers, that are in customer-facing positions, but we've been able to offset that through efficiencies in
other parts of the company.
We invested an awful lot in technology, in our branches to improve the efficiency of that entire branch channel. We
continue to think branches are an important part of our distribution strategy, but we're trying to rationalize the expense
of that channel to try to improve the efficiency of that channel. But as David said, our expense strategy, the expense
management strategy, is really not a branded program, but it's just a way of making sure we've got a strong culture
that's focused on efficiency improvement across all of our businesses and continues to look for ways to reduce our

overall expenses. And we did that successfully in 2012. We believe we'll be successful again in 2013 and have guided
to that point.
<A - David J. Turner>: Erika, I should have added. You asked about target. We think we can have an overhead ratio
still in that mid-50 to upper 50 range. So we still have some work to go.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Over time.
<A - David J. Turner>: Over time. And, of course, revenue is a component of that too and we need more revenue to
get us to those levels.
<Q - Erika Penala>: Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.
Operator
Your next question comes from Kevin St. Pierre of Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Kevin J. St. Pierre>: Good morning. As we think about potential capital return and the CCAR process, you are
over a percentage point higher on Basel I Tier 1 common than you were the last go around in the CCAR. And Basel III,
by your estimate, seems to be already where it would need to be, if not higher. Could you talk to us about your capital
plan and what your capital return priorities would be?
<A - David J. Turner>: Sure, Kevin. We like being in this position a lot more than going into where we were a year or
so ago, which gives us an opportunity to do different things. Obviously, we would like to use first and foremost our
capital base to grow organically. We think we – as I mentioned, we think we can grow our loan book in 2013, but that's
really number one.
Number two, we do believe that we have a capital base and profitability where we're accreting capital that allows us to
return more to the shareholders than we have in the past. We, as you know, submitted our capital plan in the first part of
January and we'll be discussing that with our regulatory supervisor. So it's little too early to be able to talk about what
that looks like. But having an appropriate return to the shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks clearly
is something that we think makes some sense.
As you know, we acquired our credit card portfolio about a year and a half ago. We look for opportunities with asset
classes like that to use our capital as well. So that's kind of the four things that we really think about in terms of
positioning ourselves from a capital standpoint. We do know and acknowledge where we are with regards to Basel III
and our Tier 1 common under Basel I. And we think that gives us optimal flexibility to work with our shareholders and
to grow our company.
<Q - Kevin J. St. Pierre>: Okay. Thanks. And similar question on the loan loss reserve side. You've got – no matter
how we look at it, whether it's reserves to NPLs or reserves to annualized charge-offs, high levels. Do you think that
there is a floor to the reserve to loan or reserve to NPL levels or how much of that can we expect to see flowing through
earnings in 2013?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Hey, Kevin, this is Grayson and I'll make a few comments and I'll ask Matt and Barb if
they'd like to comment on this. But we try to stay very disciplined through our process. We've had a methodology that
we've been following on calculating our allowance. It's a very analytical process and we've been confident in that
process. We continue to believe that as credit improves, that you'll see that allowance moderate closer to what peers
have given relative mix of our portfolio.
If you saw this quarter continued improvement and absent any economic shocks that we don't anticipate today, we
think that that pace of recovery continues. That being said, we have to let our process work and we have to be very
disciplined in that regard. Matt? Barb?

<A - C. Matthew Lusco>: The only other thing I'd add is I think, as we've stated before, we don't – we certainly do not
see levels of reserves sinking to the level they once were, something that once upon a time when they were in the 1% of
outstanding type range. We think they'll settle out industry-wide at a floor that's something north of probably 1.5%. So,
I think times have changed in that regard and, of course, the new FASB statement out there that we certainly don't
anticipate coming into play for quite a while, but I think that does show prevailing changes of thought as it relates to
where levels of reserve go.
Certainly concur with everything Grayson said about our methodology and its consistent application and that
methodology and our processes together with the pace of our improvement will dictate those reserves as we go
forward.

Your next question comes from Michael Rose of Raymond James.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Michael.
<Q - Michael Rose>: Hey, good morning, everyone. Just a clarification, if I could, on the expense guidance. Are you
going off the adjusted number and I'm sorry if I missed it, the $3.471 million?
<A - David J. Turner>: That's right, adjusted standpoint.
<Q - Michael Rose>: And then I noticed the head count was actually up a little bit this quarter. Was that just more
seasonal in nature or can you just give some color there?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yes, I mean, you saw headcounts up just a little bit this quarter, sort of as we sort of
transforming, if you will, a little bit to more of a growth strategy for 2013, we added a few bankers in that regard. But
you'll see that moderate some as we get into the year, as we drive some efficiency out of some other areas.
<Q - Michael Rose>: Okay. And then just one final question if I could on the thoughts of share buyback, now your
stock is trading above tangible book value, does that change at all your mindset around buybacks versus dividends?
Thanks.
<A - David J. Turner>: Well, Michael, I think that, we've gotten this question before, clearly when you're trading
below or at tangible book value that makes you think one way. The higher you trade on that from a share buyback, you
have a tendency to question that and lean in another direction. That being said, we're still trading closer to tangible
book value, and if you look at our embedded cost of equity, it's still high. So you think about the return that you get
from an investment and a buyback compared to where you're going to put that marginal dollar, and that kind of informs
us as well.
Again, we've submitted our plan in January. I guess our industry is not quite as dynamic as we once were to take
advantage of what market forces are. And that's just the way it is today. That being said, we think we'll have an
appropriate return to our shareholders and we'll be releasing that information at the end of March.
<Q - Michael Rose>: Great. Thank you.

<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Hey, guys. Just some thoughts on the timing of when loans might bottom-out or maybe
how much they go down before – you had mentioned some growth in the back half of the year. Just any sense of how
much more run off and not to pinpoint is it 2Q or 3Q, but any more clarity around the trajectory of loans would be
helpful?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yeah, I mean, Matt, if you look at our loan growth last year, our loans period end to period
end were down about $3.6 billion. Three of that was in the investor commercial real estate portfolio, it has been – it's
been a – in terms of trying to forecast that runoff, it's really been driven largely by the improvement in the economy
and the availability of credit elsewhere for some of these distressed credits. And so the runoff for 2013 was faster than
– I mean, for 2012 was faster than we had early in the year forecasted.
And as you probably are aware, when we got into the fourth quarter of 2012, there were a number of decisions being
made in anticipation of tax code changes that created a sense of urgency around resolving some of these more
distressed credits and so we saw some special activity there. So all that being said, the runoff in that portfolio was a
little faster than we had anticipated in 2012. We see it today moderating in 2013. And moderating from a couple
regards, one is we think that we've got the number of distressed credits in that portfolio down to a level that we believe
most of our runoff in that portfolio will come in the first half of the year. The second issue is in 2011 in investor
commercial real estate, we did about $1 billion of production, in 2012 we did $2 billion. So we more than doubled the
production in that portfolio in that customer segment. We are encouraged by the early signs we see in 2013. So we
think we'll have a good 2013. So we think we start to see stabilization of that portfolio by mid-year 2013. That being
said is that, our forecast – the accuracy of being able to forecast that is challenging but we believe that's where we think
we are today.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the net interest margin, the relatively stable, I guess
that'd be versus the 3.08%?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yes, that's right, Matt. That's right. That's one or two points either side of that.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Yes. And is that relatively steady throughout the year? You've got – with the CDs coming
due and obviously there's some seasonality in 1Q. I mean there's some pluses and minuses but relatively stable
throughout the year?
<A - David J. Turner>: That's right. There is obviously more challenges early given where the tenure is and we do
forecast a low but slightly improving rate towards the back half so it gets a little bit more expansive – potentially
expansive in the back half. So the first half is more challenging on that comment, but we still think we can maintain
stability even then.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: We do have a number of time deposits maturing in the first and second quarter and those
maturities are more heavily weighted towards the end of first quarter, than the first part of first quarter. So, we do think
that while we indicate stable margin throughout the year, our forecast would say that that stability is easier to come by
later in the year than early, but we still believe we are going to be able to achieve a fairly stable margin. The part that
we can't forecast is that we get resolutions on the distressed credits, many times we get the benefit of interest recovery,
which aids our margin, like you saw it happened this quarter, gave us about 2 basis points of benefit and those come
when they come, and so you can't predict them, but we would anticipate through the year that in all likelihood, we'll see
some repeat of that activity.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. Thank you very much.

<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Hey, good morning. Good morning, everybody. Grayson, I just wanted to follow on the last
question there and just expand it a little bit to just the average earning asset side of things. So, understanding you'll
have some loan growth, but as you just mentioned you do have a quite a bit of the CD book running off, you've got
some of the long-term debt as well. So can you just talk to us about how the earning asset progression goes as well?
Does it continue to also decline? How do you mix shift different categories of the asset side as loans due start to grow
from a period end perspective?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, Ken, this is David. You should expect to see some modest reduction in earning assets
throughout the year, but that from a margin standpoint gets taken care of because of what you mentioned, the change in
mix of our balance sheet, whether it be from the liability side or the asset side. Things like on asset side, we talked
about our loan growth, we talked about our 15-year mortgages. We've talked to previous conferences about changing
our investment portfolio and taking on more credit assets than we have because we have very solid liquidity and so
you'll see us take a little more risk there.
And then we have elements of liability management that we continue to work down on the right side of the balance
sheet, but – so specifically, your earning asset question is a modest reduction.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: So if we bring that all together, it presumes that net interest income dollars would likely be
down this year, right, just on, flat margin against the modestly smaller balance sheet?
<A - David J. Turner>: I think what you would need to do is compare that and then also look at kind of trends in
terms of the tenure for last year compared to where think it might go this year. We started pretty high in the tenure last
year in the first quarter, I think we topped out – I don't know, what, 230-ish, and, we're behind that right this minute. So
there are a lot of factors that go into where you think revenue may come out, but those are the – that's the main one you
needed to look at as well as earning assets and liability management.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Great. And then one just follow-up on the mortgage question. Can you just talk to us about the
dynamic between how much mortgages actually you think about intending to keep as a proportion of that total loan
growth you're expecting and then what the offsetting impact would be on the mortgage banking line by not getting the
gain on sale? Thanks, guys.
<A - David J. Turner>: Let me kind of frame it up in terms of what last year might have looked like. So had we had
this change, it would've meant about $1.2 billion in terms of volume, and call the spread on the gain in the $325 million
to $350 million range. So you can do some quick math to see what gains are relative to retaining that on the balance
sheet. So, today 15-year mortgages are in call it 2.75% offset with if you didn't sell them, taking the proceeds and
investing them in mortgage backs, which going on today with a like product are close to 1.5%. So, those are the kind of
things you think about and you can probably use what I just gave you and construct the difference between spread
income versus gain on sale.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Helpful. Thanks a lot, David.

Your next question comes from Josh Levin of Citigroup.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Josh.
<Q - Josh D. Levin>: As you think about top line growth, where specifically do you see the greatest opportunities for
top line growth in 2013?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, I think that obviously you have to look at continuing to maintain NII at a strong level
because of the reduction in expense that goes into that line item. I think you have to look at continued solid mortgage
performance, and it was very strong this past year. It should be strong going in and through 2013. If you remember
back to 2012 at this point, I don't think many people projected that mortgage would stay as strong as it did, and we are

looking at – we think mortgage will continue to be very strong for us. Growing our customer households is a priority
for us, which picks up additional NIR there. Production and growth in our credit card book, which we saw in the fourth
quarter, as you recall, we brought that conversion in the latter part of the third quarter. So now we can control the
customer experience. We grew accounts, which helps us from a credit interchange. There's no one magic bullet. It is
getting back to basics and growing every one of our businesses that we think can generate both NII and NIR for us.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Josh, I think when you look at income statement, you try to figure out where can we really
grow, I would agree with David, I don't think there's one category that's going to dominate that. Clearly last year our
loan production increased some 14% year-over-year on new production, new to Regions and we were encouraged by
that. I think what we saw was sort of some slow down, sort of in the late third, early fourth quarter, sort of across our
businesses, but then saw strong pickup in December. And I would tell you December, from an activity standpoint was
probably one of the strongest months we've seen in a couple of years. December was a very good month for us and an
encouraging month, and so I think when you look at where opportunities are, clearly for us to grow the top line
revenue, we've got to grow loans. We believe this can be a transition for our company in 2013 to get back to more of a
growth strategy, and we've got a lot of momentum in the field across our franchise and so I think if you look at where
our revenue streams have been, I think NII has got to improve for us to deliver on that.
NIR has predominantly been driven by two things, really, our sort of transition from sort of a free checking
environment to the fee-eligible environment. We think we've gotten through that transition now, and are back in a
position to grow checking accounts at our company. We also think from a mortgage standpoint, we did $8 billion in
production last year. We saw it sort of seasonally slow down in the fourth quarter between – the holiday effect that you
have in that fourth quarter. Pipelines are back pretty strong. Is it going to be as strong as 2012? I don't know, but it
looks pretty strong to us at this point. So a few more quarters, we'll know.
<Q - Josh D. Levin>: Okay. And as you said, 2012 was a transformational year for Regions. Given where you are now
and you're past this inflection point, where do you see yourselves in the M&A landscape?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Well, I think at this juncture, we're still focused on growing organically in our franchise. I
think the M&A activity is obviously opportunistic in nature. We're paying close attention to everything that's going on
in the markets, but quite frankly, our focus right now in this company is trying to make sure that we're delivering on
organic growth, sort of earns us the right to participate in whatever happens from an M&A standpoint.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller of FBR.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Hey, thank you very much. I think I missed it, going back to the mortgage – follow-up on some
of the mortgage questions. Of the $2.1 billion of production, how much did you keep? How much was 15-year product?
<A - David J. Turner>: Yeah, I think from a – most of that was actually sold.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Okay.
<A - David J. Turner>: Into the market. I can't remember the specific percentage.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And what you were talking about was that going forward, keeping 15-year product would be
about $1.5 billion?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yes, Paul, we've been retaining – of the $8 billion we've been retaining roughly about little
less than 20% of that. It's the only thing we've been retaining in large part was the non-agency eligible and also some of
the adjustable rate product that we had in there. We've been releasing the fixed rate mortgages. We transitioned in the
fourth quarter to holding the 15-year fixed rate product into our portfolio, but quite frankly, very little of that actually
hit in the fourth quarter. That transition takes about 90 days and so you'll see more of that occurring in the first quarter.

<Q - Paul J. Miller>: In the first quarter. And then the – you said you launched a new HELOC product is this – and
this is going to be for a portfolio product? Can you add some more color to that?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yes, we had historically been an equity line offering, and in the third quarter of this year,
we put together a fixed rate, fully amortizing equity loan product that we rolled out to all of our consumer channels,
and production in the fourth quarter was up some 23% over third quarter. We're encouraged by the results of that. We
like that product and that it is fully amortizing and it is fully funded on the day of origination, and if you look at sort of
how it stacks up from a Basel III standpoint, it's a very capital-friendly Basel III product.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Is this mainly second liens or can be first and second liens?

Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Hey, thanks. Just as a follow-up on some of the questions Paul was asking. In terms of HARP, it
seems like you guys may have added capacity. You noted that take-up rates have been almost 20% so far. Can you give
us your expectations of how high you think take-up rates for HARP could go as we look out through the rest of 2013?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Well, if you look at our portfolio, we're servicing about $40 billion in mortgages. That's
large for us, but, in terms of the overall market, we're fairly small player, but $40 billion in servicing. And if you look
at – when we run the analysis, we've only refinanced, we believe approximately 20% of the customers in that customer
base into the HARP II program. If you look at our production, now the $8 billion in mortgage production we did last
year, $1.6 billion was HARP II related. Of that $1.6 billion, only 50% of that was mortgages that we serviced. And it
varied from month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, but I would say, irrespective of which time period you looked at, it
ranged from 23%, 24% of production to as low as 18%, 19% of production, but I think sort of keeping it in that 20% of
production range, is sort of where we still think that sort of falls out over the next few months, unless there is a shift in
customer behavior that we have not yet seen. But there are an awful lot of people still eligible for that program. We're
reaching out to those customers, making sure they understand the program and making sure they understand the
benefits of that program, and then trying to help them through that program. And so, I think it's a win-win for the
customer and for our bank. So we're working hard on that.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Okay. And just on expenses, when you think about the Regions360 initiative, how much
incremental dollar spend are you putting into this as we look out over 2013 and how do you anticipate us seeing the
benefits of this coming through? And just when we think about the overall expense base, you alluded to credit-related
cost continuing to come down, should we expect to see credit-related cost coming down, but core operating expenses
actually increasing from the current run rate?
<A - David J. Turner>: Well, let me talk – your first part was Regions360. Regions360 is an approach to doing
business the way we want it done with our customers, which is to help them through all of their needs, through all of
their financial needs. Grayson had mentioned earlier about making investments in people that generate revenue for us.
Don't take 360 as being a new initiative where we have to hire a bunch of people. It's getting our people to do what we

want them to do, to execute on behalf of our customer and we think you'll see that in terms of more pull-through in
terms of getting a deeper relationship with our customer. As an example today, 50% of our deposit customers have one
product type with us that we need to expand that and Regions360 will certainly help us to do that. So it's bringing the
full bank to our customers that we expect.
From an all-in expense point, again, we think our adjusted expenses for 2013 will be down from 2012. No one area
really drives that. It's just got constant focus on every single line item, but if you wanted to look at the biggest movers,
you have to look at our largest expense categories that we currently have, which is salary and benefits and occupancy
expense. We do have things like credit related it'll come down some as non-performers continue to attrite and I
mentioned credit card servicing earlier and then the REIT related savings that we have.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: But, we've talked about – inside the company, we've got to generate positive operating
leverage and in order to do that, we have to look at both expenses and revenues and clearly have to be disciplined on
expenses, but where there is opportunities to invest in people or technology or products, that we believe has an
opportunity to generate revenues and to generate positive operating leverage, we don't take advantage of that, but the
early question, you've really got to be pretty disciplined in that balanced approach to make sure that your investments
are smart, and – but we recognize we still got to manage the expenses, but you still got to have a franchise that has the
ability to grow also.

<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: David, how are you?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Chris.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: Just a follow-up, I know we're kind of beating a dead horse on the expenses but David,
could you determine what the overall environmental costs were in the expense line of fourth quarter and what a
normalized run rate of them might be as we go forward?
<A - David J. Turner>: Well, let me kind of give it to you for a year or so. If you kind of look at our run rate, we still
think we have $200 million in terms of environmental expense, some of which we will always have, right, it's not going
away. We do think there's over time maybe up to half of that number, perhaps a little less than that. I would not look to
that as being a huge driver of any expense savings that we get 2012 to 2013. Yes, it will be a piece of it, but I think as I
mentioned earlier that you really have to look at all the categories because we have an intense focus on every dollar that
we spend and that will just be one of the areas where we have some savings in 2013.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: That's good color. If I can follow up with two quick questions, more logistical, the
preferred dividend this quarter, if I did my math right on the most recent preferred, is that dividend can be closer to $8
million per quarter than the $4 million was reported this quarter?
<A - David J. Turner>: That's correct.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: And then finally on – you're going to save about $28 million annually on the termination of
the third party investment in the sub, is there any lost revenue to that termination?
<A - David J. Turner>: No.

Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby of Guggenheim.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Hey, Marty, good morning.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Good morning. Well, first I have to, David and Grayson, applaud you on the 15-year
mortgage decision. Dave, I want to know a little bit of background on how you were thinking through that because
we've talked about it so much in the past looking for some term assets, but kind of what's changed your thinking at this
point?
<A - David J. Turner>: Well, Marty, as we mentioned all year, we couldn't make arguments on both sides of that
trade. We thought at the time that the gains were more important to us as we continue to accrete capital and put
ourselves in a position that we're in capital-wise. Obviously, with a low rate environment, you're taking – you haven't
analyzed that marginal dollar. Where do I put it to get the best return – risk-adjusted return I can get, and over the year,
as we became very comfortable with our capital position and again after looking at the market, market's thoughts on
how it treated gain on sale versus the lack of loan growth, that also has to enter into the picture and so when you kind of
bring those two things together, we felt that it was time for us to switch the thought and put the – give up the
incremental liquidity, if you will, for mortgage-backed securities and put it in the 1 4s that go on the balance sheet. So,
it was a close call either way, but we think this shift for us would be net-net positive.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And is it a pure substitution for securities or are you dipped into the $3.5 billion of
short-term assets, which are only earning 22 basis points. Will there be any real redesign or shifting of the asset
sensitivity or are we still waiting on that?
<A - David J. Turner>: Well, you'll continue to see us work down. So, I guess at year end now that you see our
balance sheet, $3.5 billion, earning a quarter point, that number shifts around quite a bit. You shouldn't see us on
average throughout the year to have that much. Most of that is incremental to the proceeds if we did – if we sold the
loans and took the proceeds; we go into some of our mortgage-backed securities. So you are trading out $2.75 billion
for $1.5 billion. We already have our repositioning of our investment portfolios, as I previously mentioned, to take
more credit-related assets, but I think you should think about it in the context of a mortgage-backed versus the
mortgage itself.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And looking at credit card balances, they've been dropping pretty consistently and now
we're bringing this on board, we finished the transition; do you think that those balances can start to turn around as you
go forward now?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yes, we saw some stabilization towards the end of the year and actually saw a little net
growth, but still at the end of the day, you probably, you know, Marty, you'd probably still call that flat. But I think we
have some pretty strong plans now that we have that portfolio in-house. We've seen improvement in sales out of our
branches and we've got marketing programs for 2013 that we believe we'll deliver growth in that portfolio. And we'll
have to demonstrate that to you, but we're encouraged by the early signs we're seeing.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: And then lastly, I just want to hit on what's happening with the HARP. What is causing
only 20% penetration of those refinances as you've gone through this year? What's the critical thing that you've –
they've had a year to go and refi. What's really been holding the customers back from coming in and being able to get
those loans and what will change that as we move forward? And that's it, thanks.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Well, I mean, Marty, I would tell you, it's a great question. It's a question we ask ourselves
often and when you look at the programs, the rates, the rate and terms have been very attractive. If you're one of these
customers who are eligible for this program, anecdotally, what we hear back from customers is some customers still are
– are still not as knowledgeable about the program as we'd like them to be. So we're trying to increase our level of
customer communication and customer education about it. We also know that a number of customers who may be
transitioning from the home they are in, maybe to another home will not participate, if they are going to refinance. So –
and if you look at all the anecdotal comments you hear from customers, it causes us to believe that there's still a

potential upside of more volume.
I do think the underwriting process for a mortgage is a very rigorous process right now and so, unless it provides a
tremendous amount of benefit, people are probably somewhat reluctant but we think once we explain the benefits of
refinancing and what it can do for these families from a cash flow standpoint, we've been very successful in
underwriting a number of these. We continue to build capacity to do this and I think others around the country are as
well.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: So do you think just that this last year has been kind of a passive because of the capacity
issue, just taking what they came into the door. Now what you're going to do is take on more of an active educational
process, proactively, by going out to the customer and encouraging them to come in that way?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: That would certainly be true for us.

Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy of RBC.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Gerard.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Good afternoon. Can you guys share with us, if you assume your SIFI buffer is going to be
25 basis points, maybe it's slightly higher, let's assume for a moment for the purpose of this question that it is 25 basis
points and you are required to carry Tier 1 common at 7.25%, what level above that are you going to be comfortable in
carrying in terms of your capital?
<A - David J. Turner>: Well, Gerard, I'm not so sure that the SIFI buffer is the ultimate driver there. I think there are
other things that would need to – that we need to think through and that is, one of the biggest one is OCI and how that's
going to be treated. You still have buffers related to operational risk and other elements that you want to consider in the
whole capital plan. And so, we've kind of mentioned over time that we thought capital kind of settled out in that 8% to
8.5% Tier 1 common range. I'll tell you though; it's still up for debate. We have a lot of discussion that's going on even
as we speak relative to things like OCI, the sin bucket for deferred tax assets and mortgage servicing rights and the like.
But as we kind of cut through all of that, we still see as of right now somewhere in that 8% and 8.5% range as being
probably where it settles out.
And, we reserve the right to be wrong on that, but that's our best guess now.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Okay. When you look at your securities and cash as a percentage of total assets today, it's
about 27%. Where do you see that ratio needing to go to get to peak profitability for you guys and how long do you
think it'll take to get there?
<A - David J. Turner>: You've asked the question of the day. That is something we constantly look at. Actually we'd
love to take a percentage of our securities book and deploy that in loans, if we can get properly priced, properly
structured loan growth. I think historically if you look at percentages of earning assets for securities booked, you
generally had been in that 15% to 18% range.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Correct.
<A - David J. Turner>: We understand and acknowledge we're way above that. I think most people are carrying more
securities than they would like to today. If we can get some uncertainties taken care of in the economy, whether it'd be
the cliff, the debt, the uncertainties in Asia and Europe and get some confidence in the marketplace, we could see some
loan demand, which we have the liquidity to shift into that really quickly. So, I think working that down to that range I
just mentioned is what we want to do over time. It'll take us a while. It's hard to tell you how quickly we can get that
deployed, but it is the reason that we have started to take more credit risk in investment portfolio, which is historically

and predominantly established to cover liquidity. But we believe – we had a 78% loan to deposit ratio, we have plenty
of liquidity and we don't have a lot of long-term debt, but we think that we can take some extra credit risk in that
investment portfolio to give us somewhat of a proxy for credit that we'd put on the loan book. That being said, we're in
the relationship business. We are in the business to make loans to people and businesses and that's what we want to
continue to work on.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Recognizing that is the primary focus here is growing the loan book, of course, would you
consider paying down some of that high-cost long-term debt that you have on the books and then just reducing that
securities portfolio? So, you would almost shrink your balance sheet to increase the profitability of the company?
<A - David J. Turner>: Well, we talked earlier about liability management. You saw us do some of that this past year.
We have about $750 million worth of debt maturing all-in this year. I think $250 million of that is at the holding
company and $500 million is in the bank. We've already had that considered in our liquidity planning, which we start
two years out. But we are looking for opportunities to reduce our all-in funding cost, in particular our long-term debt
cost, which today is about right at 5% after considering swaps. And so you clearly are hitting on something that we
look at all the time in terms of how we might take that out.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: And my final question is on the securities portfolio. What's the duration, the average
duration, of the portfolio? And then what is the duration of the securities that you put on in the fourth quarter into that
portfolio?
<A - David J. Turner>: If I look at the overall portfolio, it changes as a policy prepayment fees keep moving around.
But today we're probably two and three-quarter years roughly. If you look at what we put on in the fourth quarter, that's
probably, I don't know, three years maybe?
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Thank you.
<A - David J. Turner>: Okay.

Your next question comes from the line of Jennifer Demba of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Jennifer.
<Q - Jennifer Haskew Demba>: Good afternoon. A question on your corporate banking effort, I'm just wondering if
you could, Grayson, just discuss kind of the progress you made in the last couple of quarters and the growth you're
expecting from that effort over the next one or two years?
<A - David J. Turner>: On corporate banking businesses?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Jennifer, when you look at – we look at our commercial line of business, really most of our
growth over the last year has really come from the upper end of what we would call middle market and what is
generally referred to as corporate banking. Our corporate banking efforts are not that large in that – the way we sort of
have our business dissected is in our small business – our business and community banking approach, we go up to
about $20 million in sales in our commercial middle market C&I, we'll go anywhere from that $20 million up to as
much as $2 billion in sales. So, we're really focused on that core middle mark space.
That being said, most of the growth over last year has come in the upper end of that, with smaller companies, smaller
businesses really behaving more like the consumer, still no more deleveraging and carrying larger amounts of cash
reserves. We are seeing a little bit broader demand than we'd seen before. From a strategy standpoint, we've tried to
pick certain industries that we're specializing in, like asset-based lending, healthcare, transportation, energy and also
franchise restaurant. And we've tried to focus on those industries. We recruited some really strong bankers in those
industries and we've used those bankers even though they may be located in one market or another. We've used them
franchise-wide across all of markets and have generated what I think's some pretty good strong growth in our

commercial book of business.
Where we have seen the decline really has been in – owner-occupied real estate has continued to decline throughout the
year, but that's not surprising because most of that product is in the lower half of the middle market space and in the
business and community banking space. The other side is the investor commercial real estate. That portfolio had so
many stressed loans in it, a lot of those stressed loans have had to be resolved in the course of business one way or the
other, and so you've seen that de-risking activity. But as I mentioned earlier in the call, our production has increased on
that segment and when you look at the overall commercial business,
I would again say we probably had the best December we've seen in a long time. And going into January, we feel pretty
encouraged by it. We'll it hold up through the year? Again, the economy being what it is, we're continuing to see
incremental improvement in the economy, and we hope that there's more certainty around a lot of fiscal issues and our
customers get back to investing in their businesses and I think we'll benefit from that, if that occurs.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo Securities.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Good afternoon. Thanks very much for taking my question. Most of my questions have been
asked and answered, but just one quick question, I guess, to hit on the mortgage subject again. Just curious as to – with
the new recommendations for QRM mortgages coming out recently, how did that affect your outlook for mortgage
production or did it affect at all your desire to put the 15-year mortgages on your balance sheet? Just curious as to how
you're thinking about that new item for the industry.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: We've had our mortgage team going through all of those rules and guidelines and a lot of
the rules will have little to no impact on us. We think that there will be some adjustments to our business model that
we're doing today, but they're relatively small. And so our mortgage team at this juncture is not predicting a big impact
of those rules changes on our business, but our mortgage business has been fairly simple for a long time. And so, we're
not doing a lot of the things that would have impacted that business very strongly. So I think that at the end of the day,
the guidance was good. Glad we got the guidance, we'll adhere to it and we think we'll adjust our business model and
move forward without a lot of barriers.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Fair enough. And then for my follow-up, I'd like to – I'm not going let Barb get away totally
scot-free.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Thank you very much.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Barb, just curious in terms of you saw very nice decline in non-performing loan additions this
quarter. How are you thinking about that trend into 2013 within your guidance of continued improvement in overall
asset quality metrics?
<A - Barbara Godin>: Yes, even at the $350 million level, I would say that we're in that normal range, the high end of
the normal band.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay.
<A - Barbara Godin>: I do see that continuing to trend down, though, and I would say the place for you to look at is
our criticized and classified. Clearly as those numbers come down, movements into NPL will follow.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. Thanks very much.

We do. Your final question comes from the line of John Pancari of Evercore Partners.
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Good morning, John.
<Q - John Pancari>: Good morning. Just a couple of quick questions on loans, in terms of loan demand, can you – I'm
sorry if you already mentioned it, but would you discuss what you saw in terms of line utilization during the quarter,
where you see that trending?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Line utilization is relatively flat. It was down ever so slightly. We really haven't seen much
movement in that line utilization in the last few months, in that 43% utilization range approximately. We've obviously
in our commitments increased substantially, but line utilization really hasn't moved much at all.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. So in terms of borrower confidence, I mean we've heard some of the other southeast-based
banks indicate that they're seeing a pretty good pickup in confidence post the election and the near term resolution of
the cliff for now. So, are you seeing some improved activity amid your borrower base?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: I think overall we'd say that confidence is incrementally better, but it's a little mixed. I
would use the word mixed. I think that clearly our larger customers are more confident than our smaller customers are
today. I do think that, I'm not sure how many cliffs we have, but getting past what we did recently really helped the
overall confidence level. I think if we continue to make positive progress on the fiscal side, that corporations will
become more confident. Because I would tell you, business – people in business, they want a more confident
environment. I think they are poised ready for a better economy to start executing on their plans, but right now, I would
say it's better, but not – the movement has been incremental, not a big, huge swing.
<Q - John Pancari>: Okay. That's helpful. And then lastly, in terms of your loan book, can you discuss where you're
seeing the new money yields come in on your new loan originations by type? Just want to get an idea of what the
competitive pressure that you're seeing there in your pricing?
<A - O. B. Grayson Hall>: Yes, I mean, I'll make a few comments, then I'll ask Barb to speak on it as well. Clearly,
competition for lending opportunities has increased and so I would characterize the kind of spreads we're seeing on
transactions today still historically better than what we had seen in the past, but not as high as they were a few quarters
ago. So I think pricing is starting to tighten a little bit, but still at levels that we would say are better than what we've
historically seen.
Probably the most tightens has been on the commercial real estate portfolio, where those spreads have really gotten
wide, right after we really got into the crisis. And those, while they are still relatively high, they are tighter than they
were. And Barb, do you want to add to that?
<A - Barbara Godin>: If you look at middle market spreads in general, going back even as far back to 2004, and
where we are today, they're generally pretty flat. They went up clearly during the course of the recession back in 2010,
they were up. As Grayson said, they've come back, they've tightened. Again, all in, if you look at some of our
individual businesses, things like business and community banking clearly has a much better yield than some of the
other. And our business banking spreads, again, they were up significantly in 2009 and 2010 and they have come back
