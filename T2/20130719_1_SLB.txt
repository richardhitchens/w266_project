And now I'll turn the call over to Simon.
Simon Ayat
Thank you, Malcolm. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in this conference call.
Second quarter earnings per share from continuing operations, excluding charges and credits, was $1.15. This is an
increase of $0.18 sequentially and is $0.14 higher when compared to the same quarter last year.
During the quarter, we completed the wind-down of our operations in Iran. And as a result, we have now classified this
business as a discontinued operation. All prior-period amounts have been restated.
As previously disclosed, we completed the formation of our OneSubsea joint venture with Cameron prior to the end of
the quarter. We recognized a $1 billion gain in connection with this transaction, which equates to $0.77 in terms of
EPS. We also recorded $0.26 of charging related to the impairment of drilling related equity investments.
From an operational perspective, we had a very strong quarter. Oilfield Services second quarter revenue of $11.2
billion increased 5.8% sequentially. Pre-tax operating income increased 15.9% sequentially, while pre-tax operating
margin improved 178 basis points to 20.4%.
Sequential highlights by product group were as follows. Reservoir Characterization revenue of $3 billion increased
9.6%, and pre-tax income grew by over 25%. This resulted in margins improving by 380 basis points to 30.1%. This
growth was driven by very strong performance in both wireline and WesternGeco combined with the seasonal rebound
in SIS [Schlumberger Information Solutions] software sales and maintenance.
Drilling Group revenue of $4.3 billion increased 4.4%, and margins improved by 97 basis points to 18.7%. These
increases were largely attributable to drilling and measurements and M-I SWACO on robust international activity.
Production Group revenue of $3.9 billion increased 4.4% while pre-tax income increased 12.6%. This resulted in
margin expansion of 116 basis points to 15.9%. Growth was led by Well Services as a strong performance
internationally and in U.S. land more than compensated for the impact of the spring breakup in Canada. Completions
and well intervention were also significant contributors to the growth.
Now turning to Schlumberger as a whole, the effective tax rate, excluding charges and credits, was 23.3% in the second
quarter compared to 23.8% in the previous quarter. We continue to expect the effective tax rate for the full year of 2013
to be in the mid-20%s. However, this can vary on a quarterly basis due to the geographic mix of business.
Yesterday, our Board of Directors approved a new $10 billion share repurchase program to be completed at the latest
June 30, 2018. Our strong projected cash flow over the next five years allows us to increase the level of share buybacks
while also maintaining enough flexibility to continue to take advantage of growth opportunities.
Let me take this opportunity to remind you how we manage our cash flow. Our first priority is to reinvest into the
business to drive growth. We do this through CapEx and the investments we make in R&D and future revenue streams.
From a dividend perspective, over the past ten years we have increased our dividend on average by 13% per year. We
will continue to review this on an annual basis with our board. After that, we will continue to be strategic when it
comes to M&A. then the balance will be spent on stock buybacks.
For the first six months of this year, we have generated $3.4 billion of cash flow from operations. Net debt at the end of
the quarter was $5.6 billion as compared to $5.3 billion at the end of the first quarter.
Significant liquidity events during the quarter included: $906 million of CapEx; $600 million payment to Cameron for
the OneSubsea transaction; and $500 million of stock repurchases. During the quarter, we repurchased 6.84 million
shares at an average price of $73.07. CapEx is still expected to be approximately $3.9 billion as compared to the $4.7
billion we spent in 2012.
And now I will turn the conference call over to Paal.

Paal Kibsgaard
Thank you, Simon. Our second quarter results were strong, as international activity recorded significant progress and
North American results benefited from solid execution on land and increasing deployment of new technology in
deepwater areas.
Sequentially, revenue was up 6%. Margins expanded by 178 basis points, which together yielded a 16% growth in
operating income. Compared to the same quarter last year, operating income was up 12%.
The results were driven by solid activity levels in all our main markets as well as market share gains for a number of
our product lines on the back of new technology sales and our strong execution and integration capabilities.
I am pleased with the overall results and even more so with the consistency in our business performance throughout the
company, seen for instance in the margin levels of our four main operating areas, which are all at or above 20%.
The focus on the quality and efficiency of our execution is also reflected in our incremental margins, which were north
of 50% sequentially; as well as the cash flow from operations, which was $2.3 billion, driven by both improving asset
utilization and reduction in the use of working capital.
The strength in our international business was again evident in the second quarter, with year-over-year revenue growth
of 12% and margin expansion of 173 basis points to reach 22%, making up over 70% of the operating income of the
quarter.
Activity and customer plans confirmed our expectations for the year in all our major growth markets, while revenue per
rig continued to steadily increase as a function of new technology sales, increased integration related activity, and a
favorable business mix.
Our ability to consistently execute remains critical in the international markets and is a driver for both our market share
gains and superior margin performance. While we continue to replace competition on contracts where they are unable
to deliver, we are becoming more and more selective in terms of where and when we do so.
In Latin America, revenue was flat sequentially despite a 2% drop in rig count, while margins increased 107 basis
points to 20.6%. On a year-over-year basis, revenues increased 3% while margins expanded 153 basis points.
Our Latin America business showed commendable resiliency this quarter by maintaining laser focus on execution,
technology sales, and cost control, overcoming both activity headwinds and new contract mobilizations and startups. In
Mexico, the third big run for production incentive contracts was concluded, where we ended up bidding for only one of
the six blocks. Drilling activity remained soft in the north and east regions of the country following the budget shifts
announced in the first quarter, while the business offshore continued to ramp up.
In Venezuela, we signed a new agreement with PDVSA at the end of May, and we are now in the process of ramping
up our activity in the country, while payments are on plan.
Elsewhere in Latin America, the Shushufindi SPM [Schlumberger Production Management] project in Ecuador is
progressing well, with production levels well above the agreed targets; while in Argentina, we continue to be active in
reservoir studies and well set operations relating to the Vaca Muerta shale developments.
In Brazil, we continued to mobilize resources during the quarter for the new contract signed with Petrobras, although
overall activity levels were down sequentially. We have several new IPM [Integrated Project Management] projects
starting in the second half of the year. However, the overall activity level is expected to remain flat to slightly down for
the rest of the year.
Overall, our outlook for Latin America remains unchanged, with 2013 being a transition year in terms of activity for
the region. And we remain comfortable with our position, our plans, as well as the actions we have taken to handle the
somewhat challenging business environment.

In the Middle East and Asia, revenue grew 11% sequentially on a 3% rig count increase, while margins increased 178
basis points to 24.6%. On a year-over-year basis, revenues increased 28% while margins were up by 330 basis points.
In the Middle East, growth was again spearheaded by Saudi Arabia and Iraq, but our United Arab Emirates and Oman
geo markets also posted strong results. Common to all these markets is that we have gained noticeable share in the past
quarters.
Our business in Saudi Arabia continues to grow through a diverse portfolio of projects on both land and offshore, and
driven by both drilling and rigless activity. In Iraq, we have on the back of an unmatched execution track record built
up a significant business that is now starting to yield excellent results. Activity levels continued to increase both in the
north and in the south of the country. And with our business footprint and contract portfolio, we have clear leadership
in what is shaping up to be a very interesting market for us.
Asia also contributed strongly to the area results by delivering record revenue in four geo markets, driven by robust
market share and new technology sales. China led the Asia growth on a rebound from seasonally low land drilling and
stimulation activity in the previous quarter and also helped by an upswing in offshore activity.
We also posted very strong growth in Australia, driven by continued growth in unconventional activity on land as well
as offshore and deepwater activity in the northwest and in Papua New Guinea.
In Europe, CIS, and Africa, revenue was up 10% sequentially and margins increased 275 basis points. On a
year-over-year basis, revenues increased 7% while margins increased 33 basis points. As expected, Russia led the
growth in the second quarter, as the high volume land as well as the offshore business entered the most active phase of
the calendar year. E&P investment and activity levels in the country remained very strong in terms of offshore and land
activity as well as for exploration and development, and Russia will be one of our fastest growing markets in 2013.
In the North Sea, WesternGeco saw strong activity as the seismic acquisition season started, while the offshore drilling
rig count stayed more or less flat.
In North Africa, rig activity in Algeria started to rebound following the security incident in the first quarter, while rig
activity in Libya remained flat due to delays and ongoing security challenges. In sub-Saharan Africa, activity in the
Gulf of Guinea as well as in East Africa was robust. On the other hand, activity in Angola was subdued in the second
quarter due to project delays. However, the activity outlook for the second half of the year remains strong, driven by
both exploration and development projects.
In North America, revenue was up 2% sequentially while margins increased 65 basis points to reach 19.7%. On a
year-over-year basis, revenues were flat while margins were down 83 basis points. In the North America land market,
the rig count dropped 14% sequentially, driven by the Canada breakup and also impacted by the June flooding in
Alberta, while the downwards pricing trend in U.S. land continued in the areas of drilling, stimulation, and wireline,
although this slowed in pace during the quarter. However, continued strong drilling efficiency, resulting in solid growth
in horizontal wells and frac stages completed, partly offset these headwinds.
Looking at our land performance, we continue to execute very well in all our product lines, and we also see a gradual
improvement in the uptake of our new shale technologies throughout the Characterization, Drilling, and Production
groups.
In the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, the deepwater rig count is now 17% above pre-Macondo levels. And on a year-over-year
basis, activity has increased by 30%. The call for reliable and efficient service delivery in addition to risk mitigation
technologies continues in this growing market and is yielding very strong results for a number of our high margin and
high market share product lines. In addition to the Dual Coil fleet operating in the Gulf of Mexico, WesternGeco also
started IsoMetrix operations in Eastern Canada during the quarter.
Turning next to technology, during the quarter we closed the OneSubsea joint venture with Cameron, and the JV is now
operational. Cameron, with its long history of innovation and firsts in the subsea market, is an industry leader in design
capability, manufacturing excellence, and successful installations. In addition to this, Schlumberger brings a deep
understanding of the reservoir as well as industry leading well completions, subsea processing, and integration

capabilities. Through the combination of these strengths, OneSubsea will offer best-in-class subsea solutions,
optimizing the complete subsea production system, and helping our customers improve production and recovery from
their subsea developments.
In other areas, we saw growing customer interest in a number of our new or recently commercialized technologies. In
wireline, the Saturn 3D fluid sampling probe is enjoying one of the most rapidly growing deployments of new
formation evaluation technology for a number of years. Its ability to acquire reliable pressures and high-quality samples
in difficult reservoirs has been impressive.
Elsewhere in Characterization, the SIS Studio Manager software, which went from concept to market release in only
eight months, is enabling an increasing number of customer geoscientists to access data, collaborate with peers, and
share best practices within Petrel workflows.
Within the Drilling Group, new and innovative drillbit technologies recorded significant progress. Drill bits equipped
with Stinger conical diamond elements that add stability and improve drilling speed have now made more than 650
runs in North America alone since their introduction in the first quarter and have achieved an average improvement of
15% in rate of penetration. And in the second quarter, we commercialized the ONYX 360 rotating cutters that we
believe will lead to dramatic improvements in bit run lengths in abrasive formations.
Lastly, at the Production Group, joint deployment of LIVE slickline with ACTive coiled tubing services demonstrated
clear benefits in the efficiency and effectiveness of our well intervention services, both on land and offshore. And units
were active in the quarter in both Latin America and the Middle East.
Let's now turn to the macro environment, where the business outlook for 2013 has remained largely unchanged since
April, as expansion in the global economy remains soft. In summary, the U.S. has shown little or no impact of the
financial sequester. The Eurozone is still in a two-year recession, although the risk of any country to leave the monetary
union appears reduced. And recent Chinese data have been mixed, with the outlook for a long and progressive soft
landing remaining unchanged.
The oil market picture is also largely unchanged. The market is more comfortably supplied than it was in 2012, but
spare capacity remains below pre-Libya conflict levels. The year-on-year increase in North American supply is enough
to face both increasing global demand and the production decline in other non-OPEC producing countries. The call on
OPEC remains unchanged and is in line with the group's production target of 30 million barrels per day, although the
market continues to support Brent prices over $100 per barrel.
For natural gas, the apparent rebalancing of the U.S. market is still fragile, as gas production remained steady and as the
power sector has already switched back to coal in some regions on higher gas prices. Internationally, Asian LNG prices
eased on weaker Chinese demand fronts, but remain close to oil parity; while in Europe, regional supply declines from
the North Sea and very cold weather supported higher spot prices.
Despite the overall slow progress in the economic environment, the latest releases of the third-party E&P spending
surveys saw upward revisions of upstream CapEx estimates, making 2013 the fourth consecutive year of double-digit
worldwide spending gains, driven by the international and offshore investments, noticeably in the Middle East and Asia
regions, while North American spending remains flat to slightly up. These estimates are further confirmed by the rig
count outlook that shows double-digit growth in a number of both shallow water and deepwater rigs active worldwide
and a 6% growth in the international land rig count in 2013.
In this market, we continue to focus on what we control, which is the quality, efficiency, and integration aspects of our
operational execution. Through this focus, which permeates our entire organization, we continue to demonstrate our
ability to deliver tangible results today, as can be seen by our revenue market share gains, unmatched operating
margins, strong cash flow, and consistent double-digit growth in earnings per share. We also remain confident in the
outlook of the industry, in our strategic position within the markets we operate in, and in our ability to further improve
all aspects of our performance going forward, which remains the overarching objective of the entire Schlumberger
team.

That concludes my remarks. I will now hand the call back to Malcolm.
Malcolm Theobald
Thank you, Paal. Greg, we'll now open the call for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<A - Simon Ayat>: Good morning.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Or good afternoon where you are; a question, Paal, for you on the North American market. You
continue to show some differential performance on the margin front despite the fact that – and show improvement in
terms of activity, revenue, and margins despite an anemic rig progression and a lot of discussion here about the well
count and so on. So I was just wondering if you can you give us a little bit of additional color as to what product lines
that you see will be benefiting from the shift in the type of drilling that's taking place in the U.S. marketplace, and what
kind of technology that Schlumberger has that will continue to enable Schlumberger to show differential margin
performance going forward.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I think if you look at what enables us to show differentiated margins, I think it's several things:
firstly, our ability to, I think, execute very well on land, whether that is on drilling or on pressure pumping; but also the
fact that we have a very well balanced portfolio in between drilling and production related activities on land as well as
in between land and offshore. So we obviously have a very strong offshore business, both rig related as well as seismic.
But what we have done in recent years, starting off in 2010, was to restructure the business on land, which in previous
years I would say had underperformed. And through that restructuring, I think we are performing on par with the best,
if not better, in most of our product lines.
So as you look at the kinds of drilling in the North America land marked now going towards more and more horizontal
wells, predominantly focused on liquids, all our drilling segments, obviously, benefit from that. At the same time, our
pressure pumping business through new technology and deployments such as HiWAY are also benefiting from this.
And we're also introducing to the market our own multi-stage completion technology, which has been a gap in our
portfolio in recent years, which also should enjoy quite significant growth going forward. So I think it's a good balance
between land and offshore, good balance between drilling and production on land, and overall very strong focus on
execution.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: As a follow-up on that, with respect to the overall margin performance of Schlumberger,
especially in the international marketplace, are you getting the sense that we're starting to see a shift in the industry that
will demonstrate Schlumberger's relative product and services strength, whether it's deepwater or otherwise? Do you
think we're at an inflection point in the marketplace where we're going to see the strengths of Schlumberger?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I think if you look at our margin performance in international over the past couple of years, I
think we've been highly differentiated continuously. So I think we've done well in our contract strategy, what contracts
we're prepared to take on and the ones that we see more as must-wins. We are continuously introducing new
technology, and we are also leveraging very well, I think, our overall size and infrastructure.

So to your question whether there's an inflection, we don't see any imminent inflection in bid pricing at this stage. We
are seeing a continuous uptick in another pricing indicator that we track, which is revenue per rig. That is continuing to
grow and growing upwards, and that obviously helps our profitability. What drives that up is new technology sales. It is
our integration capabilities where we do more and more services and products on each rig. And it also balances the
nature of the work that we take on. Typically we take on the more complex and more intense work because it's more
difficult to do. And if you perform well in that, that also is quite accretive to the margin. So bid pricing, we still don't
see any imminent inflection, but we continue to drive revenue per rig upwards through new technology, through
integration, and just very solid execution.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay, that's great. Thank you.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of James West from Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Hey, good morning, Paal.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: You mentioned in your prepared comments the third-party surveys, which of course
you're well aware that we do a very large survey. What we saw when we reran the numbers here in May and early June
was that international spending was creeping up about 300 to 400 basis points. So I'm curious if you're seeing the same
things from your customers who you're having the same, of course, conversations that we are with.
And then secondarily, which markets – do you agree with what we showed as the biggest growth areas of the Middle
East, Eastern Hemisphere in general, which seem like markets that are Schlumberger's back yard essentially. Do you
see those as the best growth markets for this year?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Okay, so to the first part of the question in terms of the spend, yes, if you look at the average
of the spend surveys, and we look at several, I think for international it was about 9% early in the year. I think it has
generally already revised upwards lately to average about 13%. So we generally agree with that upwards revision. We
see continued strong activity levels in the international market. And those spend surveys are also, I would say,
confirmed from the rig count outlook and also the rigless outlook in terms of activity that we have for the second half
of the year. So yes, we are in agreement that that upward revision seems to be reasonable. Then the second part of the
question was?
<Q - James Carlyle West>: On the specific regions where the spending is increasing, particularly the Middle East.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Yes, so we highlighted going into the year five major growth regions. We said that
international would grow north of 10% this year. We would see growth in Latin America. But due to the transitional
nature both in Mexico and Brazil, as we indicated earlier in the year, we weren't expecting a lot of growth coming out
of Latin America, which is being confirmed. We said that the main growth markets would be sub-Saharan Africa,
Russia, Middle East, in particular Saudi and Iraq, China, and Australia. Those were the five main drivers. So basically
ECA [Europe-CIS- Africa] and MEA [Middle East-Asia] were the main drivers of growth in international markets.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Okay, and then just a follow-up for me. The market share gains that you also highlighted
in your prepared remarks, are those happening in those markets that are growing the most rapidly?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I think in general that's fair. I would say in particular in MEA we are gaining quite good
market share.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Okay, great. Thanks, Paal.

Your next question comes from the line of David Anderson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Anderson>: Hey, Paal, just [inaudible] (29:43) real quick. Baker was saying that they thought the Saudi
recount is about six months behind schedule. Do you concur with that, and does that have any impact on your outlook
for the next 12 months?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: If you look at our view on the Saudi rig count, we're still expecting the total rig count, both
drilling and workover, to reach about 170 rigs by the end of 2013 or early 2014. So the rig count evolution in Q2 was
flattish, but this is all about when new rigs arrive and how they're commissioned and so forth. So we're still expecting
that we will reach the number that we had indicated earlier roughly by the end of the year or early 2014.
<Q - David Anderson>: Okay. And on some of these you mentioned in Mexico, you touched on the Chicontepec bids
from last week. I was just curious. What was it about those contracts that kept you away? Was it the location of the
work? Was it the contract structure, or are you guys just holding out for another set of tenders there?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Let me give you a little bit of background and our view on these production incentive
contracts. We've been very clear about our interest in production incentive contracts, but we also stress the importance
of picking the right project with the right terms. So we evaluated all the six fields that were offered in the third round in
Mexico. And based on the very detailed technical and commercial evaluations we did, we only found one field
interesting. Now we bid on this field at a price that would give us the returns that we required, and that isn't really
factoring in the additional risks associated with these contract terms. The winning bid [indiscernible] (31:15) per barrel.
And basically, we were not interested in doing that, so we did not win it.
<Q - David Anderson>: Okay, one last quick question on some of the buybacks you announced today. Can you give
us a sense of your philosophy on the pace of that buyback? You talked about the cash flow you're generating over the
next couple years. Should we expect the majority of that to go towards share repurchase? I heard how Simon broke
down in terms of the view. But it seems like you have an opportunity here to accelerate that over the next, call it, I don't
know, three or four quarters here. Am I right in my assessment?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Simon, do you want to...
<A - Simon Ayat>: Okay, thanks, David. As I mentioned in my remarks that we will – the buyback is basically a
balancing number for us when it comes to utilization of the cash flow. You're right in your assumption. If the cash flow
– that's why we said latest by 2018. So if the cash flow proves to be significantly better than what we have factored in
the five-year scenario in making the $10 billion program, we will accelerate it. We did this in the past. We look at our
excess cash over a period of time, taking into consideration the growth that we are anticipating in terms of CapEx and,
as I said, investment in future revenue stream activity, be it multiclient or production incentive contracts, and any
balance will go into the buyback, yes.
<Q - David Anderson>: Great, thank you very much.
<A - Simon Ayat>: Sure.

<Q - Jud E. Bailey>: I'm sorry, obviously a big market for you guys. You're pretty diverse. PEMEX still has pretty
ambitious growth expectations the next few years. They've obviously pulled back activity in the north. I wanted to get
your thoughts. They have a lot of tenders coming up and tenders in process. And it would look like you could see pretty
strong growth in that market next year.
In your view, is there any reason for skepticism that PEMEX maybe wouldn't follow through? Or is there anything else
going on down there that would give you some caution in terms of the growth opportunities down in Mexico?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: No, I don't see any reason for that. I think PEMEX has signaled that there's a number of bids
coming out for the remaining part of this year and probably into next year. We are going to actively compete for all of
that work, and we continue to see Mexico as a very interesting market for us.
<Q - Jud E. Bailey>: Okay, all right. And then next question, just on North America, obviously, very strong margin
results factoring in Canada and everything else going on in that market. With the continued growth in the Gulf of
Mexico and then let's just say that the U.S. land market continues at this methodical pace with very little pricing
traction, how should we think about Schlumberger's margins in terms of – we would assume you get some more market
share gains. You benefit from the very strong Gulf of Mexico and a rebound in Canada. Can you help us think about
maybe the near-term and the long-term margins for Schlumberger in the North America market?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I would say that over the past year when there's been significant struggles in the pressure
pumping business, I think we've shown commendable margin resilience. And again, as I alluded to earlier, it's down to
how we execute on land as well as the balance between land and offshore. So in terms of what the margin progression
is going to be, the main uncertainty is still what is going to happen in terms of pricing on land.
As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we still saw pricing pressure both in the drilling stimulation and wireline
product lines in the second quarter, but that was slowing somewhat in pace. So assuming that the pricing is reasonably
behaved and drilling efficiency continues to be the main activity driver going forward, I would expect us to show
continued margin resilience. And obviously, we're looking to drive up margins in any operating area. I can't promise
you exactly how that's going to progress. But we have a lot of focus on margins in every part of our business, and we
will continue to look to drive it up in North America.
<Q - Jud E. Bailey>: All right, great. Thank you, Paal.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Herbert from Simmons & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: Thanks, good morning. Paal, I was wondering if you could reconcile on the one hand the
double-digit E&P capital spending growth, not so much for this year but on a structural basis perhaps going forward
internationally and reconcile the tension between on the one hand the increasing need on the part of the customer base
to reinvest simply to keep production flat, and on the other hand increasingly challenged cash flows in a range-bound
oil price environment and rising cost environment. What do you think ultimately happens over the next several years,
assuming range-bound oil prices? Does the rate of E&P capital spending growth decelerate, or what happens?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I think we are still optimistic about the further need to increase spending overall E&P spending
going forward. We saw the upward revisions of the spend surveys this year. And at this stage, although it's early to
conclude on next year, the customers need to go through their planning process, but we're still optimistic about the
initial projections for 2014.
The resilience in spend, as you say, is linked to partly the work intensity linked to fighting decline, but also due to the
overall size and complexity of the projects that are undertaken, in particular in the international market. So I think for
the company – for the E&P companies that potentially are or will be facing cash flow issues, we expect them to be
likely to shift more of the spend within the E&P spend from more infrastructure related projects towards more well

CapEx. So that obviously will be good for our business because that's where we make most of our money. I think the
general shift from infrastructure towards well CapEx is what I expect to happen for those E&P companies that are
facing cash flow issues.
<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: Okay. And then secondly, switching gears, at the reservoir level, I'm curious as to what your
views are with regard to the outlook for U.S. oil production growth. Clearly, it has been extremely vigorous. We're up
about 1 million barrels per day on a leading-edge basis, that's 15% to 20% year over year. Yet I think there's a healthy
debate here with regard to the prospects going forward, the prospect of the Bakken growth flattening out and filling that
production growth vacuum with other basins perhaps not as easy as some contend. Where do you fall out with regard to
the domestic production outlook going forward, stronger for longer or decelerating or too early to make a case either
way?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: That's a good question. So first of all, I would say that the overall production increases that
we've seen out of North America liquids have been very impressive. We've always maintained that it's too early to
extrapolate the early production trends in terms of how great they see. And also I think it's too early to conclude
whether the trends we're seeing on the Bakken is something that is also sustainable. So for the early production trends, I
think we need more information to look at the production of these wells over a longer period of time.
And I think we also need to look at the initial rates of the inflow performance for the wells that the operators are
starting to drill outside of the fairways as they step out on the acreage. So I'm going to have to go for option three of
your multiple choice there. I think it's too early to say both whether we can extrapolate the initial overall trend from
North America or whether there is any significant impact from the recent trend that we've seen in the Bakken.
<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: Okay. Thanks, Paal.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Scott Gruber from Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Thank you. Paal, I found your comment about becoming more selective regarding when and
where you choose to replace peers interesting. Is this a reflection of capacity constraints, desires to avoid problematic
contracts, some of both? Why is this stance shifting?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I think, obviously, if a customer calls upon us and wants us to do work, generally we will do
our utmost to serve them. At the same time, we also have to make sure that we prioritize putting our equipment into the
customers that have initially selected us. And if we're going to go and replace a competitor on one of their contracts, we
obviously need a significant price increase from the initial rates that our competitors took the work on for. And there's
also obviously strategic considerations as to where do we put our capacity, what is the priority in terms of the customer
mix as well.
So I'm not going to go into the details of how we select what we do. I would just say that we will always look to serve
our customers as best as we can. But at the same time, we are continuing to look at how we optimize our business mix
and how we maximize the return from the resources that we have out in operations.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Okay, and then an unrelated follow-up. Can you discuss the efforts internally to improve the
working capital management? If you look over the last six months, you guys have held the line here on receivables and
other current assets, but I assume that you're not completely satisfied in the working capital at this point. And then if
you have any year-end targets you can share with us, that would be greatly appreciated.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Maybe I'll say a little bit about what I think the investment community calls self-help
initiatives. So first of all, in Schlumberger we believe in order to maintain and extend our market-leading position, we
always need to do better tomorrow than what we did today. So company-wide programs addressing execution
improvements are not really sporadic or episodic with us; they're a way of life.

So we have, in recent years, or in the recent year, put more focus on working capital, on cash generation. In the past,
we probably had more focus on more cost and resource management. We try to balance the focus in both cost and
resource management with cash management. So we have specific programs focused on capital efficiency, around
receivables, and also around inventory management. And we build this into our business plans and we also build it into
the incentives of the entire management team. So this is really how we try to put focus on it. And what we put focus on
at Schlumberger, we generally do quite well. Simon?
<A - Simon Ayat>: I'd like to add a bit to what Paal said. The last couple years since the acquisition of Smith, you've
probably noticed that the working capital as a percentage of our sales has gone up a bit. This was all planned as a result
of expanding certain segments or the product lines of Smith internationally, which are more inventory intensive
segments of the product line. We had to increase inventory to meet the expansion that we have done internationally.
One of the main reasons for acquiring Smith and integrating it with the rest of Schlumberger was also to use it for the
benefit of Schlumberger, which meant that some of those segments that were mainly U.S. focused, we took them
overseas and therefore increased inventory. We have managed to do this now. And going forward this will be – we will
not have to increase it at the same pace that we have done before.

Your next question comes from the line of Ole Slorer from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Thank you. First of all, congratulations on your decision to return a greater part of your cash flow to
shareholders. I think there's a very clear difference at the moment between the valuation of companies that do that and
those that don't in this slow-growth environment that we are in. First of all, what are the biggest technologies that drove
your share gains?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: In terms of specific technologies, let me elevate it and maybe focus in on the product lines. I
would still say we gained the most shares in wireline drilling and measurement. Those are the spearheading segments
for these efforts.
There are a number of new technologies that we have introduced in both these product lines over the past year or two,
and the uptake of them is good. And what we also find now, as you know, we restructured our engineering,
manufacturing, and sustaining organization about five years ago, and this is really starting to pay dividends now
because the new technology that comes out is performing much better than the initial technologies that came out five or
ten years ago. There were a lot more teething problems which we are basically now avoiding. So the new technology
which is commercialized within its first year is actually now growing significantly faster than what it did maybe five or
ten years ago. So I would say wireline drilling and measurements are still the ones that are gaining the most share.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Would you say that this is largely driven by offshore?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: No, I think it's both land and offshore.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Okay, and the follow-up question would be what market share changes are you seeing in the
offshore markets? You're having your largest competitors continuously make claims that they're gaining share across
all [indiscernible] (45:53) offshore technologies.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I don't know who they're gaining share from because it isn't us. I think in the offshore market,
we obviously have quite a high share. But we referenced Gulf of Mexico in some of these discussions, and we continue
to gain share in the Gulf of Mexico in several of our high-end product lines.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Okay. Just finally, how far away do you think you are from being in a new pricing cycle in North
America pressure pumping?

<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I would say there's still significant overcapacity of horsepower sitting on the sides today, so I
don't see that happening in 2013 at least. I think we're still going to have overcapacity as we exit this year.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Finally, just what are some of the technologies that are reducing the pressure pumping intensity of
shale oil and gas in North America?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: What technologies do that?
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Yes.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: HiWAY is obviously one of them. We use significantly less proppant and also generally less
water in the operations that we do with HiWAY. The other part or the other way of reducing or lowering the intensity
of these operations is to use much more of a subsurface approach prior to actually designing the job. So having a better
understanding of the subsurface will allow you to design the completion of the well and the amount of horsepower,
water, and proppant you use by being more selective on which stages you frac and also using more sophisticated frac
fluids like HiWAY.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Are you seeing a change in attitude there with the shale oil game becoming more and more of a
larger company game?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Not a dramatic change. But I would say we have – we started to get several key customers that
we are collaborating much closer with than what we've done in the past and where we engage, all the way from
characterization to drilling and production, and taking a much more sophisticated approach to how we go about
working with them on their developments. It's still relatively slow. But through some of the contracts we've won in the
past 12 to 18 months, we have established as part of those contracts very strong technical collaboration agreements,
which are also benefiting technology penetration.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Very fine. On Forest Oil, the contract in the Eagle Ford, how would you characterize that in the
context of what you said?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: I can't really comment on that. Forest will release their results I think in a couple of weeks. I
would need to defer you to them.
<Q - Ole Slorer>: Well done, Paal. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael LaMotte from Guggenheim. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Kirk LaMotte>: Thanks and good afternoon, guys. I just wanted to just follow up on the North
American onshore market and a little bit on Forest Oil as well as SPARK. Let me ask the question just from the context
of a shift in business model in North America I think both with Forest as well as SPARK. You have tried to introduce a
new model to the U.S. land market. I was just wondering now that you've been out marketing concepts like that for a
while, what the reception has been and what you think the uptake and penetration rate might look like.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: On SPARK, we have seen a reasonable uptake on it, nothing dramatic, which we weren't
expecting either. It's mainly focused on customers that are vertically integrated. They have their own horsepower with
very limited capabilities in terms of pumping more sophisticated fluid systems. So we continue to do SPARK-related
activity, but it isn't a significant part of our business, which we weren't really expecting either. But it has progressed
reasonably well, and we're happy with the performance from this. We are mainly doing SPARK in North America, but
we're also doing SPARK in China for some of the frac operations there.
The other part of your question in terms of the Forest Oil type of deal; initially, as you said, when we closed the deal,
our main motivation for doing that type of deal was to get a display window for our shale technology capability. So we

Your next question is from the line of Bill Sanchez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Thanks, good morning; Paal, two questions. One, I wanted to follow up on just how things
are progressing on the SPM side. In the first quarter you had mentioned ten projects, goal was to have two or three a
year. I didn't see anything in the press release with regards to another announcement there. Perhaps you could just
update us on your thoughts and maybe perhaps just size for us on a revenue basis annually what SPM is contributing to
the top line for Schlumberger.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: You're correct. We didn't sign any SPM projects in the second quarter. Our goal of adding two
to three projects a year basically stands firm. But again, as I mentioned on my comments on the Mexico bid round, we
will only sign the projects that we believe are right for us. This is all about portfolio management. It's about picking the
right projects, the right fields, with the right terms. And we have very stringent return criteria in terms of what we will
engage in. So our goal is two to three fields. If we can get the right ones, we will do it. And if we can't find the right
ones, we won't do it.
In terms of the impact on the business, it's still a relatively small part of our overall revenue stream. But by picking the
right projects, it is a highly accretive part of our revenue stream, and we will continue to focus in on maintaining it as
highly accretive.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Right, your view has been that these projects are accretive to margins in essentially every geo
market in which you've rolled it out. Is that correct?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: That is correct.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Okay, great. My second question was just to follow up on North America margins,
specifically as they relate to Geco, which was called out in the press release. But you didn't specify – perhaps I missed
it in earlier comments – whether or not Geco really was being driven in the Gulf more by the marine side of the
business, or whether we saw multiclient or maybe a combination of both. And then maybe just address Gulf of Mexico
Geco as we think about the balance of 2013.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: In the Gulf in terms of ongoing operations, we have one Dual Coil fleet operating. It continues
to operate in the central Gulf. It's got a good back level of things to do there on the multiclient side acquisition. And we
have an ongoing multiclient late sales business where we had some revenue progression, which is seasonal basically
from Q1 to Q2. We don't break out what that revenue progression was on the multiclient. You could see what the total
is. The total for Q2 worldwide was $250 million, up from $175 million in Q1. So a part of that was North America.
But I would say as a general comment on the multiclient performance in North America on Q2, it was below our
expectations. We were expecting more sales in multiclient than what we actually realized. In addition to the multiclient
business in terms of late sales and acquisition in the Gulf of Mexico, we also started a third-party survey offshore
Eastern Canada, and this is with IsoMetrix. So those are basically the WesternGeco business in North America.
<Q - William Sanchez>: That sounds like that continues, and second half of the year should be accretive to overall
North America margins?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: They should.

Your next question comes from the line of Angie Sedita from UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: Good morning, guys, or afternoon. It hasn't been said, so I will say congratulations on a great
quarter, very impressive to you and the team.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you.
<A - Simon Ayat>: Thank you.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: On Mexico, Paal, I appreciate the color on the production incentive contracts and the bidding
there. But your thoughts on – I believe the next round of awards will be IPM, potentially as much, I've heard, as $8
billion to $10 billion in contracts. Do you view that as the better and more attractive opportunity in the region? And
then along with that, have you had conversations with PEMEX on the potential timing and is it multiyear for Mexico to
open up and the opportunities there?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: What we know about the bids coming out is that there are a series of bids. There will probably
be single-service bids. There will be IPM well construction bids, and there will probably be more production incentive
type of bids coming out as well over the next couple of quarters.
So as I said earlier, we are very interested in the Mexican market. It is going to be highly competitive. It has always
been highly competitive. But it's about, as I said before, being able to bid strategically, trying to pick up the right
contracts and the right opportunities, and having a plan for how you would create value for PEMEX and at the same
time create value for Schlumberger as we engage in these contracts. So I gave you a quick summary of our view on the
third round of the SPM contracts. We will continue to evaluate every opportunity for gaining more work in Mexico,
and we'll engage in it with a view to make returns for the Schlumberger shareholders.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: All right, and then on the U.S. markets, thoughts on the pace of activity for Q3 and Q4. Are
you seeing based on your conversations with the customers still steadily higher in Q3 as far as activity? And Q4, on the
seasonal decline, or are we going to run into the de-spent budgets that we did last year?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Whether Q4 is going to see the same as last year, I think it's too early to say. Obviously, WTI
ticking up a little bit over the past month or so could be a positive preventing that from happening. But I think it's too
early to say what will happen in Q4.
Our overview on the second half of the year for U.S. land is I think rig count is going to remain relatively flattish. But
drilling efficiency is going to be the main activity driver; again, generating reasonable growth in stage count
sequentially. Looking at Canada, we expect the H2 rig count at this stage to come in – or the recovery in the H2 rig
count to come in lower than 2012, while the stage count we expect to be more or less flat with last year. And then
again, continued strong activity in terms of offshore Gulf of Mexico, both shelf and deepwater.
<Q - Angie M. Sedita>: And then finally, you mentioned Russia being one of the your strongest geo markets in 2013.
Is that in part driven by the Eurasia deal, or is it outside of that project?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: The Eurasia deal is part of our business and it's an important part of our business in Russia, but
it is only part of it. We have significant other activities, both on land and offshore both in Sakhalin and the Caspian and
the Barents and the Arctic. So we are very well, I think, diversified in terms of both customers and regions that we
operate in in Russia. And that's why I think we manage to sustain very high growth rates.

Your next question comes from the line of Jim Crandell from Cowen. Please go ahead.
<Q - James D. Crandell>: Good morning. Paal, one of your competitors was indicating in the marine seismic business
relative softness in bidding activity for the fall/winter season. Are you seeing that – let's say, what are you seeing in the
fall/winter season relative to the spring/summer season, and how does pricing look for that season right now?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: For the marine market, we maintain our positive outlook, which we have basically conveyed
over the past couple of quarters. The way we see it supply and demand appears to be relatively well balanced. We have
– in terms of bookings for Q3, we are basically already fully booked, and also Q4 in terms of backlog is filling up quite
well. So activity-wise, things are looking quite good for us.
In terms of pricing, in the second quarter, we didn't see any significant further traction in terms of basic bid pricing. But
we also track another pricing indicator, which is revenue per streamer. Our revenue per streamer was up about 10%
sequentially, and that's mainly at the back end of new technology and the type of service we conduct and also some
seasonality effects. That's basically where we stand.
<Q - James D. Crandell>: Good, that's helpful, and one follow-up question about WesternGeco. When you used to
break it out, this would of course be obvious, but could you give some indication where margins are relative to, let's
say, the oil service average at WesternGeco? I'm just trying to get a handle on how much margin leverage there is there
going forward.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: We are not breaking out what any individual product line is doing in terms of margin, so I can't
really comment on that. But given where pricing stands and given the very significant new technology portfolio we
have and just putting it into operation both on land in terms of processing as well as marine, we obviously see margin
upside potential for WesternGeco.
<Q - James D. Crandell>: Okay. Thank you, Paal.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you.

We have time for one further question today, and that question comes from the line of Jeff Tillery from Tudor
Pickering. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Good morning.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: One of the questions I have around the U.S. land business, you mentioned improved well service
and pressure pump utilization several times in the release. What are your thoughts around bringing some of the
never-deployed equipment into the market, given where your margins are? How do you see that as an opportunity in
the second half of the year?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: We will look at bringing equipment in from what we have parked when we can get the
utilization that we require for the overall suite. At this stage, we aren't looking to bring anything back in that we have
parked, and I don't expect that to happen in 2013.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: Thank you, and then last question just around the Reservoir Characterization business. With the
significant margin increase there, obviously multiclient helps. But if I look back historically, there doesn't really tend to
be a fall-off in multiclient sales in the third and fourth quarter relative to the second quarter. So any reason we should

think about margins perhaps stepping backwards in the Reservoir Characterization business in the second half of the
year?
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Nothing fundamental. There's always – this is a huge business, and there are mix effects
depending on what region grows. There are exploration and development types of mixes even in Characterization. But
overall I expect the Characterization group to continue to post very strong margins.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: Great, thank you, guys, very much.
<A - Paal Kibsgaard>: Thank you.
