Ahmet Muhtar Kent
Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'm going to start with an overview of our quarterly performance
and then spend the rest of the time addressing the strategic initiatives we announced earlier this morning in our separate
release.
So let's look at our performance for the third quarter. Our overall top-line results for the third quarter were below our
expectations. Comparable currency neutral net revenues grew 1% in the quarter and after adjusting for structural items
due to factors both within and outside of our control. We continue to face a challenging macro environment, more
challenging than was expected when we started the year. In many of our key emerging markets, we see deteriorating
economic environments, coupled with the continued softness in consumer spending in the U.S. and particularly in
Japan and Europe. This is placing strong pressure on the short-term performance of our business. These factors have
driven a deceleration in personal consumption expenditures. And as a result, the non-alcoholic beverage industry is
growing one to two points slower than our initial forecast at the beginning of the year.
With that said, there's no question that we need to improve our execution in many markets, especially our consumer
marketing and commercial strategies. Although we could point to various markets, this was most prominent in Europe
where we saw a continued challenging macroeconomic environment and also aggressive competitive pricing. We
achieved a 3% price/mix in Europe, which was partially offset by a volume decline of 5%. While we're not comfortable
with our year-to-date share performance in Europe, we, along with our bottling partners, know we must drive better
consumer and commercial strategies and execution that can benefit from incremental investment in the marketplace and
we are taking actions to address this situation.
That said, we are not discouraged nor are we any less enthusiastic about the opportunity in front of us. In markets
where we executed our strategies well, we saw solid progress. In North America, our disciplined approach to pricing
supported by incremental media investments, high-quality marketing programs such as Share a Coke and disciplined
price/pack strategies, as well as improved execution, is paying dividends with increased incidence, particularly among
teens and revenue growth in our sparkling portfolio.
In key emerging markets, including India, sub-Sahara Africa as well as the Middle East, our incremental media
investments drove recruitment with solid net revenue and volume growth. This gives us confidence that when we invest
in our brands, align on a system plan and focus on execution, we do see positive results. But to be clear, we recognize
that our incremental media investments, which have really started in earnest around the FIFA World Cup, will take
time to pay off.
Stepping back from our quarterly performance, we have taken a hard look at our progress to date. Our strategies and
our actions and realized that while the five strategic priorities we laid out at the beginning of the year are on the right
track, we recognize that we must do more. Above all, the scope and pace of our actions must change to improve our

ability to capture non-alcoholic beverage industry growth. And that change starts with me. I've asked my leadership
team to take this journey with me and to facilitate this change throughout our company. It's a journey we are ready to
embark upon.
In some ways, we've already enhanced our business with strategic investments in Keurig Green Mountain and intend to
further do so with our pending investment in Monster Beverages, which underscore not only our ability to adapt to
changing consumer trends, but also our commitment to further innovation. But these partnerships alone are not enough.
That is why we're laying out today a series of actions we firmly believe will drive the necessary changes to continue to
deliver long-term shareholder value.
First, we are streamlining and simplifying our operating model in order to speed decision-making and enhance our local
market focus to drive growth. This work is moving forward aggressively and we expect to focus the role for our
corporate center and further scale our back office to support processes and policies globally. This will also enable our
local operations to focus intently on demand creation in their individual markets. And as previously announced, we're
revising our long-term incentive metrics to provide a clear line of sight between our employees around the globe and
the metrics they can best influence.
Second, we will drive efficiency through aggressively expanding our productivity program. We plan to expand the
program from $1 billion in savings by 2016 to $2 billion in annualized savings by 2017 and $3 billion by 2019. This
productivity program will build on previous successful programs, encompassing our entire spend base, and will
supplant our existing plan announced earlier this year. A number of actions are already taking place. We are
restructuring our global supply chain, including optimizing our manufacturing footprint in North America, and
investing in technology to further streamline our operations. We are implementing zero-based budgeting across our
organization and aggressively prioritizing and redesigning our normal activities to further reduce costs. As I previously
mentioned, we are streamlining and simplifying our operating model, which will enhance our speed and agility and
result in lower operating expenses over time.
Finally, we are working to drive even more discipline and efficiency in our direct marketing investments. As a result of
these initiatives, we plan to fund the marketing programs and innovation required to reinvigorate and deliver
sustainable net revenue growth.
At the same time, we expect these actions will drive margin expansion and increase return on invested capital over
time. Our third action is to refocus on our core business model of building the world's greatest beverage brands and
leading an unmatched global system of strong local bottling partners. In North America, we have a clear and definitive
plan to refranchise the majority of our company-owned bottling territories by the end of 2017. So at that time, we will
retain approximately one-third of the total bottler distributed volume in North America. With respect to the remaining
territories, our intent is to ensure the bulk of these are refranchised at the latest by 2020.
Finally, outside of North America, we will continue to pursue opportunities to refranchise other company-owned
bottlers where it makes sense, where the business is ready and where we have able and willing partners. Fourth, we will
drive disciplined brand and growth investments with a long-term view across both sparkling and still categories. We
will take a balanced approach to ensure we can build our business while consistently delivering bottom-line results.
In Sparkling, as outlined earlier this year, we will continue to work to improve the quality of our marketing and scale
our global investments through a networked marketing model to improve top-line growth across trademark Coca-Cola,
Fanta and Sprite. During the second quarter of this year, we began to step up our media investments. Our investments
target markets and categories where our current media is underfunded relative to the market opportunity we see as well
as where we have the right price/package architecture and finally, of course, execution alignment with our bottlers.
In still beverages, we will continue to invest in our core growth priorities where we are a leader in notably juice and
juice drinks and enhanced hydration. We will expand our investments in selected profitable categories where we
believe we can capture value such as value-added dairy. And we will continue to leverage our partnership model with
companies such as Keurig Green Mountain, Monster and FairLife as well as targeted M&A to enhance our growth in
key categories. We expect these efforts to build on our global leadership in still beverages and accelerate growth over

time.
Fifth, we will drive revenue and profit growth across our markets with a further focus on geographic segmentation
recognizing that each market has an important role to play within our portfolio. We've targeted our markets with clear
roles to drive top-line growth with some markets focused on price, others on volume and the remainder on a balance of
the two. Beginning 2015, our incentive metrics will be expanded to include revenue growth and will be tied to these
clear portfolio roles.
We are confident that the actions we are announcing today will ensure that The Coca-Cola Company is best positioned
to capture growth in non-alcoholic beverages and continues to deliver long-term value to our shareowners.
Since its inception, our 2020 Vision has served to focus our system on the opportunity and to align on a common set of
strategies. We began the process of evolving our 2020 Vision with our bottlers earlier this year, a process that will
continue over the coming months. Together, we remain confident in the growth potential for non-alcoholic beverages.
While growth rates will be challenging in the short-term given the macroeconomic volatility, we believe that over time
consumer trends will support mid-single digit revenue growth. Importantly, the core sparkling category remains
resilient and has grown retail value globally for the first nine months of the year 3%, outpacing the non-alcoholic
ready-to-drink industry's total value growth of 2%.
And we also see effective profitable growth opportunities in still beverages, ones that we are well-positioned to take
advantage of, but ones that require faster action and greater and focused investments.
While we have more work to do here, it is clear that our 2020 Vision will remain focused on delivering value growth
for our system ahead of the industry. Importantly, the goal of doubling system revenues, one our system can always
aspire towards but it is not a goal to be pursued at any cost over a fixed timeframe and we are realigning our
expectations based on where we are today and the outlook for our industry.
Let me be clear. We see no change to our long-term target of high single-digit comparable currency neutral EPS
growth. We are updating our net revenue target to mid-single digit growth in order to reflect current reality including
the increased contribution from our new partnership model which will impact equity income rather than flowing
through net revenues and operating income. And we are evolving our primary profit metric from operating income to
profit before tax. Going forward, the profit before tax target will be 6% to 8% on a comparable currency neutral basis,
consistent with the previous operating income target of 6% to 8%. With that said, we must also be realistic. While we
are very confident in our actions, we are cautious in our outlook. The actions announced today and the additional work
we have to do will take time to implement and deliver improvement in our results.
As such, we expect to be below our long-term EPS growth target for 2014 on a full year basis. We will come back to
you with more contexts in December; however, we see 2015 as a critical year, a year in transition as we flawlessly
implement our new operating model amidst a continued challenging macroeconomic environment. I am confident,
however, that we have the brands, the greatest and most wide-reaching consumer product distribution system in the
world, the critical partnerships and most importantly, the people to return us to a more robust growth trajectory.
I'll now hand the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Kathy Waller, who will provide you with a more detailed
look at our financial performance, as well as an outlook on our business for the balance of the year. Following Kathy's
prepared remarks, Irial Finan, Sandy Douglas, Ahmet Bozer, Kathy and I will participate in our question-and-answer
session to address any questions that you may have today.
Kathy?
Kathy N. Waller
Thank you, Muhtar, and good morning, everyone. In recognition of our time, I plan to cover key highlights from the
quarter and outlook and then we can move to your questions.

Let's start by reviewing a few key drivers of our financial performance. After adjusting for unit cases without
concentrate sales equivalent, concentrate sales were in line with unit case sales for both the quarter and year-to-date.
Comparable currency neutral net revenue growth was 1% in the quarter and 2% year-to-date after excluding the impact
of structural items.
Our top-line growth slowed from the first half of the year due primarily to a volume deceleration principally in Europe
and China. Price/mix was positive across each of our geographies with the exception of Asia-Pacific due to geographic
mix. However, due to the composition of growth, we saw negative geographic mix at the consolidated level resulting in
1% global price/mix for both the quarter and year-to-date.
Comparable currency neutral gross profit was up 4% in both the quarter and year-to-date after excluding the impact of
structural items. Our gross margin expanded in the quarter due to pricing, favorable geographic and product mix and a
slight tailwind from commodity cost.
We generated one point of operating leverage in the quarter as continued investments behind our brands to accelerate
growth, including a mid-single digit increase in DME, were offset by tight control over operating expenses and the
reversal of certain expenses related to our long-term incentive plan. Comparable currency neutral operating income was
up 5% in both the quarter and year-to-date after excluding the impact of structural items.
The impact of currency was a three-point headwind on this quarter's comparable operating income results. Comparable
EPS was even in the third quarter, including a currency headwind of six points. Although the currency headwind and
operating income was in line with the outlook we provided last quarter, foreign currency unfavorably impacted EPS by
six points due to additional currency headwinds related to re-measurement gains and losses recorded in the line item
other income.
We generated $8 billion in cash from operations year-to-date and returned $1.9 billion to shareowners through net share
repurchases. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter of 2014, let me take a minute to update you on a few outlook items
as you model our business. We do not expect the current trajectory for unit case volume growth to improve materially
for the remainder of the year. We expect structural items to be a one to two point drag on net revenue growth and an
approximate two point drag on operating income growth in the fourth quarter of 2014.
After considering our hedge positions, current spot rates and the cycling our prior year rates, we now expect a
seven-point currency headwind on operating income during the fourth quarter of 2014, with a six point impact on
operating income for the full year 2014.
We expect net interest income to be approximately $100 million for the full year 2014. We now expect approximately
$2.5 billion in net share repurchases for the year, and we now expect our full year comparable currency neutral EPS
growth to be below our long-term target.
As we look ahead to 2015, we anticipate continued challenging macroeconomic conditions in most developed markets
as well as some key emerging markets. The best way to think about 2015 is as a year of transition. We will start
implementing changes to create our new operating model in the beginning of 2015, but incremental marketing
investments and margin enhancements will take time to fully materialize. Therefore, based on what we see today, with
our continuing need to invest in our business and recognizing that we are early in our planning process, we do not
expect our comparable currency neutral financial performance in 2015 to differ significantly from this year.
As we move through our planning process, we look forward to providing more details and a methodology to
benchmark our progress through 2015 and beyond. As such, we plan to host a modeling call in December to discuss our
2015 outlook including further details of the impact from our refranchising efforts in North America. However, given
the amount of questions around currency for next year, we did want to provide an initial estimate of the impact at the
PBT line to better help you model into next year. We currently expect a mid-single digit currency headwind on profit
before tax in 2015. We will come back with more contexts on the December call.
As Muhtar said, we are committed to taking the right actions to reinvigorate our topline growth over time. We have a
strong plan in place, and we are aligned as a team to deliver against our objectives.

Operator, we are now ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: Good morning.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Morning.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: So there's a lot of questions that could be asked, but I guess one that I just wanted to focus in
on is the change in target from focusing on operating profit growth to pre-tax income. And I guess it sort of suggests
that there is a contribution that will come from growth in equity income. Can you just give us some sort of concept or
some sort of gauge in terms of how much of the growth you actually expect to come from equity income, how much
comes from operating profit and just trying to get an idea of the proportions and whether or not there's actually a
suggestion that operating profit would grow slower than that in that goal.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yes, Bryan. Good morning again. This is Muhtar. I think the most important is that our
EPS target remains high single digits and our target for profit before tax is still 6% to 8%. And beginning in 2015,
revenue growth will be added as a metric in the company's incentive plans as well. So we're obviously looking at a
metric that really – that where the target remains 6% to 8% and moving the target to PBT really brings net interest and
equity income into consideration. And if you look back at the last three years, there really has not been a leverage
between OI and PBT meaningfully, so it would not have really made a difference.
Having said that, it does go back to what we said about broadening our long-term net revenue target to mid-single
digits. And we think that there's opportunity to grow equity income as we advance our existing partnerships as well as
explore similar models in the future. And using PBT instead of OI should make operations, in a way, agnostic in terms
of evaluating alternatives to extract value in a certain given category. For example, what you mentioned also, which is
partnership model versus concentrate model. So I think it's a better broadened way of ensuring that we can deliver
long-term sustainable value to our shareholders, and I'll pass it on to Kathy if she wants to add anything.
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: Yes. I'll just also say, Bryan, that remember we anticipate and we've been saying that with the
increases in interest rates, we will have interest expense versus interest income that we've been generating. So we don't
anticipate interest providing leverage below the line going forward. So the bottom line is we can't make the 6% to 8%
PBT without a significant amount coming from operating income.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay. So no suggestion that there was a material change in operating income growth, it's
just trying to collect the other pieces below that?
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: No, not at all.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: No suggestion in any respect.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question is from Ian Shackleton from Nomura.
<Q - Ian M. Shackleton>: Yes. Good morning. Previously, you've indicated on the $1 billion product due to savings
that will be all reinvested in media. Perhaps you can give us some idea of how much of the $3 billion will be

reinvested. And also what the phasing of that will be through to 2019 [ph] in spite of the (23:43) U.S. production
changes that's going to be quite backend loaded in that timeframe?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Hi, Ian. This is Muhtar. Good morning. Firstly, let me just give you some context around
the base. If you take – firstly, that's why we put out two numbers out there, $2 billion by 2017 and $3 billion by 2019 in
order to ensure that everyone sees that this is not backend loaded. It's just a number that really will be generated and the
run rate will be flowing through into our system and then we will invest some and use some for margin enhancement.
We did say that it will take some time to achieve. 2015 is a critical year where we really – it is the most important year
for us to make the changes that I mentioned to you in terms of a leaner, better operating model and therefore I think that
year should be seen as a year in transition.
So really when you look at our company, you see about $5.5 billion in total in marketing, about $4 billion in OpEx and
really of the $3 billion, about $1.5 billion will come out of that base of around $9.5 billion to $10 billion and then the
other $1.5 billion of the $3 billion will come out of about $25 billion COGS base and it's important to understand for
everyone that we will not be taking down the second number, $1.5 billion, when we refranchise with our aggressive
refranchising program particularly for the United States between now and 2017. So that number will stay that way and
then the bottlers will get additional opportunities for COGS synergies as the territories get refranchised on top of the $3
billion. So I hope that gives you some flavor and explanation into – and answers some of your questions.
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: So...
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: And – Kathy, go ahead.
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: So, Ian, if I could just add that on the initial $1 billion program, $400 million was in 2014 and
we are on track. So it continues into 2015 with the rest of the productivity will be giving us the flexibility to achieve
our targets over the long-term.
<Q - Ian M. Shackleton>: And if I can just come back on the 2015 guide, which obviously looks quite bearish versus
where the Street is. You seem to be highlighting there's going to be quite a lot of extra cost there without savings. Is it
also a comment that you're quite cautious around revenue growth, i.e., you seem to be implying it would be more in
line with 2014 which is more like a 2%, not a 3% plus? Is that right?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yes. I think given the sort of macroeconomic volatility out there and given the fact that
marketing investments are taking some time to flow back in terms of benefit, I'd just say that that's the best we see right
now and we will come back with a more robust and more detailed discussion on 2015 in our December call.
<Q - Ian M. Shackleton>: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Ali Dibadj from Bernstein.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, guys. So I think we're generally pleased that there's more urgency around price/mix and North
America franchise [ph] meant (27:18) and the cost-cutting, but I do want to understand a little bit better how much of
the cost-cutting you think you're going to need to reinvest. And really why you think you have to reinvest? And I say
that because, look, you're going to reinvest something and I want to hear what, but you're only going to get back to your
previous growth rates? But this whole time, a lot of the discussion is about blaming mostly short-term macro issues. So
is there something that's underlying [indiscernible] (27:50) worse, e.g., perhaps consumer [indiscernible] (27:54) or
something? And in fact, is it a good ROI to reinvest in the business and marketing versus taking some to the bottom
line and to shareholders who have been rather disappointed recently? So any help there would be great.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yes. I think what we're talking about is a balanced approach that will bring us back to our
long-term growth trajectory in terms of our financial performance. That is a combination of both growth more realistic
and better sustainable growth on the top-line as well as margin enhancements. So as we've said before, this additional
program of productivity will yield – will generate two things, we believe. Clearly, better growth as well as better

margin enhancement and the important thing here is that where we have – we will have a much better segmented –
geographic segmented analysis of countries where if you take the developed countries, we will be driving profitable
growth through innovation and productivity, for example, with top countries like Spain, Korea, Great Britain, Japan,
U.S., France and so forth. And then in terms of the developing countries, they will have a slightly different role,
maximizing value through segmentation and ensuring that we continue to build consumer loyalty, markets like Latin
America, Turkey, Poland, Nigeria. And in emerging markets like China, India, Indonesia, Thailand and so forth we'll
be maximizing, more skewed on the volume side and investing for accelerated growth.
That is why we need – we believe we need to continue to invest and the world is a very big place. It's not just the
countries that we live in and we know. It's a very wide place out there and there is significant opportunities to continue
to generate growth while at the same time – and we believe that there is a very good line of sight of how we invest and
how we get return from that investment, very disciplined and very important, transparent line of sight. And that's the
way we look at the segmentation approach and therefore, revenue, which is the target of what we've indicated to you,
will be a composition of volume and price. And so we're not throwing volume out the door, we're not – it's a balanced,
very balanced approach towards how we will generate revenue, how that revenue will flow into bottom-line, both
through the additional revenue growth achieved as well as through enhancements in terms of the margin.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: So that's very helpful. And in terms of the clear line of sight, can you give us a sense of this $3
billion? Is it half re-invested, half to the bottom line? Is it 60/40? Can you give us a better sense of the split of
reinvestment versus bringing it back to the bottom-line?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, I think we're not ready to share that detail with you right now. However, I think as
we go along, we'll give you more insights. But certainly, it will not all be invested and it will not all flow into the
bottom-line, but I think we see a clear balance there as we go forward. And I think there's a different role for the –
obviously, there's a different role for the – of how you should think about the $1.5 billion that is coming out of the base
of total marketing and OpEx and also the $1.5 billion that is coming out of the COGS. And I think both of them have
slightly different roles into – how they will be played out.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Dara Mohsenian from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Good morning. Muhtar, I wanted to delve a bit more into the changes in price/mix versus
volume focus and the incentive plans. I'm assuming the enhanced pricing focus is more of a developed market
phenomenon, but maybe you can review for us how much of the change in focus going forward is in developed markets
versus emerging markets versus how you managed previously. And then in North America, has this enhanced pricing
focus already played out to some extent given you've already had compensation changes there? Or should we expect
North America to be part of that change in focus going forward also?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: No, I think the whole company is – you should think of the entire company as evolving
and changing. But as I said, Dara, I think the important thing is roles and responsibilities on a geographic basis with
complete clarity of roles. So if you take the markets like the more developed markets of Korea and Spain and Great
Britain and so forth, Japan, and United States, Canada, more focused on the balance of revenue, what will drive the
revenue slightly skewed in favor of price versus volume, what will happen in the developing markets more like Latin
America and some Eastern European markets and so forth, Turkey, that much more straight line, right in the middle
balance of how that revenue number is going to be generated, that revenue growth target is going to be generated. And
then you take the more lower per capita, more emerging markets that I mentioned, the Indonesias and the Indias and
Chinas of this world, and Southeast Asia, skewed more towards volume. But that doesn't mean that there's not a pricing
metric and that doesn't mean there's no incentives based on revenue. It's just how they're skewed.

<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Okay. That's helpful. And then while we're on the subject of pricing, can you characterize
the pricing environment right now in North America? Obviously, the 3% sparkling number in the quarter was more
favorable than you've seen recently. So I wanted to get an update there on how sustainable that performance could be
going forward.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, I'll ask Sandy to comment on that North America number. Sandy and Irial are here,
and I'll ask Sandy to first comment on that.
<A - J. Alexander M. Douglas>: Yeah, Dara. Our view of the pricing strategy in the U.S. is being very consistent with
what we said at the beginning of the year, very focused on making sure that we get our price, that we balance that with
a package strategy that's focused on our premium packs and our smaller packs which consumers want and continue to
grow double digit. And we're pleased. As you can see in the Nielsen data and the marketplace, the consumer's
responding with accelerating sales growth, actual volume was slightly better than we expected, and clearly the volume
on the premium packs that are the focus of our brand building agenda and supported by our advertising are driving the
train. So we're just at the beginning though. I think North America's ability to play a primary revenue growth role in the
company with this disciplined balance strategy is in the early stages, and we see a rational environment and we see a
good competitive environment in which the category sales performance is accelerating and we're optimistic about the
future.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Irial, do you want to add to that?
<A - Irial Finan>: Yeah, I'd just remind all of us in the first quarter, we've said we were going to have a very
disciplined approach to pricing in North America. And the last three quarters, we've demonstrated that and the intention
is to keep doing it. And we feel good about it, we feel we're going in the right direction and feel very confident as we
actually head into the future on pricing in North America.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yes. And maybe I'll ask Ahmet to also comment on the same subject as it pertains to
Europe and as it pertains to Latin America and some other markets.
<A - Ahmet C. Bozer>: Thanks, Muhtar. As we talk about the revenue focus, we are also focusing on balanced
revenue growth in Coke International. Maybe a couple of examples I can share is in Mexico, for example, where you
see 2% growth in volumes for the quarter and more or less flat volumes, we're actually seeing fairly healthy price/mix
of about low to mid-single digits and our revenue growth reflects that as well. Likewise in Brazil. We're also seeing
mid-single digit revenue growth even though our volumes are up only 1%. So we are quite cognizant of balancing our
revenue growth with appropriate pricing realization and volume at the same time.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: And do you want to say anything about Europe?
<A - Ahmet C. Bozer>: And in Europe, obviously, we are not pleased with our volume performance of negative 5%,
but the challenging macros are bringing with it a fairly aggressive pricing environment in the marketplace and we are
always trying to balance our pricing with volume. And in this quarter, I would say that we were a lot more in favor of
pricing where we have realized three points of price/mix in Europe, which resulted in a revenue decline of 2% while
our volumes were 5%. Having said that, this is a journey and an ongoing balancing act. We would be focusing on
balancing that a little bit better so that our share performance continues to be strong, which it has been for the last four
years, and we are on that journey in Europe.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Great. Thanks.

<A - Kathy N. Waller>: Good morning.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Hey. Can you guys just comment on how much you know relative to the environment that's –
what's secular and what's cyclical? And then how your strategy changes if it's more secular than cyclical in terms of
some the consumption trends? And then maybe, obviously, Muhtar, you have considerable experience here, has there
been a period where you've seen things as difficult as they are now and kind of what it took to pull yourselves out of it?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, I think, Bill, firstly, it's fair to say that we are in a challenged disposable income
growth environment. That's no question. The consumer is challenged everywhere around the world. It's not just related
to the western developed markets of Europe and Japan and the United States and Canada, but it's also related to
emerging markets. There's a lot of volatility in the world when you look at in the currencies, when you look at interest
rates, when you look at the growth rates and when you actually factor in all the different geopolitical issues around the
world. There just is a lot of apprehension. Less people traveling because of disease, because of scares, because of other
things. Mobility is down and traffic is down and that all impacts particularly our immediate consumption business, and
so we've got to find newer, better ways to ensure that we can meet – our products, our brands, our 3,000 products, 550
brands can meet up with consumers on different occasions, on better occasions, on newer occasions and on more
innovative ways to get our products in front of our consumers.
And certainly, we recognize that that is a challenging environment and we operate in that environment, but we have
still one of the most dynamic consumer goods businesses in the world and we believe it can still over time grow at the
rates that we have just outlined to you in terms of revenue growth. Is that going to happen overnight? No. Can we get
there? Absolutely, yes. Then, we have other elements to deal with in terms of trends and so we recognize that we have
to do more works on Diets and Lights, for example. We continue to innovate. We continue to launch new products
which have different sweeteners and different sweetener bases. That will continue in an expanded mode, more
innovation, more packaging, newer ways for consumers to connect.
Next year is the 100th year of The Contour and we certainly will be expanding our IC focus – immediate consumption
focus in the market, which is a really important way to build habit and build trends and build teen incidence and then
improve our marketing and improve our commercial strategies with our bottlers, which we keep working at. And so
that's where we are. It is a very challenging environment. Anywhere you go around the world, it's not different.
Everyone is apprehensive, whether it's governments, whether it's NGOs, whether it's businesses, local businesses and
international businesses. And I don't see that improving overnight. But I think it's a new normal in that new normal, we
need to generate better growth.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Great. Thanks. And then, Kathy, just one quick one. The share repurchase went from sort of a
range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion. Now it's at the lower end of the range. Is there any read-through on that why you
guys took it down? I know it's not hugely substantial.
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: No, no specific read-through. I would just say that given where we are right now, we – this is
the guidance we thought we should provide at this time.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Okay. But is cash flow coming in softer? Because I'm just trying to figure out why it would
come down if there's no change in the cash flow algorithm?
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: We did give a different outlook on currency, which does impact cash.

talked about earlier. What's the scope of that program? What are the milestones that we should be looking for? And
how does it tie in with your commitment to refranchise the bulk of your territories by 2017?
<A - Irial Finan>: Yeah, it's Irial. On the supply chain in North America, I mean, basically this is a continuation of
what started a few years ago and it's made up of many different aspects which we'll share in due course, as Kathy has
already said and Muhtar. But the key is that we're looking at becoming more effective and more efficient. We have a
very substantial supply chain footprint and we believe and have the plans to make sure we become truly efficient and
that means by streamlining in many different ways. And simple illustrations are things like bottle light-weighting which
is pretty well carried out across the world today whether it's mechanizing at different parts of our supply chain whether
it's our footprint as supply chain and so forth. So many different aspects but very clear plans behind it and a high degree
of confidence that we will achieve the synergies that we've set out.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: And on that once again I wanted to reiterate the point that I made earlier, this is Muhtar,
that of the $2 billion by 2017 and the $3 billion by 2019, the incremental synergy program, that is not going down as
we substantially refranchise our business in North America.
<Q - Michael Steib>: Okay.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Any further questions?
Operator
[indiscernible] (44:40) next question is from Judy Hong from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Thank you. Good morning. I guess, first question is just relating to really the new operating
model that you're planning to implement that I'm just hoping to get a little bit more clarity around exactly what you're
doing to change the operating model both more at the business unit level and maybe even at the country level and is
this something that gets rolled out globally or does this have a phasing of kind of how it gets rolled out? And I know
that you really have been emphasizing patience and just taking time to implement these changes, but just wanted to get
a little bit better sense of what takes longer, what can be implemented more quickly, and where can we see the benefits
of some of the changes more quickly?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, Judy, this is Muhtar. Good morning. Yes, we are streamlining and simplifying our
operating model for better speed, better decision-making and enhanced also local market focus that will help driving
better growth, help us to drive better growth. And so this work is moving forward aggressively. It's global, involves the
center and involves the entire company. And we expect to refocus the role for our corporate center and further scale our
back-office to support our processes and also policies on a global basis to get more synergies there and better service to
our business unit that operate around the world that basically make up The Coca-Cola Company and this will enable
those operations to fully focus intently on demand creation in their market.
So this is really important. It's a de-layered organization. It is a simplified organization. It's less touch points. It's faster
decision-making and that will take place starting with the beginning of the year and more will – you will hear more
about that in the coming weeks so that's important. I think it's important to, if I take just back a minute and just to say
again, this is certainly a difficult operating environment and that is clear, no question about that. But today, we're
announcing, I believe, definitive actions as a team to address that environment and improve our execution. The $3
billion in synergy enhancements are an added layer and an added layer of segmented analysis on top of the $3 billion
and metrics on a market-by-market basis. It's clear evidence, I think, of us taking action to control in a way what we
can control.
And this is – I'm so pleased that we have a team that has basically worked together for a long time and we know what it
takes to win. Today, we are taking essentially additional steps to get us back on track over the longer-term and we will
do whatever we have to do to get there, to get us across to that bridge. We know it can be done and we know we will do
it. And I think the synergy program will help, the new operating model will help, the enhanced execution will help, the
better marketing will help and the improved commercial strategy will help along those lines. Is the operating

environment tough? It is tough but we are fortunate to be in a business that is one of the most dynamic businesses in the
world, the non-alcoholic ready-to-drink business and so that's what I would leave you with.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. And then if I could just follow up maybe, Ahmet, just the two markets where obviously
the volume was very challenged were Europe and China, which presumably had both the weather impact as well as the
macro impact. So if you can give us a little bit of color just in terms of how much you think the weather did play a role,
and then it sounded like in the fourth quarter you really are not anticipating much improvement globally from a volume
perspective. Is the weakness expected in these two markets primarily or are other markets that you think could
potentially be weaker or more volatile as you get into the fourth quarter?
<A - Ahmet C. Bozer>: Thanks, Judy. And you know we don't like to talk about weather too much in this, but I would
say there was probably not so favorable weather. You mentioned the macros. Let me start with China. You could see
from the numbers in China that total food and beverage industry, NARTD industry is actually under pressure and the
growth rates are coming down. But I'm very pleased with our performance in China because now, we see a lot of
traction on sparkling beverages, which actually grew in the quarter, trademark Coke was up 4% in China which shows
that the strategy that we have shared with you all beginning of the middle of last year of segmented focus of our
beverages in China is actually working. We're very pleased with our new [ph] launches (50:08) of the isotonics, that's
doing very well. Very pleased with our innovations in sparkling with things like Schweppes +C. So for China, I am
very pleased with the results and we're gaining share and our initiatives are working for us.
When it comes to Europe, I have shared with you all a little earlier, it is more a matter of balancing our price realization
and volume a little bit more in the favor of volume and share still realizing good price/mix. I would say other than that,
Europe performance was mostly to do with the macros and you've mentioned weather, I will not.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Got it. Okay.
<A - Ahmet C. Bozer>: Thanks, Judy.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from John Faucher from J.P. Morgan.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Thank you. I guess a couple of questions here. One on sort of the change to the long-term
algorithm, and you talked about NARTD growth being more mid-single digits, I guess, going forward. Is that – going
back to Bill Schmitz's question, is that going down permanently from the 6% number that you guys had put out there
before or are you structurally calling for lower category growth?
And then the second question I had related to the restructuring program, I guess two questions on this. First, is it the
macros – is it the lower structural growth of the category that's causing you to up this just eight months after your last
program? And then a clarification on the numbers, which is part of the savings program announced in February related
to not necessarily productivity but more efficient spending, is there any of that that's built into this new $2 billion?
Thanks
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Hey, John, hi, this is Muhtar. I think when you look at the current revenue figure that we
have put out there, if you take the midpoint of that, it's only 50 basis points different than what was out there before
earlier. So I don't see that as a major difference in terms of the category, in terms of the cyclical long-term
macroeconomic. I think we see tremendous opportunity in this segment, in this consumer, very dynamic consumer
goods industry. So I see that that's not any major shift. We've been pleased with productivity in terms of what we've
done to date. Macros have not improved and so we have to do what we need to do in order to ensure that we can cross
the bridge and get to a better both top-line growth as well as bottom-line delivery of performance. And that's what you
see us doing right now. In the past, you would have cycles in macro, you would have two, three year – a year or two
years of down and then coming back up and now it's constant volatility and constant – actually increased volatility

every day around the world and increased apprehension by the consumers. So we have to do more. We have to ensure
that we create the flexibility to deliver our results and that's what you see us doing.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Got it. And I guess, can I just – and again, just a clarification on the sort of reallocation
versus sort of what we would view as incremental cost saves. Any color on that?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Kathy? You want to add anything in terms of the investment, in terms of the efficiency,
what John talked about?
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: Sure, Muhtar. So first of all, going back to the first question around the net revenue, the two
things that are primarily driving the change would be the value growth that we see come from the emerging markets as
well as the more volatile nature of the emerging markets, and then a recognition that our partnership models will drive
value for the business that will impact equity income. So I just wanted to add that particular point. And then on the
productivity [indiscernible] (54:40) sorry, I don't remember the productivity question. What was the question...
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Yes, what I was asking is if I remember correctly, the February productivity program...
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: Right.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: ...included some true productivity and then some sort of reallocation of spending to more
efficient methods.
<A - Kathy N. Waller>: Yes.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: I'm asking is there any of that also built into the incremental $2 billion from today?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yes. There actually is, John. In terms of the way – what we have done in the past is we've
said that productivity, the original $1 billion is made up of both OpEx as well as reallocation of marketing to ensure
that marketing is more effective and more efficient in terms of its delivery of results. And so that is an ongoing program
that we have in terms of how we will continue to reallocate marketing to drive better value and better return. That is
there. That is ongoing. However, of course, the scale of what we're doing in terms of OpEx flexibility is going to be
much, much bigger here, but the vast majority of the additional savings program is hard savings in productivity. The
vast majority is hard savings as opposed to reallocation. We will ensure that the amount of money that's invested has a
return. That's a different answer. But we will make – it is actually, I'd say, the majority, vast majority, in fact, is hard
savings.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Swartzberg from Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - Mark D. Swartzberg>: Thanks. Good morning. Also on the subject of media and marketing spend, when all is
said and done, Kathy or Muhtar, for calendar 2014, you mentioned a double-digit increase in media in the quarter, but
when we look at the total marketing spend, how much do you think that will that be up when all is said and done for
2014? And then when we think about the comparatively lackluster 2015, you're talking about how much of that is
attributable to the rate of increase in marketing spend you're intending next year?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: When all's said and done, I'd say probably, Mark, it will be about mid-single digits in
2014, and I think we'll give you – again, in December, we'll come back and give you more flavor about how we're
thinking of that in 2015 and beyond.
<Q - Mark D. Swartzberg>: Is there anything – is it reasonable to assume it goes up at a faster rate in 2015 given the
top-line challenges?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: I wouldn't assume that.

<Q - Mark D. Swartzberg>: Okay. And just one point of clarification, back on John's question about the $3 billion,
you mentioned, Muhtar, the vast majority being OpEx. Are you talking 80%, 70%, 90%? Can you give us some sense
of that number?
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Look, I said the vast majority is hard savings in productivity programs. And that is
composed – as I mentioned earlier in answering another question, that is composed of a base of about $9.5 billion or
$10 billion comprised of marketing and OpEx and then another base which is driving about $1.5 billion by 2019 and
the other half $1.5 billion by 2019 is driven by COGS savings. But these are hard savings, not in terms of just soft or
reallocations.

Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Powers from UBS.
<Q - Steve R. Powers>: Great. Thanks. Two questions, if I could. I guess, first, despite I guess some disappointment in
some quarters, from a strategic standpoint, this does seem like a fairly substantial change from where you were in July,
strategically. Can you talk about the process that you went through internally to get here? Do you view these changes
more reactive or proactive? And to the extent that much of the work has really been accelerated since mid-summer,
how confident are you that this is the right program? Why is $2 billion, for example, the right number and not $3
billion or some other figure? That's really kind of the first question.
And then secondly, as you seem closer to a defined timeline for refranchisement in North America, can you help us
[ph] dimension (59:36) the financial terms and the economics of that activity just in broad brush strokes acknowledging
you'll probably cover more of this in December, but do you anticipate re-franchising to result in an economic loss or
gain versus your 2010 investments? And how much dilution should we expect as we go forward through the program,
again, just in broad brush strokes? Thanks.
<A - Ahmet Muhtar Kent>: Yeah, this is Muhtar. First, I think based on the collective judgment of myself and my
team, as I said to you, this is an acknowledgment of a continuing difficult operating environment and controlling and
taking action to control what we can control. That will mean two things: create flexibility through the synergies and
also ensure that we can enhance our margins and build a credible and sustainable revenue growth on the top-line. That
is the key here, which [ph] in this industry lends (1:00:42) us to believe, and clearly, the history has shown that this
industry is the most dynamic and it continues to be and therefore, we believe that when we segment our markets in the
way we have segmented them, continue to ensure that we have the right metrics in place and the right incentives in
place that we will perform better.
And we're almost finished with this year and we're going to be embarking upon implementing this now so that we can
start the year running, and we will give you a very clear dashboard in December where you can, with three or four
things to follow, you can judge our progress, judge our progress as to how we're implementing and generating the
results out of this program. That, to me, I think is going to be key, following our progress and we will follow it and you
will be able to follow it. We'll give you that dashboard so that you can ensure that every quarter we can have a
discussion on the key four or five elements of success on how we implement, how we implement the new operating
model, how we implement better marketing, how we implement better commercial strategies, and how that's impacting
the top-line and what impact that's having on margins.
As far as the North America franchising, I'll ask Sandy to comment on that. But, again, it's a clear timeline, first by
2017 and then what we will have left is about one-third and then what we do with the rest is latest by 2020, again,
finding the right home. Sandy?
<A - J. Alexander M. Douglas>: Yeah, sure. Steve, on North America re-franchising, I go back to the objectives of
the effort, which is to restructure a system that have been in place for over 100 years to get it in better position for
growth with better focused customer management, more efficient product supply and back services and to re-franchise

to the best Coca-Cola bottlers in the United States under a new franchise agreement that is fit-for-purpose for growth.
And we are very optimistic about our ability to deliver that kind of growth profile, and to do that in a way that makes
our business more economic and makes our system more economic going forward. So as we point to the December
discussion that Kathy's going to lead, we'll have a number of the details that'll help you model this going forward, but
our strategic mission has not changed and our optimism for success in doing this with our bottlers is as high as ever.
Ahmet Muhtar Kent
Good. So thank you, Kathy, Ahmet, Sandy, Irial and Tim.
Despite gaining global value share, our year-to-date performance is not where it needs to be. The scope and pace of our
actions have to increase and we're moving very quickly to streamline our operations and further align our incentives to
drive revenue growth while simultaneously driving costs out of our business through an aggressive plan. While the
short-term macroeconomic environment remains challenging, we are confident in our ability to return to sustainable
growth as the long-term dynamics of our industry remain promising, our brands and our global system are unparalleled
and we are all fully dedicated to strengthening our position as the world's leading beverage company.
As always, we thank you for your interest, your investment in our company and for joining us this morning.
Operator
