MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the fourth quarter and full year 2012 NYSE Euronext earnings
conference call. My name is Shaquana and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a
listen-only mode. We will be facilitating a question-and-answer session towards the end of this conference.
For the Q&A session, we ask that callers limit their questions to one to allow for broader participation. [Operator

I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Stephen Davidson, Head of Investor relations at NYSE Euronext. Please
proceed, sir.
Stephen C. Davidson

We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures during this call. These non-GAAP measures are fully reconciled in the
tables attached to the text of the earnings press release that we issued earlier today. We believe that these tables provide
investors useful information about our business trends. However, our non-GAAP measures do not replace and are not
superior to GAAP measures.
Duncan Niederauer, Chief Executive Officer, will review the highlights for the quarter, update you on key business
developments in our businesses and conclude with an update on the acquisition by ICE. Michael Geltzeiler, Chief
Financial Officer, will then review the financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2012. We will then open the
line for your questions. Also in the room for the Q&A session is Larry Leibowitz, Chief Operating Officer.
We are incorporating slides for the call today, which are available for viewing on our website, and Duncan and Mike
will refer to the slides during their remarks.
With that, let me turn the call over to Duncan.
Duncan L. Niederauer
Great. Thanks, Stephen. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining today's call. I'm going to be starting on slide
4 in the deck that we distributed to everybody online.
What we're really going to talk about today is the progress we made in the fourth quarter to conclude 2012, which we
really view as a table-setting year for driving improved operating results in 2013.
To start where I know everybody wants us to start, our announced transaction with ICE presents the opportunity to
create a worldwide leader in trading markets and risk management, focused on the high-growth derivatives markets
with world-class clearing capabilities supporting it, alongside the world's premier listing venue.
I'll provide you with an update on the combination in a later slide, but I can tell you now we're very pleased with the
progress we've made so far. We filed our joint proxy statement and U.S. antitrust filings in late January. We hope to
hold shareholder meetings in the early spring, and integration planning and the regulatory processes have begun.
I thought I'd start first with the macro economy, and while challenging conditions remain, we're seeing many
encouraging signs. The U.S. markets are performing well and the U.S. economy is poised for growth in 2013. Capital
flows into U.S. mutual funds are at their highest level in quite some time, and while one month doesn't make a trend,
we're hopeful that this is an indicator of the reemergence of the retail investor and a resurgence of interest in the U.S.
equity markets. Corporate profits are strong, balance sheets are healthy and unemployment is slowly improving.
Europe, the worst of our fears about a messy breakup of the euro have begun to subside. And lastly, the health of
European financial institutions has improved as many banks have quickened the pace of repayments from the ECB's
three-year tender.
So in our mind, all of these are positive indicators for our business as well. Trading volumes in our interest rate
complex in Europe for January were up around 40% year-over-year. Consolidated average daily volume in U.S.
equities and options markets are showing slight signs of improvement, and our listings franchise is poised to capitalize
on the improved market tenor and lower volatility.
As financial institutions continue to focus on getting stronger, we also believe that our Technology Services business is
well-positioned to partner with banks and brokers to develop the next-generation of technology solutions to help them
run their businesses more efficiently.
Now turning to the quarter, we reported $0.43 on $562 million in revenue compared to $0.50 on $628 million in
revenue in the prior year's fourth quarter. The lackluster trading environment continued to impact our results, but the
recent trends I just discussed give us reasons to be encouraged for 2013.

Please turn to slide 5. Slide 5 illustrates the strong progress we've made in executing against our strategy. We focused
on growth, efficiency, and capital deployment.
Let's start with the growth side of the ledger. We have several new product development and growth initiatives
underway that should benefit the company well into the future. First, our listings' franchise continues to build
momentum especially in terms of market share of technology listings and we were the global leader in IPOs for the
second consecutive year.
We signed several technology agreements during the quarter which improved our Technology Services revenue line,
and we are optimistic about opportunities for the business in 2013.
We've revamped our global data agreements which will result in incremental revenue this year and into the next year,
and we are continuing to launch new derivatives products and establish new partnerships to fuel our future growth.
More detail on all of these initiatives will follow later in our remarks.
On the efficiency front, we continued to share cost discipline as illustrated by our results. Our clearing agreement with
ICE Clear will position our European derivatives business for growth and will accelerate cost savings and reduce
investment costs in 2013.
January, we signed a new clearing agreement with LCH for our Euronext cash business which will reduce clearing cost
for our clients by approximately 20%. This agreement will run through 2016.
As we indicated on our prior earnings call, we completed the unwind of BlueNext, and we will continue to look at
opportunities to prune our business portfolio. You'll hear more from Mike on the cost efficiency component of Project
14 later in our presentation.
Lastly, on the capital front, we are continuing to look at opportunities to rationalize stakes in businesses that do not
support our strategic objectives. We will be looking to divest some or all of our LCH Clearnet and MCX stakes in the
first half of 2013.
Please turn to slide 6 for me. Slide 6 provides an update of our derivatives markets in both the U.S. and EU. In early
2012, we organized this business and the sales teams that support it to foster innovation and product development. The
focus was to bring new products to market faster and to grow penetration and the diversity of our product line. Since
the reorganization, we have seen a meaningful jump in new product innovation.
Starting on the left-hand side of the slide, in the fourth quarter of 2012, we launched four-year mid-curve options on
EURIBOR and short sterling futures. This following the successful introduction of the EURIBOR three-year mid-curve
options contracts which is currently one of the fastest-growing STIR options products ever.
Continued growth in ADV and open interest in these products, and the launch of the four-year mid-curve options
continues our goal of expanding our product set out along the yield curve.
As we indicated earlier, we've also seen a dramatic increase in fixed income derivatives volumes to start in 2013,
specifically in EURIBOR futures which set an all-time high in ADV on January 25 with 3.2 million contracts traded.
For the month of January, ADV averaged 1.4 million contracts in EURIBOR, representing a 116% increase during
January of 2012. Again the high volumes were spurred by the news of European banks making larger-than-expected
and earlier-than-anticipated repayments of emergency loans from the ECB.
Turning to the right side of the slide, the chart shows ADV growth in the MSCI index futures traded on MSCI Liffe
U.S. With the gains we showed on ADV in 2012, the MSCI index futures contracts have made substantial progress
since open interest migrated to NYSE Liffe U.S. in the middle of 2011. The month of December last year was
particularly notable with open interest hitting an all-time high of 268,000 contracts, and December open interest more
than doubled versus the prior year. So good progress on the products front in derivatives as we strengthen that business
to build momentum into the envisioned combination with ICE.

Please turn to slide 7. Slide 7 provides an update of our equity derivatives – our equity and equity derivatives business
is in the U.S. and EU. Let's start with U.S. options. Although operating in a difficult macro environment combined with
low volatility and uncertainty over domestic policy, which resulted in a decrease of 12% in overall options
year-over-year, Q4 volumes were up versus Q3, and this positive trend has carried into early 2013. January brought a
new record combined market share for our options platform of just under 30%, so with the first month in the new year
behind us, we continue to be confident in the growth of our U.S. options franchise.
Despite the macro challenges, the business had a strong year in 2012. We maintained our position as either the number
one or number two options exchange group based on market share, with an ADV of 3.9 million contracts. In the fourth
quarter, we also continued to innovate by announcing the successful expansion of the short-term options program. In
November, NYSE Amex and NYSE Arca options led the industry as the first exchanges to file for and receive SEC
approval to expand the listing and trading of short term options on single stocks and ETFs from a single week to five
consecutive weekly expirations.
While I'm on this slide, let me spend a few minutes on the U.S. cash business as well. Although trading volumes were
at multi-year lows and TRF market share move higher throughout 2012, the cash business was at least stable in the
fourth quarter. So we focused on those levers which we can control.
In an effort to streamline and integrate our trading systems across all of our equities and derivatives markets, the
Universal Trading Platform project for NYSE and NYSE market officially began rolling out on September 24, 2012.
The UTP migration will bring U.S. cash clients lower latencies, higher throughput and increased functionality.
To date we have migrated over half of our symbols, and the latency numbers for acknowledgments have declined by
more than 50% for the stocks that have been migrated. We expect NYSE and NYSE market to be fully migrated to
UTP by the end of this month. The RLP initiative is also beginning to make headway with the expansion of participants
and ADV growth since the initiation of the program.
Lastly a little bit on our equity derivatives business in the EU. Again despite difficult market conditions in 2012 NYSE
Liffe was the number one equity futures exchange worldwide last year with ADV of just under 1 million contracts a
day. The MSCI sector indices experienced strong growth in volumes, and in December, we announced a new
partnership with Turkey to develop new futures option contracts on the IMKB 30 Index.
We continued to extend our geographical coverage with the successful launch of a partnership with the Egyptian
Exchange announced just a couple of weeks ago. The signed agreement also enables NYSE Liffe to develop and launch
of futures contracts based on the EGX 30.
Please turn to slide 8.
Slide 8 provides you with an overview of the target operating model for the new clearing agreement with ICE Clear. As
we mentioned in the announcement deal, independent of the acquisition by ICE, we negotiated and signed a multi-year
agreement to move our Liffe derivatives clearing to ICE Clear.
ICE Clear is a leading global clearing solution with U.S. and UK regulatory status, and is the only CCP with previous
experience in handling a transition from LCH Clearnet. Greater than 90% of the positions and exposure of clearing
members in NYSE Liffe have crossed over with ICE Clear, which should considerably simplify and decrease the level
of effort, and complexity, and cost needed on the member's side for the transition. The smooth conversion for the
majority of our members will allow us to focus on Liffe Clear members not currently connected to ICE Clear.
The cost of transitioning Liffe derivatives to ICE Clear is significantly less than what we expected to spend on our own
clearing initiative because we are leveraging ICE's existing infrastructure, and these costs will be shared by NYSE
Euronext and ICE.
This solution not only provides us with revenue and strategic benefits of a fully insourced clearing model in timely and
less costly manner, but it also drives product innovation for our business in the short term. In the long run, it creates an
efficient clearing model poised for growth as the interest rate market recovers.

Please turn to slide 9.
Slide 9 shows the continued momentum in our listings business which is a real bright spot for us in an otherwise
challenging 2012. As I mentioned earlier, NYSE Euronext was the global leader in IPO proceeds for the second
consecutive year, raising $37 billion in total global proceeds from 120 IPOs, and $167 billion in proceeds from 441
follow-on offerings in 2012.
Globally the U.S. was the leader in IPO activity. Asia and Europe were relatively quiet in 2012. NYSE Euronext led the
U.S. market with 79 IPOs, listing 17 of the top 20 deals by total proceeds raised, and we also captured the majority of
technology IPOs in the U.S., listing 53% of all tech IPOs.
Comparing 2012 to 2011's private equity-backed year, I think you would call 2012's IPO market one that was really
driven more by venture capital-backed deals. Forbes also put out an article on the top 20 tech IPOs in 2012 and we're
proud to say that 16 of those 20 listed with us.
NYSE Euronext was also the leader in transfers with 17 companies transferring to the NYSE in 2012, 15 to the NYSE
and two to NYSE market, with only six companies moving in the other direction from the NYSE and three from NYSE
market.
It was quite a good year for us on the transfer front. Of the 15 companies that transferred to the NYSE, three were
among the top 100 largest companies by market cap listed on our competitor.
So far in 2013, we are continuing to gain market share with respect to new listings, building on last year's global
leadership position.
Looking forward, we expect to attract several international deals from Latin America and Europe this year. And given
that 2013 is poised to show the return of the larger private equity-backed IPOs and carve-outs, we aspire to continue
attracting these quality issuers to our markets, and maintaining our positioning as the global venue of choice for capital
formation.
Please turn to slide 10 for me.
On slide 10, we are refocusing our Technologies business around three centers of excellence with the safety network as
the common foundation. We intended to have Jon Robson walk through a more detailed description of his vision for
this business but given the focus on the acquisition by ICE, we'll save that for another time, perhaps the next quarterly
earnings call.
The underlying thesis for our business is that large financial services companies are trying to reduce infrastructure
spend, but at the same time are being buffeted with request for greater support from their business leaders. So we are
positioning our business to capture this opportunity by being their partner.
We are reorganizing our product-focused portfolio into more of a solutions-focused business converging around three
centers of excellence. One, an independently managed services capital markets infrastructure business for the financial
community. Two, an integrated cloud base set of rich content and applications available to scale. And three, an open
platform for liquidity innovation providing tools and access to markets and counterparties.
This is the value proposition we are going to market with, and the feedback we have received from client thus far is
very encouraging. Remember that this opportunity is in addition to the aforementioned market data initiatives which we
expect will drive top and bottom line growth for the business beginning in the second quarter of this year.
And finally, to conclude my section, please turn to slide 11.
This is an update on our combination with ICE. This is a landmark deal that brings together two leading exchanges that
are highly complementary, with the goal of creating a leading exchange player in derivatives worldwide adjacent to the
premier listing venue.

This deal gives our shareholders a substantial premium with a significant cash component. We feel good about the
synergies announced with the deal. We are not including any revenue synergies in our projections, but we certainly see
further upside for investors from revenue synergies we hope to extract from cross selling our respective services and
the potential IPO of Euronext.
As we discussed on announcement day, any IPO of Euronext would occur as soon after the closing as practical. But as
you would expect, our focus right now is on the approval process for the merger.
In terms of process, we filed the U.S. Antitrust filings in January and our proxy statement with the statement with the
SEC in late January. We are aiming to hold our respective shareholder meetings this spring. We are also working with
U.S. and European regulators to move the process forward. And given what we are seeing and hearing so far, we are
cautiously optimistic regarding a closing in the latter half of 2013.
With that, let me turn the call over to Mike for a discussion of our financial results.
Michael S. Geltzeiler
Thanks, Duncan, and good morning.
Slide 12 provides comparative GAAP results for the fourth quarter 2012. Our GAAP EPS of $0.12 per share included a
high level of merger and exit costs this quarter, reflecting an investment write-off and wind down of our clearing
operations in connection with our move to ICE Clear, the closure of BlueNext, and merger-related expenses from our
combination with ICE.
Although the move to ICE Clear necessitated a Q4 write-off of prior investments, the effort will result in a sizeable
cash investment saving in 2013 from the discontinuation of Project Gemini, and will generate annualized P&L savings
beginning in the second half of 2013 that exceed the $25 million to $30 million we were expecting previously.
Our Q4 results also included a non-operating charge of $24 million to retire a portion of our U.S. dollar and
euro-denominated debt. The refinancing of this debt will generate significant interest expense savings over time.
My review of our financial results from this point forward will exclude the impact of merger expenses and exit costs,
the debt refinancing charge, and discrete tax items.
Slide 13 provides a more detailed look at our financial results for the quarter. While volumes, particularly in our
derivative businesses, began to improve in December, our financial results in the fourth quarter and full year 2012 were
impacted by the lackluster trading environment, with volatility hitting multi-year lows.
Net revenues on a reported basis were down 11% year-over-year and were 13% lower for the full year 2012.
On a currency adjusted basis, 2012 revenues were lower by 11%. Transaction or volume-based revenues declined 21%
for Q4 year-over-year, and 25% for the full year, which was somewhat offset by the acquisition of Corpedia, slightly
higher listing revenues, and some higher non-volume based revenues such as court and regulatory fees.
Costs were lower by $24 million, or 6%, for the quarter, and were 6% lower for the full year on a constant dollar,
constant portfolio basis. For the fourth quarter, 35% of our operating expenses were denominated in either euros or
pounds, 64% in U.S. dollars and 1% in other currencies. Diluted share count was reduced by 18 million shares to 244
million shares for Q4 versus prior year.
Slide 14 provides our consolidated and segment results on a currency neutral basis. The U.S. dollar strengthened versus
the euro this quarter versus prior year by 4%, but weakened versus the British pound by 2%.
For the fourth quarter, 42% of our net revenues were denominated in either euros or pounds. Currency impact on net
revenues for the quarter was negative $4 million versus prior year, and operating income an unfavorable $3 million. On
a currency-neutral basis, fourth quarter net revenues were down 10% and operating income decreased 18% versus the
fourth quarter of 2011.

Operationally, revenues for our derivatives and cash trading and listings businesses decreased 15% and 9%
respectively, attributed entirely to a 21% reduction in net trading revenues. Cash revenue decline was partially offset by
higher revenues in listings and corporate services.
Commercial technology revenues were down 4% in constant dollars, and grew $7 million sequentially versus the third
quarter.
Slide 15 and 16 detail the financial performance for our derivative segment. Derivatives revenue in the fourth quarter of
$160 million was lower by 14% year-over-year, and down 2% sequentially, mostly attributable to lower trading
volumes. Expenses on a reported basis were essentially flat, but were lower when you adjust for the investments we
made in our UK clearing initiative prior to our agreement with ICE Clear.
Derivatives accounted for 28% of our consolidated net revenues, and 32% of our operating income. Revenue capture
for NYSE Liffe was lower year-over-year but improved quarter-over-quarter. The decline year-over-year was primarily
due to modified pricing in Q4 2011 for the trading of individual equity options and index futures in Amsterdam and
Belgium.
Capture for the U.S. options business was relatively stable quarter-over-quarter, but declined year-over-year principally
due to pricing pressures on NYSE Arca from other [ph] post-state (25:15) venues. Overall, the volume story for
derivatives has begun to show improvement beyond what is reflected in the Q4 results. Liffe volumes including Bclear
were higher in Q4 than Q3 while CONNECT volumes fell 8%. However, Liffe volumes were stronger in December,
and as Duncan mentioned, January 2013 volumes were significantly higher, including some record days in fixed
income trading. U.S. option volumes fell 7% versus Q4 2011, but it increased 13% versus last quarter, and for January
2013 are up over 10% from Q4 ADV.
Similarly, slide 17 and 18 show the financial performance for our cash trading and listings segment. Cash trading and
listings accounted for 50% of our consolidated net revenues, and 51% of our operating income in the quarter. Cash
trading and listings net revenue was $282 million in the fourth quarter of 2012, down 10% versus the prior-year period,
and flat compared to the third quarter of 2012.
European cash market share across our four primary markets, which excludes off-exchange trading volume, was 66%
in the fourth quarter, in line with the prior year but down from 68% in the third quarter.
In U.S. cash equities, our market share across all tapes remain stable sequentially, but is down 250 basis points
year-over-year. Non-exchanged traded share or TRF share remains elevated at 34% of the U.S. equities market, up
from 30% in the prior year. Revenue capture for the U.S. cash remained stable around $0.04 per hundred shares
handled.
Revenue capture for the European cash on a per -transaction basis also remained stable at $0.58 for the fourth quarter
when compared to the fourth quarter of 2011, but did increase from $0.54 in the third quarter of 2012. The increase
compared to the third quarter was driven by lower activity from our SLPs, more activity during the option period, and
clients not hitting [ph] peers (27:33).
Slide 19 details the financial performance for our Information Services and Technology Solutions segment. Information
Services and Technology Solutions accounted for 21% of our net revenues and 18% of our operating income in the
fourth quarter. Segment revenue was $120 million in the fourth quarter, a decrease of $7 million from Q4 prior year,
but increased $7 million sequentially. The sequential increase was driven by the Russell and ATG deals signed in the
quarter. Operating margins improved to 29% as expenses and investments are being managed well given the
challenging operating environment.
Our top-line growth in this segment, as Duncan discussed earlier, has been below our expectations due to the
constricted technology spending environment. We were gratified by the sequential increase in revenue and a return to
higher operating margin. With the new global market data agreements, we expect to see technology services revenue
growth to accelerate in the back half of 2013. These incremental revenues begin in Q2, and grow as the year
progresses.

Slide 12 – 20 provides you with the progress that we've made with our Project 14 cost efficiency program. In 2012, our
reported expenses of $1,581 million were $85 million below 2011 levels. Adjusting for foreign exchange changes and
incremental investments and acquisitions of $44 million, we have a core expense base in 2012 of $1,551 million, which
is $115 million below the 2011 expense base of $1,666 million. This is well favorable to the $63 million commitment
for 2012 we guided as part of our $250 million three-year expense reduction goal. Some of the incremental savings is
coming from lower variable compensation related to our lower financial performance.
We expect operating expenses to continue to trend lower for 2013. Despite the ICE transaction, we are continuing to
execute our P 14 efficiency plan. We are guiding 2013 reported expenses on rates similar to last year to approximate
$1,525 million, a decline of $55 million on 2012 reported expenses.
Adjusting for incremental investment spending year-over-year for things like a full-year effect from the Corpedia
acquisition, and one-time cost we'll spend in the IT area as part of the IT transformation plan, we expect core expenses
to be $86 million below 2012. This will position us to be approximately $200 million below our 2011 expense base
through year two of our efficiency program, again, considerably favorable to the original timing.
Slide 21 provides you with other guidance for 2013. With the agreement to move clearing to ICE Clear, we now expect
to achieve significant savings both in terms of operating expenses and investment cost, as previously mentioned. The
movement to ICE Clear will generate annualized savings north of the $25 million to $30 million targeted previously.
These savings will not begin until July 1, when our outsourcing contract ends with LCH.
Our debt refinancing saved us $1 million in interest expense this quarter, and we are anticipating annualized savings of
$15 million in 2013 with the retirement of the sub, and annualized savings of $24 million in 2014. These savings will
mostly be realized beginning June 2013 when we retire the $414 million of outstanding 4.8% U.S. bonds, primarily
with cash we will generate in the first half of 2013.
Turning to capital, we're still planning on selling part of our – or all of our MCX stake shortly after the lockup expires
in early March, as well as a portion of our LCH stakes. With minimal investment now requires for clearing, we are
guiding capital expenditures to return to more normal levels of $150 million. We discontinued our buyback plan early
in Q4 once our 10b5-1 expired as a result of the merger discussions. We do not anticipate any share repurchases prior
to the transaction closing.
With improved operating results, lower expenses, lower capital expenditures and no share repurchases, we expect to be
in a significant delevering mode in 2013. Gross debt will stay around $2.5 billion as cash balances build until we can
repay the $414 million of U.S. notes when they expire in June 2013.
For the year, we expect our leverage to be at or below two times by year-end 2013. Lastly, we expect 2013 tax rates to
be between 24% and 25%.
Slide 22 details our cash and debt position as of December 31, 2012. Gross debt at September 30 – I'm sorry, gross debt
at December 31 was $2.5 billion, including $0.4 billion remaining of the 4.8% June 2013 notes which we'll retire in the
second quarter of 2013. We also had about $400 million in cash. Our debt to EBITDA leverage ratio increased to 2.5
times, reflecting weak EBITDA generation and the share buyback.
Capital expenditures were $66 million in the quarter and $191 million year-to-date. We executed $28 million in stock
repurchases in the fourth quarter, retiring 1.1 million shares at an average price of $24.67. For the full year, we've
retired 17 million shares at an average price of $26.55.
Last week, the board declared a $0.30 quarterly cash dividend for the first quarter of 2013 which is payable on March
28.
Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Duncan for closing remarks.

Okay, thanks, Mike. And thanks, everybody for listening.
In closing, I think we all know last year was a pretty tough year for the industry, but 2000 – and for us, and 2013 is
certainly off to a much better start which leaves us very excited about the future. That future as a standalone company
and then hopefully as part of what we think will be a terrific new company.
I think, I hope, you took away from the call that we didn't stand still in 2012, and it was a tough environment. We used
that as an opportunity to continue to execute against our strategy and the pillars of growth, efficiency, and capital
deployment. And we think that, as Mike just outlined, puts us on a track to deliver some much better results in 2013.
We are particularly excited about the strong start that 2013 has gotten off to. As Mike said earlier, one month doesn't
make a year, but it's nice to be out of the gate with what feels like a little bit of a tailwind in some of the businesses and
in the equity market.
So we're obviously going to focus a lot on our core business in 2013, so that we can build momentum as we, on a
parallel path, work on the integration with ICE.
So we will stop there and we're happy to open the line – we're happy to open the line for your questions. Thanks a lot.

[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Howard Chen representing Credit Suisse. Please
proceed.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: Good morning.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Howard.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Duncan, you spoke about some of the dynamics driving the recent volume recovery in
Europe but just given the improvement in pipelines have been so dramatic, I wanted to follow up and get your view as
to whether you think that lift we're seeing is the beginning of a trend, or is there something in some of those features
that you mentioned that make kind of the current volume backdrop a bit more elevated than it should be?
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Yes, I mean that's – it's a little hard to tell on the latter part of that, Howard, but I think
what we thought was – look, we know it's been a pretty depressed down cycle for quite some time. You had very low
volatility. No one really with different views about where short-term rates were headed. So it was kind of a status quo
market where there wasn't a tremendous amount of interest.
But I think the biggest outside factor was what I mentioned on the call with the banks – with some of the banks in
Europe accelerating and increasing their payments on the – with – on the ECB loans. I think that was certainly viewed
very positively, and that seemed to bring clients back into the market.
The question is how likely are we to maintain this? Now, those of you who follow derivatives markets know that as
volume and open interest builds, that tends to be a fairly good leading indicator of business, for at least the next quarter
or two. So I think we're optimistic, but at the same time we're not yet convinced that there's going to be any follow
through. But to have January 2013 so much better than 2012, obviously it's been a nice turnaround.
Mike, do you have anything to add to that...?
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: And I think also the strengthening we're seeing in the euro, and the credibility, I think it's
returning a little bit more to being a benchmark rate, and I think more money is coming into the euro, so a combination
of the interest rates and sort of stabilization and a little bit of improvement in the euro is helping the business.

<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Understood. Thanks for taking a crack at it.
And my follow-up is relating to the non-core stakes that you could sell. Mike, you mentioned LCH and MCX, but other
than the lockup, can you detail what else needs to be done to complete those two disposals? And as you evaluate the
portfolio, does anything else fit in that bucket now? Thanks.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: An early violation of the one question rule. A follow-up on an entirely unrelated topic
is probably a second question, but...
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: I'm sorry, Duncan.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: That's all right. We realize – we're just happy a few people actually showed up on the
analyst call, so we're excited about that.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: I can keep going, but I'll...
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: So Mike, why don't you take a shot at that?
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: So as I mentioned, the MCX lockup expires early March and we are lined up to actually
sell that in a number of block trades in the open market. So pretty – really there's no restrictions on us other than maybe
the size of any one particular trade not exceeding 2%, so I think that's certainly within our control.
The lockup is not just for us, it's for some others in the marketplace as well, so we will just gauge the market
opportunity. At this time the business performing very well, the valuation on our 5% stake was most recently
somewhere in the mid-$60 million range. So we'll continue to monitor that situation, but that's totally within our control
to sell that market.
On the LCH side, it's all real tied to the LSE transaction, so we are – have indicated our interest to sell as much of our
stake as we can. And I think that process is a little bit out of our control at this stage.
In terms of what else we have, and we have a number of other minority stakes, those are the two that I would probably
tee up for this year. There could be – there are some smaller stakes that from time to time somebody approach us and
say they have some interest in, that there may not necessarily be a liquid market for today. So there could be some
upward surprise in that, but I would think for guidance purposes, I would stick with these two areas as being the
principal dispositions.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Thank you for taking the questions.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Yes.
Operator
And your next question comes from the line of Richard Repetto representing Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed.
<Q - Richard H. Repetto>: Yes. Good morning, guys.
So my question's on clearing. And Mike, you talked about the savings exceeding the $25 million to $30 million. I guess
on slide 20, you also outlined, I guess, the reduced investment spend. So I guess the question is what is the big – as you
look at clearing savings, and that was outlined in the original transaction as being a big component of ICE's $300
million, what comes into ICE's $300 million, what additional clearings savings is there beyond exceeding the $25
million to $30 million that you're getting by pulling out of LCH and then the incremental investment spend pullback?
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: I mean – just to clarify, so the $25 million to $30 million, or what we're saving by exiting
LCH and moving to ICE Clear is actually in the $150 million bucket related to P14, so it was not in the $150 million
tied to ICE's and NYSE's integration with Liffe and Clearing, so there is not a double count there.

The other opportunities are the savings we're discussing is specifically focused on the U.K. portion of moving Liffe
Clear to – from LCH to Liffe Clear. There's also the Continental piece, which we indicated would have not only
incremental revenue in the first quarter of 2014 when we bring that in, but that we were expecting to have probably
about 50% margins on that.
Clearly if that was to move into ICE Clear, they would – the margins would be considerably more than 50% because
we wouldn't – we would be able to leverage their existing infrastructure. So that's one area where there could be
incremental savings beyond our P14 savings.
I think the summary of it all is we are looking to spend $100 million to $125 million over two years on Clearing. We
spent about $65 million last year, $20 million in the P&L the rest you're seeing we wrote off in the first quarter. So the
savings from this transaction comes from not having to spend year two of the capital and P&L to build this thing. And
the annualized savings that we're getting just from the U.K. piece, will be above what we had – thought we could do if
we bought it in-house our self. The third part of it clearly will come from the Continental...
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Right, and so just to summarize that Rich, because we get asked about that a lot. So the
U.K. derivatives migration will happen at midyear. I think we've been pretty transparent on what the savings on that
were likely to be if we were doing it ourselves, and now what Mike just articulated was the increase in savings by
moving that into ICE Clear, and he can follow up with you guys one on one later, if you'd like.
The cash business, the second leg of it, the cash business is pretty straight forward, right?
We haven't – the savings that we're getting are being passed on to the clients. That's a long-term contract to stay with
Clearnet, and we think that will obviously be well received by the European regulators as they care mostly about the
equities market.
And you also know that we've announced before that the clearing of our European equity derivatives business was
scheduled to migrate to Liffe Clear at the beginning of 2014, it is our intention until further notice to move that
business to ICE Clear in Q1 of 2014, and what Mike's trying to articulate is the revenue capture will be similar but the
cost we would have to – the incremental cost that we would have to spend to handle that business if we were standing
alone is more than what ICE will have to invest, given that they already have the clearing infrastructure in place.
So more details to come on that when we start talking about the 2014 outlook for hopefully the new company.
<Q - Richard H. Repetto>: Yes. I guess my point, it just doesn't seem like that's a big percentage of the $300 million
that comes from ICE, from NYSE ICE combined.
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: It's not. It's almost – it's actually a very small percentage.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: We're agreeing with you.
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: We agree with you.
<Q - Richard H. Repetto>: Okay. Thank you very much. That helps, Duncan and Mike. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm representing UBS. Please proceed.
<Q - Alex Kramm>: Hey, good morning. Maybe if you could just very quickly stay on that Clearing discussion. Can
you just walk us through a little bit more what the steps are to get the initial summer transaction going with ICE Clear?
Like where are you in discussions with the broker dealers? Are there any risks that this could actually get delayed? I
think ICE's own transition a few years ago got delayed because of some events. So if there is a delay, are there risks
that you have to stay longer with LCH? Are there contingency plans? Maybe just talk us through a little bit more there.
Thank you.

<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Yes, sure. Thanks, Alex, it's Duncan. So first of all, we obviously have been in
communication with a lot of our customers on this, and I may be slightly off on these numbers, but we have just under
50 different clearing members that are members of Liffe now, and all but a handful of them are also members of ICE
Clear. So for them, there's actually less work to do than if we were creating our own, because there's no new
clearinghouse they need to connect to, they're already connected.
So particularly for the handful that may trade a few contracts with us, that ICE doesn't trade – so they've got not
connectivity to ICE Clear, we've got to do some work with them, but we're talking four or five clearing members, the
overwhelming majority are already on ICE Clear, so that will be easier.
We've begun the conversation with all of these clients about what's required for the migration, and the overwhelming
response we got is that it's less work, as I said a minute ago, than they were going to have to do if they migrated over.
So we actually think we've reduced a lot of the frictional costs and risks associated with any migration there.
To get to the last part of your question, obviously at the insistence of the regulators to both us and LCH, there is a
contingency plan. Now remember, if memory serves, ICE's migration out of LCH, their own clearinghouse was
delayed, I think because of the financial crisis. If I have got my timing right, they were trying to finish that migration
right around the time of the Lehman collapse. So I'm sure that added some complexity at that time.
But if something like that were to transpire and we needed to avail ourselves of the services of LCH for another month
or two, at the insistence of the regulators, that contingency is in place for as long as we would need it. It is our
anticipation now that we would not need that given how smooth this migration seems to be.
<Q - Alex Kramm>: Excellent. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Roger Freeman representing Barclays. Please proceed.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Hi, good morning. Just looking at market share in the U.S. and U.S. equities, the
internalized or off exchange for both your market and NASDAQ has been going up, and much more so even in
January. I'm just wondering what you're seeing? Is this more broker-dealer facilitation or dark pool volume? Any
thoughts around that?
<A - Lawrence E. Leibowitz>: I think it's a combination of a couple of things, Roger. First is volatility has been
relatively low which tends to make TRF go higher. Just over time, the brokers are getting better at internalizing and
circulating among their dark pools and segmenting their customer base. They've gotten very sophisticated about
different pricing schemes, different segmentation schemes, and the market is just moving in that direction.
We've been on record about our opinions on that, and we'll see where that goes. We don't think it's healthy at a certain
point for price discovery and the health of public markets, but that's the market structure we have right now. It's very
competitive, and we're going to do our best to mitigate it.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay. Thanks, Larry.

Your next question comes from the line of Niamh Alexander. Please proceed.
<Q - Niamh Alexander>: Thanks. Good morning. If I could come back to the transaction tax, because since the last
call what we've had is the kind of agreements, an unusual agreement, but there are certain number of member states,
including France and Germany, looking to plow ahead, and now it's emerging that they really want to capture not only
where the trade – the country of origin, and then the product country of origin, so it could actually impact your Liffe
business, and maybe ICE's business, too.

So help me think about what you can do to countermand that, or what your clients can do? Because it seems like if you
are a French utility, even if you're trading on Liffe U.S. or Liffe Europe you could get taxed here, and this is could have
an impact on volume.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Yes. It's a good question, Niamh, so thank you for asking it. So the only country so far
where we've really had any experience in the potential impact of these types of taxes is in France. And I think we've
been pretty transparent that the impact on volumes, although it's tough to isolate, right, because the fourth quarter was
kind of a strange quarter for a host of other reasons in the markets. To the best of our ability, it looks like it might have
10% to 15% impact in volumes.
Now to be clear, everybody on the call, as Niamh said, this is kind of an unusual agreement that's been struck with
these 10 member states. So it's called Enhanced Cooperation. It's a bit of – that's a bit of a euphemistic term. So it's 10
countries, it's Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Greece, Portugal, Belgium, Austria, Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia. I think
it's basically those 10 countries or 11 countries. And the Netherlands is sort of saying we'll do it too as long as our
pension funds are exempted and the revenues find their way back to the proper place.
So I discussed this with a lot of policymakers in Davos, because obviously a number of the countries in which we
operate are among the group that's having the Enhanced Cooperation. Just to be very clear, all of these states would
have to agree, when the negotiation begins they all have to agree on not just the final test, but how it's implemented,
where it's implemented, what the exemptions are, what the ground rules are. And the sense I got from talking to
policymakers in Davos is that this is going to be much more challenging to implement than meets the eye, because each
one of those companies (sic) [countries] I just mentioned has a very different view of what it should be, who should be
taxed, how it should be implemented, whether local enterprises are exempted, et cetera.
So the phrase that was used with me quite a bit was that this will be slow-walked. Now, that doesn't mean we're going
to take our eye off it, we have to pay attention to it, but I think that it's going to take a lot longer than we think for 11
countries, each of whom have their own idea of what this should be, for it to be implemented in this broader way. And
there's no sense that the full 27 countries are interested in doing this, none whatsoever.
<Q - Niamh Alexander>: So it doesn't sound like you're too concerned from Liffe's perspective, because if for
example, they do manage to get it done, even within two years instead of a year or whatever they're targeting, it just
sounds like it could impact Liffe's revenue because a lot of the customers that are trading on Liffe are probably based in
Continental Europe and maybe some of the products even originate there.
<A - Lawrence E. Leibowitz>: Yes. Well, just remember I mean, a lion's share of Liffe's volume actually comes from
U.K.-based companies, not from Continental Europe. Just like a lot of our equities are actually from U.K.-based
companies, not Continental Europe.
<Q - Niamh Alexander>: Okay. So the vast majority is U.K.-based?
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: And clients, most of the big global clients, Niamh, have offices all over the world, and
I've talked to many of them that are already trying to figure out where would they need to manage their business from
and send the orders from, because even if all 10 or 11 countries agree, you've still got plenty of other venues and
jurisdictions in which you could operate that this – where this wouldn't be a problem.
But I want to be very clear. It's not something we're just taking – we're not complacent about it because it's – frankly,
Enhanced Cooperation is a lot further than I thought they might get.
<Q - Niamh Alexander>: Okay. Thanks so much for taking the time.

<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Hi. Good morning, folks.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Hey, Brian.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Mike, could you talk a little bit more about the revamped market data agreements, and frame
the potential revenue impact for this year, and maybe 2014? And then also in with that talk a little bit about the traction
that you're seeing in the technology business from a revenue perspective, and what we should be thinking about?
<A - Michael S. Geltzeiler>: Let me tackle the market data. Since as we mentioned several times in the call and also in
the fourth quarter, we have introduced a number of initiatives in market data that we're pretty convinced will accelerate
our revenue growth there. We're restructuring the global data agreements, particularly the non-display area, addressing
some of the data that's purchased for feeds to routers and algos. There were some pricing changes. We've launched a
number of new products that we're pretty excited about. So those are being implemented in various stages throughout
2013, and I think a couple times in the call we said we expect the revenue from these initiatives to reach kind of nice
mass in Q2, and accelerate as we move forward in the quarter.
And I think in previous calls we've talked about this, certainly north of 10% of our market data business, as a sort of
annualized potential upside from this. So I think it's a series of initiatives, it's pretty comprehensive. It's similar to what
others have done in the marketplace, so it's not untested, and it's well under way. So I think we'll leave the guidance at
that for now. [ph] And Larry, technology generally (54:30).
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: So why don't we let Larry talk about kind of what we think some of the other
opportunities in reference with the new structure and the color. And then we'll take one more question and wrap it up.
<A - Lawrence E. Leibowitz>: Sure. As Mike mentioned, we did sign a couple of agreements in the fourth quarter that
are indicative of the types of individual opportunities, whether it's the Russell contract or ATG. But I think in talking
with a lot of our customers now, they are seriously talking about how do they outsource significant chunks of
infrastructure, because they really need to get some savings.
It's all consistent with when we put that chart in that you saw, if you really look at it, you say, well, it's not that different
than what you've said, I think the issue was the thesis that the banks would need to do these things was early two years
ago. Now I think they really need this to get on with it. Particularly with Dodd-Frank coming in, and other things that
are happening, they really need to increase their return on equity, and decrease their operating cost. So we're having a
lot of discussions in terms of those sort of deals.
I don't think that there are any of them in particular that's going to be huge, and that's – so we're not looking for big and
chunky, we're looking for steady growth of projects that are proof of concept that this thing continues to have [ph]
effects, okay (55:40).
<A - Stephen C. Davidson>: Great, okay. We're going to take one more.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Thank you.
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: Thanks, guys. Thanks, Brian. All right.

Your question comes from the line of Chris Allen representing Evercore. Please proceed.
<Q - Chris J. Allen>: Hey, guys. Brian just asked my question. But I guess just in the context of the ICE transaction,
any thoughts about the data centers longer term? And any new plans to monetize them moving forward?
<A - Duncan L. Niederauer>: So as we've said before, we're always looking at these as strategic assets, meaning we
don't get any personal satisfaction out of owning a data center. We don't go visit it [ph] on weekends. (56:18) So the
point is, we're always looking for a, well, gee, would we be better – would a sale-leaseback, are there other ways to
monetize this asset if we've got empty space. And that process was underway before the ICE transaction.
