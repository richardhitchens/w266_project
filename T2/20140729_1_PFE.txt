Slides that will be presented on the call can be viewed at pfizer.com by clicking on the link for Pfizer Quarterly
Corporate Performance, Second Quarter 2014, which is located in the Investor Presentation section in the lower
right-hand corner of this page.
Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussion during the call will include forward-looking statements and
that actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could
cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer's 2013 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in our reports on Forms
10-Q and 8-K.
Discussion during the call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly
comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's Current Report on Form 8-K dated today.
We will now make prepared remarks, and then we will move to a question-and-answer session.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian. Ian?
Ian C. Read
Thank you, Chuck, and thank you all for joining our call this morning. I'll begin with some brief comment from the
quarter.
Overall, we saw good performance and strong operational growth in a number of areas including Lyrica in developed
markets, Prevnar primarily in the U.S. and in emerging markets and Celebrex worldwide.
Our recently launched brands are making solid gains. Eliquis grew sequentially 50% quarter-on-quarter on a global
basis, while Xeljanz posted sequential growth quarter [indiscernible] (2:30) 30%, primarily in the U.S. With the
continuation of this momentum, these products are on a trajectory to become meaningful contributors to our underlying
business in the coming quarters. We also saw the continued uptake of Xalkori and Inlyta globally.
Revenues in our Consumer business increased 15% operationally, primarily due to the recent launch of Nexium 24HR
in the U.S. in late May. We also saw strong company-wide performance within the emerging markets. Revenue
increased 11% operationally compared to the year-ago quarter, driven by growth in China, Venezuela, Argentina, and
Brazil.
Despite the somewhat slower start to the year, each of our businesses is performing well in the face of ongoing product
Losses of Exclusivity [LOEs] within our innovative businesses, and continued pricing pressures and changing market
dynamics affecting our established business. I would also point out the negative impact of LOEs and the revenue loss
resulting from the expiration of some co-promoted revenues was $1.7 billion for the first six months. This impact
masks the company-wide operational revenue growth from all other products during the first half of the year, which
was 3% overall.
In evaluating our performance now that would have been operating in our new commercial model since the beginning
of the year, I believe the structure is providing greater transparency into the operations of each business, and on a daily
basis it enables decision making that better optimizes the performance and portfolio of each of our segments.
Furthermore, we remain encouraged by key developments that demonstrate our pipeline momentum.
Of particular note, we expect to complete the submission of the palbociclib new drug application to the FDA in August.
The submission is based on the final results of PALOMA-1, a randomized Phase II trial comparing the combination of
palbociclib plus letrozole versus letrozole alone, as a first-line treatment for postmenopausal women with
estrogen-positive HER2 negative advanced breast cancer. We will publicly communicate once we've completed our
submission.

Also of note, our Phase III palbociclib trials in advanced breast cancer, PALOMA 2 and PALOMA 3, are progressing
and both trials have completed recruitment of new patients. In addition, a number of Phase III studies where we are
collaborating with leading international breast cancer investigators are open and enrolling patients with both advanced
and early breast cancer, and we have active exploration underway in multiple Phase I and II studies in non-breast
indications.
Given the outbreaks of meningitis B disease on several U.S. college campuses in 2013, we worked closely with the
FDA to submit our biologics license application for accelerated approval of our meningitis B vaccine for the prevention
of invasive meningococcal disease in adolescents and young adults. We look forward to the meeting that has just been
scheduled to take place on August 13 by the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, ACIP, to discuss
and vote on a potentially expanded recommendation for Prevnar 13 use in adults.
We have a comprehensive Xeljanz program that is progressing with Phase III studies underway in UC and psoriatic
arthritis, and Phase II studies in psoriasis for topical use, Crohn's disease, and ankylosing spondylitis. We continue to
enroll patients in Phase III trials of bococizumab for cholesterol lowering in high-risk individuals, ertugliflozin for the
treatment of diabetes, and later this year we expect to begin enrolling patients to rivipansel: for the treatment of
vaso-occlusive crisis individuals with sickle cell anemia.
As we enter the second half of this year, our strategy, focus and priorities remain unchanged, supported by the steady
performance of each of our Commercial segments. When it comes to business development, we will continue to
evaluate all opportunities, regardless of the size, through the lens of value creation for our shareholders and enhancing
the competitiveness of our businesses.
Our most recent announced acquisitions and collaborations are examples of enablers of our strategy. We expect
InnoPharma will meaningfully increase the size of our Sterile Injectable business through their existing and
out-licensed portfolio of sterile injectables, as well as the medium- and long-term through the potential of their
pipeline. And if we see promising results as we move forward with this Cellectis collaboration to develop
immunotherapies against select targets in oncology, we believe it has the potential for changing the way cancer is
treated.
In summary, for the remainder of this year, we will be focused on executing our plans and taking the actions that will
further strengthen and globally position us to be market leaders in each of our business segments. We remain
committed to advancing innovative new therapies on behalf of patients we serve, prudently managing deploying capital
to drive the greatest value for our shareholders, and creating a culture within the organization where colleagues think
creatively, take prudent risks, and operate with an entrepreneurial mindset.
I will now turn it over to Frank to take you through the financial details of the quarter.
Frank A. D'Amelio
Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone.
As always, the charts we are reviewing today are included in our webcast. As a reminder, because of the full
disposition of Zoetis on June 23, 2013, the financial results of the Animal Health business and the gain associated with
its full disposition are reported as a discontinued operation in the consolidated statements of income for the second
quarter and first six months of 2013. Now let's move on to the financials.
Second quarter 2014 revenues of approximately $12.8 billion decreased 2% year-over-year, reflecting a 1% negative
impact from foreign exchange, and an operational decline of approximately 1%, driven mainly by the expiration on
October 31, 2013 of the co-promotion term for Enbrel in the U.S. and Canada, the ongoing terminations and expirations
of the Spiriva collaboration in certain countries, the loss of exclusivity and subsequent multi-sourced generic
competition for Detrol LA in the U.S., and other product losses of exclusivity in various markets. These are partially
offset by the strong operational growth in developed markets of Lyrica, Nexium 24HR in the U.S., Prevnar, Eliquis,
Xeljanz, Celebrex, Xalkori and Inlyta, and by strong operational growth of 11% in emerging markets.

In addition, reported revenues included $71 million from transitional manufacturing and supply agreements with
Zoetis. I want to point out LOEs and declining alliance revenues had a negative impact of approximately $840 million
during the quarter.
Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.58 increased 4%, primarily due to fewer diluted weighted average shares outstanding due to
ongoing share repurchases and the impact of the Zoetis exchange offer, which were partially offset by a 4% aggregate
operational increase in adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A, adjusted R&D expenses resulting from an unfavorable
shift in product mix, and recently initiated Phase III programs for bococizumab, ertugliflozin, palbociclib, and the
meningitis B vaccine, and for the studies of Xeljanz and certain other products and potential new indications. However,
adjusted SI&A expenses decreased because of continued benefits from cost reduction and productivity initiatives.
Reported diluted EPS of $0.45 compared with $1.98 in the year-ago quarter was primarily due to the non-recurrence in
the second quarter 2014 of income from discontinued operations in the year-ago quarter attributable to the Animal
Health business, including the gain associated with its disposition, and the income in the year-ago quarter from a
litigation settlement for patent infringement damages, and to a lesser extent, the LOEs and the expiration of the
co-promotion term for certain products, all of which were partially offset by lower acquisition-related costs, purchase
accounting adjustments and asset impairment charges, a lower effective tax rate due to the resolution in the second
quarter of 2014 of certain prior-year tax positions with various foreign tax authorities, a favorable change in
jurisdictional mix of earnings, and the non-recurrence of the unfavorable impact of the tax rate associated with the
aforementioned patent litigation settlement income. And finally, fewer shares outstanding.
Foreign exchange negatively impacted second quarter revenues by 1% or $87 million, and had a net positive impact of
$18 million on the aggregate of adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses.
Consequently, foreign exchange negatively impacted adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.01 compared with the
year-ago quarter.
Now moving on to the financial highlights of our businesses: in the second quarter, Global Innovative Pharmaceuticals
revenues decreased 5% operationally year-over-year, due to the previously mentioned expiration of the co-promotional
term for Enbrel in the U.S. and Canada, and the loss of exclusivity for Lyrica in Canada in February of 2013, and the
expiration of the co-promotion term for Enbrel and the LOEs of certain products resulted in an operational decline of
$459 million. However, all other GIP revenues grew 9% operationally, driven by strong growth from Lyrica, primarily
in the U.S. and Japan, as well as the performance of recently launched products, including Eliquis globally and Xeljanz
primarily in the U.S.
Income before taxes declined 12% operationally due to the decrease in revenues, a 5% operational increase in cost of
sales, or a 1.2% percentage point increase as a percentage of revenues. I want to point out here that the loss of Enbrel
alliance revenues in the second quarter of 2014 negatively impacted cost of sales as a percentage of revenues by 1.5
percentage points operationally. 13% operational increase in SI&A expenses from increased investment in new
products and in-line brands such as Lyrica and Viagra as well as a 41% operational increase in R&D expenses due to
recently initiated Phase III programs for bococizumab, ertugliflozin and additional Xeljanz indications.
In the second quarter, revenues from our Vaccines, Oncology and Consumer Healthcare business grew 15%
operationally year-over-year due to the strong operational growth of Prevnar 13 in the U.S. and in emerging markets,
the launch of Nexium 24HR in the U.S. in late May 2014, and the continued strong uptake of Xalkori and Inlyta
globally.
Income before taxes increased 10% operationally due to increased revenues, which were partially offset by a 23%
operational increase in cost of sales driven by increased sales volumes and an unfavorable change in product mix, an
18% operational increase in SI&A expenses associated with the launch of Nexium 24HR and the pre-launch marketing
expenses for the meningitis B vaccine and palbociclib and the 16% increase in R&D expenses supporting the
acceleration of the meningitis B vaccine and palbociclib development programs.
The second quarter Global Established Pharmaceuticals revenues decreased 5% operationally year-over-year due to the
loss of exclusivity and subsequent launch of multi-source generic competition, for Detrol LA in the U.S. in January of

2014, Viagra in most European markets in June of 2013, and Aricept in Canada in December of 2013, as well as the
ongoing termination of the co-promotion agreement for Spiriva in most countries including the U.S. in April and the
ongoing expiration in certain other countries. These were partially offset by the strong operational performance of
Celebrex in most major markets, Lyrica in Europe, and Lipitor primarily in China.
The LOEs of certain products, the loss of alliance revenues for Aricept and Spiriva and Lipitor in developed markets
negatively impacted GEP revenues by $395 million operationally. However, all other GEP revenues grew 1%
operationally. Income before taxes declined 4% operationally due to the decrease in revenues which was partially offset
by the aggregate decrease, cost of sales, SI&A and R&D expenses which included increased spending on biosimilar
development programs.
Now moving on to our 2014 financial guidance, we've updated several components of our adjusted guidance and
reaffirmed our 2014 adjusted diluted EPS guidance range. Because of the anticipated negative impact from the
expected multi-source generic competition for Celebrex in the U.S. in December of 2014, we now expect revenues to
be in the range of $48.7 billion to $50.7 billion versus $49.2 billion to $51.2 billion. This range absorbs the negative
impact of approximately $3.4 billion due to declining alliance revenues and expected product losses of exclusivity.
In addition, we are decreasing our adjusted SI&A expense range due to an expected reduction in promotional spending
for Celebrex in the second half of 2014 and now expect adjusted SI&A to be in the range of $13.3 billion to $14.3
billion compared with $13.5 billion to $14.5 billion previously.
To reflect the planned $80 million upfront payment to Cellectis for our global strategic collaboration and anticipated
increased expenses for the acceleration of certain late stage clinical programs including palbociclib and bococizumab,
among others, we now expect R&D expenses to be in the range of $6.7 billion to $7.2 billion versus $6.4 billion to $6.9
billion previously.
We now expect approximately $200 million of other income versus approximately $100 million of other deducts
because of lower expected net interest expense for the remainder of 2014 and gains realized during the first half of
2014, mainly on sales of product rights and investments and equity securities.
We expect reported diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.47 to $1.62 due to charges related to certain legal matters
primarily related to Neurontin incurred during the first quarter 2014, and we are reaffirming our 2014 adjusted diluted
EPS guidance range of $2.20 to $2.30, which absorbs approximately $0.05 per share for anticipated negative impacts
related to Celebrex and $0.01 related to the planned upfront payment for the Cellectis collaboration.
Now moving on to key takeaways, we recorded solid second quarter 2014 results. We reaffirmed our adjusted diluted
EPS range which absorbs an approximately $0.05 anticipated negative impact related to Celebrex and $0.01 related to
Cellectis.
We achieved several key R&D milestones, including the initiation of a rolling submission in June 2014 of an NDA
seeking approval for palbociclib which we expect to complete this August. In June, we submitted a biologics license
application to the FDA for our meningitis B vaccine candidate, and we discussed with the ACIP at its June meeting the
potential expanded recommendation for Prevnar 13 use with adults. We expect the ACIPs decision on August 13.
We announced several business development opportunities to further strengthen our position in key strategic areas and
we continue to create shareholder value through prudent capital allocation. To date, in 2014, we've repurchase $2.9
billion or approximately 95.1 million shares, and we continue to expect to repurchase $5 billion of our common stock
this year. These repurchases and planned repurchases for the remainder of the year are expected to reduce total shares
outstanding year-over-year by a total of approximately 100 million shares by the end of 2014 after considering actual
and projected dilution related to employee compensation programs.
Finally, we remain committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2015 and beyond.
Now I'll turn it back to Chuck.

Charles Triano
Thank you, Frank. Operator, at this point can we please poll for questions?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Great. Thanks very much for the question. Just two here. The first one, I'm sure this is
the first time you've been asked this recently, but on business development, just how are you thinking about BD
[Business Development] at this point? I guess given the valuation resets and pipeline recovery that's occurred in this
space, is it more challenging to find larger deals that both advance Pfizer's story and give your investors the type of
returns they're looking for?
And the second question, for the past year or so, up until the Astra approach, there had been a focus on the potential
breakup of Pfizer based on your new corporate structure you're creating coupled with new pipeline recovery. Can you
just update us on your thoughts on that potential split of Pfizer over time? Have your views on breakup making
potential sense changed at all? And do you still see merit in the idea of splitting the company into maybe two over
time? Thanks very much.
<A - Ian C. Read>: So thank you for the questions, Chris. On BD, BD is not a strategy, it's an enabler of strategy. We
continue to aggressively look at all types of BD regardless of size that we believe would add value to shareholders. So
that's our stance on BD.
And on the, on this much-discussed potential breakup, we, as before, we're managing the business in two segments,
broadly speaking; one being Innovative and the other being Established. And in the Innovative, we have sub-businesses
like Oncology and Consumer and Vaccines that are very distinct from other parts of the Innovative business. So we're
giving you transparency on those segments, and we are collecting both P&L and balance sheet information to give us
optionality.
What we do eventually will really depend upon how those businesses perform, how our shareholders value those
businesses, and we will look at that after an appropriate period of time of both collecting the data we need for
optionality and the performance in the marketplace.
Thank you. Frank, do you want to add anything?
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: The only thing I would add, Chris, to punctuate what Ian said is I think for the time being
and for the near future the most important thing those businesses can do is execute with excellence. It's all about
operational performance and then that will create all kinds of options and choices for us in the future.
<A - Ian C. Read>: So fundamentally, I see BD as adding to what I see is a strong hand we have with our core
strategies.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thanks, Ian and Frank. Next question, please?
Operator
The next question comes from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: Yeah, thanks for taking the question. So couple here. Again, I'm sure you have gotten some of
these before as well. But one is around the increase rhetoric in Washington, around inversions. Would that impact or is
it impacting in any way the way you look at doing an inversion-based deal in the future?

And then the second one just on the pipeline around palbo, I think there's a lot of questions. You said, obviously, you're
going to file next month. A lot of questions around what the FDA is going to do and really – so I think why would the
FDA approve it [ph] on an exadata basis (21:57) when you'll be getting full Phase III data just a few months later? So if
you can just give us any updated thoughts there as to around the discussion you've had with the FDA and why the need
to, again, just maybe take a little bit more of a risk to get this out just a few months ahead of the full data set? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thanks for the question, Vamil. In Washington, I – we remain committed to discussing and
advocating for fundamental tax reform. And that will play out with the political parties we suspect over the next
coming years, and it's really difficult to comment more than that other than we do believe the tax system is inherently –
puts American companies at a disadvantage, and we would like to see the tax system reformed.
On palbo, I think there is some confusion as to when we get the final Phase III data, but I'll ask Albert to comment on
the palbo submission.
<A - Albert Bourla>: Thank you, Ian, and thank you, Vamil, for the question. As you're aware, our submission is
based on the final results for our Phase II trial. And this has happened after conversations with FDA. I don't want to
speculate what FDA will request as we go through the review process, but I can tell you that until now, they have not
placed any conditions on us related to the Phase III trial results. As Ian alluded, the Phase III is – has completed
recruitment, and it is expected to come to final completion at the end in December of 2015 and the final report will be
available in 2016.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Albert.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thanks, Albert. Next question, please, operator.
Operator
Your next question comes from Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Tim Minton Anderson>: Thanks. Just going back to M&A, and I know you will probably struggle to answer this
question, but in your prepared remarks, you said you would continue to evaluate all opportunities regardless of size.
My question is whether it's reasonable to expect that Pfizer can find strategically attractive targets that are big enough
such that tax inversion could be one of the benefits? So the operative here for me would be strategically attractive,
because I can think of other theoretical inversion targets but I'm not sure I'd see the strategic value in those so I would
like to get your opinion on that.
And then on palbociclib in Europe, do you expect that PALOMA-1 will be adequate for submission or will regulatory
authorities likely require at least interim Phase III results before approving kind of like they did with Xalkori?
<A - Ian C. Read>: Albert, why don't you take the palbo question and I'll come back to the M&A.
<A - Albert Bourla>: Yeah. Thanks a lot, Tim. Look, I mean, as you can expect, we have begun discussions with the
European and other regulatory health authorities and those – for palbociclib and those discussions include discussions
on the clinical data. Also, we have presented to them our development program, and we have entered into discussions
about the potential regulatory path forward, but it is too early to disclose at this stage our regulatory strategy for these
regions.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you.
And Tim, on M&A, we look and continue to look at a very wide spectrum of M&A transactions. We have substantial
financial ability and balance sheet and tax inversion is one part of the value equation. I mean, when we were looking at
AZ, we looked at both their pipeline, the synergies and the tax inversion, so we will continue to look very broadly at
deploying our capital in a way that makes sense for shareholder return.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thanks, Ian. Moving on to the next question please, operator?

Your next question is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. I know we're all kind of dancing around the same issue, Ian, but just on the assumption
that AstraZeneca does not materialize, is there actually a plan B in place? What we've seen since then is a small
acquisition, InnoPharma, and is that the kind of deals that we should anticipate going forward or is there still a plan in
place to achieve a lower tax rate to enhance the pipeline?
And then I don't know if Mikael Dolsten is on the call but just a question on business development, in-licensing,
out-licensing activity, I mean, we've seen recently a couple of high-profile licensing deals: tremelimumab to
AstraZeneca, neratinib to Puma and regrettably, those look like very unfortunate decisions. And just, Ian, are you
looking internally and are you pleased with the team that you have in place who are charged with making these critical
decisions? Thanks very much.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. So on the BD, we looked at both those assets you mentioned early on in their life cycle
and we looked at the opportunities with inside our portfolio and took the decision, given that they were lower, we
believe, lower value assets with what we knew about those asset at the time, to out-license them.
In the case of the Puma asset that they acquired neratinib, we have – we out-licensed this or we looked at almost 10
companies, most of them major pharmaceutical companies, and the only company that was interested in its
development was Puma. And as such, we were pleased with the out-license agreement we struck with them and the
royalty rate. I have not seen the data, nor has Pfizer seen the data that may or may not indicate that the product has
value, and we will be in discussions with Puma vis-à-vis our legal rights as to that data and the consequences of that
data.
On the tremelimumab, it was a decision to out-license to AZ, and I am not aware of any data that would make me
believe that we made a mistake given the fact that we had other products that we were developing of higher
productivity value.
Now with regard for plan B my comment would be our plan A is our plan to continue to develop our innovative
pipeline, to restore the vigor in our pipeline. We're making progress with mid-and late stage pipelines, including
Prevnar adult, palbociclib, bococizumab, ertugliflozin, mening B, and Xeljanz follow-on indications. We'll continue to
grow our newly-launched brands such as Eliquis, Xeljanz, Xalkori, Inlyta, Lyrica, and Enbrel, and we're focusing on
the emerging markets.
So plan A is to continue with the strategy that we have always articulated, which is to reinvigorate our innovative core,
make our R&D productive, and make smart and shareholder-friendly capital allocation decisions. Any BD that we do
will be looked at for the view of accelerating those strategies and improving returns to shareholders and the deals that
you – InnoPharma and Cellectis, are deals that are opportunistic and add-on, and we think build and help the
underlying, Bus, but certainly are not representative of the total firepower of corporate strategy of Pfizer.
Frank, do you want to add anything to that?

<Q - John T. Boris>: Thanks for taking the questions. First question for Frank: in 2013 and for the front half of 2014,
you returned a significant amount of cash through share repurchases, and through dividends in both of those years. Can
you just remind us what the total amount that you returned and how much cash did you have to bring back offshore to
be able to fund your share repurchase and your dividend from offshore?
Second question for Ian, on large scale versus tuck-in type acquisitions, if you look at your U.S. operation, which is
traditionally the most profitable operation of a major pharma, it seems with ongoing losses of exclusivity and losses of
alliance revenue, that that operation seems to be under a fair amount of pressure. You do have some pipeline assets that
you're successfully launching through there, but is the scale of what you're launching large enough to be able offset
some of those pressures that you have from continued losses of exclusivity, losses of alliance revenue?
And then on your Established Products business, traditionally you've had a lot of success bringing in injectable assets
into that business but on a global basis, is it of scale where you have the regulatory capabilities needed to be able to
successfully launch other types of assets on a global basis through that strategically? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, John. Frank, do you want to take the first question?
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Sure. Sure. So, John, just in terms of running the numbers, last year we returned $23
billion to our shareholders between share buybacks and dividends. The buyback piece of that was $16.3 billion. This
year the buyback piece year-to-date is $2.9 billion. If you look at our dividend on an annual basis, we've got, on
average, call it 6.4 or 6.5 billion shares at $1.04 dividend. Call that $6.5 billion to $7 billion so for mid-year, a piece of
that is another $3 billion, $3.5 billion. And then if you look, by the way, just in terms of numbers, if you look over the
last three years, 2011, 2012, and 2013 we returned about $53 billion to our shareholders in terms of buybacks and
dividends.
And in terms of a major way we have funded that has been through some of our unlocking value activities, so the sale
of Capsugel, the sale of Nutrition and the exchange for Zoetis. So those are three of the ways we've done that, and
obviously, through very effective and efficient tax planning.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Frank. On your question about scale of the Innovative business, you – obviously, your
question goes to the strategic issue we've been dealing with as we try and take care of the LOEs while trying to
minimize revenue decreases while growing our EPS, and I think we've been doing a good job of doing that while we
manage the sort of onslaught of LOEs with EPS growth. So it comes down to the question of the growth of Lyrica, the
growth of Eliquis, the growth of Xeljanz, the adult vaccine, the mening B, the Xeljanz follow-ons. What is the extent of
growth we can get from that while we continue -- and, of course, the palbociclib and when it launches? That compared
to the LOEs plus the growth we can get out of emerging markets.
So it's a very good question. We feel that our strategy is the right one. We will continue to be challenged on revenue
growth, but we see that we can manage through this cycle through those products I just mentioned, and behind that, we
see a wave of very exciting products coming as we get through these LOEs.
On EP, I would ask John to comment.
<A - John Young>: Okay. So thanks for the question, John, about sterile injectables. I think maybe the first point to
make is that we actually have a very strong sterile injectable business globally, not only in the US. But one of the
features of the market overall is actually it's pretty concentrated, and there are about five markets globally that probably
represent about 80% of the total profit pool in sterile injectables. The U.S. is obviously one of those markets. The other
markets would include China, Japan, France and Italy. So it's actually more concentrated than you would think, and I
think the answer to your question is we actually feel very confident about the underlying capabilities that we have,
particularly in regulatory affairs, to be able to bring to market products in that portfolio, either products that we are
developing organically, or hopefully in the future, pending completion of the acquisition of InnoPharma, products that
will come out of the pipeline of that company.
<A - Ian C. Read>: I would add, John, our Established Products or our international presence is probably the strongest
of any American company and certainly on a par with any of the Europeans. We have great strength, broadly speaking,

<A - Charles Triano>: Thanks, Ian. Next question, please, operator.

Your next question is from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Yes. Thanks very much. I have two strategic questions and then one cost question. So on the
first two, number one, I was just wondering if you could provide feedback that you received on the final offer of £55
for AstraZeneca that you received from major investors?
And second, are you considering other major tax re-domiciling transactions?
And then with respect to net costs, obviously, Pfizer continues to cut costs but also needs to reinvest. So beyond 2014,
Frank, should we think about Pfizer being able to reduce net costs in terms of selling and general and administrative
and R&D? Or at the end of this year, will you be at the point of essentially looking at flattish costs or rising costs going
forward? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: So on AZ, you understand I can't make any forward-looking statements on AZ. I would like to put
in context of, I believe, information that's already been reported. We were faced with the AZ management with an
indication that they would not engage with us in any meaningful way unless we had an opening offer of approximately
£59. Faced with that, we made what we thought was a full and final offer of £55 that fully valued the company and
gave appropriate sharing of synergies to the appropriate shareholders. We have, in general, received good feedback
from our shareholders that we demonstrated appropriate capital discipline.
Are we looking at additional or other BD deals? Absolutely. And would a tax inversion be part of that value? Just as it
was AZ, it will be part of the value that we look at. We also look for strengthening parts of our businesses as well as we
do that. Fundamentally, what we look for is will any BD create long-term value for our shareholders? And that's the
lens we look at it through, not necessarily through financial or strategic, but overall is it value creating against our cost
of capital?
Frank, on our net cost.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Sure. And so, Dave, just in terms of timing, when we close out the year, we are on our end
of January early February call 2015, we'll close out Q4 and then I'll give specific guidance by line item for 2015 so
you'll get the specific numbers then. But I'll comment – I'll answer your question now in maybe macro context.
What I've said this year in the last few quarters is that I think we've entered the late innings on cost reduction. We've
got some pressure on R&D as we've initiated some late stage development programs that we've alluded to on the call.
We've had some pressure on SI&A due to launch costs for new products. It's a good problem to have.
With that said, in terms of managing our cost and expense structure, our expectation is that we will continuously
improve as we go forward and there are still opportunities to improve our cost structure and we will capitalize on those
opportunities, and we will drop as much of that to the bottom line as we can. It will be a balance between cost benefit
analysis and how we deploy our capital.

<Q - Colin N. Bristow>: Thanks. A few product questions, if I may. On Xeljanz, could you give us a little more color
on the performance in the quarter? And then looking forward, where are you in terms of getting the 10 milligram
approved in RA given you intend to file the 5 milligram and 10 milligram doses in psoriasis? What gives you
confidence the FDA will feel comfortable with the 10 milligram dose in this setting?
And on the once daily formulation, what are timelines associated with this?
And then finally on ertugliflozin, how do you see yourself competing given it looks like you'll be fourth to market and
historically third or fourth entrants in these types of commoditized markets have struggled to gain meaningful share?
Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Geno, would you like to answer those questions, please?
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Sure. So let me start out with Xeljanz. So we had a good quarter with Xeljanz. We grew by
over 30% from the first quarter of this year. We think we've really hit an inflection point with the launch of the
structured data that came out during the first quarter this year, so we have some momentum, and we're feeling good
about the performance in the U.S.
With regard to the 10 milligram in RA, we think that's going to take a while. It's going to take accumulation of
additional safety data to satisfy the FDA although we have 10 milligram registrations in other countries, so we'll just
see how that plays out.
With regard to psoriasis, we have a fairly large comprehensive database, over 3,600 patients and four significant trials
in psoriasis. The results that we saw across the 5 milligram and 10 milligram doses were consistent in those trials. It is
obviously a different patient population with a different safety and efficacy profile overall.
So we're in the process now of assembling our dossier and we'll file a dossier and have discussions with the agency on
the appropriate benefit risk and the appropriate dosages for that indication.
With regard to the once a day, we're continuing to make really good progress with the once a day program. As you may
know, we are not needing to do any additional clinical work. We're doing some pharmacology and PK work so we
expect to be filing in the first half of 2015.
And with regard to ertugliflozin, we have, again, a comprehensive program in partnership with Merck developing
ertugliflozin as a single entity molecule or product and also in combination with Januvia and metformin and we will
have an overall strategy that involves both the single entity and combination of products to make our way into that
marketplace.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Geno. Of course, as you say, fourth in but it depends upon the quality of the clinical
trial and the results we get and we believe that it is potentially a best in class molecule. Thank you.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thank you. Our next question, please, operator.

Your next question is from Marc Goodman from UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Hey, Geno. I was wondering if you could also give us an update on Xalkori, Inlyta, how those
products are doing in the trends and how much more you think we can get from those?
Second question is an update on tanezumab?
And third, China, maybe you could talk about some of the trends in China. Are we still gaining market share over
there? Are we adding sales reps or moving into new cities and how the Hisun JV has worked out? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Marc. Great questions. So, Albert, in fact, will – has Oncology under his responsibility
so he will answer the Xalkori and Inlyta questions, and then we'll go to Mikael for tanezumab, and then perhaps in

general, perhaps John could answer the China question.
<A - Albert Bourla>: Marc, Inlyta, overall very pleased with the performance of Inlyta. That was driven by a very
strong uptake in key new regions in the quarter. We've had $101 million of sales that was up 44% operationally from
last year.
Very similar sentiments for Xalkori. We reported revenues of $108 million for the quarter, that was up 59%. Overall,
the growth is driven as a result of we have increased testing for the ALK gene mutation. We reached 78%. I remind you
that when we launched the product, 11%, so quite strong uptake. And the second reason is because we have extended
duration [indiscernible] (43:46). So more patients are treated, and they're treated for longer. So very strong performance
for both and we expect to see this growth continue. Geno?
<A - Ian C. Read>: No, Mikael, on tanezumab.
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Yes. So on tanezumab, and thank you for the interest in that asset, and as you may remember,
tanezumab delivered some very strong efficacy signal in the previous studies. And represent potentially one of the few
classes of new mechanism that recently proving substantial clinical benefit and you know, we have been working with
the FDA in some very good, constructive dialogues on what needs to be demonstrated in pre-clinical toxicology in
order to submit a new package that could open up the potential for re-initiating large studies. This is been focused on
pre-clinical studies on the peripheral nervous system, and we have done some in-depth studies that continue to
accumulate data, but so far, I am encouraged about what we've learned about the drug and the mechanism and we have
stated that we will plan potentially to resubmit the data if it will continue to come together in a positive way, no later
than the first part of 2015.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. John, China overall, and perhaps Frank has also got some numbers, we'll see if we can
do a tag team there.
<A - John Young>: All right. So thanks for the question, Marc. So I think we're obviously very pleased with the
performance of China this quarter. Overall, the total biopharmaceutical business in China showed operational growth of
27%. The GEP business within that grew at 37% in the quarter. And you can see the product performances when you
go to the schedules in the earnings release, so pretty much across the board, what we've seen is strong volume growth
driven by good operational performance in the marketplace.
I think maybe just to comment on overall the strategy in China for our business which clearly is very important to us,
overall, our strategy has a number of areas of focus. We are very focused on driving the legacy brands in China. Lipitor
is probably a standout product for us, and we see a great fit with the priorities of the Chinese government to really
better treat and manage patients with cardiovascular disease and our portfolio of Lipitor and Norvasc is a great fit in
that regard.
You mentioned Hisun, and certainly, we've had a strategy in China for a number of years now to really find ways of
participating in the profitable segments of the fast-growing generic market. Our partnership with Hisun is really a great
example of that. Overall, generic products account for around about 70% of the domestic market in China and really
our partnership with Hisun places us extremely well to be able to maximize our contribution there with products that
are a great fit with, again, the needs of the health care system.
Thirdly, clearly, we're looking to bring Innovative products to market and the GIP and VOC [Vaccines, Oncology and
Consumer] businesses in China are looking to maximize the performance of innovative products in the market as well
as bring new products to market.
And overarching all of that, the last thing I would just say is that we are clearly looking to find ways of collaborating
very constructively with the Chinese government and with their goals for the development of the pharmaceutical
industry capability in China. We've had a domestic manufacturing capacity in China for many years. And we're also
very engaged with working with the Ministry of Health to partner with them to better screen patients for cardiovascular
disease in China as well.

So all of those things together really give you hopefully a flavor of what is driving the performance in China this
quarter.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, John.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: And then, Marc, I'll just run a few other numbers, and then I'll answer your questions about
reps. So John mentioned 27% operational growth with biopharmaceutical business. Total company for the quarter grew
24% operationally, and then John mentioned Lipitor and Norvasc. Lipitor in China grew 55% operationally
quarter-over-quarter, Norvasc grew 30% quarter-over-quarter. So just some really, really strong performance, and we
have added a significant amount of reps in China in the first half of the year.

Your next question is from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink.
<Q - Seamus C. Fernandez>: Thanks very much. I have three questions. The first one on palbociclib can you just
update us on the timing of the potential interim look in PALOMA-2?
The second question is really for Frank. Frank, maybe you can just confirm for us as we look at the year-over-year
comparisons, we do see the 2013 numbers broken out, but can you just confirm that this is not fully audited information
that would include the balance sheet? Basically my question is, historically you've said that there won't be a look-back
at 2013 that would basically facilitate a split occurring sooner, but as I look at that data, if it were fully audited, it
would seem like that might be a possibility.
And then my last question, for Ian, would you ever consider a sale of the Innovative businesses, should you be
approached by another company, basically a willingness, if it made sense for shareholders in terms of the value that
might be provided to Pfizer in an eventual split? Thanks so much.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Seamus. Palbo interim.
<A - Albert Bourla>: Yes, there's an interim review built into the design of Phase III trials of PALOMA-2, but the
timing of that review is event-driven. So we cannot speculate when that review will exactly take place. As I said before,
the primary completion of the study is expected at the end of 2015 so the final report is expected in 2016. Again, it's
event driven so the actual date may vary a bit.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. Frank?
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Yes, so Seamus the way I think about this is no change from what I've said previously,
which is, if it's a public transaction, if we were to decide to do something from a separation perspective in the future, it
would be three years of audited financials, and with year one being 2014, so it'd be prospectively three years of audited
financials. So no change from what I've said previously.
<A - Ian C. Read>: So on your last question, Seamus, I see myself and the management team and I'm sure the board
sees themselves as custodians of shareholder value, and so we would have to evaluate any proposal under its merit, and
whether we believed it produced long-term superior returns to shareholders.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thanks, Ian. Next question, please, operator.

<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I've got three for you. First off on Prevnar 13, would you
just like to frame the opportunity for us again if you were to receive positive recommendation from the ACIP in
August, and is that contained within your guidance for this year?
Secondly, could you just comment around your strategic thoughts on your Consumer business given some of the recent
consolidation within that industry? Does this asset still make the most sense within the Pfizer structure?
And then lastly, I wonder if you could just give us an up-to-date overview of your biosimilar programs and the
potential timelines for any key assets? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. On the consumer business, we see a great store of value. We have an active both with
acquired assets in that business, we've just launched Nexium 24HR, we have an active Rx to OTC switch strategy, so
we see it is a business that we want to be in.
On Prevnar 13 adult, I'll ask Albert to give you some idea of the opportunity. The early approval is included in this
year's overall guidance.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: No major change.
<A - Ian C. Read>: No major change. Albert?
<A - Albert Bourla>: Yes, I will tell you this is a great opportunity, of course, globally, not only in U.S., because there
is a very large adult target population, and there is a significant unmet need over there. There are 300 million adults are
greater than 65 years of age in the world, and half of that is in U.S. Europe and Japan. 3.6, 3.7 million U.S. adults are
turning 65 each year, and also depending upon ACIP recommendation, we do believe that there could be even an
addition catch-up opportunity for adults greater than 65 that have already received the old generation vaccine. So we
expect Prevnar-13 to be the leading adult vaccination given the strength of our data.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. And biosimilars, John?
<A - John Young>: Okay, thanks again for question, Jeff. So essentially, we have five monoclonals in development.
All of those products we expect to come to market in the 2017 2018 time-frame after the loss of exclusivity of the basic
patents of those molecules. So just to give you a rundown of the five:
We have trastuzumab, which is a biosimilar for Herceptin. That is already in Phase III. Phase III was initiated earlier on
this year.
We have a biosimilar, rituximab. That achieved our proof of concept in the first half of this year, and we expect to
initiate Phase III in the second half of 2014.
We have biosimilar infliximab, Phase I was completed or we expect complete at the end of this year, and the next
milestone there would, again, be the initiation of Phase III in the second half of this year.
We have biosimilar adalimumab. Phase I has been initiated, and the next milestone would be a proof of concept readout
from those Phase I studies in mid this year.
And then we have biosimilar bevacizumab. That is in pre-clinical, and the next milestone for that program would be the
initiation of Phase I studies, again, this year.

<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. On palbo, when can we expect updated
survival data from PALOMA-1?
And a higher-level R&D question, is there an opportunity for additional cost savings in your R&D structure? We've
seen some of your peers simplify their structure and achieve significant savings without seemingly compromising
productivity. Is that an option for Pfizer? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Would you like to do palbo, please, Albert?
<A - Albert Bourla>: Yes, on the overall survival data, we had an initial assessment that was done when we had only
37% of the total events. Now there is a follow-up analysis, but it is scheduled following the accrual of additional
events. But the time can take really long, because the average, the median overall survival of this population, it is
approximately four years. So I really think that the final analysis likely will take long. Just a reminder though here, that
the primary endpoint of the study was the progression-free survival. The overall survival was one of the secondary
endpoints. And also, historically, [ph] agents on the market (55:55) for ER-positive metastatic breast cancer have been
approved all with PFS data as the primary endpoint.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Albert. So on the R&D question, we feel that post the acquisition of Wyeth, we were
very prudent in the way we dimensioned our R&D spend. I believe taking the combined spend of some 11...
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: $11 billion total.
<A - Ian C. Read>: $11 billion down to $6.5 billion, $6.7 billion. So I really can't comment on what other competitors
have been doing, but certainly for a few years now, we've accelerated the refining of how much we spend in research,
where we spend it. We have really good tools internally to look at the productivity by asset, and we invest behind
strong signals with lots of quality gates. And we have separated out the decision between proof of concept and a
decision to move forward into Phase III between the research and the commercial business. So we've got strong internal
drivers for return on capital.
Will we continue to look at the best ways to invest in research? Of course. We've got a CTI initiative where we have
major relationships with some 20 universities in the U.S., and I believe outside of the U.S. at least one, where we
attempt to look to be efficient in the way we discover mechanisms of action. And of course, this is a major expense
which we are constantly monitoring to make sure it's efficient.
When you have great products like we do and we're bringing them forward in the development of Phase III, clearly
there's pressure on the development costs for large trials such as we're doing with bococizumab or with palbociclib or
with mening B or with the Staph Aureus vaccine.
So clearly there are pressures on our Phase III spend, but we will continue to manage our overall R&D spend within
our overall guidance and our overall drive to continue to grow EPS. Thank you.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thanks, Ian. Next question, please.

Your next question is from Andrew Baum from Citi.
<Q - Andrew S. Baum>: Hi. A couple of questions, please. First, we've obviously seen increased pressure by PBMs
together with lesser price discipline from the pharma industry translating into negative pricing dynamics in prescription
diabetes spaces. I'd be interested in your view on the evolution of that into the specialty pharma segment.
And then leading on from it, and I appreciate it's a different situation, but GSK recently announced the pricing for their
GLP-1 at a 65% discount for the first in class. To what extent do you think aggressive pricing strategies like that may
work for products where it is late to market? And I guess I'm thinking partly of Xeljanz, maybe not now, but at one
point, does a pricing lever become a potential option for you?

And then secondly, building an oncology company around one drug is not easy, particularly if you've never had a
strong legacy oncology business, as I think is the case with Pfizer. To what extent do you think you can build an
oncology company without the acquisition of external talent and additional products through an M&A structure? Thank
you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Well, undoubtedly, the PBMs are doing what they are constructed to do, which is to try and
aggregate volume and achieve price discounts. This has been going on in the U.S. market for many years now and I
think will continue to occur. It really depends on the value that you bring to the marketplace, and we are focused on
that, and I think specialty products certainly normally if you define them as having close to or cures or having dramatic
impact on the outcome of disease, or be disease-modifying, have future value, and so I believe that we will continue to
see attention there, but value is rewarded, innovation is rewarded.
I really can't comment on GSK pricing.
And on how we price Xeljanz, we think it reflects both the composition of the value to the patient, the value in the
marketplace, and the most important thing in that market is, I think, is the efficacy and safety, and adoption is normally
slow and driven by clinical data rather than pure pricing decisions.
So I would see pricing as being more for acute conditions or conditions where it's highly genericized and it's not so
much a sort of long-term serious disease.
Geno, do you want to comment anything more on that on...
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Yeah, all that I would say is as I'm sure you're aware, Andrew, I mean is the pricing
reimbursement process, particularly in the United States, is very complex, very fragmented, and we're dealing with not
only prices but discounting, rebating, step edits, tiering of formulary status, and so it's not as simple as saying the price
should be higher or lower. It's really a strategic approach to the marketplace, where you first and foremost have to build
value for your product and then operate within the system that exists out there for maximum benefit.
So it's a day-in and day-out process. We think very strategically about how to price our products, how to discount our
products, how to position our products on formularies, and I think we're going to continue to need to do that.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Geno.
On oncology, I don't quite understand your comment about building it around one product. We have Xalkori in the
market, we have Inlyta in the market, Bosulif in the marketplace, we have Sutent in the marketplace, so we see palbo as
another product coming to market, and we have a very in-depth Phase II oncology portfolio. So perhaps Mikael, do you
want to just to mention a little bit about how you see the oncology portfolio developing?
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Yeah, thank you, Ian.
So on one hand, there is significant activities on expanding palbociclib into a variety of additional indications and we
have a handful of Phase I, Phase II studies exploring various segments of lung cancer including genomic defined with
collaborators, melanoma and also looking into other novel indications.
We have very exciting smoothing inhibitor that we are broadly expanding into a variety of blood cancer in ongoing
Phase II studies including AML and mild dysplastic diseases. Our gamma secretase inhibitor shows a very interesting
clinical profile distinct from what we've seen previously reported, and we're moving that into triple negative breast
cancers.
And in immuno-oncology, as you know, we are collaborating with Merck on combining 4-1BB with their PD-1, and
that study will soon start. And early next year, we plan to bring into clinical studies (1:03:29) an Oxforty [ph] antibody
followed by a PD-1. So during the later part of 2015, will have a significant onco-immunology portfolio. And then of
course we have the Phase I ongoing with a follow on to Xalkori that shows really interesting profile.
So this was just a brief overview of some of the more interesting compounds building on what Ian said, we have
breadth and depth and talent and pipeline here.

<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you for the question, Andrew.
<A - Charles Triano>: Next question, please?

Your next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from ISI Group.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hi. Thanks for fitting me in. Maybe we could just go back to some questions in the first
half of the Q&A, if you'd tolerate that. Number one, maybe for Ian. Ian, just speaking again about BD, could you
perhaps, if possible, kind of prioritize therapeutic areas for us that you're interested in? I know, I remember as recently
as last summer you had mentioned a few therapeutic areas you were most interested in. I'm just understanding what
your priorities are now. And then within that commentary, perhaps you could comment on strategically whether it
would make sense to add a significant generics component to your current business?
And then a two-part question for Mikael, if I may. Mikael, could you update us on conversations you may have had
with the regulators in the last several months around the PCSK9 class? I know that Pfizer had spoken before about how
you thought perhaps outcomes trials might be necessary prior to registration. I'm just wondering what your current
thoughts are. And then also just summarize your CAR T-cell program that you recently in-licensed and how it differs
from the programs that are a little bit ahead? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Mark. Well, on BD, clearly you want to do BD where you have potential for not only
organic growth but synergies so you'd like to look at BD where you already are strong in therapeutic areas whether it's
pain, oncology or vaccines, just to mention a few. Anything that you would utilize a primary care field force would also
be of interest to us.
And adding a significant generic component, we would look at, as you say, we look at all alternatives. If it fits, if it
makes sense, if we think we can leverage it in the emerging markets, if we see that there is organic growth we could
produce from it, we would certainly consider it. I mean we are open to a wide range of business development activities
that we believe that we can acquire at a good value for our shareholders.
Mikael, on the question of PCSK9, and then I think the CAR technologies.
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: So, Mark, thank you for the interest in R&D program. So first on PCSK9, we have a very large
clinical program that, of course, includes LDL lowering and a significant CV outcome study involving those patients
with less than 100 and patients above 100 in cholesterol, and includes primary and secondary prevention. And we think
actually it's the broadest program available which could, you know, of course bring real insight to patients, physicians
and to regulators.
We think is difficult to speculate if regulators will approve with LDL alone or wait for outcome studies. I think it
depends how other studies that are reading out will deliver on the correlation between LDL lowering in the variety of
CV patient groups through outcome, but I would underline that it's our view that what would really matter for the
uptake in the marketplace in my dialogues with Geno is very much that payers will look for outcome studies and we
think we have a premier outcome program and we think it will deliver timely to competitors.
Concerning Cellectis, it's another Pfizer entry into the different modality of onco-immunology, and I am pleased to
share with you that Cellectis is – the company uses allogenic CAR, which has the upside that is not a complex
procedure, but you could actually in a more industrialized process provide defined cellular treatments for thousands of
patients. Cellectis has a unique TALEN technology that allows them to modify and optimize those cell with a precision
that made it very attractive for us to make the deal, and it's a significant collaboration including more than 15 targets by
Pfizer.
And also, we are supporting some targets that Cellectis will develop, and we have first rights to refusal for those few
Cellectis targets. And it includes a number of technologies, such as giving the cells the best specificity such as

introducing signals that allow you to eliminate the cells, making the cells resistant to certain standard of care that the
patient may be receiving as well as enhancing the CARs by possibly knocking out molecules such as a PD-1 creating
super CARs.
So I just gave you a flavor what, I think, we and Cellectis will uniquely do in the industry and it really combines our
in-depth ability in engineering of biologicals with Cellectis genome editing.
<A - Charles Triano>: Thank you, Mikael, and operator, if we could please take our last question now.
Operator
Your final question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.
<Q - Stephen M. Scala>: Thank you very much. I have three questions. What is your level of confidence around the
August 13 ACIP vote on Prevnar 13 in adults? Would you say, for instance, that you're highly confident in the vote?
Secondly, regarding the neratinib comment earlier in the call, were you suggesting that you believe you have some
legal right to gain greater participation than just the 13% royalty?
And then thirdly, I would think you have kept a close eye on developments at AstraZeneca, maybe involving evolution
of the pipeline and I'm wondering if you would share any observations? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. AstraZeneca, I really don't want to make any comments. It's a very complicated legal
situation with the Takeover Panel. I think it's best to remain silent. Sorry for that, Steve, but I'm sure you'll understand
why.
Perhaps, Doug, you could comment on neratinib.
<A - Douglas M. Lankler>: Sure. As we indicated before, we did not see the data and believe we should have been
able to see that data, and we're in the process of reviewing our contractual rights.
<A - Ian C. Read>: I think what we're basically talking about is that we were in negotiations with them and we believe
we have contractual rights to see data that we didn't see, so we're reviewing our options.
And ACIP, Albert?
<A - Albert Bourla>: Yes, I don't want to speculate what ACIP decisions will be, but I'm very optimistic. And I think
that the policy options that they proposed were both favorable, actually commercially neutral for us because either we'll
be the only or we'll be the first vaccine that will be administered. We think that we will be involved in this meeting, we
hope it will be positive.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. When you all have a chance to meet Albert, he has a very optimistic personality. So
we appreciate that optimism.
Charles Triano
Thanks, Albert. Thanks everybody, for your attention.
