MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, and welcome to Procter & Gamble's quarter end conference call.
Today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K,
10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ
materially from these projections.
As required by Regulation G, P&G needs to make you aware that during the call, the company will make a number of
references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Management believes these measures provide investors valuable
information on the underlying growth trends of the business. Organic refers to reported results excluding the impacts of
acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, where applicable. Free cash flow represents operating cash flow
less capital expenditures. Free cash flow productivity is the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings. Any measure
described as Core refers to the equivalent GAAP measure adjusted for certain items. P&G has posted on its website,
www.pg.com a full reconciliation of non-GAAP and other financial measures.
Now, I will turn the call over to P&G's Chief Financial Officer, Jon Moeller.

Thanks and good morning.
Our January-March, results came in as we expected keeping us on track to deliver our fiscal year objectives. All in
sales were unchanged versus the prior year including a three-point head wind from foreign exchange.
Organic sales grew more than 3% in a very challenging macro-environment with significant market level events in
places like Venezuela, Argentina and the Ukraine; declining levels of market growth in both the developed and
developing world and weather-related issues in North America. Organic sales were at or above prior year levels in each
of our five reporting segments. Organic sales growth was driven by strong organic volume growth of 3%. Volume was
at or above prior year levels in each of our five reporting segments.
Pricing added one point to sales growth and mix reduced sales growth by a point. Fiscal year-to-date, we delivered
between 3% and 4% organic sales growth leaving us on track to deliver 3% to 4% organic sales growth for the fiscal
year.
March quarter all in GAAP earnings per share were $0.90, all in earnings per share include approximately $0.04 per
share of non-core restructuring charges and $0.10 per share of non-core balance sheet revaluation impacts resulting
from foreign exchange policy changes in Venezuela.
Core gross margin declined 110 basis points, cost savings of 200 basis points, pricing and volume leverage were offset
by product, category and geographic mix of 150 basis points, foreign exchange headwinds of 100 basis points and
higher commodity costs. Core SG&A improved 130 basis points driven by market inefficiencies and overhead
productivity savings. Importantly, therefore, core operating margin increased 20 basis points.
Core earnings per share grew 5% to $1.04, leaving us on track to deliver 3% to 5% core earnings per share growth for
the fiscal year. Foreign exchange was a $0.12 per share headwind for the company on the quarter. Excluding foreign
exchange, core earnings per share grew 17%. The effective tax rate on core earnings was about 20%. Tax accounted for
roughly $0.03 of earnings per share benefit on the quarter versus the prior year. We generated $3.2 billion in free cash
flow, achieving 119% free cash flow productivity and remaining on track to deliver free cash flow productivity of
about 90% for the fiscal year.
As planned, we returned $1.7 billion of cash to shareholders in dividends. We also announced a 7% increase in our
dividend. P&G has now been paying a dividend for 124 consecutive years since its incorporation in 1890. This is the
58th consecutive year the company has increased its dividend. We repurchased $1.5 billion in stock bringing
year-to-date share repurchase to $5.5 billion.
Stepping back, we're satisfied with our top line growth, particularly against the difficult macro backdrop. Constant
currency earnings progress was very strong. We're reliably converting earnings to cash and are building on our strong
track record of cash return to shareholders.
As we move forward, valued creation for consumers and share owners remains our top priority. Operating TSR is our
primary business performance measure. Operating TSR is an integrated measure of value creation at the business unit
level, requiring sales growth, margin progress and strong cash flow productivity. Operating TSR drives focus on core
brands and businesses, our leading most profitable categories and leading most profitable markets.
Our strongest brands in business unit and total company positions are in the U.S. We need to continue to ensure our
home market stays strong and growing. The actions we have taken over the past two years to restore consumer value,
expand our vertical product portfolios and horizontal regiments, and lead innovation have enabled us to restore value
creating share growth in more parts of the business. We still have a lot more work to do, and the competitive
environment is intense, which leads to choppy results on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but we're making steady progress.
We'll continue to grow and expand our business in developing markets with a focus on the categories and countries
with the largest sizes of prize and the highest likelihood of winning. This is where the world's babies will be born and
where more new households will be formed. Developing markets will continue to be a significant growth driver for our

company this year and for years to come.
We'll continue to focus the company's portfolio, allocating resources to businesses where we can create value. Over the
past six years, we've exited businesses that have accounted for over $6 billion in sales, including coffee,
pharmaceuticals, snacks, kitchen appliances, and water purification. Last quarter, we announced our exit from the
bleach business. Two weeks ago, we announced our plan to exit the pet food business.
Mars will buy our business in the Americas and several other countries. We expect to sell the European business to a
different buyer. The $2.9 billion purchase price Mars has agreed to pay for the non-European business represents a 1.8
times multiple of sales and an 18x multiple of EBITDA on an average of the past two years sales and profits for the
global pet food business.
We'll begin the process of selecting a buyer for the European business in May. Early interest in this asset is strong.
We'll continue to exit businesses where we determine that potential buyers with different capability sets can create
more value than ourselves.
Consistent with our focus on operating TSR, we're continuing to drive productivity and cost savings. We've made solid
progress over the last fiscal year and a half. We have strong productivity plans for fiscal 2014, and we're accelerating
some fiscal 2015 savings into 2014. Versus a target run rate of $1.2 billion, we're now forecasting about $1.6 billion of
cost of goods productivity savings this fiscal year across materials, logistics and manufacturing expense. Versus a
going-in target of 5%, we expect to improve manufacturing productivity by at least 6% this year. We're up more than
7% fiscal year-to-date.
At the CAGNY Conference, we announced a complete redesign of our end-to-end supply chain in North America. We
operate 35 manufacturing facilities in North America today, only 6 of which are multi-business or multi-category.
We're consolidating operations into multi-category sites located closer to the customers and consumers we serve,
allowing us to respond quickly to their needs and provide better service at the best possible cost. We're examining the
potential for similar improvements in Europe.
At the same time we're converting to common manufacturing and technology platforms for faster innovation,
qualification and expansion. We're designing supply systems to allow for more online product differentiation and
customization. We're also transforming our distribution operations, consolidating customer shipping and product
customization operations into fewer distribution centers, which are strategically located closer to key customers and
key population centers, enabling 80% of the business to be within one day of the store shelf and the shopper.
All of this will drive step change improvement in responsiveness, reducing out of stocks, taking down inventory and
lowering cost. It will leverage the scale and scope of our production and distribution network in a way we've never
done before. Savings from this transformation will accrue over three to four years, and should be in the range of $200
million to $300 million annually, which will be incremental to the $6 billion of cost of goods savings we previously
communicated. We expect additional top and bottom line benefits from improved service levels.
Turning to overhead, we've exceeded our 2014 fiscal year non-manufacturing enrollment reduction goals and have
accelerated over 1,000 role reductions originally planned for fiscal 2015 into 2014. Through March, we're down 8,000
roles, or 13%. Our stretch objective is to get substantially to our end 2015 objectives by the end of 2014. This would
put us close to or within the 16% to 22% reduction goal we've established one to two years ahead of target.
Underpinning this progress are some important and fundamental changes in our organization structure and focus.
We've organized into four industry-based sectors or global business units. The businesses in each sector are focused on
common consumer benefits and needs. They share common technologies. They partner with common customers and
common trade channels, and they face common competitors. These sectors, or global business units, are big enough for
scale and small enough to stay in touch with consumers and markets and move with the agility and flexibility to
consistently grow value.
We've made a significant clarification in roles and announced a significant de-duplication of effort between the GBUs
and the go-to-market operations. GBUs will create, design, manufacture and market our brands and products. They will

be the focus of brand building at the global, regional and local levels. Brand franchise building resources will be in the
GBUs.
We've changed the name of our go-to-market organizations from MDO to SMO, sales and market operations. This is
more than a name change. It clarifies the work SMOs need to do and the work they do best: superior, effective and
efficient selling, distribution, shelving, pricing execution and merchandising every day, every week, in every store.
Selling resources will be concentrated in the SMOs. We're aggregating the SMOs to be more logically focused on the
consumers, channels, customers and markets we serve.
We're merging Western, Central and Eastern Europe into one European organization. We're merging India, the Middle
East and Africa into one IMEA region. We're more fully integrating Greater China, ASEAN, Australia, New Zealand,
Japan and Korea into one Asia SMO region over the next year. Within the SMOs we'll aggregate countries at a higher
level, reducing the number of geographic country clusters to about 25, a 20% reduction versus today.
And back in the GBUs, we're moving from four desegregated brand-building functions – design, consumer and market
understanding, communications and marketing – into one integrated brand building or brand management organization.
We've embedded resources that are required to win in the GBUs and SMOs, reducing the size of the standalone support
functions, flowing those resources to work and outsourcing more of their activities.
The changes I just described are significant. They will reduce interfaces and transaction costs, clarify who is
accountable for what, deduplicate effort and simplify operations. These changes will enable us to operate with more
agility and speed, to operate with clearer accountability and effectiveness, and to operate at a lower cost. They will also
enable further enrollment reduction.
Moving next to marketing expense, we continue to drive marketing effectiveness and productivity through an
optimized media mix with more digital, mobile, search and social presence, improved message clarity and greater
non-advertising marketing efficiency. We expect marketing spending to come in below prior year levels due to
productivity improvements in non-working marketing and advertising costs. Importantly, the overall effectiveness and
the consumer impact of our advertising spending will be well ahead of the prior year.
While acknowledging the progress I've just described across costs of goods, overhead and marketing, you may be
asking yourself, where have all the savings gone? This year, a disproportionate number of them have gone to offset FX.
We have leading positions in some of the markets where currencies have softened the most: Japan, Venezuela, the
Ukraine, Russia and Turkey. As I mentioned earlier, January-to-March earnings per share would be 17% ahead of a
year ago on a constant currency basis. Year-to-date, constant currency core earnings per share is up 11%.
Partially as a result of devaluation, we're seeing significant wage inflation in developing markets, which we also need
to offset. And, we're making targeted investments in innovation and in selling coverage to drive growth. The majority
of the offset, though, has been FX, which hopefully will annualize and will be partially offset by pricing. As more
savings come online and we see several more years of significant opportunity, we will get a greater percent re-invested
in growth or brought to the bottom line. We're committed to make productivity a core strength and a sustainable
competitive advantage.
We're equally committed to maintaining innovation leadership in our industry. Innovation and productivity are the two
most powerful and sustainable ways we can drive value creation for consumers and shareholders. The IRI Pacesetter
results for calendar year 2013 demonstrate our commitment to leading innovation. P&G launched seven of the top ten
non-food U.S. consumer product innovations in 2013, with Tide PODS topping the list. In addition, six P&G
innovations were included in their list of rising stars.
Innovation is creating value and building cumulative advantage in the fabric and home care sector. Our breakthrough in
proprietary three-chamber unit dose laundry technology, launched as Tide PODS, Ariel PODS and Gain Flings, has
reset the delightful consumer usage experience, product performance and convenience bar. Unit dose detergents are
currently available in over 20 markets around the world and have generated well over $1 billion in retail sales. The
recent launch, Gain Flings, has gone extremely well, reaching nearly a 3% value share in the U.S. laundry category in
just two months.

Unit dose now represents 11% of category sales, of which we have an 80% share. The balance of the fabric care
innovation bundle that we launched in North America in February is also off to a good start. In-store execution of Tide
Simply Clean & Fresh has gone very well. Total Tide share was up more than half a point over the past three-month
period an indication that so far, Tide Simply Clean & Fresh is attracting incremental users to the brand. Improved
scents and new sizes of Downy Unstoppables and Gain Fireworks in-wash scent beads have helped accelerate growth
in this new product segment.
The broad range of Baby Care innovations launched in the U.S. last fall continue to deliver excellent results. Nearly
every diaper across all sizes and price tiers was improved to deliver better absorbency, comfort or design. Overall P&G
U.S. Baby Care share was up 2 points with share growing in 90% of retail customers. This has led to our largest market
share in the past 20 years, enabling us to retake market leadership from Kimberly-Clark. The extension of the
Swaddlers form into sizes 4 and 5 has been particularly successful. Swaddlers share is up 3 points to a 10% value share
of the U.S. diaper category.
At the CAGNY conference in February, we announced we would be launching two new innovations in blades and
razors. The first was the launch of Gillette Body, which is going well. The second and more significant innovation will
be announced next Tuesday, April 29th. Men have told us they prefer the new innovation two-to-one versus the
best-selling razor in the world. More information will be coming to you soon on how you can watch the unveiling of
our newest male shaving system.
Product innovations like the one I just described, laundry, baby care and grooming are critical to driving strong,
sustainable, top-line momentum and delivering superior consumer value. We're also working to improve execution and
operating discipline. We're seeing this improvement play out in the supply chain and the execution of innovation
launches in stores and in the effectiveness and efficiency of our marketing programs.
We're performing better, but there's still more to do. Operating discipline and execution have always been and must
continue to be a core capability for Procter & Gamble.
We believe that the focus we bring to the four areas: operating TSR, productivity, innovation, operational excellence,
along with targeted re-investment, will enable us to continue to improve results even as we work to address several
remaining opportunities. We remain on track to deliver our 2014 guidance, top line, bottom line, and cash. We're
maintaining our organic sales growth range of 3% to 4%.
Foreign exchange is expected to be a sales growth headwind of 2 to 3 points which leads to all-in sales growth of
approximately 1% for the fiscal year. We're maintaining our forecast for bottom line core earnings per share growth of
3% to 5%, offsetting stronger headwinds from foreign exchange and softer market growth rates with productivity
savings.
We currently expect foreign exchange to be roughly a 9-point headwind to core earnings per share growth. As a result,
our guidelines translates to constant currency core earnings per share growth in the range of 12% to 14%.
Recall that with the planned sale of the pet care business, we're restating pet care earnings from continuing operations
to discontinued operations. This will reduce core earnings per share by approximately $0.03 and $0.04 per share for
fiscal years 2013 and 2014 respectively. All-in earnings share per growth remains the same.
We've included a table in the press release this morning which provides an estimate of the quarterly restatements.
Please pay attention to this when you adjust your models as the impacts vary across quarters.
On an all-in GAAP basis, we now expect earnings per share to grow approximately 1% to 4%.This range reflects the
non-core impacts from foreign exchange policy changes in Venezuela, approximately $0.15 of non-core restructuring
costs in fiscal year 2014 and the restatement of pet care earnings into discontinued operations of both the current and
prior fiscal years.
The fourth quarter earnings growth that's implied within our guidance is driven by a combination of operating growth
driven by productivity savings and devaluation related pricing, a lower tax rate of about 21% on core earnings, and

$0.03 to $0.04 of small brand divestiture gains. We expect to deliver another year of about 90% free cash flow
productivity. Our plans assume capital spending in the range of 4% to 5% of sales, and share repurchase of about $6
billion.
In addition to the assumptions included in our guidance, we want to continue to be very transparent about some key
items that are not included. The guidance we're reconfirming today is based on last week's FX spot rates. Further
currency weakness is not anticipated within our guidance range. We continue to monitor unrest in several markets, the
Middle East, for example, and Ukraine. Venezuelan price controls, access to dollars for imported products and
devaluation present risks, as do import restrictions and price controls in Argentina. Finally, our guidance assumes no
further degradation in market growth rates.
Our year-to-date results are in line with what we expected to deliver, putting us on track to deliver our goals for the
fiscal year and make progress towards our long-term objectives. We continue to operate in a volatile environment with
uncertainty in foreign exchange, deceleration in market growth rates, and a rapidly developing policy environment.
Against this backdrop we've maintained a top line growth and improved constant currency operating earnings growth.
We launched a strong round of innovation in the third quarter and have significant new innovation coming in the fourth
quarter, which will be complemented by further savings from productivity. We're making targeted investments in our
core business, most promising developing markets and biggest innovation opportunities, and are aggressively driving
productivity and cost savings. Above all, we remain focused on value creation for consumers and for our shareholders.
That concludes our prepared remarks. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our press release and
will be available in slides, which will be posted on our website, www.pg.com following the call. I'd be happy now to
take any questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Yes, thank you. Good morning. Jon, as we look at the cost saves strictly on the gross margin
line, they're not really flowing through at this point. Obviously, some of that is the big transactional impact, but you've
also got this very big mix impact, which is really offsetting a lot of the work you're doing there. How should we think
about that over the next couple of years, and is this going to continue to be a massive drag or should it dissipate as you
get more local manufacturing in place, and just give us a little bit of an update there. Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: So there are two things, as you rightly pointed out, John, and as we talked about in prepared
remarks, that are offsetting the cost savings on the gross margin line, and one is FX, which is significant. Hopefully that
annualizes, and as I mentioned, we're committed to price where legally allowed to help mitigate that effect as well. So
hopefully that portion of the dynamic dampens going forward.
The other dynamic, as you rightly point out, is a mix dynamic, which has two components. One is – two primary
components. One is a category component, and in the quarter we just completed, we had a great quarter of growth, both
volume and sales, in our fabric and home care segment, which is very profitable overall, but which does have lower
gross margins than the balance of the business. By contrast, we had relatively soft quarters in our healthcare business
and our grooming business, which are higher gross margin. I look at that as one quarter's impact. I don't think that that
sustains itself going forward. Some quarters it will be positive, some quarters it will be negative.
The second component of that is a geographic component made up, as you well know, by faster growth in developing
markets, which have a lower gross margin. That impact will continue to exist. I don't see a scenario in the near term
where developed markets grow faster than developing markets. We will make progress on the margin in developing
markets as manufacturing is localized, as we build scale, but it will continue to be a component of drag.

Do I think we can get to a place where this mix dynamic is only partially offsetting cost savings such that we're
growing gross margin? Absolutely, and I expect that absent another big foreign exchange event, that would characterize
the future.

Your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Good morning, Dara.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: I was hoping you could discuss the sustainability of the gap between organic sales growth
of 3% to 4% this year and the local FX core EPS growth of 12% to 14%, particularly with the negative geographic
gross margin mix impact. Do you think that gap is sustainable as you look out to next year and longer term?
And then just on a related note – I know you're not going to obviously give guidance on EPS next year, but given as a
company you've had some difficulty hitting the initial EPS targets over the last few years, I'm just wondering if
conceptually, there you might need to bake in conservatism as you set guidance going forward, particularly given the
world seems more volatile and there obviously have been a lot of external issues that have pressured results and could
going forward, and If that's part of your thought process as you look to next year's guidance.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Thanks, Dara. In terms of the spread between organic sales growth and constant currency
earnings per share growth, if we're successful in delivering basically the $2 billion of savings per year that are implied
in our $10 billion five-year goal, that by itself is 11 points of earnings per share benefit. So you add that to 3% to 4%
organic sales growth, and you're in the ballpark of the spread that we're talking about for this fiscal year. We have no
intention of letting up on our cost savings and productivity effort, and see several years of significant savings ahead of
us.
So I think that that relationship is representative of the work that's going on. How much of it actually gets to the all-in
bottom line numbers will be a function of FX and also a function of some degree of re-investment as good
opportunities present themselves.
In terms of philosophy on guidance, you know, obviously we haven't spent a lot of time focusing on next year yet. In
general, what we're going to try to continue to do is be incredibly transparent or as transparent as we can.
So if you look at the year that we just went through, the one reduction in guidance we made midway through the year
was due to currency in Venezuela. The way we handled that in the initial forecast of the year was by communicating
that we didn't have anything assumed in the numbers. We didn't know when or what the devaluation was going to be.
You know, we wanted to provide full transparency so that you and others could, in essence, use your own
understanding and knowledge to come to an informed point of view of what you thought the result was going to be.
So at minimum, we will continue to be very transparent, tell you what's in, tell you what's not in. And generally, you
know, we like making our goals, we don't like not making them, and that will be reflected in our approach as well.

Your next question comes from the line of Wendy Nicholson with Citi Research. Please proceed.
<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Hi. Could you talk a little bit more about the comment that marketing efficiencies helped
sort of generate all that SG&A leverage? How much of that was a shift from advertising to promotion? How much of
that is just part of A.G.'s long-term, "Hey, we want to lower advertising by 100 basis points?" And, is there a risk that,
you know, in some of these categories, given how competitive the market is, is there is a risk you're under investing or
maybe just comment on all of that. Thanks.

<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Sure, Wendy. So the SG&A offset to gross margin, which resulted in operating margin
accretion, is driven by both overhead productivity and marketing effectiveness and efficiency improvements. Within
marketing effectiveness and efficiency, a significant portion of that is a reduction in non-working dollars, tighter
operations, if you will, in the design and creation of marketing programs.
Another big portion of it is the work I mentioned to get – to more effectively target consumers through new capabilities
that are available, to use new forms of media and consumer engagement, to generate more effective communication as
well as more efficient communication with our targeted consumers.
So it's really all of that. As I tried to say in the prepared remarks, we are very focused on ensuring that the overall
impact of our advertising program, the number of consumers that we're reaching, the quality of that interaction grows,
does not decline. I think there's – you know, we're at a point where simply looking at dollars is just not representative
of the strength of a marketing program and a rapidly changing marketing landscape.
We do – to your question of, you know, under investing, that is something that we look at very carefully. There have
been some categories this year where we've reduced spending as the year's gone on, and there's been some categories
where we've increased spending as the year has gone on. We're not going to underinvest, but we are going to be
effective and efficient in our investment.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
<Q - William G. Schmitz>: Great. Thank you. Good morning, everybody. So, a couple questions. First one is can you
just break down the growth in emerging markets versus developed markets? Then, I know we rarely talk about, but can
you talk a little about family care? I think they're your second and third largest businesses in the U.S., and clearly, that's
slowed quite a bit and I know you cited some competitive promotional activity, but maybe the outlook for that business
and how you respond to it because it is, obviously, a decent chunk of the U.S. business. Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: First of all, the breakdown between developing and developed, developing in the quarter was
plus 5, developed was plus 1, leaving you with a total of plus 3.
In terms of Family Care, you rightly pointed to the issue, Bill, which is heightened competitive activity that's reflected
in the amount of promotion that's going on in the category, primarily driven by Georgia-Pacific. You know, I'm not at
liberty to talk about future actions that we might take, but I will assure you that that's a category that we intend to be
competitive in and will be.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Ferrara with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
<Q - Chris Ferrara>: Hey, thanks. Just first real quick, Jon, I think you mentioned that there were gains coming in in
the fourth quarter – I think you said 3 to 4 points. I just wanted to confirm that. But the real question is, look,
obviously, you faced a ton of headwinds this year, and when you talk about productivity you guys are using the term
"Pull forward" of savings. You brought fiscal 2015 savings into 2014. You're almost at your 16% to 22% target on
non-manufacturing roles. Can you talk about what that leaves for 2015. What do you need to sustain that pace of
productivity? Do you need some of the supply chain stuff to start to come through? Or do you still see incremental
runway from the sort of blocking and tackling savings that you're doing already? Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: First, on the small brand divestiture gains in the fourth quarter, those should be between $0.03
and $0.04. Those are things we've talked about before, which is primarily the closure on the bleach sale, which we
announced at CAGNY. That isn't a certain event. We're going to have to wait to see how the regulators proceed. I think
it is certain event in terms of it eventually happening, but the timing of it is uncertain. But, that's what's assumed in

those numbers that I gave you.
In terms of productivity going forward, as I mentioned, we see several more years of significant productivity
opportunity. I wouldn't take the acceleration of savings into last year or this year as an indication of reduced savings
potential next year or the following year. I can assure you that as our leadership team discusses this topic, that's not the
mindset that we have. So I would expect similar levels of savings for the foreseeable future.

Your next question comes from the line of Olivia Tong with Bank of America. Please proceed.
<Q - Olivia Tong>: Great. Thank you. Appreciate it. First, is it possible to parse out the impact of mix from a country
perspective versus a category perspective, considering that you think the country will continue to be the case as
developing grows faster than developed versus the category which may ebb and flow over time? And then, can you also
update us on the percentage of market share that you're holding or gaining in overall and also for the U.S.? Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: In terms of the components of mix, it's about half and half, Olivia, between the two drivers that
you cited. And, of course, that varies quarter-on-quarter, but think of it as roughly 50/50.
I'm drawing a blank – oh, the market share question. Sorry. We're about flat on the quarter. The market is growing
about 3%. That dynamic is true on an aggregate basis both globally and in the U.S.

Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
<Q - Nik H. Modi>: Yeah, thank you very much. Just a quick clarification, Jon. The organizational design changes
that you talked about, is that a function and output of what Jorge Uribe was working on, and if there's any more work to
do in that area?
And then, the actual bigger picture question is, can you just give us an update on the OTC business? It seems like a
scalable business where P&G can win with their brands. Any appetite for M&A? I know there are a lot of assets out
there that potentially could get unlocked for purchase. So, just wanted to get your philosophical viewpoint on that.
Thank you.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Sure, Nik. First as it relates to organization design, some of the changes that I talked about are
very much a product of the work that Jorge Uribe and others have been leading. Most of that is just being put in place
now or in the summer. I fully expect that as that happens, not only are operations going to improve because of reduced
duplication and increased clarity of accountability, but I expect that we'll identify additional opportunities from those
new ways of operating. That's very much what we saw when we set up the sector organizations a year ago. We had an
estimate for savings that could be possible, but as we got into it, it became clear that there were additional savings
possible. So this is, again, something we're going to keep grinding away at day after day, week after week, and create
an organization that's not only more efficient but is more effective, that has a broader range of job responsibilities and
is a funner, easier place to work.

of the mix element on gross margin that should dissipate, can you give us a sense of kind of over what timeframe you
think that will happen, given all the investments you are making to grow the categories, but also, frankly, on the
geographic piece as well of opening your plants, et cetera, like the one in Brazil?

But, the second thing is, you mentioned in the release – let me just find it. It says in the beauty section it says, "Sales
have declined in salon and skin care, primarily in Asia." So does that mean you are getting better skin care stability in
the U.S.?
And then, sorry, the last question is, I want to understand better the grooming negative 4% mix that we saw in the
quarter. Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Okay, let me first – and I apologize, Nik, I breezed by the second part of your question. Let me
go back to that first and then come back, Ali, to you. If I continue my trend this morning of forgetting the second parts
of questions, you can remind what they were.
Nik, in terms of OTC, it is a space that we like. It's certainly demographically advantaged. It's an area that we feel we
have strength in within select product treatment areas. And as we've said for several years, it is a place that we would
consider adding to our business, both organically. Clearly the Teva joint venture has enabled us to accelerate our
progress internationally quite significantly. We added the New Chapter asset recently, so it is a space that we'll
continue to look for opportunities in. But, we're also going to be choiceful and value-driven as we pursue and evaluate
those opportunities.
Ali, on the glide path for mix, the developing/developed split is so much informed by foreign exchange. There is a
constant FX cost differential. I would say, I think we've talked before, that's probably a three to five-year glide path. It's
not overnight, but we'll get there, just as we have in China, just as we have in Russia, just as we have in Saudi and
places that we have been operating for longer periods of time. How much of that actually gets to the bottom line is
going to be a function of FX, which is why I hesitate to say, definitively, it's going to be x period of time.
The second piece on skin care, we had a reasonably good quarter on both U.S. skin care, which was up mid-single
digits, and on U.S. Pantene, which was also up mid-single digits. We continue to have opportunity in Asia. And I
wouldn't say that we've necessarily fully rounded the corner on either U.S. skin care or U.S. Pantene, but certainly are
making significant progress.
And then on Gillette mix, a large part of that is geographic. As you're probably well aware, we have some category
growth challenges in the U.S., so the size of that market is down. That's the most profitable piece of the business. And
that's something as category leaders we're responsible for managing and we're actively doing that.
We certainly like the position that we start from in that task. We have 70% market share of the most profitable
segment. Huge levels of consumer loyalty. Very high, especially relative to other participants in the category, net
promoter scores. We offer really a significant value to consumers. A man can use Gillette Fusion ProGlide for the cost
of about a dollar a week, and for that he gets uncompromised quality from a brand that's spent over a century
developing the best shaving products for men.
You know, we have significant innovation coming to market in the shave care space as well, which should help both
market growth and mix going forward. We have launched the body product that we talked about at CAGNY, and on the
29th of April we'll be revealing the next major innovation for Gillette. While I can't give details of that today, all of that
will be revealed on the 29th. I can tell you what men are telling us, which is that they prefer this product 2:1 versus the
world's best-selling razor currently. We're active in terms of managing the category challenge in the U.S. and are
excited about some of the innovations that we're bringing to bear to do that.

<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Well, China continues to be a very attractive market. We've grown that business 50% over the
last three years, and quarter-to-quarter there can be some chop, but it continues to be a very attractive market for us.
Market growth, in general, in developing markets has slowed by 1 to 2 points over the last six months, and that's what
explains most of the slowdown that I mentioned in our developing market business. Fiscal year-to-date we're high
singles, call it 7%, and so the 5% is 2 points lower than that.
If you look at share as a measure of whether we're holding or losing ground, we built share in Brazil by more than half
a point. We've built share now there for 22 consecutive quarters. We built share in India where we've grown
double-digits now for 47 consecutive quarters. We built a modest amount of share in Russia. China, frankly, is very
hard to read shares at the moment. There's a significant channel shift that's occurring, for instance, to e-commerce
where we're doing very well from a share point, but which Nielsen doesn't measure. We have wholesalers that are
shifting from Nielsen-measured retailers as their source of volume to non-Nielsen measured distributors.
So it's a bit complex. But, again, it's a business we feel good about. We've got good innovation coming to market there.
We just launched a premium diaper, which in its early days has done extremely well, taking market leadership in three
out of the four major e-commerce platforms for diapers in China in its early entry period.
So as I said in our prepared remarks, I expect developing markets will continue to be a disproportionate source of
growth across the board for many years to come.

Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Hey, good morning, folks. Thanks for the question. Two questions. First, a small
housekeeping item. Can you give us a sense of what sort of gains you expect on the pet care business once it's sold, just
as we think about modeling into next year?
And then, back to my other question. I want to go back to the organizational changes that you talked about in the
prepared remarks and a little bit and Q&A. I get the cost efficiency benefit of reducing role redundancy in emerging
countries into fewer SMO clusters, but I was hoping you could help me on your agility comment. How does further
centralization of decision-making in an already heavily centralized organization make you more agile? And as you
move forward with this, how do you ensure that local execution doesn't falter? Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Good question. First, relative to the gains. If you go back to the press release we issued when
we announced the sale, we said we expected very little impact, positive or negative, from a one-time gain standpoint
from the sale of the pet business. John can give you more specifics there later today. Generally, it shouldn't be a major
impact.
In terms of the organization question, I think there's a couple things that we can do a better job explaining. One is that
there seems to be a notion that when we talk about global business units, that by definition, moving work into global
business units centralizes that work and moves it to a global level. I understand completely why one would have that
conclusion, because when we describe it, that's just what it sounds like.
But, that's not what happens. So we have GBU resources at a global level, at a regional level, at a local level. We have
brand managers at a global level, at a regional level, at a local level for each of our major product line-ups. So, what
we're trying to do is just clarify that the work of brand building belongs with those people, locally, regionally and
globally. It shouldn't be done by other organizations in addition to those resources. We need those resources focusing
on one of the most strategic things we do, which is sell and build joint value creation with our customers.
You can imagine if you have two different organizations working on the same thing, from an internal standpoint, how
that can create a lot of complexity. If you're in an executional role in the organizations, it's hard to know what to
execute when you're getting multiple sources of direction. So clarifying this, deduplicating it should have both, I think,
cost opportunities associated with it, as well as enabling us to be more agile, be clearer, be more decisive, be quicker in

terms of the action that we take. To date, in the last roughly two years, we've reduced the number of overhead roles by
8,000 people. We've done that without significant business disruption, without significant organization disruption. That

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS. Please proceed.
<Q - Steve R. Powers>: Hi, Jon. Good morning. I guess regarding your North American and potential Western
European supply chain restructuring programs, do you have any estimates for the cost, whether cash or non-cash
associated with those programs in the $200 million to $300 million savings you mentioned? How should we expect
them to flow over the three to four-year life of the program? Will they be non-core charges, elevated CapEx? Will they
show up in other areas, et cetera?
That's my main question. If I can tag on one more, which is really the taxes. I think the quarter and your guidance for
next quarter imply kind of a tax rate for the year in the 21% to 22% range, if my math is right. I just wanted to get your
update on whether you think that rate is sustainable going forward and what the risks are in either direction to the more
normalized tax rate as we look ahead. Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: On supply chain, there will be costs, there will be capital. Those will be significant, though
obviously, we wouldn't do this if we weren't earning a significant return on those. We'll try to detail those for you at
some level when we provide guidance for next year.
As I mentioned earlier, we're still working through, we're in the exploratory process of this in Europe. We'd like to
come to you with a total package, which we will do as we provide our guidance for the year. Now, within that, though,
capital spending I don't see going – I see it staying in kind of the 4% to 5% range as we execute this program.
We will continue working very hard on working capital reduction as an offset to this. We've been able to do that
successfully in the last three or four years with our whole build-out program in developing markets, really maintaining
our free cash flow productivity targets despite somewhat higher capital spending. That's certainly the objective going
forward. So I wouldn't consider it net a major change to the cash profile of the company. There will be some costs to
execute it. Some of those will be non-core, some of those will be core, and we'll provide more context with guidance.
Tax rate on the year, based on everything we know today, should be 21%. We still have a quarter to go, so that can
change, but that's what we're seeing currently. This is going to continue to be a bit lumpy as we go forward. You're
going to see quarters where it's going to be lower than that. You're going to see quarters where it's going to be higher
than that. That's a function of geographic mix, as you can appreciate. It's also a function of the timing of audits and
reserve establishments and reserve reversals, et cetera. We try to provide disclosure on the big chunks of that within our
financial disclosures and our statements.
In terms of what are the major drivers that could affect tax rate going forward, clearly, again, geographic mix can affect
it. That should be generally a net positive as we go forward. Assuming that developing markets continue to grow faster
than developed markets, and there are lower tax rates in developing markets. The other change, of course, that is
unknowable and can affect us either positively or negatively is our policy developments, both in the U.S. and overseas.
What I'll say, though, is in general, there seems to be a lot of competitiveness on the part of governments to maintain
business-friendly status in a slowly-growing economy. So I think it would be somewhat unlikely that there would be a
major adverse event that would affect our tax rate significantly, but, of course, that's completely unknowable.

<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: Good morning. I just had a question for clarification on the supply chain savings. I
think you were talking about $200 million a year. Could you say if that is only for North America, and when you would
expect it to start?
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: The $200 million to $300 million range I gave you, which is a very rough range at this point, is
inclusive of our early thinking on Europe. So it's North America and Europe.
We will start seeing some of those savings next year, particularly the distribution-related savings as we consolidate
distribution and customization centers into fewer distribution centers located closer to customers. That's a relatively
smaller portion of the overall savings, which will accrue – the major savings will start accruing three and four years
from now.
So it's something that we're changing our footprint so dramatically that we want to do it in a very disciplined, organized
way to avoid business disruption. The savings will be significant, but they're not immediate.

Your next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research. Please proceed.
<Q - Javier Escalante>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I would like to come back to the emerging market
negative mix issue.
Basically, if you can help us, Jon, kind of like at least have an average emerging market gross margin and operating
margin figure, and also more philosophically, you have over $30 billion in sales in emerging markets, which is – this is
much bigger than most of your competitors combined. Essentially, you have lower profitability.
And then the question is, is it because you are leading with the wrong categories? Leading with categories that have
low margins as opposed to leading with categories like beauty or healthcare and essentially you are kind of like
doubling down in the negative mix by leading with the legacy businesses, which is detergents and paper as opposed to
the high-value businesses, beauty, health care, and grooming? Thank you.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Thanks, Javier. We'll give you some better kind of gross and operating margin breakdowns
relative to company average for developing markets as part of our guidance for next year. The reason I'm not giving
that to you right now is because it's all changing as we put in pricing for FX et cetera and I'd like to get to a more stable
situation so I can give you something that's actually useful. But I understand the need, and we can provide something
that hopefully will help there.
In terms of our developing market business profitability, it's really a tale of two cities. In markets where we have been
for extended periods of time, where we've developed the scale to justify localization of the supply chain, where we've
built local organizations and where we've developed significant relationships with our retail partners, we have very
good margins, in many cases at the company average, and in some cases above the company average.
So I mentioned markets before like Russia, like China, like Saudi. There are a number of examples. Take China as an
example. That's not only our second largest market in terms of sales, it's our second largest market in terms of profit. So
obviously, it's a very profitable situation there. I think that is more what needs to occur than altering the mix of product
categories in the markets where we're earlier on in our journey like Brazil and like India.
We need to get the cost structure. We need to get consumer usage of premium products. Which is happening – it
happened in China, it clearly happened in Russia. It's happening right now in Brazil, a little bit less so in India. But
those are the kinds of things that will enable us to get margins to a place that I'm very confident we'll get to, which is
somewhere close to – somewhere close, a little bit below the company average.
Your point, though, on other categories is an important one. I mentioned earlier that we are really through the joint
venture with Teva for the first time building out our healthcare business, which is very high margin, across the globe
including developing markets. We've talked before about the Vicks expansion in Russia and Eastern Europe. We have

Your next question comes from the line of Joe Altobello with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.
<Q - Joe N. Altobello>: Thanks. Good morning, Jon. I guess the first question is in terms of the innovation strategy
and how you're seeing it right now, given that we've seen you go down market recently with Tide and also up market it
sounds like in blade razors, will the emphasis still be on moving up market going forward and staying true to what has
been a very successful trade-up strategy for you guys, or given the environment, do you think the innovation going
forward will be a little bit more balanced between mid-tier and premium price points?
Then secondly, in terms of the outlook for next year, I know it's very early, so I'm not going to ask for guidance here.
But given that you're going to be anniversarying the FX headwinds and given that the manufacturing startup costs are
behind you, what do you see as the biggest headwinds for you guys in fiscal 2015? Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: In terms of innovation, we will continue to pursue a balanced innovation strategy. You know, if
you just think about the laundry bundle in North America now, it has lower-priced components designed for consumers
for whom price is a bigger part of their personal value equation. It also has premium items. We generated more new
sales on Gain Flings than we did on Tide Simply Clean & Fresh in the last quarter.
Our innovation decisions are going to be guided by consumers, their needs and wants. It's less about price point than it
is about value for a particular consumer. Value, as you know, is a combination of pricing and product efficacy and
consumer experience, our communication of that experience, et cetera. So we're going to continue to be focused on
consumers with whom we can create value and to whom we can provide value.
Relative to headwinds going forward, I think one of the biggest headwinds is market growth, both in developing and
developed markets. The good news is we have a say in that and we can create growth with innovation by trading in
consumers in many markets, trading consumers up in other markets. But that is challenging in a 3% growth world, and
that's just a reality that we're going to have to adapt to. It is part and parcel of the combined productivity and innovation
strategy. Those are the two things that are required to win in a slower growth environment and the two things we're
committed to deliver.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust. Please proceed.
<Q - William B. Chappell>: Thanks for the question. Just want to go back to the divestiture of the pet business. I think
if we go back a few years with the divestiture of the coffee business, the plan was to take the proceeds and reinvest in
actually restructuring and try to offset some of the dilution. And this divestiture, there's just for general corporate
purposes. I'm just trying to understand at what point – $2.9 billion, $5 billion, I mean, is there a philosophy change in
terms of maybe reinvesting some of this money back into the business or reinvesting it into share repurchases or kind of
a thought? Because this doesn't seem to be one of the smaller divestitures you've done over the past few years.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: A couple things here. First of all, the $2.9 billion becomes $2 billion once we pay Uncle Sam.
So that's the amount of cash that we're looking at at this point, and really that's cash that we'll earn next fiscal year
when the deal is likely to close. Buyers have a nasty habit of not paying you until they have certainty on ownership of
the asset. So, we'll build that cash into our planning for next fiscal year, and we'll be very clear with you how we're
intending to use that.
Relative to the Folgers situation, there are two things that are different with regard to restructuring. The first is that
Folgers was much more dilutive than pet is going to be. So the need was greater from that standpoint. Second, at the

time that we announced Folgers, we didn't have a non-core restructuring program. So we chose to increase restructuring
to accommodate that objective. We have a fairly robust restructuring program right now. We're not capped or limited.
If there's more opportunity to generate return and create value, by all means we will.
But again, this is a next-year cash flow, and we'll get back to you with the use of that cash as we describe plans for next
fiscal year.

Your next question comes from the line of Alice Longley with Buckingham Research. Please proceed.
<Q - Alice B. Longley>: Hi, good morning. I have just a couple leftover housekeeping questions. Your 1% organic
growth in the developed region, can you break that out in terms of volume, price and mix?
My other question is when you give us your EPS growth adjusted for currency, could you explain more what you take
out to get to that number? Do you take out the pricing that you're getting in emerging regions as an offset to currency?
Do you take off all the cost benefits, the local cost benefits you're getting as a result of currency as well? Thank you.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Developed market organic sales breakdown, we had 2% volume growth in developed markets,
a minus 1 point price mix dynamic getting you to 1% organic sales growth, so that's the breakdown there.
The currency numbers do not include pricing. They do include the total transaction impact on the cost structure so if
there are local cost benefits, that's in the currency number. We just take our currency exposures on the rate of change,
and that's the number we're providing.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Astrachan with Stifel. Please proceed.
<Q - Mark S. Astrachan>: Thanks and good morning. Wanted to clarify a couple of things, on the North America
beauty business, is there any benefit from restocking from destocking a year ago, six months ago?
Then from the slowdown in developing markets, any commentary there about whether the categories or a category
specific has become more promotional as a result of the slowdown?
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: I think the beauty organic sales numbers are representative of the state of the business. I don't
think they include any one time – significant one time impacts of any sort, so I think you should look at them as decent
numbers.
Relative to promotion levels, we are seeing increased promotion in North America in a few categories. We talked
earlier about the family care category where we have seen some increased promotion. We've seen increased promotion,
not surprisingly, in response to our laundry innovation launches in North America. We've seen increased promotion
relative to – in response to our innovation in the hair care space. But we look at those generally as temporary in nature,
and, you know, it's not – as I said many times before, promotion is not high on our list of strategic choices to grow
business. So it's certainly not a dynamic we're going to be encouraging. If you look at price mix inclusive of promotion,
for the last quarter it was a positive impact on a global basis. It's been a neutral-to-positive impact for 13 consecutive
quarters. It's been a positive impact for the last nine years.
So we're going to try to compete on the basis of innovation, make sure the base price of our product is as sharp as it can
be as a result of our productivity efforts. We will need to be competitive on promotion levels, but it's not a dynamic that
we're going to drive.

Your next question comes from the line of Jon Andersen with William Blair. Please proceed.
<Q - Jon R. Andersen>: Good morning, Jon. You mentioned a significant shift to e-commerce in I think referring to
China that you're seeing, but I guess, I suspect you're seeing a similar shift in perhaps developed markets as well. You
know, should we think about this as a net positive for P&G and manufacturers in terms of kind of reach, your ability to
target consumers, even profitability? If you could just discuss maybe that opportunity and any plans you have to
capitalize on that channel shift over time.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: We want to be available for consumers wherever they want to shop, and that includes the
e-commerce space.
Jon, you mentioned some very attractive aspects of that space. One is the ability to target – to more narrowly target
consumers, more effectively target consumers and that's certainly relevant. There's also an opportunity to provide
sometimes some more information as e-, in general, becomes what we're calling the zero moment of truth, and
sometimes it's the zero and first moment of truth. In general, e-commerce shoppers represent a more attractive
demographic. We're seeing larger basket sizes in some of the e-commerce channels than in bricks and mortar. Not
always, but in some cases.
We're working very hard to ensure that our share of both sales and profits is at least as good as is the case in more
traditional retail channels. And that currently is the case. This is a channel that's been evolving fast and will continue to
change significantly in the next three to five years. It's something that we need to and intend to be a significant part of.

Your final question comes from the line of Caroline Levy with CLSA. Please Proceed.
<Q - Caroline S. Levy>: Good morning, Jon. It's on margins. I'm just looking at the EBIT margin expansion in beauty
and grooming. I'm wondering if going forward you believe you'll be able to sustain that, or if you actually see some
pickup in margins in the other divisions?
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Well, I think sustaining 17% earnings growth, which is what you see in the beauty segment in
the last quarter, is not an objective we would have. We're happy with that growth. We want, over time, to achieve more
balance between that top line and bottom line while still delivering a very strong bottom line. The bigger margin
improvement opportunity comes as we do three things.
One, get the higher margin categories growing at their rate of category growth, and that includes beauty. Two, improve
our margins in developing markets as we've talked about with several of you this morning. Third is continue focusing
on growth behind innovation in developed markets where we have higher margins. All three are very much a part of
our thought process and activity system presently.
