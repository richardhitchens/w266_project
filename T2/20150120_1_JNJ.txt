Instructions]
I would now like to turn the conference call over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.
Louise Mehrotra
Good morning and welcome. I'm Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson, and it
is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2014. Joining me on
the call today are Alex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer; and Dominic Caruso,
Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer.
A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the
Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. I'll begin by briefly reviewing fourth
quarter and full year results for the corporation and for our three business segments. Following my remarks, Alex will
comment on the 2014 results and provide a strategic outlook for the company. Then Dominic will provide some
additional commentary on the business and review the income statement and provide guidance for 2015. We will then
open the call to your questions.
We expect the call to last approximately 90 minutes. Included with the press release that was issued earlier this
morning is the schedule of sales for key products/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are
available on the Johnson & Johnson website as is the press release.

Please note we will be using a presentation to complement today's commentary. The presentation is also available on
our website. Before we begin, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or may be
considered forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2013 and the company's subsequent filings
identify certain factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any
forward-looking statements made today.
The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future
events or developments. Our SEC filings including the 10-K are available through the company and on our website.
During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business
performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for and should be read
together with GAAP results.
Tables reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the schedules
accompanying the press release and on the Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. A number of
the products and compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed
from other companies. This slide lists acknowledgment of those relationships not otherwise referenced in today's
presentations.
Now, I would like to review our results for the fourth quarter of 2014. Worldwide sales to customers were $18.3 billion
for the fourth quarter of 2014, down 0.6% versus the fourth quarter of 2013. On an operational basis, sales were up
3.9% and currency had a negative impact of 4.5%. In the U.S., sales were up 7.4%. In regions outside the U.S., our
operational growth was 1.2%, while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by
7.9%.
On an operational basis, the Western Hemisphere excluding the U.S. grew 3.9%, while both the Asia Pacific and Africa
region and Europe grew 0.6%. The success of new product launches and continued growth of key products in all
regions was partially offset by divestitures, the most significant one being Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics. Excluding the
net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational growth was 6.7% worldwide, 10.7% in the U.S. and
3.6% outside the U.S.
Turning now to earnings, net earnings were $2.5 billion and earnings per share were $0.89 versus $1.23 a year ago. As
referenced in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2014 fourth quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude a
charge of $1.1 billion for after tax special items. Fourth quarter 2013 net earnings were adjusted to exclude a net charge
of $42 million for after tax special items. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks.
Excluding special items for both periods, net earnings for the current quarter were $3.6 billion and diluted earnings per
share were $1.27, representing increases of 1.4% and 2.4% respectively as compared to the same period in 2013.
Now turning to the financial highlights for the full year of 2014. Consolidated sales to customers for the year of 2014
were $74.3 billion, an increase of 4.2% as compared to the same period a year ago. On an annual basis, sales grew
6.1% operationally and currency had a negative impact of 1.9%.
Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational growth was approximately 8%
worldwide, 11.6% in the U.S., and 5.1% outside the U.S.
Turning now to earnings, 2014 annual net earnings were $16.3 billion and earnings per share were $5.70. For the year,
2014 adjusted net earnings were $17.1 billion and adjusted earnings per share were $5.97, up 7.7% and 8.2%
respectively versus the 2013 results. Free cash flow for the year was strong at $14.7 billion, up $900 million versus
2013.
Turning now to business segment highlights, please note percentages quoted represent operational sales change in
comparison to the fourth quarter of 2013 unless otherwise stated and therefore exclude the currency translation impact.
I'll begin with the Consumer segment.

Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $3.6 billion increased 0.9% with U.S. sales up 2.5%, while outside the U.S.
sales grew 0.1%. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures, underlying operational growth was 2.1%
worldwide, 4.9% in the U.S., and 0.7% outside the U.S. Growth was driven by OTC worldwide, US skin care, as well
as oral care and women's health outside the U.S. This growth was partially offset by lower sales of baby care and skin
care outside the US due to competitive pressures and prior year inventory stocking.
OTC sales growth was driven by analgesics and upper respiratory products. Upper respiratory grew 8% worldwide,
driven by sales growth outside the U.S. Analgesic growth was 16% with growth in the U.S. of 24%, driven by share
gains as well as trade inventory build related to the relaunch of products. In the U.S., adult analgesic market share was
11%, up from approximately 9.5% a year ago, while U.S. pediatric share was nearly 42%, up from 34% a year ago.
New product launches and successful marketing campaigns drove the results for NEUTROGENA and AVEENO in
U.S. skin care, as well as LISTERINE in oral care and women's health products outside the U.S.
Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment, worldwide sales of $8 billion increased 13.9% with U.S. sales up 22.7%
and sales outside the U.S. up 5.8%, driven by strong sales of new products as well as core growth products. A major
driver was our hepatitis C product OLYSIO.
Excluding sales of hepatitis C products, OLYSIO and INCIVO, underlying growth worldwide, U.S. and outside U.S.
was approximately 11%, 16%, and 7% respectively. Other significant contributors to growth were immunology
products, STELARA and SIMPONI, SIMPONI ARIA, as well as XARELTO, INVOKANA, ZYTIGA, INVEGA
SUSTENNA or XEPLION and recently launched IMBRUVICA.
Net revenue recorded for IMBRUVICA in the fourth quarter was $92 million worldwide, with $64 million in the U.S.
On a full year basis, net revenue was $200 million worldwide, with $144 million in the U.S.
The results for immunology were driven by strong double-digit market growth, complemented by increased market
share for STELARA and combined SIMPONI, SIMPONI ARIA. U.S. export sales of REMICADE were down due to
timing of shipments to our distribution partners.
XARELTO sales were up 58% and total prescription share or TRx for the quarter in the U.S. anticoagulant market
grew to 15%, up approximately 0.5 point from last quarter and up over 4.5 points from a year ago. Cardiology TRx
estimated at 23.5% was up over 4.5 points from a year ago.
INVOKANA/INVOKAMET sales were approximately $200 million in the quarter with over $190 million in the U.S.,
contributing approximately 3.5% to the U.S. pharmaceutical growth rate. In the U.S., INVOKANA/INVOKAMET
achieved 4.1% TRx within the defined market of Type 2 diabetes excluding insulin and metformin, up from 3.3% in the
third quarter of 2014.
TRx with endocrinologists grew to 10% for the quarter, up approximately 1% sequentially.
INVOKANA/INVOKAMET was the category leader in new-to-brand share with endocrinologists reaching over 19%
at the end of the quarter.
Strong growth of the combined metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer market at over 15% drove the results for
ZYTIGA in the U.S. ZYTIGA share was approximately 31% of that market, down approximately two points on a
sequential basis due to increased competition. Continued strong market uptake and additional country launches drove
the strong results outside the U.S. ZYTIGA is approved in more than 95 countries. INVEGA SUSTENNA or
XEPLION achieved strong results in all regions due primarily to increased market share.
I'll now review the Medical Devices segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices segment sales of $6.6 billion
decreased 4.7%. U.S. sales declined 7.7%, while sales outside the U.S. declined 2.3%.
Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics was divested mid-year 2014. Excluding the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures,
underlying operational growth was 1.5% at worldwide, with the U.S. down 1% and growth of 3.5% outside the U.S.
Growth was driven by orthopedics and cardiovascular care products, partially offset by lower sales in vision care.
Competitive pricing dynamics negatively impacted growth for vision care in the U.S. This was partially offset by

growth outside the U.S. with strong results in emerging markets.
Orthopedic sales growth was driven by sports medicine, hips, spine and knees. The successful launch of MONOVISC
coupled with the continued strong growth for ORTHOVISC drove results for sports medicine. Hip growth of 5%
worldwide was driven by strong volume growth partially offset by continued pricing pressure. Primary stem platform
sales were a major contributor to the results.
Spine grew 3% with solid market volume growth and new product launches partially offset by continued pricing
pressure. Knees worldwide increased 3% due to the successful launch of ATTUNE, with pricing pressure offset by
positive mix. Cardiovascular growth was driven by a 16% worldwide increase in our Biosense Webster business due to
strong sales of the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH catheter.
That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's fourth quarter of 2014. For your reference, there were
some notable developments in the fourth quarter, which we have summarized on this slide to assist as you develop your
models.
Lastly, to assist you in updating your models for the full year 2014, on our website, you will find annual sales
highlights by segment, as well as adjusted earnings before tax by segment.
It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to Alex Gorsky. Alex?
Alex Gorsky
Thank you, Louise, and good morning to everyone who's joined the call today. I'm really pleased to be reviewing with
you the highlights of our very strong 2014 results, and to preview our plans for 2015 and beyond. But before I get to
that, I'd like to start, as I often do, with just a word on Our Credo.
This remarkable document was written 71 years ago by the son of our founder, and Johnson & Johnson has long been
guided by its principles. And what I can tell you is that this philosophy, this ethos, is alive and well in our organization.
There's a six-foot version of it etched in glass and positioned directly in front of my desk. It's something we pay a lot of
attention to, and it challenges our entire company to ensure that we're working with the interests of our key
stakeholders in mind: consumers, caregivers and patients, our employees, the global communities in which we live and
work, and of course, our shareholders.
And as we enter 2015, the business of Johnson & Johnson is very strong, and we're well positioned for the long-term.
We delivered 31 consecutive years of adjusted earnings increases and 52 consecutive years of dividend increases for
our shareholders. We're one of just three companies to be triple-A rated by all three major credit agencies, which
continues to afford us many benefits in the financial markets. Our products are industry and segment leading, with 70%
of sales coming from the number one or number two market share position, and 25% of our sales coming from products
we've launched in the past five years. And we reward the shareholders by returning about 70% of our free cash flow
over the past decade, which amounts to about $90 billion.
As most of you know, Johnson & Johnson is built around three core businesses, and as the chart on the left of the slide
shows, our Pharmaceutical segment generated over $32 billion in sales last year, followed by Medical Devices at $27.5
billion and $14.5 billion in Consumer to round it out. We're the largest pharmaceutical company in the United States
and the fastest-growing company among the top 10 globally. We're also the market leader in Medical Devices, which
includes surgery, orthopedics, and consumer medical devices like vision care and diabetes. And we're a market-leading
consumer products healthcare company as well.
And so looking back on 2014, here's a slide I presented last January that delineated our commitments for the year, and
I'm proud to say that we've achieved our near-term priorities and exceeded our financial targets with full year
operational sales growth of 6.1%. We successfully restored a reliable supply of the over-the-counter medicines to the
shelf in the United States, and saw strong growth in our pediatric analgesics.

In DePuy Synthes, which showed 3% operational growth over the prior year led by the trauma, hips and knee
businesses, we've begun to realize the benefits of the scale and breadth of the combined businesses, which have
contributed to strategic wins in key markets. And by any measure, we've built on the already strong momentum in our
Pharmaceuticals business, driven by the strength of key products including OLYSIO, XARELTO, ZYTIGA,
INVOKANA, and IMBRUVICA. Later, I'll cover the progress we've made against our long-term growth drivers,
particularly in the area of innovation.
To set context for our businesses going forward, there are a few points I'd like to make about the dynamics shaping the
global healthcare environment. First is the rising cost of healthcare, which by 2020 is expected to account for 21% of
the GDP in the United States, nearly 11% in the European Union, and 6% in China. And as I travel around the world,
it's clear that providing sustainable high-quality healthcare is one of our society's greatest challenges. It's at the
forefront of many discussions I have with our associates, government leaders, physicians, hospital administrators, and
executives of our peer companies. As the world's largest healthcare company, we're working to assume a leading role in
the solutions, which must be centered on the patient and improving outcomes.
Next, expanding access is an important macro trend impacting how we and others think about the future of the
business. Healthcare reform efforts and improving economies are clearly helping more people access affordable quality
care, which will certainly help in the fight against cancer, obesity, and heart disease. And here in the U.S., we've seen
healthcare utilization rates increase for the second quarter in a row, both sequentially and versus the prior year, and we
estimate that we will continue seeing similar to slightly higher growth rates when all of the fourth quarter numbers are
reported.
Managing those dynamics, demand innovation, and new models are driving considerable health industry consolidation
at the health system level, as well as in the med tech, pharmaceutical, and biotech sectors, where the M&A activity is
back to peak levels last observed before 2009.
The good news is that governments are increasingly recognizing the need to continue to address healthcare needs, and
are taking steps to reward innovation through FDA and EMEA designations that are helping to speed product review
times.
And in thinking about all of these dynamics in the marketplace, today I will cover three themes about Johnson &
Johnson that are driving our confidence in the future. First, the core businesses of Johnson & Johnson are strong and
positioned to continue expanding their market leadership positions. Next, we have an exciting and deep product
pipeline across the entire enterprise. And we're changing the way we interact with our customers and evolving our
structure to be more effective and efficient to drive growth.
Now I'm also a firm believer that in order to achieve our goals as a company, it's important to establish a clear set of
priorities for the entire organization. Three years ago, when I first assumed this role, we were very focused on
excellence in execution. And given the progress we made to date, we're evolving our approach, placing an even greater
emphasis on innovation and accelerating growth with continued excellence in execution as a non-negotiable part of the
process. So without compromise, we're focused on delivering on our financial and quality commitments.
In Pharmaceuticals, we'll continue building out our launch excellence and robust pipeline. In Medical Devices, the
emphasis is on growth acceleration from innovation and also by transforming our go-to-market models that better
reflect the reality that purchasing decisions are increasingly being made at the healthcare system level as they look to
improve the quality of care they provide patients while controlling costs. And in Consumer, we're expanding our
market leadership in key segments within the over-the-counter medicines, oral care, baby, and beauty markets.
Let me take you through the thinking of how we will meet these priorities in each one of our businesses. Let's start first
with our Pharmaceutical business. I've got to tell you I could not be prouder of this organization. About six years ago,
we lost $8.5 billion of sales to patent expiry, and this was out of about a $24 billion portfolio in our Pharmaceutical
business. A lot of companies have chosen different strategies. But what we said is, first of all, we want to be very
focused on innovation and on developing differentiated products that will ultimately help fulfill unmet medical needs.

We focused on five therapeutic areas, recognizing that we can't be everything to everybody. And we've also said we
want to go where the best science is and to have a mix of internal and external innovation while being completely
agnostic about the source. And the results really speak for themselves, with 14 new products launched since 2009,
driving cumulative sales of over $27 billion. Six of these products have already crossed the $1 billion threshold. With
this, we are the industry leader in terms of research and development productivity and NMEs per dollar spent compared
to the benchmark.
And the story is not over. In 2014, we had 20 new line extensions approved and we filed an additional 20. We also
started 23 Phase 3 trials and initiated 11 Phase 2 trials. And as currently constituted, our pipeline is poised to yield 10
potential new product filings between 2013 and 2017.
Next, our Medical Devices business is in a very strong leadership position, particularly in orthopedics,
electrophysiology, surgery, and vision care, where there's a lot of innovation advancing the standard of care. Many of
our platforms are overwhelming market leaders in their categories, and 85% of our sales are from platforms with a
number one or number two position. We have 10 different platforms in this business that have exceeded $1 billion in
sales, which is quite remarkable when you think about it.
And we're growing very well in emerging markets and are capitalizing on the scale, depth, and breadth of the portfolio
we can offer to governments, large healthcare systems, and large payers around the world to add value and help
patients. And we grew sales in China by nearly 15% on an operational basis last year. We've launched over 50 major
new products since 2012 and have more than 30 new filings pending as of the end of the year. So again, this is a very
strong business that's well positioned for the future.
And our Consumer brands, these are the ones that most people know us by. As you can see, we're guided by
insight-driven innovation and have taken a very focused approach to meeting key consumer need states, led by our 12
mega brands. And while the McNeil U.S. OTC business continues to operate under a consent decree, they're on track
with all of their commitments. And a consistent supply of these products are returning to the market.
I'm incredibly proud of the work that the team has done. And based upon recent market share trends that show
consumption is growing at four times the market, with particular strength behind Children's TYLENOL and Children's
MOTRIN, the new strategies we've implemented within the organization are really paying off.
Now the work that I just described is leveraging the full strength of our enterprise, the product portfolios, the expertise
of our research, medical and epidemiological teams, and our commercial organizations. Looking longer term, our
strategy for driving growth should be very familiar to all of you by now, and I'll use the balance of my time taking you
through some of the elements behind it.
So let's start with innovation because in the end, without innovation, we just can't be successful. That's ultimately how
we're going to help more patients and consumers, and we invested $8.5 billion in R&D last year across our segments to
keep us at the forefront.
Our approach can be viewed in these four ways. As I said earlier, we want to ensure we have the right mix of internally
and externally sourced science and products, and we've built new innovation models. We're also focusing on greater
cross-segment collaboration to innovate and focused operationally on building market-leading capabilities that enable
us to achieve the highest quality and efficiency standards possible across the world.
And the good news is it's working. We've had about an 8% CAGR over the last 20 years, and we've invested almost
$200 billion in innovation over that span. About $109 billion of that has been internal and about $85 billion has been
external, so a pretty fair mix. With that external spend, we've done over 120 deals, and well over 100 of those are under
$1 billion.
Of course, the larger ones make up more of the value, but what this graph shows is that you've got to have those
singles, doubles, and triples, as well as the larger home run type deals to be successful over the long term. And that's
helped us build a portfolio with 24 brands and platforms that generate over $1 billion in sales a piece.

As an example, our team has done a great job of this in the oncology space. The partnerships we have built since 2008
have helped us grow from a $1 billion franchise to over $4.5 billion today. And we have earned four breakthrough
designations in this portfolio, demonstrating our ability to identify and develop products that can revolutionize the care
of cancer patients. And we're doubling down on our efforts to ensure we continue accessing new ideas and products at
their earliest stages.
Building on the legacy of entrepreneurship that the Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation established since its
inception by investing over $1 billion in startup companies, the team made an additional 43 investments worth nearly
$200 million just last year. Our new innovation centers, which are in four innovation hubs across the world, have made
over 200 alliances in the past two years. And in our four no-strings-attached incubators at Janssen Labs, we're giving
small startups places to work and access to instrumentation.
I had an opportunity to visit our facility in South San Francisco just last week and met with one of our teams that we're
working with, who says it could have taken them eight years and $300 million to do what we're enabling them to do in
just a couple of years for significantly less, in an environment where they're building a foundation for strong
partnerships for themselves, and frankly, with us as well.
As technologies are advancing, we're seeing more and more opportunities for cross-segment collaborations, bringing
together the scientific, regulatory, clinical, and commercial expertise from across Johnson & Johnson to improve care.
Examples include our EVARREST Fibrin Patch, which has demonstrated an ability to control problematic surgical
bleeding that goes well beyond the current standard of care.
Stem cell therapy for adult macular degeneration is another area that we're very excited about. We think it offers a great
complement to our existing Vision Care platform.
Also, while I was in China for the APEC Economic Leaders' Summit in November, I announced plans to optimize our
expertise in oncology to help the Chinese government fight lung cancer. It's estimated that by 2025, there will be 1
million cases of lung cancer. And while China has 20% of the world's population, they've got about 30% of the cases.
So we're in the process of establishing a China lung cancer center, which will adopt an integrated medical approach to
transforming the disease we hope ultimately into a preventable and curable one by taking a unique local approach
where we have R&D, medical device, pharmaceutical, and consumer experts all working together to bring forth new
and very comprehensive solutions.
This is also a good illustration of the versatility of the types of enterprise-wide solutions we can uniquely offer as
Johnson & Johnson, and we're already in talks with governments and other nations to develop similar models to help
them attack diseases that are rapidly spreading through their nations.
Now, we realize that in order to implement programs like these on such a large scale, we must change the way we work
as a company. For many years, Johnson & Johnson has been extremely decentralized and we think that accountability
and responsibility is something that we don't want to lose or compromise. But we also realize that operating a $75
billion global company is different than operating a much smaller one and then making sure we've got the right
standards and systems in place in areas such as quality, supply chain, and finance is essential.
So we put in a very ambitious agenda to strike the right balance in our organization. And as I stated last year, we're
aiming to take $1 billion out of our P&L over the next three years and believe that we'll be an even stronger
organization.
So all of our commitments to innovate have helped us establish a very strong pipeline for Johnson & Johnson. As you
can see in our Pharmaceutical business, we have a deep pipeline that, as I said earlier, we're expecting to yield 10 major
filings and 25 line extensions between 2013 and 2017. One of them is esketamine, a potential breakthrough medication
for treatment resistant depression, as well as daratumumab, which is being developed for multiple myeloma. They both
have breakthrough designations from the FDA.
We're also excited by ARN-509, a next generation treatment for prostate cancer, as well as guselkumab for psoriasis
and sirukumab, which is for rheumatoid arthritis. And just yesterday, we announced that the FDA has granted priority

review of our NDA supporting the three-month formulation of paliperidone palmitate for the treatment of adults with
schizophrenia. If approved, it will be the first and only long-acting atypical anti-psychotic that can be dosed just four
times a year adding an unprecedented treatment option to help address the needs of these patients. We'll keep you
apprised of these programs as their development progresses.
Innovation is also deep in Medical Devices, where we expect 30 major filings between 2014 and 2016 including the
ECHELON FLEX powered vascular stapler and our TFN-ADVANCED proximal femoral nailing system in trauma,
which we launched this year. We're also innovating medical devices for consumers like the new Calibra three-day
wearable insulin patch, as well as with our new brand of ACUVUE for use in the beauty and astigmatism and
presbyopic segments.
In our Consumer business, we have 20 key product launches planned for this year including NEUTROGENA hydro
boost and LISTERINE HEALTHY WHITE. Innovation though is not just about new products. It's also about new ways
of managing. More and more what I'm hearing from hospital CEOs or from healthcare administrators around the globe
is that they want to work with Johnson & Johnson on a less-fragmented basis. So we're implementing different
approaches.
To take on healthcare in the future, we need to take a much more holistic approach and build more holistic partnerships
and we're making it easier for health systems to do businesses with us through customer-focused team leaders that can
represent an enterprise view.
Again, when you think about the depth and the breadth that we have from orthopedics to surgery to the pharmaceutical
group, our ability not only to contract, but to fundamentally partner, price, and work collaboratively in a different
construct, it offers us a unique and exciting opportunity to be part of the solution in healthcare, as it continues to change
around the globe.
We also have a very strong global footprint and 53% of our total sales last year were made outside the United States,
with about 21% in the fast moving emerging markets around the world where we see stronger growth rates than what
we're seeing in developed markets. While these markets always represent a certain challenge or a certain risk, we've
been operating in them for many years and we believe that taking a long-term view is the right way for us, not only in
terms of expanding our presence, but also in the way we conduct research and development and the way we embed
elements of our supply chain in all areas of our business, which is an important strength for us overall and which is
helping us to drive us to this level of success.
Now, while we've talked a lot about ways in which we're building our portfolio, we also think it's important to make
sure that we're being thoughtful about where we're going to participate and where we're not going to participate. Again,
you've seen some decisions that we made around areas such as drug-eluting stents, ortho clinical diagnostics, selective
pharmaceutical and consumer brands.
Our approach is to focus on being number one or number two in a particular area, as well as on those businesses or
product areas that we feel have a path to achieving leadership or that will be directly complementary with one of our
businesses. Now, if a business or product doesn't meet at least one of those criteria for us, it may be that it's better
served in someone else's hands.
To be clear, these can be very good businesses with a lot of opportunity such as the U.S. NUCYNTA pain brand we
just announced plans to divest or Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics. The point is that moves like these give us a chance to
rejuvenate our portfolio and to focus on those programs that we know are ultimately going to help more patients and
grow our business.
One other topic I'd like to talk about before I close regards our efforts around Ebola. Now, in addition to the privilege
of working in healthcare, we have a real responsibility to lead with purpose and to help the global community in times
of crisis. Our work to expedite development of an Ebola vaccine is a great representation of our ability to mobilize and
focus our resources in a really short period of time to help meet the needs of patients. And because every day counts,
we've committed to substantially accelerate the production of our vaccine regimen through unprecedented
collaborations among the global health community.

Our goal is to bring this vaccine to families and front line healthcare professionals as fast as possible. We started our
Phase I clinical trials and have produced more than 400,000 regimens for use in large-scale clinical trials. As I started
this talk, I showed you a slide from my presentation last January outlining what we expected to accomplish in 2014. So
we'll remain focused on our near-term priorities and continue to advance our longer-term growth drivers, and I look
forward to reporting on our progress next January when we review our 2015 accomplishments.
As I close, I just want to emphasize why I'm so confident in our business and our growth potential. First, our core
businesses are strong and positioned to continue expanding their leadership positions. We have an exciting and deep
product pipeline across the entire enterprise. And we're changing the way we interact with our customers and evolving
our structure to be more effective and efficient to drive growth.
Finally, I'm privileged to work with some of the greatest people in the world, and I believe that with the progress we've
made, a shared commitment to Our Credo, and resolve in pursuit of our aspiration to help billions of people live longer,
healthier, happier lives, we're extremely well-positioned for the future.
Thank you. And it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to our CFO, Dominic Caruso.
Dominic J. Caruso
Thank you, Alex, and good morning, everyone. It's a great pleasure to report on our excellent 2014 performance, which
was driven by the many successes that Alex previously discussed, as well as to provide guidance for you to consider as
you update your models for 2015. Now, let's review some highlights of our full year and fourth quarter financial
performance.
Turning to the next slide, you can see our condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the full year of 2014. At the
beginning of 2014, we provided an outlook of our expected financial performance for the year and we saw continued
improvement in our results throughout the year. That growth was driven by strong sales results, particularly in our
Pharmaceutical business, and also good expense management across the enterprise. And so we ended 2014 with
full-year sales growth of 4.2% with operational sales growth of 6.1%, which exceeded our initial guidance of 4% to
5%.
Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, our operational sales growth was a strong 8% for the year. While
we did benefit from a significant level of sales of our hepatitis C products, excluding both of these factors, our
operational sales growth for 2014 was approximately 5%. I'm also pleased to report that our pre-tax operating margin
for 2014, excluding the impact of special items, improved by 190 basis points, with more than half of that coming from
sales of OLYSIO. Finally, our net income margin excluding special items improved to 23%.
Turning to the next slide, you can see our condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the fourth quarter of 2014.
While our total sales change of negative 0.6% reflects the negative impact of currency movements, we were pleased to
report operational sales growth of 3.9% which, as Louise discussed earlier, was driven in part by the continued uptake
of our recently launched Pharmaceutical products. Excluding the impact of hepatitis C products and acquisitions and
divestitures, operational sales growth was 5.6% for the quarter.
Now let's take a few moments to talk about certain items on the statement of earnings for the quarter. I'm pleased to
point out that we saw very good operating performance. Cost of goods sold was 40 basis points lower than the same
period last year, primarily due to our product mix and cost improvement actions, partly offset by currency impacts.
Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were down as compared to the fourth quarter of 2013 as favorable mix
of the business was partially offset by investments made in all areas of our business.
Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was up compared to the prior year as we continue to
make important investments for future growth and we closed a number of exciting licensing deals in the fourth quarter.
Overall, our pre-tax operating margin excluding special items decreased 60 basis points in the fourth quarter as
compared to the prior year due to the timing of these investments during the fourth quarter. Interest expense net of

interest income of approximately $122 million was slightly higher than the prior year.
Other income net of other expenses was $963 million of expense in the quarter compared to $868 million of expense in
the same period last year. Excluding the special items that are included in this line item, other income net of other
expenses showed a net gain of approximately $103 million for the quarter versus net expense of approximately $47
million in the prior year.
In the quarter, the effective tax rate excluding special items was 8% compared to 8.9% in the fourth quarter of 2013.
And for the year, excluding special items, the tax rate was 19.3% compared to 17.2% for 2013. This was primarily due
to the geographic mix of the results in each of the periods. This effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2014 includes
the Federal R&D tax credit for all of 2014, which we had anticipated would be passed by Congress and in fact was late
in 2014. This was included in our guidance but not yet in our reported results. Therefore the entire full-year credit is
now reflected in the results for the quarter.
Now turning to the box section at the bottom of the slide, during the fourth quarter we recorded several special items
that netted to an approximate $1.1 billion charge on an after-tax basis and consisted primarily of the following items:
increased litigation accruals, cost associated with the Synthes acquisition, which is consistent with what we expected
would be incurred as special items throughout 2014 and which we expect to continue through the middle of 2015 as
that integration activity wraps up; and some charges for in-process research and development.
Together these special items negatively impacted our fourth quarter results by $0.38 per share. Excluding these special
items, our adjusted earnings per share were $1.27 for the fourth quarter, which exceeded the mean of the analyst
estimates as published by First Call despite the increased currency headwinds in the quarter, which I will discuss later.
Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2015. I'd like to start by first
providing some context, which we believe is important to consider regarding our guidance for 2015. First, as a
reminder, as we discussed last year, that although we took the opportunity to invest in the business with the increase in
profitability from OLYSIO sales, our earnings in 2014 did benefit by approximately $0.20 per share even after those
investments.
Also as we did throughout 2014, we will provide a review of our sales growth excluding the impact of hepatitis C as
well as acquisitions and divestitures, which as you know are both important when considering the underlying base
business performance. Additionally, currency headwinds have increased quite substantially since we last spoke with
you in October of 2014, negatively impacting both sales and earnings and our guidance for 2015 to a greater extent
than we had anticipated.
We noted that some of you have updated your models for currency but many of you had not yet, and even those that
have updated for currency have not yet reflected a negative impact that current rates could have if they were to remain
at recent levels for all of 2015. And finally we have decided to exclude amortization of intangibles from our adjusted
earnings guidance consistent with the majority of our competitors and which I will discuss in more detail shortly.
Before I discuss sales and earnings, I'll give you some guidance on items we know are difficult for you to forecast
beginning with cash and interest income and expense. At the end of the year, we had approximately $14.3 billion of net
cash, which consists of approximately $33.1 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $18.8 billion
of debt. For purposes of your models and assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you
consider modeling net interest expense of between $450 million and $550 million.
Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as
gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our Development Corporation, divestitures, asset
sales and write-offs. We would be comfortable with your models for 2015 reflecting net other income and expense
excluding special items as a gain ranging from approximately $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, which includes the
anticipated gain from the divestiture of our U.S. rights to the NUCYNTA pain medicine.
As announced last week, we anticipate this transaction to close in the second quarter. This is a higher level of other
income than some of you may have modeled and higher than the prior year level. And we expect to use this increase in

other income to compensate for lower level of income from OLYSIO, which we expect in 2015 as compared to what
we had in 2014, allowing for continued investments in our core business primarily in research and development.
Now a word on taxes. Our guidance for 2015 anticipates that the R&D tax credit will also be renewed by Congress for
2015 although that has still not yet happened. We would therefore be comfortable with your models reflecting an
effective tax rate for 2015 excluding special items of approximately 20% to 21%. If the R&D tax credit is not
approved, it will negatively impact the tax rate by approximately 0.5% for 2015.
Now turning to sales and earnings. Our sales and earnings guidance for 2015 takes into account several assumptions
and key factors that I would like to highlight, which may not be fully reflected in your models. For sales, our
assumption for PROCRIT is that there will not be biosimilar competition in 2015. We also do not anticipate generic
competition this year for RISPERDAL CONSTA or INVEGA SUSTENNA. We are, however, expecting a generic
entrant for INVEGA in the first half of 2015 as well as biosimilar competition for REMICADE in Europe in early 2015
and have included the expected impact in our sales guidance.
As we've done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis reflecting our results
from operations. This is the way we manage our business and we believe this provides a good understanding of the
underlying performance of our business. We will also provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2015, with
the impact that current exchange rates could have on the translation of those results.
We would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase on a constant currency basis of
between 1% and 2% for the year. This would result in sales for 2015 on a constant currency basis of approximately $75
billion to $76 billion. Additionally, by way of comparison to how we described our results in 2014, our operational
sales growth for 2015, excluding the impact of all acquisitions and divestitures as well as the impact of hepatitis C
would be approximately 6%, a higher level of growth than the comparable 5% for 2014, which we noted earlier.
Throughout the latter part of 2014, the euro like many other currencies weakened significantly versus the dollar and as
of last week was lower by approximately 11% as compared to 2014 average levels. As you know, the dollar has
strengthened recently versus virtually all major currencies. We are not predicting the impact of currency movements,
but to give you an idea of the potential impact on sales, if currency exchange rates were to remain where they were as
of last week for the balance of the year then our sales growth rate would decrease by nearly 5.5%, reflecting the recent
weakening of the euro and other major currencies against the U.S. dollar. Thus under this scenario, we would expect
reported sales to reflect the change in the range between negative 3.5% and negative 4.5% for a total expected level of
reported sales between approximately $71 billion and $72 billion.
Now turning to earnings, consistent with the reporting practices by the majority of our competitors, beginning in 2015,
we will exclude intangible amortization expense in addition to special items when providing our adjusted earnings
guidance and actual results. The impact of the amortization of intangible assets that we are projecting is approximately
$1.3 billion on a pre-tax basis representing approximately $0.32 per share on an after-tax basis for 2015 compared to
$0.42 per share in 2014. The amount for 2014 includes the acceleration of the amortization expense on certain
intangible assets, which we don't anticipate for 2015 at this time.
To assist you in comparing our guidance to your models and to our prior year results, I will first describe our adjusted
earnings guidance excluding special items as we have done in the past, then I will update that guidance to also exclude
the impact of amortization of intangibles. A significant factor impacting our earnings guidance for 2015 is the impact
of currency movements on transactions, which although hedged is still somewhat negative incrementally versus the
prior year. We expect transaction currency impacts to be negative to our gross profit by approximately 50 basis points
to 70 basis points in 2015 as compared to 2014. I will, of course, discuss the translation impact of currency on EPS in a
few minutes.
Consistent with our prior-year presentation of adjusted EPS excluding special items, we would be comfortable with
adjusted EPS excluding special items ranging between $6.22 and $6.37 per share on a constant currency basis, up
approximately 4.2% to 6.7% compared to a constant currency sales growth rate of 1% to 2%. Now excluding the
impact of amortization of intangibles in addition to excluding special items, we would be comfortable with adjusted

EPS guidance in the range between $6.54 and $6.69 per share on a constant currency basis reflecting an operational or
constant currency growth rate of 2.3% to 4.7%. Again, we are not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to
give you an idea of the potential impact on EPS if currency exchange rates for all of 2015 were to remain where they
were as of last week, then our reported EPS excluding intangible amortization expense and special items would be
negatively impacted by approximately $0.42 per share, a much higher negative impact than we provided back in
October of $0.15 to $0.20 per share due to the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar during the past several
months.
Therefore, our reported adjusted EPS guidance excluding the impact of intangible amortization expense and special
items would be in a range between $6.12 and $6.27 per share, reflecting the significant headwind of currency on EPS if
exchange rates were to stay where they are now for all of 2015. At this early stage in the year, we would be
comfortable with your models reflecting the midpoint of this range.
So in summary, as you update your models for the guidance I just provided and reflecting on the context I shared with
you earlier, I would like to make a few key points. Although operational sales growth is expected to range between 1%
and 2%, we are pleased to note that when excluding the impact of hepatitis C and acquisitions and divestitures, our
operational sales growth at the midpoint of our guidance would be 6% for 2015 as compared to 5% for 2014.
We expect that the higher level of other income in our guidance for 2015 will replace the lower level of income from
OLYSIO in 2015 as compared to 2014, allowing for continued investment in the business, particularly in research and
development as we continue to build our pipeline. The negative impact of currency exchange rates in 2015 as compared
to 2014 will be much more significant to both sales and earnings than many of you have modeled. And we expect that
this additional negative currency impact to be more significant in the first half of the year as compared to the second
half of the year.
On a constant currency basis, our operational EPS growth in our guidance is expected to range between 2.3% and
4.7%. And finally going forward, as we noted today, we will be reporting our adjusting earnings per share to exclude
intangible amortization expense as well as special items, consistent with the majority of our competitors.
So in closing, we're very pleased with our strong results for 2014, and we have the financial strength and breadth to
execute on our near-term priorities and to continue to deliver solid results while also continuing to invest for long-term
growth. And I look forward to updating you on our progress throughout the year.
Thank you. Now I'd like to turn things back to Louise for the Q&A portion of the program. Louise?

<A - Alex Gorsky>: Sure, Larry. Thanks a lot for the question. Larry, consistent with our strategy, we're always
looking for opportunities frankly that help us better fulfill unmet medical need. And so if we start with our
Pharmaceutical, Larry, I think over the past several years we've done a really nice job of identifying compounds early
on in development, things like ZYTIGA, things like ibrutinib, bringing them in, putting them through a very rapid and
extensive clinical development program, and then of course having successful launches. And we've experienced 14 new
product launches since 2009. So we think in the Pharmaceutical area, that kind of approach to sourcing new technology
and new compounds is definitely a successful one.
If we look to our Medical Devices, of course our big focus over the past several years has been making sure that we are
making the most of the significant investment that we made in Synthes. And I think we made a lot of headway I
outlined during my presentation. And in fact, I think we were one of the first companies to really look hard at spaces
like orthopedics and recognize that consolidation was very likely to occur. And so we were able to do that in a way
where we feel we got a very good portfolio fit. And as we've managed through that transition over the past several
years, we feel that we're in a very good position now, particularly as many of our competitors are just starting to go
through some of those consolidation initiatives.
But even in this space, we continue to look for new options, new innovations. There is number of spaces. We've
identified areas such as orthopedics, such as surgical, such as vision care in particular to be significant priorities for us,
and we continue to look in those spaces.
If we look to consumer, our top priority over the last several years frankly has been on remediating our
over-the-counter brands, particularly here in the United States. And I really commend the team for the great work
they've done. The McNeil Group has basically completed the major steps, the consent decree, so they're on a very good
path. They are relaunching brands. You see it in our results for the quarter. But here too we continue to look for ways to
innovate, continue to look for ways to add scale and expand in the appropriate way. And of course, while we're doing
that we're also making sure that we're being very disciplined and decisive about businesses that we're choosing not to
participate in. And I think we made a number of moves over the last several years that also has allowed us to continue
to invest, but has also been healthy for the shareholders at the same time.
<Q - Lawrence Biegelsen>: That's very helpful. And then, Alex, I know this may seem like an overly simplistic
question. But over the past 15 years, J&J's Pharma business has gone through three roughly five-year cycles, with the
first five being strong, followed by a deceleration due to patent expirations, followed by another five strong years or so.
And when one looks at the Pharma business, one can't help but see increasing competition to key products like
ZYTIGA and STELARA as well as the biosimilar competition that you highlighted on the call, which will slow your
overall Pharma growth. So my question is how confident are you that you can break those five-year cycles we've seen
over the past 15 years and why. Thanks.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Larry, thanks for that question as well. Look, I'm very proud of our Pharmaceutical business and
frankly the work that they've done over the past five or six years to address, as you highlighted, the significant patent
expiry challenge that we experienced and that we successfully navigated our way through.
When you think about it, we lost about $8.5 billion to patent expirations several years ago. And we took a very
determined strategy that frankly was different than a lot of our competitors, where we decided to focus on five major
therapeutic areas where we had capabilities and frankly where we still felt there was a lot of unmet medical need. We
got very agnostic about the sourcing of our research. At the end of the day, we wanted the best molecules, the best
science where we felt we could make the biggest difference. And then of course it was about how do you build robust
clinical development programs and then ultimately have benchmark commercial and reimbursement teams to make
sure that you're maximizing all of those compounds. And if you look at the track record, as I mentioned earlier, 14
compounds since 2009; six of those have reached $1 billion. And again, these are compounds that are really making a
difference for patients.
But at the same time, we have made a very strong commitment to make sure that while we were launching those, we
were also investing in the future. And here I really want to commend our scientific team, our business development

team because if you look at our near-term pipeline, I think it's quite encouraging. We've got things like ARN-509,
another approach in androgen receptor inhibitors that we think will be a great complement with ZYTIGA in the not too
distant future. To complement an already very strong immunology franchise with REMICADE, STELARA, and
SIMPONI, we have got sirukumab in IL-6 in patients for RA and guselkumab in IL-23 that's an antibody for psoriasis.
Both of those are progressing very well through development stages as well.
We've got a very interesting compound, fulranumab, an anti-NGF antibody for osteoarthritic pain. We've been in pain
for some time, but we think this will be a new approach for patients. And we've also got esketamine. You've heard
some of the data on that. It's the first NMDA antagonist, and these are from patients with treatment refractory
depression, a really difficult condition with high rates of suicidality. And we see very good results. Again, it's early. We
have more work to do but we're quite encouraged.
So if we add that to the very strong platforms, and you heard earlier in my presentation that we've had over 20 line
extensions approved in 2014 off our existing compounds, we've submitted at least that many more that we'll see
approved over the next several years. And when you look at some of the areas where we're currently participating, be it
prostate cancer, be it Type 2 diabetes, and some of the other areas such as thrombosis, we've seen many of these areas
growing at double-digits. An areas like XARELTO, I think we've penetrated perhaps a third of the warfarin market. So
we think there is strong growth opportunities in our core business. We think we've got exciting line extensions and we
think we've got a great coming pipeline of Phase 3 and Phase 2 compounds for the future.

Your next question comes from Derrick Sung of Sanford Bernstein.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Hi, Derrick.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Hi, good morning, thanks for taking my questions. Alex, you spent a lot of time highlighting the
successes that you've had in Pharma, which we would agree, you've done a great job in seemingly finding the secret
sauce there in terms of both external and internal innovation. I'm wondering if you have any thoughts on how
translatable that formula is over to your Medical Device business, which has continued to – you've struggled to grow
above market. Maybe you could talk about if there are any learnings there that could be translated over to Medical
Devices and what it will take either internally or externally for you to get that medical device business growing above
market?
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Hey, Derrick. Thank you very much. And first of all, clearly, we acknowledge our Medical
Device Group has faced challenges that many of the businesses have over the past several years and we've got some
very promising and I think very strong stories in our Medical Device Group. And when you think about our EP
business, Biosense Webster and the growth rates that it's experienced, I think now we have about 19 consecutive
quarters of double-digit growth for that business, a continuous and constant stream of innovation, ultimately, really
helping patients and growing our business, it's impressive by almost any measure.
I think we've also started to see some of our other core businesses come back and grow. We think about the Medical
Device market probably growing in the 3% to 5% range. It's been consistent with our longer term projections. Of
course, our goal is to outpace that growth, because we want to gain share vis-à-vis innovation, the way we work with
customers in our broader portfolio. If I look across other areas, we're starting, I think, to see signs of a strengthening
orthopedics performance by DuPuy Synthes.
For example, we saw hips up around 4%, knees up 3%, trauma growing at the high 4%s, almost 5%. And we think our
share performance has been very good in all of those different areas. We saw energy also, on a full year basis, come
back over 5%. Even our suture business is growing over 3% on an annual basis.

So we think those are strong performers and can continue. And then of course, we have some businesses that we're
working hard on, areas such as diabetes, which as you know was challenged by the price setbacks. Our vision care
business is facing challenges in the marketplace, but they've done a lot of good changes recently, and we think they're
well-positioned for the future.
But as we look even longer term, clearly, we're trying to take pages from the innovation playbook that you might say
our Pharma Group is built on and apply those in other areas. So whether it's in our clinical development programs, the
way we monitor safety, adverse event reporting, those are areas where we're spending a lot of time.
We're doing more and more through our innovation centers that we're recently opening and utilizing JJDC on how do
we better source early start-up innovation, again, in the Pharma as well as the Device, but even our Consumer
businesses going forward. And of course, we're looking at ways also to partner with customer in new unique ways.
So we remain confident in our Medical Device businesses. We've got some very strong businesses. We've realized
there's others that we still have more work to do, but we think long-term, they offer a significant opportunity for
patients, for us, and for our shareholders.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Thank you. That's very helpful. I was wondering, Alex, also if you could follow up a bit on your
comments on healthcare utilization. You had mentioned that now you're seeing a couple quarters of sequential uptick in
healthcare utilization. Can you perhaps break that down a bit by geography and give us your outlook and also what
you're seeing in the U.S. versus Europe versus the emerging markets and what you see the drivers are for utilization as
we look out to 2015 and beyond?
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Sure, Derrick. And as you know, because of our presence in Pharmaceuticals as well as Devices
and even Consumer, it gives us a pretty good lens to understand what's going on fundamentally in the market. So let me
start in the United States where we probably have the clearest and the most tangible data.
And here we're encouraged. We think we've got about three quarters now in the positive. When I say in the positive, I
mean somewhere between 2% and 3% when we're looking at hospital admissions, surgical procedures. Physician office
visits still appear to be negative, so I think it's too early to declare complete victory yet. But generally, I would say
we're encouraged by some of the signs that we're seeing. And if we can see the fourth quarter, the full results coming
out for this year to have a third quarter then of increasing results, that would be a positive.
I think one of the areas of challenge for us has been Europe. There remain obviously a lot of concerns economically in
Europe. We have some businesses, frankly, that are doing quite well. We have others that are challenged. I think it's a
bit of a mixed bag. We continue to see good growth in China. On a full year basis, we saw over double-digit growth in
China and close to that in the BRIC regions, although obviously with Russia, that's been a particularly challenge over
the last year given some of the things that we've faced. South America a little bit more with Venezuela. Brazil has been
a little bit mixed. We saw some challenges in our Consumer segment and in some of the other areas, we haven't felt
that as much. But I think that's the global sense that I would give you.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Thank you.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: It's very helpful. Thank you very much.

<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Hi, there. Thanks for taking the question. So Dominic, let me start with you, if you don't
mind. So I just want to walk through kind of the approach to numbers this year. So you have a starting point for on a
cash EPS basis of $6.39 for 2014. But then you lose $0.42 from FX, let's call it $0.20 from OLYSIO. But then the other
income step-up from 2014 to 2015 add extra $1 billion gains you about $0.30. Is that how to think about it? And then if
that's right, that would still seem to imply relatively conservative underlying EPS growth outlook of about 1% to 3%.
So is there anything I'm missing there?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: I think the impact of the higher other income and expense line, I mean you have to think
about that as utilizing a tax rate that's predominantly U.S. versus our blended tax rates. I would say that the impacts
lower than $0.30 a share and closer to $0.20 a share to $0.22 a share. Just think about $1 billion at a 35% tax rate and
$6.50 and do the math on that. So I don't think you get to $0.30 on that. So I would just adjust that a little bit.
And then I would just give you maybe another macro observation, Mike, and that is that if you – I know that not
everyone has updated their models for all the moving parts here. But I think if you – when I looked at consensus at
about $6.14 and then I considered the fact that we should add back to that $0.32 of this amortization expense and then
reduce it by what I'm using as about $0.24, which is the difference between $0.42 that I just discussed and the midpoint
of what we provided as an estimate back in October of between $0.15 and $0.20 so call that $0.18. So an incremental
$0.24. So $6.14 plus $0.32 minus $0.24 gets you to in the $6.20 range. And so we're thinking that that's about apart
from the expectation on currency, about where everyone had sort of expected us to come out.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Okay. Let me fast forward then into 2016. So we should assume that, that level of other
income benefit fades in 2016? So is that a bit of a headwind as we're trying to update our models not only for 2015 but
for 2016?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: I think that, as Alex has talked about and I've mentioned in other calls and you all have
asked us about, we're continuing to review our portfolio. We expect that we will continue to make choices about areas
we're going to play in and areas we're not going to play in, where we want to invest and where we think others certain
assets may be better in the hands of others.
And when we do that and we divest certain businesses as a result of that analysis, we tend to use those divestiture gains
to basically benefit shareholders. So we either use it to invest in other more promising activities that we think will give
us a better boost in long-term growth or in fact we deliver a higher level of earnings as a result, and of course, as we did
with OCD, if there's any dilutive impact of that, on a go-forward basis, we would then adjust for that with share
buybacks and the like.
So I would say that I wouldn't take 2015 as sort of an abnormal number, and I wouldn't just say it would fade into 2016.
It all depends on what choices we make when we evaluate our portfolio going forward.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Okay. Let me ask one if I can. Let me sneak in one bigger picture question. So if I take
out the noise from OLYSIO, the underlying growth for business is accelerating in your guidance for 2015. Could you
just comment on that? What businesses are you assuming get better between Pharma, Medical Devices, and Consumer?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Yeah, well, overall, I would say that the growth rate in Pharma, ex-OLYSIO will be
slightly softer than it was the prior year, as these products have now ramped up in the marketplace. So the Medical
Device business overall and the Consumer business are expected to have better growth prospects in 2015 than we saw
in 2014.

<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, two questions for Alex. First, Alex, can you
describe your commitment to your cardiovascular device business? And the reason I'm asking is that there was
something written up a few months ago that J&J may be thinking about selling the interventional cardiology business,
but not the electrophysiology business, so commitment to cardiovascular.
And then as a follow-up, what is your commitment to the AAA rating? In other words, how sacred is the AAA rating?
And the reason I'm asking that is because as your competitors are getting bigger and bigger is better according to some
of your competitors, if J&J were to see a deal that was larger, but it would sacrifice the AAA rating, would J&J do such
a deal? Thank you.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Hey, thanks a lot, Glenn. Look, Glenn, I think that if you ask me about cardiovascular, my
response is that we think cardiovascular is an important area. We have done very well over the last several years in our
EP business, as I mentioned earlier, and I think by any standard, if you look at the way they've been able to advance the
standard of care, if you take a look at the new technology, the innovation rollouts, and frankly, the execution of that
business, it's been superlative in just about every mark. And we're really proud of that.
We made decisions in other areas of the cardiovascular such as our decision on drug-eluting stents several years ago.
We've continued to look at emerging areas in cardiovascular. But I think overall, we want to participate in areas where
we've got technology that we think can really make a difference for patients, where we think the markets are promising
for the future in terms of reaching more patients, expanding share, volume growth, some pricing stability.
And so, we're going to continue to evaluate our portfolio to make sure that we're consistent with our strategy as it
relates to cardiovascular.
If we talk about our AAA, look, we're proud of the fact that we're only one of the handful of companies that still has a
AAA rating. It gives us a lot of financial flexibility as an organization when you realize that we literally have almost –
well no covenants in the way that we're able to manage our business, for an enterprise of our size, and frankly, for the
sustainability of our performance over a very long period of time, we think that's important.
However, what we would also say if we came upon technology that we felt was truly transformational, that opened up
new patient segments for us, new opportunities, that is one factor that we would consider as we would think about
different acquisitions or different opportunities. So it's one among many factors. It is very important to us. But it's not
the only factor that we would judge a strategic option buy in the future.

<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning, Jeff.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. So we've seen quite a lot of contracting
pressure in some areas of Pharma. I just wanted to get a bit of color from you whether XARELTO is a product that
you're potentially starting to get any more serious discussions, with ELIQUIS becoming much more penetrated within
the U.S. market.
And also just for INVOKANA as well, just what the situation is like there, just from a contracting perspective. And
then second, just if you could, a bit more color on, what kind of impact you've expected within your guidance for
REMICADE within Europe from biosimilars.

And then just lastly, if you can just give us a bit more color on the increase in the litigation accrual you described in
your release. Thank you.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Okay, thank you, Jeff. Let me start off with the first one, and then I'll ask Dominic to chime in on
the other couple of questions.
First of all, we take a very broad look in the very early stages of our compound development, on what potential impact
or scenarios we could face regarding pricing and reimbursement. And so, it starts very early with the science. And as I
mentioned earlier in my commentary about our Pharmaceutical strategy, we think taking a very high innovation
approach in Pharma is the right approach, and it certainly has been the one most successful for us. And so, part of it
starts with selecting compounds that we feel have a strong probability of differentiation versus current standards of
care, and we think that's certainly the case with XARELTO and INVOKANA.
Secondly, it really gets into your clinical development programs. And if you look at the XARELTO clinical
development program that we had, I believe we had more than 60,000 patients in – as part of our plan, extensive
studies. As you know, we've got more than five indications for that literally at launch or very soon thereafter,
once-a-day dosing. And so, as part of our development program and labeling, we had a very comprehensive approach.
And we think that that clearly played a strong role in its rapid launch uptake.
And I think the same for a drug like INVOKANA. If you take a look at the comparative labeling that we have versus
Januvia regarding HbA1c reduction, regarding weight loss, other parameters, that's enabled us to have a very
differentiated and strong dossier to share with decision makers, payers around the world.
So as a result, we think not only have we seen strong acceptance, but we've seen good formulary uptake. XARELTO,
for example, in the United States, is available on, I believe more than 90% of commercial, as well as Medicare and
Medicaid programs. We see the very strong uptake with INVOKANA. I think it's somewhere around 70% or 80% even
in most cases. And we've had good success outside the United States as well.
And so, we think it takes, again, a very good clinical development program, strong labeling, very strong reimbursement
and commercial expertise. And so that's the way we think about those compounds. We haven't seen additional pressures
as of late. We certainly see competitive pressures. But we feel very good about our compounds that we're frankly still
in the launch stage of and their potential for future growth. Dom?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Jeff, with respect to REMICADE in Europe, as you know, we don't provide specific
product sales guidance on any product. And particularly with REMICADE in Europe, as you probably know, Merck is
our partner for distribution in Europe and the countries affected by biosimilar competition in the beginning of February
2015, so I think the question is best posed to them.
One thing I would say, though, is that we have a view on how biosimilars are likely to unfold in the marketplace, which
is unlike how typical generic chemical compounds unfold in the marketplace, and our best experience there was with
PROCRIT and EPREX in Europe. So using that as a guide, we felt pretty comfortable updating our guidance to reflect
our expectation of that, but we won't give very specific guidance on any product in particular.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Thank you. Next question, please.

Your next question comes from Kristen Stewart, Deutsche Bank.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning, Kristen.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Hey. Good morning, guys. Dominic, I just wanted to just go back and reconfirm the other
income commentary. So you're including the gain from NUCYNTA, and going forward, you said it would be likely
that we would continue to see these gains on sale of asset divestitures. Is that correct?

<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Right. So we did include that in this year's guidance. And in response to Mike's question
where he said, would it fade off in 2016, I commented that consistent with our review of our portfolio and making
decisions on where we're going to invest and where we're not, if we decided to divest other assets as part of that review,
then we would have similar type transaction gains in the particular year. And we would highlight them to you as we're
doing today.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Right. And this year, $0.20 to $0.22 just for that after tax?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: I think if you look at the change in our guidance on other income and expense compared to
what you will have modeled, it's about $1 billion after tax of 35% gets you to about $0.20 per share, $0.22 per share
impact versus current models.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. And then just kind of I guess more business operational, can you just talk a little bit
just about the surgery business? You highlighted it as being a key area of focus within Medical Devices with some new
products coming up. Can you just refresh us on your stance on robotics and what products you have within the pipeline
that you're most excited about in 2015?
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Sure, Kristen. Thank you very much. I'll take that one. Look, we're excited about the broad area of
surgery. And as you know, we break it out both by specialty surgery as well as surgical care. And what I would start
with in specialty surgery, there's a number of areas that I think are great opportunities.
One is certainly energy. We've had a number of new launches this year that I think have resulted in about, over 5%,
5.2% full year growth rate in that franchise. We think there's a lot of opportunity going forward. We also saw very
good performance from our mentor business this year. It grew at almost 9% after a couple of years of a lot of
challenges. It came back strong, and so we're pleased with what we've seen there.
And finally, our bio surgery business, which is one that we also think can really revolutionize the way bleeding is
controlled interoperatively. We saw over 8% growth in it for the quarter. So by and large that segment of our surgical
business is doing well. There, we're continuing to address some issues at ASP, but our team has made a lot of headway
there. So we're confident about that platform as well going forward.
If I look more broadly in our other surgical business, we saw suture grow over 3%, which was nice year-on-year
growth in that particular area. We think that's a good precursor of what you see generally across all of surgery. In the
endo mech area, our ECHELON FLEX portfolio is also being introduced and is doing better. Clearly, in certain areas
there, we're facing pricing pressure, but overall, we think that the surgical area both in specialty as well as more general
surgery offers a significant opportunity for us.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: And with respect to robotics?
<A - Alex Gorsky>: I'm sorry. Regarding robotics, look, as Gary mentioned, during last year's review of our medical
device space, we think that areas of robotics, visualization, particularly as some of those components become more
inherent to the instrumentation themselves, we do think that they can offer opportunities. We've got several
partnerships there as we speak. And we'll continue to look for ways to think about how that's going to impact surgery
going forward.

<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Hi, David.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Good morning, guys. Alex, more of a high level question on international. If we think about
the last three years, 2013 growth rate was a little slower than 2012. 2014 growth rates look slower than 2013. Even
second half 2014 was slower than first half 2014. Given your focus on global reach, can you just describe why
international is decelerating? Is it emerging markets? And what's the strategy to turn that around? And I had a quick
follow-up.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Thanks, David. Look, there are a lot of different moving parts when we talk about it. I think first
of all, let's talk about Europe. In Europe, we saw a contraction initially. Then Europe actually performed better. As I
mentioned earlier in the guidance going forward, we're watching it closely.
And even there, you've got Southern Europe versus Northern Europe. We continue to see Northern Europe performing
slightly better than the rest of Europe. It's been impacted the most recent quarters by Russia in a significant way, so
that's a watch. And although we have had some of our businesses, such as our Consumer group, do relatively well in
Russia, but it's something that we're watching closely.
China, we continued to see pretty solid growth. For our businesses, our Medical Device business is the most significant
in that. They continued to see good growth there. Our Consumer group has had some other challenges that we don't
think necessarily are related to the macroeconomic environment. Frankly, they have to do with some of our own
products and ingredients, but we think that we're on a better path there.
And then if I look to South America, we've been most challenged there in Venezuela. Brazil, definitely we feel there
was some slowdown in the back end of the year. And we're just going to have to watch it closely as we head into 2015.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Hey, David, just one thing to remind you about when you said it slowed down further in the
back half of 2014 compared to first half of 2014; just a reminder that the divestiture of the OCD business would have
impacted that comparison as well.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Yes.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: That's true. Thank you, Dominic. Maybe just a quick one for Dominic and then a strategic one
for Alex if I can sneak that one in. Dominic, I know it's hard with all the moving pieces. Do you have any sense of what
you'd consider the underlying operating margin expansion to be for the business in 2015?
And, Alex, just strategically, just thinking through your comments in the slide deck this morning, is it safe to interpret
your comments that within Pharmaceuticals, oncology probably sees an increase relative investment over the next
couple of years relative to historical periods? Thank you and I'll jump back in queue.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure, David. Just in terms of operating margin expansion in 2015, just to set the stage here,
remember we expanded our operating profit margin by 190 basis points in 2014, so we're already at a pretty high level,
and we wanted to continue the investment. We said we would use the divestiture gain that's included in our OI&E
number for NUCYNTA to offset the lost profitability on OLYSIO. And by doing that, we're going to maintain the level
of investment that we now have achieved. So an incremental operating margin expansion in 2015 would be very
modest.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: And, David, I would say we're really focused on all five of our therapeutic categories. Oncology
is certainly an exciting one. And when you look at the science and what's happening there, we think that there's a lot of
opportunity to better address need for patients. We think there's a lot of very interesting science. But also when we look
at immunology, when we look at infectious disease, when we look at neuroscience, as well as broader spaces in
cardiovascular and diabetes, we think that all of those offer significant potential for us.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Thank you. Next question, please.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Thank you very much.

The next question comes from Rick Wise, Stifel.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning, Rick.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Hey, Rick.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Alex, maybe start with a little more detail with
diabetes, if you would. It's been an underperforming asset. Maybe just broadly, what do you need to turn it around?
And let me touch on a couple of points. Remind us when you anniversaried the price cuts. Vibe proved in launching
here. We heard great things about it in Europe. Is that going to be a good proxy for what we expect to see in the U.S.?
And maybe you had a picture of the Calibra patch. Remind us when you hope to file and get that approved and
launched in the United States.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Sure, Rick, thank you very much. Diabetes is clearly one of those areas, Rick, where you know
and we've got several conversations on this. There are 350 million Type 2 diabetics around the world, and so many of
them not in control. There's a lot of unmet need. But we also realize it's been a very challenging market, particularly in
the areas of the part of the market that we've been in for the last several years. So Louise is going to get the exact date
when we lapped it.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: The price changes went into effect about a year ago June, but you're still seeing the impact of
them and you saw them earlier in the year and you're still seeing some of them.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: So we're still – look, for a very significant portion of our market, we saw over a 70% price
reduction. And as you know, whenever that happens in one of your businesses, you finally have got to reframe that
entire business. And I think all of the companies involved in SMBG have gone through that kind of transition over the
last year and a half.
If we look at the underlying fundamentals, things such as volume share, we've actually done a very good job. We've
done a very good job in managed care contracting. So as a result, we've been able to keep our volumes up, our costs
under control. But nonetheless, that business has completely had to reshape itself, and they're still in the process of I
think getting it stabilized.
We are excited about the Vibe approval. We think that's going to represent a real nice breakthrough for patients. Over
in Europe, we've had strong results. We're putting together the launch literally as we speak, so we're excited about that.
We think Calibra could be a very nice opportunity, very unobtrusive way to have insulin delivery. And it looks right
now like by the back end of the year 2016, that we should have more on that.
So again, overall, diabetes is an area that we feel strongly about. And by the way, this is the same team that had a very
significant role in the launch of INVOKANA as well. And we think the relationships that they've built with the
endocrinologists have been quite important for us in the launch success of that brand as well. So it's an area that we're
interested in but clearly one that's changed, and we still have more work to do to make sure we understand the best path
forward.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: That's great, and, Dominic, just one question for you. The $1 billion cost reduction program, it
sounds like a new one, a new incremental one, if I understood you, over three years, just help us briefly. Where does
that come from? What operating line does it affect? And is it incremental or will you reinvest it? Thanks.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: We actually talked about it last year at this time as well, so it's not a new program. It's just
the same program we've discussed, and we're confident we'll get about $1 billion over the next three-year period.
It's in the area of IT, finance, HR, all the functions that support the businesses, how we perform those services, where
we perform those services, and as Alex mentioned earlier, some more standardization and commonality across the
businesses through shared service environments. You'll see it across the SG&A line in particular, but we would always
look to see what the right balance is of investing versus delivering those cost savings. Of course, we do expect pricing

pressure to continue, so this is a good hedge against that as well, Rick.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Thanks again.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Yes.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Okay, thank you. Next question, please.

Your next question comes from Vamil Divan, Credit Suisse.
<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: Thanks for taking the question. Just to follow up to an earlier question, I think from Jeff, on
INVOKANA and XARELTO and some of the contracting issues, I was just curious about the specialty care markets,
specifically the TNFs. And we're seeing obviously a lot of discussion around pricing in primary care and hep C. But are
you seeing anything more in the specialty care areas, specifically in autoimmune? How has that changed over the last
six to 12 months from what you were seeing before?
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Vamil, this is Alex here. We haven't seen any significant changes over the last six months or 12
months. And again, we've got a lot of experience in those areas with REMICADE, SIMPONI, STELARA. And I think
our team has done a nice job in managing the overall value and pricing and reimbursement issues. But we haven't seen
any noticeable changes in that environment.
<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: Okay, and then just one follow-up if I could. It's on the tax side, where you had the lower rate
this time and you mentioned for 2015. How should we think about just longer-term tax planning? Is the range you're
giving now what we should assume going forward or are there other steps that can lower your longer-term rate?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: I think, Vamil, we're always doing prudent tax planning. And I think the ultimate change in
tax rates would come from hopefully corporate tax reform being implemented, in which case, if you project that, I
would then project a slightly higher effective tax rate. But of course, the utilization of our OUS cash, et cetera, without
penalty is a great benefit that arises from that. So I can't give you a long-term projection, but you've seen that we've
been in the 20% range for quite some time, and that's I think is a solid place that if you just want to model it for now.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Thank you. And we'll take our final question from Danielle.
Operator
Your next question comes from Danielle Antalffy, Leerink Partners.
<Q - Danielle J. Antalffy>: Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks so much for squeezing me in and I appreciate it. As we –
so appreciating all the headwinds that are impacting growth in 2015, how do we think about sort of medium-term
growth, so 2016-2017? And what's in the pipeline to return the company back to growth?
This is sort of following up on Larry's question, Alex, on specifically the Pharma company? And going through a few
years of strong growth and a few years of decelerating growth, what's in the pipeline that gives you confidence that
2015 is sort of the one-off where you absorb headwinds from OLYSIO specifically, and then of course, FX?
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Thank you, Danielle. Look, I would say first of all, we think that there's significant growth left in
our core brands. And as I mentioned earlier, whether you look at the penetration that you have within a particular
therapeutic category, for example, the new novel mechanisms against warfarin, for example, if you look at the
penetration of the SGLT2s versus other options in diabetes, and frankly, the growth rates of the markets in areas such
as prostate cancer or some of the leukemias, we think there's a lot of growth opportunities just from reaching more
patients.

Number two, it's about getting additional indications and line extensions. And so, I think our team has done also a very
nice job there in continuing to reinforce, introduce new data, new information, new approaches that, whether it's
combination therapies, whether it's something like our three-month version of paliperidone that we just announced that
we know in a condition such as schizophrenia can have a tremendous impact if you can keep compliance high on just
four injections a year. We think in that core business, it gives us a very solid opportunity with the line extensions.
And then, of course, if we look beyond that, some of the compounds that I mentioned earlier, we think ARN-509 will
be a great complement with ZYTIGA and we're learning more and more about that. And we're becoming increasingly
confident as we gather more data.
In immunology, our IL-6 and IL-23 with sirukumab and guselkumab will be great additions to a portfolio where we've
already got three compounds. And we know very well clinically; we know very well commercially as well as from a
reimbursement perspective.
And finally, esketamine, while it's still early, we're very encouraged by the data. We really are encouraged by the fact
that we've seen, whether we have received breakthrough therapy designation as well as fulranumab in pain. So we think
those in addition to our line extensions and additional indications that we'll be gathering, remember, we filed more than
20 different line extensions over the course of 2014. We have 11 compounds in Phase 2 development. I think we've got
50 compounds in early development and more than 100 in discovery. In addition to the ongoing licensing flow that we
were able to build this year, I think it gives us a lot of confidence in our portfolio going forward.
<Q - Danielle J. Antalffy>: Okay, thanks so much for that color, Alex. And then if I could just follow up really
quickly on the question on the device side of things. So obviously, we're nearing a close of one of your competitors or
two of your competitors merging in a mega transaction here making a big bet on breadth and scale across the hospital
and bundling, et cetera. So just wondering how you guys are planning to respond to that? How you think the
environment could change from a purchasing perspective at the hospital level with the Medtronic-Covidien deal once it
closes?
<A - Alex Gorsky>: I guess what I would say, Danielle, is we wouldn't respond to that necessarily. I think we initiated
probably some of it with our move several years ago when we started down this path ourselves. And we've been pretty
steadfast on our strategy. One, it's about innovation and that's why we're continuing to invest in innovation in all of our
core Medical Device businesses.
We do think that having scale in the right areas is also important as payers and as hospital systems want to deal with
you differently. And then it's about having also a very good geographical presence so that you can expand globally.
And we're always looking for opportunities to add the right new technology or the right business to ours. And that's the
path that we'll stay on.
<Q - Danielle J. Antalffy>: All right. That's great. Thanks so much, guys.
<A - Alex Gorsky>: Okay.
Alex Gorsky
Hey, everybody, thank you again for joining today's call and together with Dominic and Louise, look, I look forward to
keeping you apprised of our progress over the course of the year and I'm sure we'll be talking on several different
occasions.
So please note that we're going to be hosting a Pharmaceutical Business Review for analysts on Wednesday, May 20,
2015, right here in New Brunswick and it will include a review of our overall strategy for continuing to build on our
launch excellence and robust pipeline, much of which I talked about today. So I look forward to seeing many of you
there. Enjoy the rest of your day, everybody. Thank you.
