MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Greetings, and welcome to the Second Quarter 2013 Monsanto Company Earnings Conference Call. [Operator
Instructions] A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a
reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Bryan Hurley, Investor
Relations Lead for Monsanto. Thank you. Mr. Hurley, you may begin.
Bryan Hurley
Thanks a lot, Kevin, and good morning to everyone. Thanks for joining our second quarter earnings update. I'm joined
this morning by Hugh Grant, our Chairman and CEO, by Brett Begemann, our President and Chief Commercial Officer
and Pierre Courduroux, our CFO. Also joining me from the IR team are Ashley Wissmann and Manny Cruz.
As usual, this call's being webcast and you can access the webcast and supporting slides at monsanto.com. The replay
will also be available at that address.
We're providing you today with EPS measures on both a GAAP basis and on an ongoing business basis. Where we
refer to non-GAAP financial measures, we reconcile to GAAP in the slides and in the press release, both of which are
posted on our website.
This call will include statements concerning future events and financial results. Because these statements are based on
assumptions and factors that involve risk and uncertainty, the company's actual performance and results may vary in a

material way from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statements. A description of the factors that may
cause such a variance is included in the Safe Harbor language and our most recent 10-K and in today's press release.
With this call, we'll focus on our second earnings guidance increase in as many quarters. That's a function of a strong
quarter and continued strong business performance. Hugh will start today with an overview of our strategy and how
we're thinking about growth this year and for the long term. From there, we'll have Brett Begemann walk through the
operational drivers that underscore our business performance. And finally, Pierre will bring that together in the
translation to our current financials and our guidance outlook.
With that, let me hand it over to Hugh.
Hugh Grant
Thanks, Bryan, and good morning to everybody on the line.
The second quarter's always an important quarter for us. This year, I'll tell you this second quarter is more important
both because our business results confirms the early momentum that we saw building and because we achieved
breakthroughs on a couple of key strategic targets that reinforce the runway for our long-term opportunity.
I'll let Brett walk you through the details of the operational milestones. I want to focus on how our business today fits
into our overall strategy. There's four areas that I want to emphasize. First, in the near term, an earlier-than-typical sales
season has created a better line of sight that allows us to raise our full year outlook for the second time. That comes
together on Slide 5 as we raise our earnings guidance range today to $4.40 to $4.50 of ongoing EPS. That provides an
earlier-than-usual punctuation mark on the year and it reinforces our expectation for a third consecutive year of growth
above our original projections.
That growth also comes after we've previously excluded from our outlook the historical range of approximately $0.20
to $0.25 of full year EPS associated with the Brazil Roundup Ready 1 soybean trait. So our bottom line business
outlook today means the momentum that we anticipated in our first quarter has clearly carried through into our even
stronger business results for the second quarter.
And that really sets up my second point. As we look at our business results this year in context of the longer term,
we've turned the corner as a global business. We're a yield company, so what propels us today is the strength of a truly
global business, not just one driver, and you can see that on Slide 6.
We've good momentum in the U.S., we're on the front edge of some significant acceleration in Latin America and we're
bringing a couple of new layers of growth into our business each year. And the strength in our global portfolio in fiscal
2013 reinforces our confidence in the growth opportunity that continues beyond this year.
Thirdly, we've always focused our strategy on those elements that we can influence. In this quarter, we made some
strategic moves that reduce uncertainty, provide clarity and reinforce key elements of our ongoing growth. The biggest
of those were our efforts to take a step forward with our deal with Brazilian customers around the Roundup Ready 1
technology and, most recently, our deal with DuPont adding them as a new licensee for our Roundup Ready 2 Yield
and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend platforms in soybeans.
The DuPont agreement is a major breakthrough that allows us to put the marketplace noise behind us while we expand
customer choice by making our innovations available to more farmers and more brands. Strategically, the deal validates
our Roundup Ready 2 Yield and our new Xtend technologies and it expands total opportunity for both of these. And
that's backed by the financials as we have a long-term customer that consolidates a key piece of the growth that we've
anticipated.
And lastly, as good as I feel about this year, I feel equally good about the opportunity that comes as we take the concept
of a total package of yield to the next level in our pipeline. Today, we've more platforms that will drive yield than ever
before. You can see that on Slide 7. This year, we make the first step into precision agriculture as our first integrated
farming systems offering moves into ground breaker trials in the U.S. Behind that, with significant pipeline upgrades to

broad-acre traits, other completely new platforms like our BioDirect technology, and an increasingly powerful package
of new technologies that we expect will step up yield every year from now through the end of this decade.
I'll end on the point that agriculture provides a compelling stage for innovators like Monsanto. If you set aside the usual
back-and-forth in annual acres, yields and prices, what becomes apparent is the prospect that the growing global
demand for grain is creating an opportunity for us to create a lot more cumulative value in the next decade. We are
well-positioned to do just that.
As I look at what we've accomplished so far this year, we've clarity in this quarter and that enables us to raise our EPS
guidance range, the high end of which would represent a third consecutive year of greater than 20% ongoing EPS
growth. That's an important indicator of our momentum and our performance. But it's also the foundation for our
strategy going forward as we've the global business strength to add even more layers to our opportunities over the next
several years.
I have to tell you that I'm delighted with the trajectory of our global businesses, and I'm confident we've got the right
balance of innovation, continued increased customer focus and operational execution to propel our profitability
forward.
So Brett's right in the front line of those opportunities, so he's in the best position to walk you through these drivers in a
bit more detail. Brett?
Brett D. Begemann
Thanks, Hugh, and good morning to everyone.
As Hugh said, my focus is on driving growth in our global business. I'll anchor on one point Hugh made. We've turned
an important corner as a global business and that global growth is exactly what is driving our strong performance this
year. So it's worth highlighting how we see it come together, not just for this year's results, but also for the strategic
opportunity it creates going forward.
Part of the strength of a growing business is the supporting ensemble, and for us, that's the advantage we realize from
our Ag Productivity segment. Ag Productivity and the Roundup business in particular has emerged nicely from our
strategy reset a few years ago. Our strategy allows us to capture the upside of a rejuvenated market environment while
significantly reducing the impact of volatility of the historical cyclical side of our business. But what really drives the
incremental opportunity in our business is when we deploy our portfolio to create yield and value for our farmer
customers on a global scale.
You can see that best back on Slide 6. We are continuing to drive yield in core geographies taking that proven success
into emerging markets and unlocking completely new sources of growth through our unmatched R&D pipeline. If we
zero in on our 2013 drivers, we can see how this plays out in the momentum we've talked about in our business.
Start with the single biggest driver of our performance this year, our Corn business. And make no mistake. This is one
of the most global businesses, which really is highlighted as you skip to Slide 8. With the Southern Hemisphere seasons
largely in hand and early insight into the Northern Hemisphere Corn season, there's no doubt that our Corn business is
having an extremely strong year.
Here are the metrics that matter.
We're growing our global volumes. In fact, we expect to hit record total volumes in our Corn business in 2013 driving a
key increment of our growth. I believe that's a direct outcome of our conscious focus on our farmer customers. We've
taken the feedback from our customers to heart, staying true to our deliberate approach to pricing and our focus on
providing the best performing products. It also is important over the long term, as this modest pricing approach means
we're not pricing to the highs and lows of a commodity price market that is certain to fluctuate over time.

The second benefit that shines through is the power of a global upgrade, which you see prominently on this same slide.
Every year, we upgrade a significant portion of our portfolio across the largest geographies with the newest,
highest-value hybrids. That annual refreshment has the effect of lifting our Corn portfolio prices on a global level every
year. This annual germplasm refresh allows us to grow price and volume, and together, that creates a blockbuster effect
generating more than $2.3 billion of corn seed sales growth across the key geographies in the last decade.
If we focus in on the drivers for 2013, our second quarter now reflects the conclusion of the second season in Latin
America and that punctuates the strong results we saw in Q1. If you go to Slide 9, in a country like Brazil, the power of
our Corn story lies in the compounding upgrade as we expand both the trait penetration while simultaneously
upgrading to next-generation traits. As the Brazil season ramps up, we saw a record [ph] suprenia (11:51) planting
season and record volume for our business. That acreage growth in [ph] suprenia (11:55) likely continues over time and
that's a positive for our business as we've historically done well in that season.
This opportunity also shows the trait trend isn't a one-shot benefit. We're in the first phase of introducing traits into
Brazil. Coming behind today's traits are additional multi-trait stacks that will add on top of today's best products
creating a runway for upgrades we expect carries over the next half decade.
Those same core drivers show up in the Northern Hemisphere and, in particular, in the U.S. on Slide 10.
We made an earlier-than-usual call on our view on acres on par with last year's 96 million to 97 million acres. Now
within range of actual planting, that early call feels spot on, something reinforced in last week's USDA outlook.
Without last year's head start, and with some of the rain and snow in the last few weeks, farmers won't be able to get in
the fields as quickly this year. So the conditions through the planting season will be important in getting to the final
acres.
Obviously, last year's drought will also play out in this year's crop, and going into planting, farmers still need to
replenish a lot of moisture through the season. Likewise, with the drought negatively hitting last summer's seed
production across the Corn Belt, it's a tight market across the industry. We've worked with our distribution, and we feel
good about having the portfolio of seed to meet the needs of our farmer customers against that projected market. One of
the benefits of our portfolio is the broad availability of RIB products giving farmers even more flexibility and speed in
getting their acres in this year.
Importantly, the strength we saw in our early order book is also apparent in the financials this quarter. This is setting up
to be another strong year for our U.S. Corn Seed business as we project another year of growth. The biggest driver of
that growth is the mix benefit coming from our upgrades, and those have been in high demand. In fact, we're on track to
be at the high end of the original target of 36 million to 38 million acres in our Reduced-Refuge family.
And within that, there's a compounding benefit, both the upgrade from the older products to the Reduced-Refuge
family and the upgrade within the family as highest-performing, highest-value products are most in demand. In
particular, with the good yield performance last year, we've seen strong demand for our top-tier Genuity SmartStax
product as it now is the largest volume product for the Reduced-Refuge family and our own brands.
The other major factor that straddles our current core markets and new emerging opportunities is the Soybean business,
on Slide 11. With Genuity Roundup Ready 2 Yield and Intacta Roundup Ready 2 PRO, we've talked about the key
elements of soybeans. However, we're on the verge of seeing the cumulative power of our next-generation soybean
platform drive our financials.
On this slide, you see that there are 200 million acres of soybeans planted in North and South America. With a fit on
every one of those acres, we expect the success of platforms of Roundup Ready 2 Yield, Intacta and then Roundup
Ready 2 Xtend to come together as a multi-billion dollar driver in the next five years. This year, we'll touch more than
40 million acres with Roundup Ready 2 Yield in the U.S. but only about 20% of this opportunity. That means in the
next five years, we expect to see significant upgrades that have a practical fit on the remaining 160 million acres.
Here's how I think about that roll-out.

Going into the U.S. this season, our Soybean business is in a very strong position. The early order book is translating
well into shipments, and we're positioned to see the next step-up of Roundup Ready 2 Yield. Just as we're seeing with
the Reduced-Refuge family in Corn, the strong demand for Roundup Ready 2 Yield means we now expect this year's
acres to come in at the high end of our original 39 million to 41 million acre range.
This is also the primary area where the strategic breakthrough that Hugh mentioned reinforces our opportunity. I'm
pleased to have DuPont on board as a customer for Roundup Ready 2 Yield and Roundup Ready 2 Xtend. Strategically,
it provides an important confirmation of the platform status of these technologies for the industry.
Just as importantly, it immediately expands the U.S. opportunity for both Roundup Ready 2 Yield and Xtend,
confirming the first phase of this multi-year runway. And financially, it carries more than $1 billion of value that
dovetails in for the U.S. soybeans and reinforces the growth on that element over an extended period of time.
The next significant phase of that runway comes as we take another step closer to commercializing the first of our new
100 million acre soybean opportunities with Intacta in Brazil, on Slide 12. Ahead of Intacta, we also continue to put our
effort behind an orderly wind-down of Roundup Ready 1 soybeans in Brazil. I believe we'll continue to see back and
forth on Roundup Ready 1, but I think we've made the right strategic steps to help transition, work with our customers
and direct our focus to Intacta.
Intacta's the opportunity I tell our teams to spend their energy on. The reason Intacta is so compelling is because it's a
step change in performance, and the new data we have today and the early results from our second year of Ground
Breakers data in Brazil, just like last year, we're seeing the performance we expected with a better than
four-bushel-per-acre advantage on more than 1,000 locations, double the number of locations that we tested last year.
With two years of data on real customer fields, it's clear that the performance is there and the excitement among
customers is tangible. That sets up very nicely as we look to take Intacta to the first increment of commercial scale in
Brazil's summer season. There's still some work to do, but we're in very good shape to move on this 100 million acre,
$1 billion-plus opportunity.
On the heels of Intacta will be our Roundup Ready 2 Xtend technology. It moves into Ground Breakers this season in
the U.S., and we really see this over the next five years as another increment that adds to the Roundup Ready 2 Yield
and Intacta basis to top off that big soybean opportunity in the Americas. Taken together, this is really the first time
we've talked about the cumulative opportunity for our next-generation soybean platform and the total opportunity
makes this one of our biggest growth drivers, and the early milestones are right on track.
The same core point would be true as we look at the whole business. Our milestones are on track. The momentum we
anticipated has clearly materialized. The last couple of years have been important in confirming our strategy and
re-igniting growth, so I'm pleased to see that play out in fiscal 2013 as well. That's a function of the effort we've made
to connect with our farmer customers, and that continues to be a priority for me and my teams.
With that, let me have Pierre walk through how all of this comes together in the financials. Pierre?
Pierre Courduroux
Thanks, Brett, and good morning to everybody on the line.
Hugh and Brett covered the strategic business drivers that influenced our full year guidance, so I will now concentrate
on a focused review some of the key year-to-date financial elements and how they translate in an upside to our original
plans. But before I go into the details, let me highlight, on Slide 13, how I think about the full year outlook at this point.
First, we are very pleased with our results both in the quarter and for the year to date. This year has been unique in
providing us an earlier-than-usual view in our first two quarters, and that's what gives me confidence as we take our full
year guidance higher today. We've locked in the key increments of growth we expected from South America and in the
early U.S. season, and that really sets the course for our full year growth.

Second, the results really show the power of an increasingly global business. This is the most significant factor I see in
the results. Operating a business in agriculture, we will be facing variability that range from weather effects to
geographic swings every year. So having a leading business in multiple geographies and built on multiple technology
platforms matters. If you look at our financials this year, that geography balance is apparent as we continue to be on
track with our full year growth split roughly equally in between the U.S. and international.
And lastly, as the strong business performance also translates into our cash flow statements, we're evolving our cash
deployment approach as we look to return more value to our shareowners.
If I translate that overview into the specifics of the financials, the best way to see the portfolio effect I just mentioned is
to focus on the year-to-date numbers. Start with year-to-date sales, which increased more than $1.2 billion, driving the
to- line growth that sets the tone for our overall earnings. That translates into a gross profit growth as well, as
year-to-date GP was over $4.4 billion an increase of approximately 18% over the same point last year. As we increase
our full year guidance today, it flows through from our combined full year expectations for GP, which we would expect
now in the range of $7.7 billion to $7.75 billion.
Consistent with our strategy, and as we've become a bigger company, EBIT has become the most relevant metric to
monitor our overall growth. Importantly, we see leverage in EBIT as we grow our above-the-line components faster
than our operating expenses. As a result, year-to-date EBIT margins have grown nearly three points and that puts us on
a trajectory to grow our overall EBIT margins for the third consecutive year.
If you look at what drives year-to-year growth, there are a couple of clear factors.
First, on the Seeds and Genomics side, the largest overall contributor and the largest driver of growth is our global Corn
business. Year-to-date Corn sales have grown by 19% reflecting the strength of our overall business and the uptick we
saw in our early order book. That is nearly 2/3 of the overall sales growth of the company, which reaffirms the role this
key driver has in our overall portfolio. It also puts us in a very good position at the halfway point for expectations of
mid-teens full year sales growth for Corn.
This Corn performance is really a function of our global footprint as we are seeing the cumulative volume gain and mix
benefits from Latin America, from our core U.S. business and from other key geographies like Europe. Practically for
the full year, we expect double-digit gross profit growth in Corn and I also expect margins to [ph] orbit (23:31) pretty
well in line with what last year or up slightly, and this even any year where cost of goods come in at one of the highest
points in the last decade reflecting the impact of last year's drought and winter production costs.
These cost pressures impact our financials, but give us the business flexibility to make sure we have the seeds to supply
our farmer customers. That Corn upside is complemented by the continued benefit we've seen in Ag Productivity.
Fundamentally, the benefit that we saw in the first quarter continues to track in this quarter in our full year outlook, and
we project full year GP to further increase putting it in the range of $1.35 billion to $1.4 billion.
The upside continues to be driven by glyphosate pricing as a result of the earlier increases in generic prices. Now that
we're well into the U.S. portion of the volume, we feel very good about the outlook for the Ag Productivity segment.
While we recognize the current strong environment will subside some over time, the current sales levels give us a good
view of the continued contribution through the end of the year and a solid line of sight for Ag Productivity into our
fiscal year 2014.
If you look at the other earnings drivers, both above and below the line, they are tracking in line with our early
expectations. The second quarter is relatively small for other businesses within Seeds and Genomics but all fit with our
previous expectations. Within that, the area to highlight would be soybeans.
As we covered in our first quarter call, our guidance excludes the historical range of approximately $0.20 to $0.25 of
full year EPS from Roundup Ready 1 soybeans in Brazil, and you can see that effect in the soybean gross profit for the
quarter. In the second quarter, we have seen strong growth in the U.S. as we've seen the mix benefit from the upgrades
on Roundup Ready 2 Yield, but that positive effect was offset as the second quarter, along with Q3, is one of the two
large quarters where the Brazil soybean contribution would historically flow through our P&L.

Below the line, our total operating expenses track very well against the targets we gave with our initial guidance. As a
result, we see no changes there and would expect to see the continuation of positive earnings leverage.
As I look at the remainder of the year, it also tracks in line with our previous expectations. As we balance the continued
momentum in Corn and Ag Productivity against the effective Roundup Ready soybeans in Brazil and the expected
lower overall cut in acres, this gives us a clear line of sight for full year growth reaching a third consecutive year of
greater than 20% on the high end.
From the standpoint of cash, the strong business results position us for another year of strong cash generation as
reflected on Slide 14. With the early flow of cash resulting from the strong economy and the early ordering season in
the U.S., our year-to-date results keep us on track to meet our guidance range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion of free cash
for the year. That strong cash position creates an opportunity for us on cash deployment.
I've said that my first priority is to aggressively reinvest in the business to support the continued growth opportunity.
We've been true to that commitment investing approximately $2.4 billion in total over the last three years on CapEx
and targeted investments. Strategically, we have begun to step up our CapEx investments this year in those areas Hugh
noted as having the best growth potential within our Seeds business. This CapEx is important for our next round of
global growth and offers some of the lowest risk and highest return on investment for our cash deployment.
The next priority for me is the strength of our balance sheet, which matters, as I want to maintain the resources and
flexibility to be in a good position to address the cyclicality and potential variability inherent to agriculture. And in fact,
today we're at a point where further strengthening our balance sheet wouldn't create further meaningful benefit.
Based on our analysis and with feedback we've gotten from many of our owners, we are now moving to use the cash
over and above our current levels to further prioritize our share buyback and dividend programs. We continue to view
dividends as an important element of our cash deployment strategy.
Over the last three years, we've increased our dividend by more than 40%, and as we continue to grow our business,
dividends will remain a priority. Most directly, our historical practice has been to use share buybacks to offset dilution.
As a function of our available cash, we are shifting to using our buyback program more opportunistically in a way that
we expect to begin to reduce share count.
We back this new approach with our early actions. We bought back $300 million of shares in the second quarter as we
aggressively make progress against our current $1 billion share buyback authorization. We'll continue to focus on this
tactical buyback and expect to see the early share count reduction in this fiscal year.
Taken together, we've used approximately $3.3 billion of our free cash on share buybacks and dividends in the past
three years. That's almost 3/4 of our total free cash flow during that period, and I continue to like our ability to be a
company with strong underlying growth that generates a strong cash trend we can use for additional capital return.
Let me conclude by stepping back from the numbers for a moment.
I'd summarize by telling you that there are two things I take away from this quarter. First, the quarter is at an important
punctuation mark. It confirms the momentum we anticipated and gives us a unique line of sight to be able to raise our
full year guidance and lock in our expectation for a third consecutive year of strong growth. And second, this strength
is a direct result of a growing global business. That business performance sets us up nicely for a strong year, for our
continuing growth opportunity and for the ability to return compelling value to our shareowners.
Thanks for your time. And with that, let me turn it over to Bryan for Q&A.
Bryan Hurley
Thanks, Pierre. We have Hugh, Pierre and Brett Begemann here as we open the call to your questions. As we typically
do, I'll ask that you please hold your questions to one per person so that we can take questions from as many people as
possible. You're always welcome to rejoin the queue for a follow-up question.

So, Kevin, I think we're ready to take any questions that may be on the line at this point.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. Please
proceed with your question.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Yes. Thank you. A question on your gross profit guidance. You've gone up $50 million to $100
million from your previous guidance, yet, Roundup's gone up by more than that. So I'm just wondering what's
happening in the Seeds and Genomics business because – is the Brazilian loss larger than you thought on the last
quarter? And then just how sustainable is this surge in Roundup?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah, so maybe I'll – so you had two or three questions in there, Don. I'll maybe ask Pierre to give
a little bit of color on gross profit, but overall delighted with global Corn performance; a bit of softness in Brazilian
beans but completely in line with what we anticipated in the first quarter. And then I'll maybe come back and say a
little bit on Roundup as well. But, Pierre, on the Seeds side?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: So, Don, good morning. Regarding our Seeds gross profit and looking at the second half of
the year, the way I'm thinking about that is to position it within a year where we can, for the third year, grow earnings
by 20% and a year where, at this point in time, nothing has been planted yet in the U.S. Regarding the second half
specifically, we expect the key drivers of growth that we saw in the first half to continue and prevail, so Ag
Productivity still being strong and, obviously, our Corn business driving growth.
And the point which I want to make here is that if you normalize the second half of the year for the impact of Roundup
Ready 1 in Brazil, knowing that a large part of the $0.20 to $0.25 of EPS that we excluded from our guidance would be
coming in the second half. So if you normalize our numbers for the large part of that Roundup Ready 1 and, also,
remember that the cotton acres that we've been projecting this year and companies and events that we sell mostly in Q3,
we've been anticipating a reduction of those cotton acres of two million to three million acres in the U.S. So if you take
all of those elements together, actually, the second half we are projecting represents a fairly nice growth coming from
the key drivers that we have seen in the first half, including Corn and Ag Productivity.
<A - Hugh Grant>: And then just thanks, Pierre. So we're pleased with where we are. We'll feel better when we get
some seed in the ground. On the glyphosate piece, real briefly, just to put it in context, so tracking well with the
strategy that we had laid out. We've seen some price increases this year. Glyphosate would now – Roundup would now
be tracking in the $10 to $12 a gallon range and would be on the upper end of that $10 to $12. And, Brett, maybe just a
little bit of color on how the 300 million gallons is panning out?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah, exactly. And as our approach has been for the last few years with our new strategy is
to focus on selling about 300 million gallons a year, and we're very much on track to do that. Also, the emphasis of
moving as much as we can to our branded business versus third-party sales and that continues in a favorable margin.
I'd also add on the Ag Productivity, specifically the Roundup side, that what we're really seeing from asset prices in
China is a range of $4 to $5 and something on that asset, which is substantially less volatility than what we saw years
ago. So I feel good about our strategy and how it's playing out. Recognize that there can be some volatility there but not
like what we've seen in historical patterns.
<Q - Don D. Carson>: Thank you.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Thanks, Don.

Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Hi.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: If I could start with one more on glyphosate. Have you sold more than half of your volume
– more than 150 million gallons so far in the first half or less?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah, we would've sold more than the halfway mark in the first half.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Okay. And then secondly, when would you need Chinese approval for Intacta in order to
ship for the second Brazilian soybean season?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah, Jeff, we would, as a rule of thumb, if we had it before fiscal year end, so the back end
August, we'd be feeling good for this year. The first year is going to be small shipments, relatively small shipments,
and we've – getting over the line before fiscal year-end close would be good news.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Okay. Good. Thank you very much.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Thanks for your questions.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: You know, you have been consistent with your price discipline raising your base germplasm
prices by 5% to 10%, I guess, over the last few years. But this new pricing model is not tested in an environment of
falling prices. So if Corn were to go down, if Corn prices were to fall because of yields or whatever, do you think you
could raise base pricing 5% to 10% without upsetting your customers?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah, P.J. Thanks for the question. I think it's a truly strategic question, so I would remind you
that in previous years, we didn't chase the peaks on our pricing. So when corn was sitting $8 we never aspired to chase
that. We've tried to be – what we've been consistent in our pricing philosophy. We've spent a lot of time discussing that
with growers and the feedback from growers, both in terms of how they've responded and how they've voted with their
pocketbooks, I think, underscores the consistency that we've been stressing.
So our world, we've been doing our budget and our forecasting on a $4 to $6 corn world. So we were never [ph]
aspiring (37:23) those peaks and we were never pricing against them. And I think when you look at the whole I expect,
from the Seed business is in a good place as you look at some of the commodity pricing that is potentially unfolding.
So never say never. But you look at the early days when corn was $2 or $3 a bushel, we saw some of our strongest
technology penetration curves in that timeframe. So we – I think the position that we've taken and the fact that we've
stuck to that over the last two or three years, I think, is being recognized by our grower customers.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Thank you. And I just have a clarification question. Have you licensed Intacta to any other
company?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah, we've licensed a number of companies in our space. And we followed the same doctrine
that we've been pursuing for the last 12, 13 years. So we've been very open in that licensing model.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Thank you.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question is coming from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. If we could just talk about the cost of goods sold this year
and the movement or the leverage or lack thereof between sales and gross profit in Seeds and Traits and assuming that
seed production costs and logistics costs next year are less, if we have a somewhat more normal crop and production,
do you think that leverage will show up next year? Or how should we be thinking about those costs this year versus
next year?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Vincent, thanks for your question. There's a lot of insight there coming off of one of the driest
production years in the last decade or so, and it did squeeze us on cost. But, Pierre, maybe you can key off that on how
you're thinking about next year in a more normalized environment.
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: Yeah, I mean, the way I'm thinking about that, Vincent, I'm just looking at our
performance this year in the first half and how we think about the whole year. And what we see is actually that our
strategy is working because you can see, specifically regarding corn, we're looking at top-line growth of 19% year to
year, which means we are growing volume and our pricing strategy is working and that's really the key for us.
However, as you noticed, this year we are hurt by higher cost of goods and this is not a surprise because we knew that
coming out of the summer we had last year where drought definitely impacted our production yield and actually pushed
us in using more winter production than in a normal year.
So I think your analysis is exactly right. I mean, this is something which is not structural. This is something which is
definitely linked to this unique drought situation that we faced last year. And actually, the results we see right now,
especially on the top line where we see volume growth and the leverage we get from price, makes us feel very good
about our ability to continue growing. I mean, the strategy is definitely working there.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: But how much should we – like in a normal – how much more cost of production or logistics
above what it should've been normally? Can you give us any sense of what the hit was this year?
<A - Pierre Courduroux>: It's difficult to evaluate and really quantify. But at this point in time, we're looking at
margins that are roughly flat from a year-to-year perspective. So I think when we were talking about the price lift we
were expecting early in the year, I mean, you can back-calculate where we should be hadn't we had those cost of goods
penalty.
<Q - Vincent Andrews>: Okay. Thanks. I'll follow-up.
<A - Hugh Grant>: That's good. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Good morning, Frank.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Hey, Hugh, you said at one point that we're at the front edge of significant Latin American
growth, and I just wanted to get an update from your perspective as to what's going on with the Brazilian farmer
situation. I know that you signed an agreement in terms of forgiveness of the $0.20 to $0.25 on Roundup Ready 1 in
exchange for the full royalties on Intacta. But there's been some farm groups lobbying against that agreement. And so
can you give us an update as to where that stands and how you think that plays out over the next year or so?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah, no, Frank. Thanks for the question. I'll maybe ask Brett to do the high-speed refresher. But I
think the headline news is, this is all about Intacta. We have done another year of Ground Breaker trials. We've now got

1,000 growers in – so about 2x the number of growers that we had in last year's Ground Breaker trials, more
geographically diverse, and we reconfirmed a four-bushel gain versus the old technology. So the gold ring in this, the
piece that we're chasing is getting Intacta out there as fast and as broadly as we can. But, Brett, maybe just to Frank's
point, just a quick recap and then what you're hearing in Brazil from growers.
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah, I think I'd – Frank, I'd step back, and if you think about that front edge, what's that –
the front edge of? Let's talk about corn. Two big things happening in corn at the same time, and I know they're hard to
parse out. But we've never fully penetrated Brazil corn with biotech so we have an acceleration of penetration of
biotech traits across all the corn acres. And at the same time that we're doing that, we're upgrading those biotech acres
to a new, higher-value biotech trait and that's going to carry on for a number of years. We have a lot of runway in front
of us there.
The same, to a lesser extent, happens in Argentina with Double PRO going to Triple PRO. Then in soybeans, as Hugh
was describing, I would tell you that as we talk with farmers, anytime you're going through a transition like this, you're
going to find various perspectives in the marketplace.
I feel really good about where we're at there. Here's where we're at. Every farmer in Brazil that's interested in soybeans
finds themselves in one of two places. They've either signed an agreement or can sign an agreement to move on from
Roundup Ready 1 and focus on Intacta, or we've deferred the billing and they won't be paying until there's a court
resolution.
So every farmer is covered in regards to Roundup Ready 1 in Brazil and now the focus and energy is on Intacta. I can't
overstate the excitement of a second year of significant performance coming in on Intacta, as Hugh said. And I will tell
you, as I talk to farmers across South America, the conversation is about Intacta. It's not about Roundup Ready 1. So
I'm really excited about where their focus is and, yes, there'll be some noise but we'll make that transition. I'm excited
about where we're at.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Cox from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Michael E. Cox>: Thanks a lot, and congratulations on a great quarter. My first question or my question is on
glyphosate, and I know that a number of questions have been asked about this. But I'd be curious what sort of supply
response you have started to see or anticipate seeing given the price movement in glyphosate both at the wholesale and
retail level?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Michael, can you say a little bit more on supply response or just...
<Q - Michael E. Cox>: From the generic producers, in particularly, China?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Okay. Yeah, so I'd say so far in an unpredictable world, it's been pretty predictable so far and the
spreads – what we've done with our new strategy over the last few years, we've focused on narrowing the spreads
between ours and the generics. So we've moved price this year to keep track with that generic volume. We are about
half of the world. The Chinese suppliers are about the other half. So that's why I say it's predictable.
But if you look at the volatility and the size of the spreads versus our last experience, as Brett made the point earlier,
that's a lot tighter this time around, Michael. So still early days in the season but feeling – with the volume that's out
there, we're feeling pretty good and I think we get visibility into 2014 from where we sit today.
<Q - Michael E. Cox>: That's great. Thank you.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Thanks for the question.

Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mark Connelly from CLSA. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Thank you. Hugh, you've made it pretty clear where the big growth is coming from. I
wonder if you could help us understand what the outlook is for the U.S. corn market. You know, when I look at Slide 7,
I still see a whole bunch of things in the pipeline there. Do you look at the U.S. as a steady growth market now, or how
should we think about that? And similarly, if you could just remind us of the timing of vegetables because you had
indicated over the next couple of years that was going to start to hit.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah, so on corn, I'm really pleased with the performance this year. The 36 million, 38 million
acres, we're continuing to break through hurdles, and I think there's some continued steady upgrades there.
The first question this morning was around our germplasm and price of the germplasm. That's been a sleeper. But all
the feedback that we get from growers as they continue to look for performance regardless of commodity price, and as
we continue to drive that performance through the germplasm as well as the traits, we're rewarded on price. This year's
a great example. We sell out of our best performing products early, and we sell out of them every year early. So
growers are focused on performance, and I think that would be the steady drumbeat in the U.S. I don't know, Brett, if
you have anything that you'd add beyond that?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: No. I think you've nailed it. I think that's their focus. And I would remind you that we
didn't talk a lot about it today, but that IFS is a very interesting concept that fits corn and we're going to be doing
Ground Breakers with IFS and that'll be an option for us in corn in the U.S., too.
<A - Hugh Grant>: And then veggies, nothing much to report; feeling better about it than a year ago. But still, demand
is still soft in some of those world areas. As we look long term in veggies, I think, and we've been told this for a couple
of years. But as we see the front end of that pipeline emerging, a lot of this in the coming years is going to focus on our
ability to add value through price and to improve performance on the molecular markers and the improved breeding
technologies that we're seeing coming out of our labs in California. But it's still ahead of us, I think.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Okay. Very good. Thank you.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Thanks for the questions.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed
with your question.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Yes. Good morning. With regard to the U.S. corn seed market, you're now pointing to the
high end of your 36 million to 38 million acre range for the Genuity Corn Seed family. It sounds like the USDA's
planting intentions numbers were pretty consistent with your expectations. So in that context, would you comment on
what is driving the move or your confidence to achieve the high end? Is it having to do with market share expectations,
availability? Perhaps you can provide some color along those lines.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah, I think you've answered it, Kevin. So we took the unprecedented step of putting our
estimate on acreage out there. And there's still a lot of vectoring on continued drought but some good moisture late in
our season but an earlier sell-in so there's kind of multiple moving parts. But the bottom line in this is it looks a lot like
96 million to 97 million acres.
And given that 96 million to 97 million acres, we've been seeing a strong build, Brett, in the order book and a
preferential pick within the order book for these technologies, and I think that's what gives us the confidence and it
banks on our production numbers. So I think you're – kind of what was it, say asked and answered. But maybe, Brett, I
don't know if you've got anything else to say on how that's shaping up.

<A - Brett D. Begemann>: I'd just add two things to what Hugh said. Number one, the Refuge-in-a-Bag convenience
has really gone over great. And everything we offer in the Refuge-Reducing family is Refuge-in-a-Bag now and that
convenience factor is huge, and I would argue, going to be really important this year with what could be a compressed
planting season as we see the moisture across the Midwest and not getting in the field as early as last year.
The other piece is, and I highlighted it in my comments, is the outstanding performance of SmartStax last year. And as
you look across that Corn Belt and the challenges farmers face with insects and continue to face, SmartStax is core.
And it's now our top-selling product out of the Refuge-Reducing family going right at that rootworm. So that's helped
move us in that direction as well, Kevin.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Mark Gulley from BGC Financial. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Mark R. Gulley>: Hey. Good morning, Hugh.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Morning.
<Q - Mark R. Gulley>: Since this is the first time you've had to talk to us post the DuPont settlement, I was a little
surprised that maybe you didn't take the opportunity to raise your long-term earnings growth estimate because, after all,
as Brett points out, you've secured a very large customer for a long period of time. So it would seem to me your
long-term growth rate could easily be above 15%. How should I think about that?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Mark, thanks for your comment. So we are delighted to have the deal done. We're pleased to
welcome DuPont Pioneer as a new licensee to our soybean technologies. And I think as you look – I never talked much
today about 2014 and 2015. As you looking at 2014, I guess I'd say it increases the certainty or improves the clarity or
our confidence as we look at those growth rates with DuPont, Inc. in there and some of the other growth drivers that
we've talked about this morning.
But frankly, at this time of year, maybe it's tradition, maybe it's common sense. But at this time of the year, we're more
focused on getting seed planted and getting the season nailed than looking further out.
But I take your point. I mean, it was a sizable deal. It's significant and it brings strength to the portfolio, and it gives
clarity on longer-term growth opportunities. So I think that's a conversation that we'll have as the year pans out rather
than pre-spring, I think.
<Q - Mark R. Gulley>: And just a quick follow-up, if it's a play on words, you've talked about Monsanto being a yield
company.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah.
<Q - Mark R. Gulley>: I'm wondering if you could also apply that to the financial side. Maybe, while you've talked
about share repurchases today, it would seem to me given the share price move and given the earnings visibility that a
sizable dividend increase could also be in the cards.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Well, so we're blessed. And I think it's more than a play on words. I think one begets the other,
right? So it starts with bushels and ends with dollars and our ability to deliver bushels with consistency in our price and
improves our pick with growers. It favors our opportunity to win each spring when we sit down at that kitchen table.
As Pierre outlined in his comments, and I'll maybe ask him to say another few words, we've looked at this from
buybacks and dividends. And as our financial strength increases, it's our shareowners' money and we will aggressively
repatriate. But, Pierre, I don't know if you want underscore that.

<A - Pierre Courduroux>: No, I think that's exactly right, Hugh. So our first priority always to be reinvesting in our
business, and we feel we've done that and we're on the verge of doing that again. However, as I mentioned this
morning, we feel extremely good about our balance sheet right now so we're going to move towards returning more of
the cash we generate towards our owners and, absolutely, dividend is one of the two tools we will be using.
The way we are thinking about it is, obviously, on a year-by-year basis. But the way we think about dividend is,
obviously, as a long-term commitment. So the balancing between dividend and buyback is something that we are
always very careful about and very considerate when making those types of moves and, obviously, working with our
board in those types of decisions. But what I can tell you today is that we're going to be more aggressive returning the
cash we generate to our owners because we feel very good about the position of our balance sheet.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Thanks for the question, Mark.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Laurence Alexander from Jefferies & Company. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Laurence Alexander>: Good morning. Two quick questions. First, did you have any kind of assumption for a
settlement with DuPont in your mid-teens guidance before the announcement? And second of all, as you look at the
cadence of profit margin improvement in corn over the next few years, do you get a better pricing position with your
new next-generation drought products if we remain in the kind of environment we've seen recently or are you neutral
on terms of the environment and the climate conditions?
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yes, taking the second piece last. I think we'd say we were neutral. It's nice to have that
opportunity, but you can't speculate around that. I'd say we're neutral. And in the DuPont question, it's some and some.
So some of that was baked in because we continue to expect growth in beans, but it's nice to have, to the earlier
question, it's nice to have the certainty around that rather than the speculation of outcomes in courts and appeals and
protracted processes.
We've, all of us over the last 10 years, tried to reach a business resolution and I'm pleased to see that we finally got to
that and that will broaden the choices for growers. They've now got the chance to choose brands by technology options,
and some of that is going to be, obviously, incremental growth to where we were forecasting. But I think the way I
would think about it is it's clarity, it's certainty and it strengthens the portfolio in the next couple of years.
<Q - Laurence Alexander>: Thank you.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Sure.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is coming from Tim Tiberio with Miller Tabak and Company. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Tim J. Tiberio>: Good morning. I'm looking at the Intacta yield data that you provided. Obviously, you have not
provided any guidance on final pricing. But maybe you can just walk us through how you're thinking through that
process. Will this be strictly pricing the new yield data on the basis of that $80 per acre value capture? Or will you be
looking at 2014 futures at that point and then coming up with, maybe, an average of the yield between the initial yield,
Ground Breakers, and then the 2012/2013 data.
<A - Hugh Grant>: Yeah, I'll maybe – so it's a good question. I'll maybe let Brett say a few words on that. The algebra
and the trigonometry isn't that precise because we're pricing once a year. So in reality we're pricing forward, and to the
point of being consistent, you have to kind of stake a claim and then stick with it.

I think it's going to be fast on its ramp. There's tremendous demand, and the good news is we're reconfirming that
there's four new bushels coming up on the farm and that's a really big deal. But, Brett, as you've talked to some of these
massive growers down there, what was that price talk and how's that philosophy playing out?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Yeah, I think it's important to go back to what has been our pricing philosophy and we're
going to stick consistent with that philosophy. It's how much incremental value has been created? And this year
confirms, again for the second time, that it's in the range of $80 based on assumptions, of course, and that comes from
improved yields, reduced insect control cost, et cetera.
So we'll look at that, and we'll look at that in conjunction with the offers that we have available in the marketplace and
we'll shoot for a percentage sharing of that. But at the same time, not only will we be thinking about Intacta and the
sharing around Intacta, we'll be thinking about the pipeline that Rob talked about in the first quarter call where we're
going to be looking at Intacta 2 and Intacta 3 coming behind it and how do we build a trajectory into those.
So this is about the long-term approach to soybeans, and as I mentioned, soybeans becoming a significant $1 billion
driver for our South America business over the next five years, and that's how we're thinking about this is in a whole
strategic approach to that. We'll be more specific with that as we get final approvals and get those conversations done
with our farmer customers.
<Q - Tim J. Tiberio>: And from a timing standpoint, how should we think about that? Can that be finalized prior to
the Chinese import approval or is that potentially a gate?
<A - Brett D. Begemann>: Well, we're in conversations with farmers all the time about how we're seeing the value,
and they are as well, and we'll build it into our overall process. But what I would remind you of is as much as I'd like to
have a whole bunch of Intacta to sell next year, we'll be limited biologically on how much we can produce. So of
course, the Chinese approval will be a significant part of how we choose to take that new technology into the
marketplace, but it won't be the driver necessarily on how we think about our pricing. But it'll be closer to planting time
than where we are today.
<A - Bryan Hurley>: And, Kevin, I recognize we're getting near the end of our call. I think we probably have time for
one final question. Then I want to leave just a little bit of time for Hugh to wrap things up.
Operator
Certainly, sir. Then our final question today will come from Bill Young from ChemSpeak LLC. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - William R. Young, Ph.D.>: Good morning. Maybe you could fill us in a little bit on your outlook for market
share in soybeans here in the U.S. I think you rank number two now, and you've got your Roundup Ready 2 Yield, et
cetera, so Xtend coming out. What do you see this year and what do you see going forward?
<A - Hugh Grant>: So the good news, Bill – so thanks for your question. The good news is on our forecast and we're
seeing, as I mentioned, or as Brett mentioned, 39 million to 41 million acres of Roundup Ready 2 Yield. So it's only a
few brief years ago there was the questions on whether Roundup Ready Yield would ever make it, and it became the
key technology play in soybeans, so very pleased with the progress. 39 million to 41 million, who knows where the
markets going to land but nice growth.
And as a couple of questions have come up here, but the recent deal with DuPont Pioneer and welcoming them onto
that platform, we now pretty much license the industry in the U.S. so growers are going to have their pick of brand by
technology. So nice growth, and I'm always little bit nervous until we get that seed planted in the ground. But if you
look at strength in order book, you look at our forecasts and you look at the way the season is setting up, we're feeling
pretty good with the opportunity and the growth in the segment.
<Q - William R. Young, Ph.D.>: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.

Hugh Grant
Sure, Bill. So I appreciate your – I'll maybe just say a few words and wrap up.
Thanks for your patience. We're a couple of minutes over today, but it's an important quarter. I started by saying that
the quarter or Q2's important because the look that it gives us, not just this year, but as a few of the questions came up,
it gives us an early indicator into next year and beyond. And I think I'd reemphasize that notion as we close by just
summarizing three points that I would take away from this unique vantage point as you look towards the remainder of
this year and beyond.
So first of all, we've raised guidance today. We're on track because of that for our third consecutive year of strong
growth with our range reaching greater than 20% ongoing EPS growth if you take the high end of that guidance range.
And I think that speaks to our momentum, our performance and the continued improved relationship that we're seeing
with our grower customers.
Secondly, as Brett mentioned in this call, we've the right drivers in place to drive our growth going forward and that
speaks to our focus on customers over the last few years and our opportunity as a company dedicated to yield in the
broadest sense of yield.
And then finally and thirdly, our results show the power of an increasingly global business, particularly in the
Americas. So we're very focused on turning that opportunity into results, and I look forward to reporting on progress
with you this year once we get the U.S. crop planted this spring.
So thanks for joining us, again, on the call this morning, and thanks for your continued support.
