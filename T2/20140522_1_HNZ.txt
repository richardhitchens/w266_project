MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Beautina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to
welcome everyone to the H. J. Heinz Company First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being
recorded at the request of the H.J. Heinz Company.
Today's presentation includes forward-looking statements as defined in the U.S. Security Law, which are based on
current expectations, subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances and which are not a guarantee of future
performance. Actual results may differ materially due to a variety of factors, including the Risk Factors listed in
Heinz's Form 10-KT, which was filed on March 7. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking
statement except as required by the law.
Today's remarks will include non-GAAP financial measures, which are reconciled to GAAP numbers in the first
quarter 2014 Form 10-Q, which was filed by the Hawk Acquisition Intermediate Corporation II, on behalf of itself and
Heinz, on May 9. These and other SEC filings are available on Heinz's website at the Investor Relations page.
I would now like to turn the call over to Paulo Basilio, Executive Vice President and CFO. Mr. Basilio, you may begin
your conference.
Paulo Luiz Araújo Basílio
Thank you. Good morning. I am pleased to provide you with an overview of Heinz's results for our first quarter of
calendar 2014, reflecting continued higher profitability versus last year. Sales were $2.8 billion, down 2% from the
prior year due to unfavorable foreign currency impacts of 2.4% and divestitures of 0.2%.
Organic sales or volume plus price increased by 0.7%. This included favorable pricing impacts of 1.1%. Our volume
was down 0.4% including an estimated 2% timing benefit from shipping ahead of our U.S. cut-over SAP at the end of
March. We expect to see a corresponding volume decrease in the second quarter.
As shown in detail on pages 41 and 42 of our Form 10-Q, our first quarter operating results were impacted by
productivity charges this year, and special items in both this year and last year. Setting these aside, gross profit
increased by more than 5%, and gross margin expanded by 270 basis points. Operating income increased by almost
40%, and operating margin expanded by over 600 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA grew by nearly 33%.
With the start of this new fiscal year, we have transitioned our segment reporting to align with our new organizational
structure. I will briefly cover each of our five reporting segments and their first quarter results.
Let's begin with North America, our largest segment. In Q1, sales increased by 0.5%, with volume up 1.8% including a
5% impact from SAP shipment timing, offset by frozen and meals and snacks category softness. Canadian foreign
exchange decreased sales by 1.3%. Gross profit increased 6.6% and gross margin expanded by 230 basis points,
reflecting higher volume and the benefits from prior-year restructuring productivity initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA grew
more than 25%, through higher gross profit along with lower SG&A spending.

Turning to Europe, sales were up 1.7% in Q1, driven by favorable foreign exchange of 4.5%. Volume declined 2.2%,
primarily due to soft UK soup category sales from their mild winter. A divestiture also decreased sales by 0.2% – 0.8%.
Gross profit increased by nearly 11%, while gross margin expanded by 330 basis points, benefiting from prior-year
productivity initiatives. Adjusted EBITDA grew by nearly 30%, reflecting higher gross profit, lower SG&A spending
and favorable foreign exchange.
Moving to Asia-Pac, sales decreased by 10%, resulting from unfavorable foreign exchange of 9.3%. Volume
decreasing by 1.9%, primarily in Australia, while price increased by 1.2%. Gross profit decreased by nearly 15%, and
gross margin contracted by 170 basis points. This reflects increased expense from purchase account impacts, along with
lower volume. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 4%, as lower gross profit was more than offset by SG&A savings.
In Latin America, sales decreased by – decreased in first Q by nearly 6% due to unfavorable foreign exchange of 7.5%.
Volume declined by 5.3%, and price increased by 7%. Gross profit increased by 7.2%, and gross margin expanded by
420 basis points, reflecting a delay in Venezuela price increases this time last year. Adjusted EBITDA nearly doubled,
due to the gross profit increase and lower SG&A.
And finally, in RIMEA, our segment made up of Russia, India, Middle East and Africa, Q1 sales decreased by 4.2%,
due to unfavorable foreign exchange of 12.2%. Volume increased by 3.1% and price increased by 4.9%. Gross profit
decreased by 2%, but gross profit margin expanded by 90 basis points. Adjusted EBITDA increased by 17% from
lower SG&A costs.
Now, turning to cash flow. Cash from operating activities, net of investing activities, was $258 million compared to
$394 million a year ago. This decrease reflects unfavorable movements in inventories, accrued liabilities and additional
pension funding, partially offset by favorable movements in accounts payable, lower capital spending, and increased
proceeds from the sale of property, plant, and equipment.
Cash used for productivity and restructuring initiatives was $102 million, versus none this time last year. Cash used for
financing activities totaled $217 million versus $525 million last year. Reductions in net payments of short-term debt
more than offset the increase in dividends.
On March 30, 2014, the company had total debt of $14.8 billion and cash and cash equivalents of $2.5 billion. We
expect these cash and equivalents will be utilized to liquidate accrued obligations under the Merger Agreement, pay
preferred stock dividends, meet seasonal working capital requirements, and fund future restructuring expenditures.
In summary, we are pleased with the company's performance in the first quarter and our growth momentum. We are
committed to driving the best-in-class efficiencies that will strengthen our business, while reinvesting in our brands and
always putting the consumer first.
Thank you and have a great day.
Operator
