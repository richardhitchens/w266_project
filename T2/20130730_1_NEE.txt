Moray P. Dewhurst
Thank you, Julie, and good morning, everyone. NextEra Energy had a very successful second quarter. Our financial
results were good, driven by new contracted renewable assets at Energy Resources and strong operating performance
across the portfolio and put us a little ahead of where we had expected to be at this point in the year. All of our major
existing capital projects progressed satisfactorily, most notably with the Cape Canaveral modernization coming into
service ahead of schedule and under budget.
In addition, we made excellent progress in firming up some of the additional investment opportunities we had
previously discussed and in developing initiatives, which we expect will allow us to maintain our strong competitive
cost position. As a consequence, our expectations for this year have improved, slightly while our longer-term financial
expectations now have additional support. All in all, it was a very good quarter.
At FPL we maintained a regulatory ROE of 11%, while continuing to invest capital in ways that improve the value that
we deliver to our customers. Average regulatory capital employed grew roughly 11.5% over the same quarter last year
and was the main driver of our net income growth of about 11%.
The FPL team continues to execute well on our major capital projects. The new units at Cape Canaveral entered service
in April, under budget and more than month ahead of schedule. Their fuel efficiency is roughly 30% better than the old
units they replaced. And our customers began benefiting from their fuel savings earlier than anticipated. The roughly
$1.3 billion Riviera Beach modernization project remains on schedule to enter service in June of 2014 and our third
modernization project at Port Everglades reached a major milestone earlier this month with the demolition of the old
1960's era plant. Construction of a new plant is slated to begin next spring.
FPL also made good progress in pursuing additional initiatives that we have previously mentioned. During the quarter,
we filed petitions with the Florida Public Service Commission to accelerate our storm hardening program and upgrade
our peaking capacity systems. And we concluded our analysis on the most cost-effective alternative for additional
natural gas transportation capacity into Florida. We will discuss these initiatives in greater detail later in the call.
At Energy Resources, contribution to adjusted earnings per share was up $0.15 or 37% over the prior year comparable
quarter, primarily as a result of new contracted assets added to the portfolio, as well as strong operating performance
from our existing assets.
We continue to make good progress on our backlog of contracted renewables projects. Our Canadian wind program is
progressing satisfactorily, with approximately 125 megawatts expected to enter service this year, while the remaining
roughly 475 megawatts are targeted to come online in 2014 and 2050.
We continue to expect roughly 300 megawatts of new contracted solar capacity to enter service in the U.S. this year.
The remaining approximately 500 megawatts of the solar backlog with which we started the year are expected to come
online by the end of 2016. In addition, we will have at least another 40 megawatts, as I will detail later.
Turning to the U.S. wind business. Since our last quarterly call, Energy Resources signed contracts for nearly 650
megawatts of new capacity, bringing the total to date for the 2013 to 2014 program to roughly 975 megawatts, of which
250 megawatts are expected to enter service this year.
This places us firmly in the middle of the range of 500 megawatts to 1,500 megawatts that we discussed at our Investor
Conference in March, and we are currently in discussions with customers that could bring the total higher. The progress
we made during the second quarter continues to support our long-term expectations for EPS growth, and we continue to

see a range of growth in adjusted earnings per share of 5% to 7% off the 2012 base.
While the baseline capital deployment program we discussed in March continues to support the lower end of this range
and while we are pleased with the developments of the last three months, we should also note that 2016 is a long way in
the future and there are so many sources of uncertainty that could push us towards either the higher or the lower end of
the range.
Let me now walk through our results of the second quarter of 2013. I will begin with the results at FPL, before moving
on to Energy Resources and then the consolidated numbers. For the second quarter of 2013, FPL reported net income
of $391 million or $0.92 per share, up $0.07 per share year-over-year. The principal driver of FPL's earnings growth in
the quarter was continued investment in the business. We invested roughly $700 million in the quarter and expect to
invest approximately $2.9 billion for the full year.
Regulatory capital employed growth of roughly 11.5% over the same quarter last year was the main driver of growth in
net income of approximately 11%. We utilized $82 million of reserve amortization during the quarter, enabling us to
maintain a regulatory ROE of 11%, and we remain comfortable that the balance, which we expect to be roughly $180
million at the end of the year, will be adequate through 2016.
Recall that over the past two years, we have utilized a larger proportion of reserve amortization during the first half of
the year and we do not expect this year to be any different. We also had expected 2013 to require higher reserve
amortization than in subsequent years. And this remains true. For 2013, we believe that achieving an 11% to 11.25%
ROE is reasonable.
Economic indicators in Florida continue trending positively during the second quarter, particularly those associated
with the recovery of the housing market. Housing inventory levels continued to decline, spurring new construction and
price increases across the state.
Housing starts in Florida are up 67% year-to-date, compared to 28% nationally. Florida building permits, a leading
indicator of residential new service accounts, are now at levels not seen since 2007 and have outpaced the nation's
quarterly growth by 41%. South Florida home prices are up nearly 13% for the year, which is the highest annual growth
we have seen since 2006 and above the Case-Shiller composite index.
The broader economic outlook in Florida also remains positive. Florida seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in June
dropped 1.7 percentage points from the prior year to 7.1%, outpacing the improvement in the national unemployment
rate of 0.6% over the same period. Other positive economic data across the state include improvement in taxable sales,
which recently surpassed their pre-recession peak, as well as the Consumer Confidence Index, which has also
recovered to pre-recession levels.
As Florida's economy continues to recover, it also continues to diversify. According to a recent IT industry report,
Florida ranked third in the number of high-tech establishments and fifth in high-tech employment in the U.S.
International trade is growing as well as Florida now ranks second in the number of exporting companies, behind only
California.
Encouraging economic data in Florida continues to be generally reflected in the internal indicators that we follow at
FPL. During the second quarter, we averaged approximately 35,000 more customers than in the comparable quarter in
2012, representing an increase of 0.8%. This general level of increase has now been consistent for more than two years
and we are optimistic that it will increase modestly in the years ahead. Total retail sales increased 1.0% during the
quarter, as customer growth and increased underlying usage offset much cooler-than-normal temperatures we
experienced in May.
The number of inactive meters declined 8.5% year-over-year in June, the strongest annual decline in over a decade. We
have typically seen seasonal increases in inactive meters between May and June, as many retirees leave for the summer.
This year was unusual, as we saw inactivate meters actually fall 2.8% between May and June, indicating either less
seasonality or a true tightening of the housing market.

On the other hand, the proportion of low-usage accounts has remained relatively static and appears to reflect a
semi-permanent increase in the proportion of investor-owned and internationally owned properties.
New service accounts are on track to total between 35,000 and 40,000 for the year. And as was the case last quarter, we
continue to see growth in our industrial accounts, which are generally tied to the construction industry in our service
territory. Overall, we remain encouraged by the positive economic trends in customer metrics in our service territory.
As many of you will recall, FPL issued a request for proposals in December of 2012 for new natural gas transportation
capacity that will help ensure Florida's continued access to clean, affordable, U.S. produced fuel necessary to meet the
state's growing needs.
Only two major pipeline systems serve Central and Southern Florida today. A third new pipeline system will increase
the diversity and reliability of gas supply for Florida's residents and will bring substantial direct and indirect economic
benefits to the state.
During the quarter, we completed an extensive analysis of all bids and determined that the best solution for meeting
customers' needs economically is a combination of the Sabal Trail Transmission proposal advanced by Spectra Energy
for a new northern pipeline originating in Southwestern Alabama and terminating at the new Central Florida Hub.
And the proposal submitted by Florida Southeast Connection, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of NextEra Energy,
for a second southern pipeline to connect the Central Florida Hub to FPL's Martin plant. This combination was
substantially more economical than any other combination of bids and promises to deliver excellent value to FPL's
customers for decades to come. Late last week, FPL filed with the PSC for prudence review of the necessary
contractual arrangements for both Sabal Trail and Florida Southeast Connection and we are seeking regulatory
approval by the end of 2013.
Consistent with what we have stated previously about NextEra Energy's willingness to invest in the northern pipeline to
ensure that FPL has the necessary natural gas transportation capacity when it is needed, we have agreed to invest
approximately one-third of the capital needed to complete the Sabal Trail pipeline, which is expected to total roughly
$3 billion. The NextEra energy investment in Florida Southeast Connection is expected to total approximately $550
million.
Let me now turn to Energy Resources, which reported second quarter 2013 GAAP earnings of $229 million or $0.54
per share. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $238 million or $0.56 per share. Adjusted earnings exclude
the mark-to-market effects of non-qualifying hedges, which beginning in the second quarter of 2013 include interest
rate hedges related to the Spain solar project, as well as the net effect of other than temporary impairments, or OTTI, on
certain investments.
Energy Resources had a strong quarter with contribution to adjusted EPS increasing $0.15 year-over-year.
Contributions from new investments placed into service since the second quarter of 2012 increased $0.12. We are
targeting approximately 300 megawatts of solar this year for CITC election equating to roughly $75 million in full-year
adjusted earnings.
Adjusted earnings per share from our existing assets increased $0.04 over the second quarter last year, due to favorable
wind generation, the absence of a power derate at Seabrook, and the absence of outages at our two Texas combined
cycle plants. Our gas infrastructure business increased $0.02 from additional production, while the customer supply and
trading businesses were down $0.03. All other effects were minor.
Energy Resources had a successful quarter in the capital markets. We completed $170 million differential membership
interest or tax equity transaction on approximately 160 megawatts of contracted wind projects. We continue to expect
the proportion of PTCs allocated to investors to grow to nearly 50% in 2013, up from approximately 41% in 2012.
We also completed the company's largest project financing in our history, a $1.15 billion term loan on our natural gas
plants in Texas, which significantly exceeds the book value of the assets. The success of this financing positions our
Texas portfolio well and is indicative of our continued ability to access different segments of the capital markets at
attractive rates.

We will continue to pursue suitable tax equity and project finance structures to support our overall corporate credit
position and our cash flow growth year-to-date is consistent with our projections for credit metric improvement that we
discussed at our Investor Conference in March.
I want to take a moment to address a number of recent inquiries from investors about our interest in forming a so-called
Yieldco for a segment of Energy Resources' contracted assets. While we have made no decisions yet and do not feel
any great urgency to undertake a major structural change that might prove difficult or costly to reverse, we are actively
examining this and other alternatives that might highlight the value of our contracted renewable asset portfolio or might
enable us to access a pool of capital with different risk/return requirements.
As we examine these alternatives, we are very focused on the question of whether and how they might create long-term
sustainable value for our shareholders. And we're sensitive to the fact that our situation is unique and, therefore, blindly
copying a solution that is suitable for another company may not be the best for our shareholders.
Looking at the company on a consolidated basis for the second quarter of 2013 NextEra Energy's GAAP net income
was $610 million or a $1.44 per share. NextEra Energy's 2013 second quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS was
$620 million and $1.46, respectively.
The Corporate and Other segment was down slightly from the same quarter last year, but we continue to expect the
full-year contributions from this segment to improve modestly relative to 2012.
Before taking your questions, let me turn the call over to Jim Robo for some closing remarks.
James L. Robo
Thanks, Moray. At our Investor Conference in March, we laid out a series of potential incremental investment
opportunities at both our major businesses that we indicated could take us beyond the growth profile implied by the
backlog of projects that we enjoyed at that time. I would like to take a moment to summarize where we stand on those
opportunities.
Starting with FPL, we indicated that we saw the potential for investing additional dollars in storm hardening and
reliability programs, depending upon progress in improving our already strong O&M performance. We've now filed
with the PSC a proposed storm hardening plan that will effectively accelerate roughly $400 million of capital spending
into the 2013 through 2016 time period and we've also increased our expectations for general infrastructure capital
expenditures for the same period by roughly $700 million.
All these initiatives are designed to improve our T&D service reliability or to otherwise improve customer service. We
are confident our cost position will allow us to absorb these expenditures under the rate agreement, while still earning
an adequate return for our shareholders.
In June, we completed our analysis on the most economical way to upgrade our peaking capacity and on June 28 we
filed with the PSC a plan for upgrades that will cost approximately $820 million and will be completed by the end of
2016. We believe this proposed program should be eligible for recovery under the environmental cost recovery clause.
A hearing is scheduled to be held in November and a decision is expected later that month.
As Moray mentioned earlier, our capital commitment to support the development and construction of a new third gas
pipeline could total roughly $1.6 billion and we hope to have a PSC decision on this project by the end of the year.
We continue to look for opportunities to bring more solar generation to Florida and have 500 megawatts of sites more
or less ready to move forward. However, we think the most likely timeframe for this initiative will be in 2015 or 2016.
And finally, we continue to pursue opportunities to serve others within the state, either at retail or through wholesale
contracts and we hope to close the Vero Beach acquisition in 2014. At Energy Resources, our U.S. wind program for
2013 and 2014 now stands at close to 1,000 megawatts or roughly $1.7 billion worth of capital expenditures, with

potential to grow up to 1,500 megawatts. We are making progress on our initiative to add up to 300 megawatts of
incremental U.S. solar by pursuing both greenfield development and acquisition opportunities. We have already signed
contracts on 40 megawatts of U.S. solar earlier this year and we see the possibility of one additional large-scale project
being finalized within the next few months.
Underpinning all of our new investment and growth initiatives is our continued commitment to enhancing our already
strong competitive cost position. We have undertaken a companywide initiative aimed at rethinking our approach to all
aspects of how we do business and I'm very pleased with the many thoughtful and creative ideas that our employees
have put forth.
While we are only just beginning to move into the implementation, we believe that the entire portfolio of ideas will
enable us to attain our goal of keeping total nonfuel O&M flat in nominal terms at FPL through 2016 and, at the same
time, support Energy Resources growth objectives. This companywide initiative has also helped identify a number of
areas where we expect to improve margins and grow revenue at Energy Resources.
At our March conference, we indicated that the capital associated with all of our incremental opportunities might total
as much as $9 billion. To-date, we have firmed up roughly $5 billion of incremental growth capital that we expect to
deploy through 2016. While we still have a long way to go to bring the projects shown on this slide to fruition, I'm
pleased with the progress we've made.
Although the exact proportions will vary, at this point we continue to see roughly 60% of our capital expenditures
going towards FPL and other rate-regulated opportunities, while nearly all our growth capital and energy resources is
going into long-term contracted assets.
Consequently, we continue to expect our portfolio mix and earnings profile to shift towards a more regulated and
long-term contracted business. Adjusted EBITDA coming from our regulated and long-term contracted operations is
expected to reach roughly 84% of the total in 2016.
Turning to the financial outlook. We are not anticipating that the second half of the year will be quite as strong as the
first half. But based on our performance year-to-date, we think it is reasonable to expect our full-year adjusted EPS to
be in the upper half of the $4.70 to $5 range that we had previously communicated.
For the longer-term outlook, we continue to see adjusted EPS growing at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7%
through 2016, off a 2012 base. The positive developments of this quarter clearly provide additional support for this
growth range. As always our expectations are subject to the usual caveats we provide, including normal weather and
operating conditions.
As we continue to invest to build and grow our businesses, we expect to maintain our strong credit position. Our cash
flow profile is improving, which by itself will help our credit metrics return to historical levels.
In addition, as we've discussed at the Investor Conference in March, we currently expect to issue incremental equity to
the extent our capital program requires it. There has been no major change in our thinking here, with the potential for
up to $1.5 billion of incremental equity, if we were to be at the top end of our range of capital investment. Given the
likely timelines for various regulatory proceedings, we expect we will have a firmer sense of our requirements early in
2014.
Before turning the call back to Moray for questions, let me close by again summarizing our focus for the remainder of
2013. First as always, we must maintain our focus on excellence in day-to-day operations. We can never afford to lose
sight of the fact that our long-term success is built on delivering outstanding value for our customers at FPL and on
operating efficiently and reliably across the portfolio.
Second, we will be very focused on moving the large portfolio of ideas we have developed for improving productivity
in day-to-day operations from the idea stage to practical reality. We have much implementation planning and of course
execution ahead of us to ensure the customers and shareholders ultimately realize the value of the good work that has
been done so far.

At FPL, we have two monetization projects underway that we are committed to bringing into service on schedule and
on budget. We will also be working on a larger portfolio of reliability investments, primarily in the T&D system, which
we are committed to completing as soon as we practically can. And third, we have some important new initiatives,
particularly the peaker upgrades and the new gas pipeline that will require development, regulatory and ultimately large
scale construction activities to bring to fruition. The FPL team will have much on their plate.
At Energy Resources, in addition to a focus on excellence in daily operations, we must continue to push forward with
development and construction on the large backlog of contracted renewable projects that we have, which today totals
more than 2,400 megawatts, while also seeking additional opportunities to add to that backlog. The Energy Resources
team will have much on their plate as well.
Of course, this is not the sum total of our challenges but, if we are successful with these, we will have a strong future
ahead of us.
With that, we will now open the line for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will first go to the site of Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Your line is open.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: Hey, good morning, guys.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Morning, Dan.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: Just kind of on this Yieldco conversation, I know you guys are still in the evaluation mode. But
a number of years ago when the wind IPO was a very popular idea, I know you guys took a look at that also. Can you
just maybe share your thoughts on what you guys learned looking through the process of separation and what kind of
bearing that can have as you think about the institutional impact if you guys were to go forward or something at this
point?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Sure, I'll give that a try. Just reflecting back on where we were back in 2006, 2007, one of
the things that we observed then and it would certainly apply in the current case is that there are some incremental costs
associated with setting up the separate structure. So we shouldn't – they're not massive, but we shouldn't underestimate
them either.
So for us, that suggests that we really need to try and understand whether there is a reasonably long-term sustainable
opportunity here or whether we're just seeing a sort of transient divergence in capital market prices. So I think if you
reflect on the renewable spinoff phase, at least a couple of those looked very strong initially, but the performance was
not sustained. And I think reflecting on where we are now, we wouldn't want to be in a situation where we've incurred
all the incremental costs and only short time later we find ourselves effectively looking for a way to reverse that.
So having said that, to the extent that there's really a pool of capital here that prices certain risks characteristic
differently than the main capital markets, that is something that we would certainly want to try and take advantage of. I
should point out, however, that isn't necessarily simply a public pool of capital, but maybe other ways of accessing
investors who have the same sort of risk/return profile.
So one of the other things that I've talked about with at least some of you before is that we've – have in the mix is also
whether there are individual large investors who would be interested in a portion – taking a position in a portion of the
portfolio, so there's a variety of structural ways that we might go about accessing that sort of capital. So those are some
of the things we're looking at right now.

<Q - Daniel Eggers>: Okay. And I guess just on – the wind additions were quite strong in the quarter and interesting.
If you look at the Colorado projects, they were done because the economics were good, not because they were trying to
meet renewable standards. I didn't know Armando or Mike or somebody wanted to talk about kind of the bigger
landscape for projects that you guys are looking at for customers? And what is the prospects? And how long is the
timetable do you think to sign contracts between now and year-end to qualify for PTCs?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Let me ask Armando to address it. But first, just generally, I don't think there's been a
great deal of change in what we're seeing. Obviously, customers as well as we are aware of what the situation is with
the PTC program right now, so there's a strong incentive to the extent that you either have a renewable portfolio
obligation in the near-term or to the extent that the economics in your particular area look attractive to negotiate and
sign if you can. But, Armando, you want to comment further?
<A - Armando Pimentel, Jr.>: Dan, what we're seeing – what we're seeing right now is there was certainly a good
slew of RFP opportunities, I'd say, starting late first quarter, really progressing through the second quarter this year. As
Moray just indicated though, everyone is keenly aware keenly aware of the PTC expiration. Once again, the words are
a bit different this time around than they have been in the past. What we're seeing right now is – is a slew of additional
RFP opportunities out there. Whether all of those opportunities – whether all of those RFPs come to fruition in real
projects remains to be seen.
I'd say that the majority of the opportunities that we're seeing are still RPS related, but there's a good portion of the
opportunities that where either the states or the individual customers have met their RPS requirements and are really
looking to buy, what we call, economic wind. So I'd say there's another two to three months, probably this year, where
we will – we and others will have the opportunity to sign up projects for 2013 and 2014. And I think after that it will
slow down a bit.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Yeah, I think, if we're – as I said before, if we're not kind of buttoned down by the fall,
then it's probably not going to happen unless there's some change in the PTC program. So there is a clear sense of
urgency.

Our next question comes from the site of Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Good morning.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning, Stephen.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Congratulations on a good quarter.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Thank you.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Moray, I wanted to go to the point you mentioned about thinking about long-term sustainable
value of a yield company, the pros and cons. One of the dynamics that I look at a lot is the earnings profile for the
business relative to free cash flow. And currently Resources has very good earnings, but the free cash flow is far greater
than the earnings. And that's also not a profile you see for renewables assets. Is that a dynamic that you all think about
in the context of a Yieldco?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: It's certainly in the mix. I wouldn't say that it's – at least at this stage, one of the principal
drivers that we're seeing. And by that, I mean, that the cash flow to earnings profile will naturally change over time.
And as we've discussed, certainly as we discussed at the Investor Conference, in the next couple years, we're going to
see that strong cash flow generation at Energy Resources much more manifest in the overall corporate numbers. Just

the way the dynamics of the portfolio are moving.
So I think that's going to become more obvious anyway. I think on the – the fundamentals of the Yieldco, it seems to be
more around whether there's a systematic difference in the way certain investors value different combinations of
essentially risk and growth. I mean, obviously, what you're doing in a Yieldco format is you're creating something that
has very visible yield, very visible income. And also the potential for – essentially a certain degree of controllable
growth or pre-specified growth, maybe is a better way of putting it.
Well, that kind of structure, it seems to me in today's environment should be very attractive to investors, so that's not in
question. The question is whether the valuation of that cash flow stream in a separate format is in fact any higher than
is implicit in the overall corporate format. And that's a question that is a little tougher to sort out.
So one of the things that we certainly want to do is take advantage of the fact that we're not under any time pressure
here to see how some of the existing vehicles that are now out there trade. I think that's going to give us a lot more
insight.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: That's very helpful. And just as a follow-up. If you think about the M&A environment for
renewables assets, I know in the past that you've been targeting double-digit unlevered returns and that would put the
levered equity returns, in our view at least, above 20%.
These days what we see at least the target return levels continue to come down. It's a competitive environment, more
into the sort of low double-digit equity returns. As you think about a Yieldco as a currency relative to say NextEra,
which is – and what many investors would think on a sort of EPS accretion basis. How do you see a Yieldco as – in the
context of M&A and growth?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Well, I guess, to me it comes back to the point that I was discussing earlier, which is
whether there's fundamentally a different pool of investors with different – who place different value on certain risks
and growth combinations. To the extent there is then it seems to me you want to take advantage of that source of
capital, regardless. To the extent that it's not, then I think a Yieldco, so called Yieldco currency could end up simply
misleading you as to the appropriate prices.
In other words, I would hate for – to be in the situation where having such a vehicle puts pressure on you to lower the
underlying returns that you're targeting in the things that you're going after because those things really should be based
on the investors' risk-adjusted opportunity costs. So I'm a little bit leery of it in that respect. But again, I'd want to
emphasize it – to me it really comes down to the question of whether there's a distinct pool of investors who
fundamentally value different cash flow streams with different risk and growth characteristics differently.

<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: I guess we beat the Yieldco question to death, so I won't go there. Can you just – what was the
wind resource last quarter? I know you revamped your algorithm.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: It's – there's a new chart in the back of the release, which we've recalibrated and frankly
simplified our calculation of the wind resource. So we have reintroduced it. I just want to caution people that these new
numbers are not comparable to the old numbers that we had. Offline, we can talk about all the gory details of that, but
the bottom line is that in the first quarter it was slightly below. I think it was like 97%.

<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: The short answer is I don't know on the current basis exactly because we haven't gone
back and redone everything in history. But it was certainly below average, so there's no question that the average wind
resource shifted around from below long-term averages to above long-term averages.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Okay. And then just two short questions, you talked about second half might be a little more
challenging, could you outline some of those challenges? And then just an update on where things are in Spain?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Sure, on the second half – I guess two points on the second half, first of all, the comment
was meant to say that some of the things that have been good in the first half are just things that were good in first half.
And we have no necessary reason to believe that they're going to perpetuate into the second half. And then secondly
and separately, there are some things that we see ahead in the second half, primarily for Energy Resources that will, we
expect, be a little more of a challenge.
The main one – two principal ones are certain sort of timing matters on the O&M front. So I think we're just a little bit
ahead of where we expected to be in the first half, some of that will reverse. But the bigger thing is the – so far at least
we haven't had much summer weather in Texas, so I think the – excuse me, the opportunities open for, what we call,
asset optimization activities in the Texas portfolio are going to be a little less than we would either expect for a normal
year or relative to last year.
And the second question, on Spain, forgive me – we've – I've talked to so many people about different developments in
Spain and so many things have happened over the course of the past few months. So relative to where we were in last
quarter, the principal thing that has happened is the Spanish government has come out with yet another round of
changes to the tariff regime for renewals.
The current – what they're talking about is a regime that in general terms would offer investors – at least as they've
stated it – a set margin, a pre-tax margin over Spanish government bond yields. However, there's a lot of details that
need to be worked out before anybody could understand what that would actually mean for economics. As a practical
matter, if it's as they stated it, a 300 basis point pre-tax spread over Spanish government bond yields, that clearly
doesn't help the project economics, even compared with the confiscatory changes they had made before.
So as a practical matter, we continue to believe that we are in the same situation, which is that our economic exposure
is limited to the remaining equity contribution, which is not material now. And operationally, the plants are up and
running very well. So that's the disappointing irony here is on the operations side, they're doing better than we
expected. But as a practical matter, economically, there doesn't appears to be much future for us in there. So again, just
to remind everybody, we've taken out from our financial expectations all earnings and cash flow contributions from the
Spanish assets.

some variability in what you guys might actually invest, but is there any earnings before the pipeline actually comes
online that like an AFUDC kind of thing that might happen? Or can you just elaborate a little bit on that?

accounting because they're both regulated pipelines. So there'll be a contribution that way. The Sabal Trail portion, the

upstream portion would be accounted for by us on the equity method. So we would just carry our proportion of
whatever Spectra is recording there. But yes, there will be an earnings impact, a non-cash earnings impact through the
construction period.
After that – after it goes into service, I think folks should recognize that the long-term economic prospects of the
upstream portion look very good, but they are fundamentally tied to the continued growth and development of the state.
Initially, the pipeline will not be fully subscribed, as you would expect. You clearly build these things with room for
growth. And so the short-term economics will not be representative of the long-term economics.
The reality is that the FPL customers are getting a great deal in here. And the economics – the long-term economics of
the upstream portion of the pipeline are fundamentally dependent upon incremental volume and the growth in the FPL
volumes in future years. So we are obviously very optimistic about that, but that piece, the growth piece remains to be
seen.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: It sounds like a great project. Let me just ask you in terms of the solar opportunities in Florida
that Jim was mentioning, is there any legislation that's contemplated or needed? Or can you do it right now with what
you have in place in Florida?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: There's no guiding legislation either in place or currently contemplated, so that's the first
part. As to the second part, could we do it right now? I think that the best way to answer that is to say, not really. The
reality is that the Commission fundamentally is required to look at the lowest cost – look at and approve the lowest cost
resource path.
Now they do have some flexibility within that to consider what may happen down the road. But I think at this stage it
would given – particularly given all the other things we've got going on, it would be a little bit of a challenge to add
that on top. So that's why in the prepared remarks, Jim made the comment, I think, that the realistic time for moving
forward on that is probably 2015, 2016.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And then just in terms of the Yieldco and all that stuff, it sounds like you guys are taking
obviously a very cautious approach in terms of any – anything you may do. Should we think that this is probably
something that we probably we won't hear anything before the end of the year? Or I hate to put you on the spot on that
but, I mean, just sort of in terms of timing and stuff, it sounds like it's going to be some time before you make a
decision. Does that make sense? And also just does the incremental – the tax equity stuff, does that have an impact on
any of this – the potential of you doing it? Do you follow me?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Okay. Let me hold the second part of that question. The first, on the timing, I can't say
exactly end of year, but I think certainly several months is realistic. We'll certainly give you an update on where we are.
I'm sure somebody will ask the question on the third quarter call. So we'll certainly give you an update. But I would
certainly hope to be in a position to understand a lot more where we might want to be by the end of the year. We won't
necessarily be in a position to execute, even if we do have something that we ultimately want to execute.
On the question of the tax equity transactions, in a sense, yes, there is an interaction here. And in a sense, it goes back
to the fundamentals that we were talking about earlier, which is different investors' appetite for different combinations
of current income and future cash flow growth and risk.
In a sense, things like tax equity and project finance even are already examples of slightly different forms of vehicle
that the Yieldco represents. So you can sort of put them on a spectrum, if you like, with project finance being at one
end of the spectrum, where you are carving off a discrete portion of the cash flow stream of the – in this case the
renewable portfolio and packaging it in a particular way that's appealing to a certain class of investors.
Tax equity transactions do exactly the same thing. Now they don't do it quite the same way that the Yieldco format
does. It's a different combination of current income, cash flow growth and risk. But they are – in my mind, you can
place them all on a spectrum. So that's a long-winded way of saying, yes, they are. They do relate. And specifically
when you put these assets into a tax equity transaction, you are effectively precluding them from being in a Yieldco
vehicle in the short term. However, that's not a problem because the Yieldco format is not well adapted to accepting

Our next question comes from the site of Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Yeah. Hi. Can you hear me?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Hey, good morning, Moray. Just first on the Florida pipeline, the intrastate piece, it – would
that have a more kind of timely return, relative to the interstate piece that you mentioned before, i.e., is it fully running
from the get-go?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: No, it will have a – as I think about it – a slightly more favorable because fundamentally
as I've said many times to many folks, FPL is the principal customer for the downstream portion, whereas the upstream
portion has the potential to serve many other customers over time. And it's that growth to serve the other volumes that
ultimately should provide the economic leverage that will ensure that the lifetime returns of the upstream portion are
attractive.
So because the downstream is much more heavily likely to be dedicated to FPL, the profile is a little better. But it still
has the same thing, because what FPL required was a step-up: specified growth in volumes and options on future
volume. So obviously, everybody who competed for the downstream portion had to size the thing for the long term.
And so the upfront returns will not be as strong as the lifetime returns.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay. And one other question just back to the hot topic. Back three or four years ago when
we had the pure play renewables stories, you never went through a process like this of evaluating options and the like.
So this does seem to be somewhat different than then. And it seems to be a more serious review than three or four years
ago. So is that fair to read that there is more validity to either this structure or something like it than necessarily what
you saw when we went through this with the pure play renewables?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: No, I don't think that's at all fair, Steve.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: We may not have been so transparent about it at the time. But we spent an awful lot of
time back in 2006, 2007 on various structures at that time, so there was a great deal of work. The key thing then, at that
time, was we could not get ourselves convinced that there really was a – I'll call it a capital market mispricing
opportunity. We thought that there was an unsustainable bubble, if you like. And our conclusion at that time – again,
this is now ancient history, but our conclusion at that time was it didn't justify going through all the distraction and the
incremental cost of the establishment of the structure for something that wasn't going to allow us long-term to access a
different pool of capital. So it's the same fundamental reading. And we did spend a lot of time on it. We may not have
been as explicit as we have on this one.

because of the opportunity into the FP&L service territory and into the State of Florida? Or is this more of a strategic
move where you could see other incremental pipeline investments down the road, whether standalone or via joint
ventures with other companies? That's the first part.
The second is once the pipeline is online and in service, how do you think about the corporate structuring, meaning the
potential for either other JVs or potential master limited partnership opportunities? We're now talking about a sizable
investment in midstream assets. So just trying to think through how you're envisioning kind of the 5 to 10 year path?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Well, Michael, I think you are perhaps a little ahead of us here. Our fundamental
motivation here – this is a Florida project. We are interested in figuring out – as we always have been – how we
continue to improve value delivery to our FPL customers here in Florida. And this we think is an absolutely critical
project. It's a great project. As I said earlier, I think FPL customers are getting a great deal off this. And we want to
make sure that we are a part of seeing that that thing happens. That's our fundamental motivation. We're certainly
comfortable committing a large amount of capital to this project with these kinds of economics, given the overall
regulatory environment. But it's fundamentally about serving our FPL customers.
Having said that, there is no question that assuming that we are successful in bringing this project to completion, it will
provide us with other possibilities. And where that may take us, we're going to have to see. But all of that is off in the
future. We're talking right now about – just as a reminder, a pipeline that's going to come in service in 2017. And
there's a lot of work to be done to get it to that point. And obviously, the whole set of projects is subject to regulatory
approval. So again, it's all about serving our customers in Florida better.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay. And I guess just a quick follow-up. How do you – how should investors think about
the targeted return on capital for the new pipeline project and will it differ much from the northern leg to the southern
leg.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Well. I'm not going get into the numerical details because obviously as I think my remarks
earlier should have suggested, there's uncertainty about what the – certainly the short-term economics are going to be. I
think that the best way to think about this is you can look at other major pipeline projects across the country and get an
idea of the range of economics that are reasonable. As I said, we think that the long-term economics here, particularly
to the upstream portion, are based on continued growth in Florida and the need for natural gas transportation capacity
by folks other than just FPL.
So we are fundamentally making a positive statement about our belief in the long-term growth of Florida here.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. Thank you, Moray. Much appreciate it.

Next we'll go to the side of Angie Storozynski with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Your line is open.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Thank you. My first question is about the dividend growth. Given that you have already
locked about $5 billion of the additional CapEx and that will require some additional equity funding, how should we
think about the growth in dividends? Is there an expectation that some of that growth – significant pickup in dividends
will be delayed because of additional CapEx?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Well, first of all, although it's perhaps an admission against interest, I can't, I have to
dispute your characterization as having things locked in. There are lots of steps that have to be gone through before any
of these incremental projects are really in service, so – including regulatory approvals, further development steps. So
let's not get ahead of our ourselves here. Having said that, on the dividend growth front, I just go back to what we I
believe talked about in the March Investor Conference. And so, we had talked about subsequently, which is the current
target is 55% payout ratio in 2014. Where we go beyond that will clearly depend upon the CapEx profile.
And the way I characterized it before is to suggest that beyond 2014, we would hope to see dividend growth, at least in
line with earnings growth. And by that I mean that if we're at the higher end of the earnings growth, we will need all

the cash flow and we will be in the market for incremental equity as we've discussed. And therefore, we probably more
likely see dividend growth in line with EPS growth.
If we were at the lower end of the CapEx range, then we would clearly have free cash flow available. And that might
suggest increasing the payout ratio further, which obviously would imply dividend growth slightly higher than earnings
growth. So I still think that framework for thinking about it is reasonable. If we're at the upper end of the CapEx range,
the upper end of the EPS growth, then I think dividend growth in line with EPS growth is a reasonable expectation.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Okay. And completely separately on new wind projects, we're seeing those prices of wind
power in low $20s. Could you briefly talk through what actually offsets the reduction of pricing of electricity versus the
returns that you can realize in those projects? I mean, is that the net capacity factor went up so much? And if so, what is
the average MCF that you're realizing on those new projects? Or is it the cost of new build that has dropped
significantly? I basically cannot somehow make the numbers work.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Sure. Well, the single biggest driver of the improvement in the economics of wind projects
has clearly been the increase in capacity factors. So to get a PPA in the $20 range and still yield acceptable returns, you
have to be in a part of the country that has very strong wind resource. And with modern technology turbines, you can
expect to see capacity factors as high as 50% where a decade ago in the same year, we might have been looking at
33%.
So that change when you run it through the numbers is huge. Secondly, but much lower in importance, it's – it is true
that we have seen some relief on the cost side of the turbines. But that I think was more a function of a retreat from
very high prices at a time when the turbine supply market was very tight. So I think that is more a cyclical thing, but the
long-term, the biggest single trend is the improvement in technology, improving the capacity factors.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: But the cost of new build is roughly, is it roughly a $1000 per kilowatt or is it just slightly
above that level?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: No, I think if you look at the numbers that we discussed in the script, I think the average
we're looking at is about $1700 a KW, obviously it varies depending upon where you are.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Okay. And you're still accepting similar levels of returns as you did a couple of years ago?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Yeah, the – over a long period of time, we really haven't seen – we've been able to
maintain decent modest spreads over risk-adjusted cost of capital. So obviously, the overall cost of capital has come
down over the course of last decade just because the real interest rates have come down. But the spreads have been
generally in the same kind of range.

2014, among other things we have a significant pickup on the wholesale side, which we were obviously aware of, so
that was baked into our thinking about the spread of the $400 million over the course of the period. So I just – it may
perhaps be worth emphasizing that with a $180 million leftover at the end of this year, we still feel very comfortable
based on where we see our cost structure going that we are going to be able to maintain healthy ROEs for shareholders
for the remainder of the rate agreement period, out through 2016. So we feel good about where we are on that.
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: So, basically, the ability to maintain let's say an 11% ROE is contingent on, one, the
growth of the wholesale sales and, two, your flat O&M cost forecast, is that what I heard you just say, or?
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Well, I think going forward, it's – we are clearly – not so much the wholesale growth,
because at least the piece I'm talking about is a contract that we signed some years ago. So we know where we're going
to be on that.
If you looked to areas of uncertainty, it would be on retail growth. So, customer growth, the usage growth, for which
our expectations are continued growth on the customer side in the 35,000 to 40,000 [new service accounts] a year and
on the usage side of maybe a half to a little bit more percent per year. And then the cost control which you referred to.
So to the extent that there's uncertainty or risk about those two elements and that's reflected in our thinking about where
we could be over the course of the rate period. But again, as I said, we feel pretty good about it based on what we see
right now.
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: Excellent. Thank you very much.
<A - Moray P. Dewhurst>: Thank you, everybody.
