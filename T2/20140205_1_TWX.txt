MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the Time Warner, Inc. fourth quarter 2013 earnings call. My name is Joe, and I will be your operator for
today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer
session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.
I will now turn the call over to Mr. Michael Kopelman, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations at Time Warner.
Mr. Kopelman, you may begin.
Michael Kopelman
Thanks and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Time Warner's fourth quarter and full-year earnings conference call.
This morning we issued two press releases, one detailing our results for the fourth quarter and the full year and the
other providing the 2014 business outlook which excludes Time Inc.
Before we begin, there are three items I need to cover. First, we refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures.
Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP
financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules. These reconciliations are available on
our website at www.timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected future financial performance are also
included in the business outlook release that is available on our website.
Second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current
expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various
factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent Annual Report on
Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation and, in fact, expressly
disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future events, or otherwise.

And lastly, in the fourth quarter the company separated its former Networks reportable segment into two reportable
segments, Turner and Home Box Office. In addition, during the fourth quarter the company changed the names of the
Film and TV Entertainment reportable segment to Warner Bros. and is publishing segment to Time Inc. The new
presentation had no impact on the historical consolidated financial information previously reported by the company.
Thank you and I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Jeff?
Jeffrey L. Bewkes
Thanks, Mike, and thanks for listening in this morning.
2013 was another very successful year for the company. We grew adjusted operating income 8%. Adjusted earnings
per share increased 16%. We generated over $3.5 billion in free cash flow, and we returned almost $5 billion to
stockholders through buybacks and dividends.
These accomplishments were the result of a strategy that served us very well, not just last year, but for the past five
years. Between 2008 and 2013, we grew adjusted operating income at close to a double-digit compound annual growth
rate, and we turned that into average annual growth in adjusted EPS of more than 20% a year. We've achieved that
through a combination of solid revenue growth, tight cost control, and disciplined capital allocation. In fact, over that
period we allocated nearly $20 billion to dividends and share repurchases.
As we announced this morning, we anticipate another year of double-digit growth in adjusted EPS excluding Time Inc.
in 2014. And we're committed to continue providing direct returns to stockholders, as evidenced by the new $5 billion
share repurchase authorization and 10% increase in our dividend approved by our board. That marks the fifth straight
year we've increased our dividend double digits.
The consistency of our performance over the last few years is a result of our unwavering focus on the same key
objectives that we've been talking to you about for quite a while. First and foremost, we're investing aggressively in the
best content. Second, we're focused on harnessing technology and developing new business models to increase the
value of our content to consumers and distributors and drive growth for our businesses. Third, we're increasing our
presence in the most attractive international territories to take advantage of growing demand for our content outside the
United States. And fourth, we're constantly striving to optimize our operating and capital efficiency to drive improved
returns.
So let me briefly talk about the progress we've made on each of those objectives in 2013 and how we have positioned
ourselves for success in 2014 and beyond. I'll start with our investment in great content and storytelling, the heart of
what we do.
At Turner, we're significantly increasing our investments in programming, particularly in originals, to keep our network
at the very top of the industry. TBS finished 2013 as the number one cable network in primetime in adults 18 to 49 for
the first time in over a decade. The Big Bang Theory remains a big part of that success and was once again the number
one comedy on ad-supported cable. But TBS has also been building a strong stable of original hits with Cougar Town,
Ground Floor, Sullivan & Son, and Men at Work all among the top ten original sitcoms on ad-supported cable this
year.
And while TNT has hit a bit of a soft patch the past few months, it still finished 2013 as the number two cable network
among adults 25 to 54 in total day and number four in primetime among adults 18 to 49. Four of TNT's hit shows,
Rizzoli & Isles, Major Crimes, Falling Skies, and Perception were among the top 15 originals in primetime on basic
cable. That's more top hits than any other basic cable network.
In 2014, TBS and TNT are going to increase their investment in high-quality originals by approximately 20%,
including some high-profile new launches from TNT later this year, The Last Ship, Legends, and Murder in the First.
Turner is also raising its game in high profile sports. Our March Madness coverage will include Elite Eight and Final
Four games for the first time this year. That bolsters a strong lineup of sports that already includes the NBA and Major

League Baseball.
Adult Swim is also on a roll. It had its highest viewership ever in 2013, growing its total-day audience double digits in
audience 18 to 34, and finishing as the number one cable network in that demo for the ninth straight year. As Adult
Swim has grown in popularity, we've continued to expand its programming hours. And in April, we're going to add
another, expanding it to the 8 PM hour.
In 2013, CNN overtook MSNBC as the number two cable news network in total-day viewership, but we still have a lot
of work to do. In 2014, CNN is focused on remaining the place where viewers turn for breaking news, revamping
primetime, broadening the programming schedule to better hold audiences during slower news cycles, and extending its
leadership in multiplatform news.
TruTV had a dip in its performance, but it remained a top-20 basic cable network among men, and we have a lot of
confidence in the direction new leadership is taking it. We think there is significant opportunity to both grow audience
and better monetize its position as we refresh tru's programming in the second half of this year.
The strength of Turner's brands and success of our programming strategy have been reflected in our recent affiliate
negotiations. Since we last reported earnings, we've signed three additional top-ten U.S. distributors to long-term
affiliate agreements. That means that during this negotiating cycle, we have now signed seven of the top ten
distributors, including two of the top five. All these deals have been consistent with our expectation that Turner will
average double-digit growth in domestic subscription revenue over the next three years. You will start to see the impact
of many of those deals in the first quarter. And given our progress to date, we now have even more confidence in that
multiyear outlook.
Now speaking of high-quality, high-impact programming, HBO remains in a league of its own. This year, HBO won 27
Primetime Emmy awards, the most of any network for the 12th year in a row, and tied for the most Golden Globes of
any network. HBO's value to its viewers and distribution partners was evident in the continued growth in its subscriber
base. Last year, HBO added almost 2 million subscribers in the U.S., its highest increase in 17 years. That included
solid growth across both HBO and Cinemax.
HBO is going to up the ante again in 2014, increasing its original series hours and investment in original programming.
That includes returning hits like Game of Thrones, Boardwalk Empire, True Blood, and Girls, as well as five new
series. One of those, True Detective, is already looking like it will be one of HBO's biggest hits. It premiered to critical
acclaim last month, and the cumulative audience for its first episode has already passed 10 million viewers. We're also
excited about The Leftovers, a Warner Bros. show from Damon Lindelof, which debuts in June and could be the next
big hit for HBO.
Now let's turn to Warner Bros. It had a banner year creatively and commercially in film and television production,
leading the industry by practically any measure and recording the highest profits in its history. Theatrically, Warner
Bros. led both domestic and international box offices, crossing $5 billion in global box office for the first time in its
history. That included seven movies with more than $300 million in global box office, led by hits such as the second
installment of The Hobbit, Gravity, and Man of Steel. Warner Bros. films also received an industry-leading 21 Oscar
nominations, including Best Picture nominations for Gravity and for Her.
In 2014, we have another strong slate, led by titles like: The LEGO Movie, which opens this Friday; Edge of
Tomorrow, starring Tom Cruise; Jupiter Ascending from the Wachowskis; Godzilla; Christopher Nolan's Interstellar;
and the final installment of The Hobbit.
In television production, Warner Bros. was also unrivaled in 2013. Over the course of this TV season, Warner's will
have produced 32 shows for broadcast networks, again, more than any other studio. Among adults 18 to 49, these
shows include the number one comedy in The Big Bang Theory, the number one unscripted show in The Voice, and the
number three drama in The Following. And including our production for cable networks, Warner TV is producing over
60 shows in total this season.

Let me turn to our second area of strategic focus, digital. Our goal is to give consumers more ways to access our
content on more platforms. That will increase the value of our content to consumers, bolster our existing businesses,
and open up additional opportunities for monetization.
For example, Turner continues to lead in providing TV Everywhere rights to its distribution partners. This last year,
Turner expanded its TV Everywhere offering to include live streaming of its networks in and out of the home. And
Turner is now working to provide modem-based authentication for TV Everywhere, reducing the need for people to
sign in. As we've said in the past, we think distributors need to accelerate the deployment of TV Everywhere
capabilities, invest in better consumer interfaces, and simplify authentication. Those will be key areas of focus for us in
this year 2014.
Turner's digital efforts aren't limited to TV Everywhere. For instance, Bleacher Report grew its monthly unique visitors
by almost 40% in 2013 and ended the year as a top-three digital sports destination. And CNN remained the number one
multi-platform provider of news in the U.S., significantly outstripping its cable news peers and leading the industry –
the news industry, in mobile users.
HBO continues to set the standard for the industry with its TV Everywhere apps, HBO GO, and MAX GO. In 2013,
active users of HBO GO grew over 30%, and average monthly usage increased by double digits. HBO GO is now
available in 23 countries outside the U.S. as well. And HBO will be investing even more this year to make the HBO
GO user experience even better.
In Home Entertainment, Warner Bros. is also making progress in improving the user experience for its digital products.
One of the most important initiatives on that front is UltraViolet, the industry standard designed to make it easier for
consumers to access their content on multiple platforms. UltraViolet ended 2013 with more than 15 million accounts.
That's a 65% increase from the end of 2012. Awareness still needs to improve, but the consumers who use UltraViolet
love it. And we think more and more consumers will enjoy its benefits as retail support continues to increase.
You can see the impact that improving experience is having on consumer behavior in almost 50% growth in electronic
sales for the industry last year. That helped drive an increase in domestic consumer spending on home entertainment
for the first time in eight years. With UltraViolet now available in nine countries outside the U.S. and plans to expand
further, we're hopeful we'll also see stabilization in international home video revenue over the next few years.
That's a perfect segue to our third strategic objective, which is international growth. Including HBO's unconsolidated
ventures, we generated nearly $10 billion in revenue outside the U.S. in 2013. That's a third of our revenue. We think
there's a big opportunity to grow this over time given the increase in multichannel TV penetration, the expansion of
premium and SVOD services into new territories, and growth in theatrical screens in emerging markets.
Our biggest international business is at Warner Bros., which generates nearly half its revenue from outside the U.S. In
2013, Warner's grossed over $3 billion at the international box office, with 10 movies grossing more than $100 million.
Warner's also continues to expand its international TV business, with revenue approaching $1.5 billion in 2013.
Perhaps our biggest international opportunity is at our international networks. Including HBO's unconsolidated joint
ventures, our international networks generated more than $3 billion in revenues and over $750 million in adjusted
operating income in 2013. Despite a continued drag from foreign exchange, we're on track to take that to $1 billion in
the next couple of years.
We're seeing particularly strong growth in Latin America, where Turner grew its revenues double digits and grew its
profits by over 25%. Latin America is also a source of strong growth for HBO, which helped drive its international
subscriber base up over 15% in 2013 to end the year with 84 million HBO subs outside the United States. That means
HBO ended the year with almost 130 million subs globally.
As we make these investments in content, technology, and international expansion, our fourth objective is to improve
our efficiency to help fund them. To that end, we announced last month the sale of our office space at Columbus Circle
in New York. Our intention is to relocate our headquarters and all our New York City based operations to a new tower
in the Hudson Yards development on the west side of Manhattan, beginning in late 2018. That would include

approximately 5,000 employees from across Time Warner Corporate, HBO, Turner, and Warner Bros. Moving into a
dynamic new complex will foster even more collaboration and creativity across our businesses. And by consolidating
space from seven buildings throughout the metro area, we'll be able to reallocate substantial savings to our primary
business of creating valuable and engaging content for audiences around the world.
We're also pleased with the progress Time Inc.'s new management team is making in its preparations to become an
independent publicly-traded company. And we remain on track to complete the spinoff in the second quarter of this
year.
In closing, we had a tremendous year in 2013. We posted record financial results while investing aggressively for the
future. We also put in place the next generation of leaders, with new CEOs at each of our divisions. And with the
decision to spin off Time Inc., we set ourselves on a path to being a pure-play content company, with an emphasis on
video and television in particular. So we're embarked on an exciting new phase for the company. And with our strong
brands, leading scale, and focused strategy, I'm more confident than ever in our prospects to drive attractive growth in
2014 and for many years to come.
With that, I want to turn it over to Howard for his first earnings call as our Chief Financial Officer. Take it away,
Howard.
Howard M. Averill
Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide of our presentation, which is now available on
our website. As Mike noted, we're breaking out HBO and Turner for the first time with these results. As we become a
smaller, more TV focused company, we hope you will find the new presentation helpful.
Starting with consolidated results, as Jeff discussed, we had another great year in 2013, with revenues up 4%, adjusted
operating income up 8%, and adjusted EPS up 16%. Turner, HBO, and Warner Bros. all posted record adjusted
operating income. And if you exclude Time Inc., adjusted OI grew over 9% and adjusted EPS grew 19%.
We were able to achieve all that despite a slight dip in adjusted OI in the fourth quarter. And that was largely related to
the impairment of programming at Turner as well as the timing of programming and related marketing spending at
Turner and HBO. Even so, we limited expense growth to 3% this year and drove margins up almost 100 basis points,
our fifth straight year of margin expansion. Over those five years, margins have increased over 600 basis points. We
remain intensely focused on managing our cost structure in order to free up resources to invest even more in our
businesses, and we expect that focus will allow us to continue to grow margins over the next several years.
Adjusted EPS was up slightly in the quarter and 16% for the year, our fifth straight year of double-digit adjusted EPS
growth. And that was despite a drag on this year's earnings due to equity losses from CME [Central European Media
Enterprises Ltd.].
Along with our strong full-year operating performance, growth benefited from a lower effective tax rate and $3.7
billion in share repurchases. So combining our repurchases with $1.1 billion in dividends, we returned almost $5 billion
to stockholders in 2013. This is an increase of more than 10% year over year and exceeded our free cash flow by more
than 35%. And as evidenced by the dividend increase and new repurchase authorization we announced this morning,
we remain committed to delivering significant direct returns to shareholders. So we're really pleased with our
performance in 2013, and we feel great about how we are positioned going into 2014 and beyond.
As you saw this morning, for the first time we are providing a full-year outlook for the company excluding Time Inc.
Following the spinoff, which we expect will occur in the second quarter, Time Inc. will be reflected as discontinued
operations in our consolidated financial statements and will no longer be reflected in our adjusted EPS. Excluding Time
Inc., we anticipate another year of double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. I'll provide additional context around our
outlook as we go through the presentation.

Now turning to the segment highlights, I'll begin at Turner, where we achieved record adjusted operating income for
the year despite a slight decline in the fourth quarter. Advertising revenues grew 5% for the year and a modest 1% in
the quarter, a little lighter than we had originally expected, and that was due to a combination of softer than expected
ratings and a weak scatter market in November. Domestic advertising was flat in the quarter. That included
mid-single-digit growth at the Entertainment Networks, including kids and young adults. Domestic news declined
double digits in the quarter, owing to the comparison against the 2012 U.S. Presidential election and ongoing softness
in the news advertising marketplace. International advertising was up modestly in the quarter. That reflected healthy
growth in Latin America, while performance was softer elsewhere, particularly in Asia and international news.
Looking ahead to the first quarter of 2014, we anticipate total advertising to grow in the mid to high single digits.
Scatter pricing is up high single to low double digits over the upfront, though ratings will likely remain somewhat of a
drag on our performance. Also, keep in mind that we will be airing two NCAA Elite Eight games, which we expect to
provide a boost of around 200 to 300 basis points to total ad growth in the quarter. Similarly, second quarter ad growth
will benefit by around 300 to 400 basis points from the airing of two Final Four games. That revenue will come with
additional expenses such that the net impact will probably be a slight drag on adjusted OI.
Moving on, subscription revenues were up 6% in the quarter and 5% for the year, and that included an FX drag of
approximately 100 basis points for both periods. Excluding the impact of FX, international subscription revenue grew
double digits in both the fourth quarter and for the year, and Latin America was once again our strongest region. As we
look forward, we should start to see the benefits of Turner's domestic affiliate renewals in the first quarter. We also
continue to see healthy subscriber dynamics in international territories, though FX headwinds remain a drag there.
Taken together, we anticipate an acceleration in our subscription revenue growth into the high single digits.
Adjusted operating income was up 6% for the year but down 3% in the quarter. The decline in the fourth quarter was a
result of a significant increase in programming expenses, which grew 12%. That growth included around $70 million of
programming impairments related to our decision to stop airing certain programming due to its poor performance. We
also significantly increased our investment in original programming and related marking spend at our domestic
networks in the quarter.
Even with the ramp up in programming and marketing spend in the fourth quarter, for the year programming expenses
were up just 6%, and we limited total expense growth to 4%. And we were able to do that by keeping SG&A
essentially flat, reflecting our continued commitment to tightly managing overhead costs.
So all in all, we had another good year at Turner. Excluding programming impairments, adjusted operating income
would have grown about 8% for the year, and margins would have expanded over 100 basis points. And we think we're
in great position to grow at attractive levels in 2014 and beyond.
Moving on to HBO, we had another year of healthy margin expansion and strong growth in adjusted operating income.
Subscription revenues were up 8% in the quarter and 6% for the year. And the consolidation of HBO Asia and HBO
Nordic contributed around 400 basis points to the growth in the quarter and approximately 100 basis points for the year.
Domestically, we had relatively steady subscription revenue growth throughout the year. And as Jeff mentioned, HBO
and Cinemax together added almost 2 million domestic subscribers in 2013. Keep in mind, the majority of these
subscriber additions are non-revenue generating. Still, the subscriber gains reflect very healthy demand for HBO. So as
we look ahead, we feel good about the trajectory of subscription revenues.
Turning to content revenues, we saw a 9% drop in the quarter. And that was mostly due to soft demand for home video
library product. However, we continue to see very healthy demand for the licensing of our content internationally, and
these revenues were up solidly for the year. HBO has been investing significant resources in its international operations
in recent years. And including HBO's unconsolidated joint ventures, international accounted for approximately a
quarter of HBO's total revenue in 2013. That was helped by solid double-digit growth in subscribers, with particularly
strong growth in Latin America. Given positive trends, we anticipate that international will be an even larger portion of
HBO's business in the future.

Adjusted operating income was down 4% in the quarter, but would have been flat without the consolidation of HBO's
international properties I noted earlier. On the cost side, programming expenses grew 12%, with HBO Asia and HBO
Nordic contributing nearly 800 basis points to that growth. Increased spending on originals also contributed to
programming expense growth, and we ramped up marketing spend in the quarter to support our original programming
lineup, including high-profile first quarter launches such as True Detective.
Despite the drop in the fourth quarter, adjusted operating income grew 8% for the year, and margins expanded 130
basis points. So we had another good year financially while growing our subscribers significantly both in the U.S. and
internationally, and that gives us a lot of confidence about the opportunity for continued attractive growth in the years
ahead.
Turning now to Warner's, where the studio ended a record year with a record quarter, adjusted operating income grew
4% in the quarter and 7% for the year to over $1.3 billion. Theatrically, we had a tremendous year, ending number one
at both the domestic and international box office. Our fourth quarter theatrical results were highlighted by the strong
performances of Gravity and the second installment of The Hobbit.
On the TV side, revenue and associated profits were down for the year, in part due to the comparisons against the
syndication of The Mentalist in 2012. But Warner has remained the industry leader in shows produced for broadcast
networks, and we continue to see healthy demand for our content both domestically and internationally. So TV
production remained the largest contributor to the segment, and we feel good about the trends here.
The performance of our video game slate was also a meaningful contributor to growth this year, led by the fourth
quarter release of Batman: Arkham Origins and continued strong results of the LEGO franchise. This is an area where
we have been able to leverage our brands and IP to develop new franchises and where we see the opportunity for
further growth in the coming years.
Across theatrical and TV, Home Entertainment revenue declined 6% in the quarter and 3% for the year. Both of those
included a pretty tough comparison to the release of The Dark Knight Rises in the fourth quarter of 2012. In addition,
we have seen some softness in catalog. However, we're seeing very positive trends in digital across both theatrical and
television product, with electronic sell-through up over 50% in the quarter and over 40% for the year. That mirrors
trends in the broader industry, as initiatives like UV that we have championed are starting to have a significant impact.
After eight years of declines in total consumer spending, the industry grew 1% in 2013. That's a reflection of digital
revenue growing fast enough to make up for physical declines. For context, Warner Bros. digital revenue for theatrical
and TV products grew double digits to almost $1 billion in 2013, and we expect it to grow double digits again in 2014.
Putting it all together, Warner's had another great year and once again set a high bar for itself. In what is often referred
to as a mature business, Warner's has managed to grow its adjusted operating income at a 10% CAGR over the past
five years. And while that won't be achievable every year, we have great confidence in our ability to continue to grow
the business over time.
Now on to Time Inc., where challenging conditions continued to weigh on results for both the quarter and the year,
revenue in the quarter included the positive impact of the inclusion of American Express Publishing Corporation,
which we acquired in October, and the negative impact from the shift of an issue of both People and Sports Illustrated
into the third quarter. Excluding these items, revenues would have declined 6% in the quarter, with advertising down
5%, subscription down 8%, and other down 4%.
The underlying drop in advertising revenue reflected softness in print advertising both domestically and internationally.
Digital advertising revenue was up modestly for both the quarter and the year. Similarly, subscription revenues
included the impact of declines across both domestic and international titles, with newsstand remaining an area of
particular softness.
Adjusted operating income declined 14% in the quarter despite a drop in expenses when excluding the American
Express Publishing titles.

Looking ahead to 2014, the operating environment remains challenging. So excluding the impact of our acquisition of
American Express Publishing Corporation, we anticipate continued declines in advertising and circulation revenues.
Within that context, the new management team announced yesterday that they are beginning a process to make
significant changes to the way Time Inc. operates, with a goal of stabilizing the business and freeing up resources to
invest in growth initiatives. As part of their efforts to reengineer the company, Time Inc. will dissolve their operating
clusters to help make them flatter, more nimble, and better able to respond to a rapidly changing landscape.
To that end, we anticipate taking restructuring charges of around $150 million in the first half, around two-thirds of
which we expect to hit in the first quarter. Excluding restructuring charges, we expect modest declines in adjusted
operating income, both in the first quarter and for the full year. And that's largely a function of continuing revenue
pressure and incremental public company and stock compensation expenses that Time Inc. will incur this year. They'll
have more to say about their plans as we get closer to the spin off.
One important decision we made is Time Inc.'s capital structure. While there could be some minor adjustments for
working capital, we intend to spin off Time Inc. with net debt of around $1.3 billion. We think that level will allow
sufficient flexibility to both invest in the business and provide direct returns to stockholders while also optimizing its
cost of capital and delivering attractive levered equity returns to investors.
Moving on to the next slide, which shows our outlook excluding Time Inc. for 2014; as I noted before, we had another
great year in 2013, and we feel very good about how we are positioned for this year. At Turner we'll benefit from the
domestic affiliate renewal cycle, which should drive a nice improvement in subscription revenue growth. At the same
time, we're expecting an increase in programming expense growth, primarily due to the airing of the NCAA Final Four,
the first year of our new Major League Baseball contract, and increased investments in originals. And while
international growth remains a positive driver, at this point FX appears likely to remain a drag. Taken all together, we
anticipate Turner's adjusted OI growth will accelerate significantly in 2014.
At HBO we're encouraged by the continued strength in demand for our services, and that should help subscription
revenue growth. That will be balanced against an increase in programming expense growth related to continued
investment in originals and the addition of a full slate of Summit films to our theatrical lineup. We'll also be investing
even more in technology as we develop the next generation of HBO GO. Even with these investments, we're
anticipating another year of solid growth in adjusted operating income.
At Warner Bros., we obviously have very challenging comparisons coming off a record year, so it could be difficult to
grow. But we think we have a great film slate, and we anticipate an improvement in TV performance given strong
global demand and the syndication of Mike and Molly. That all gives us confidence that 2014 will be another great year
for the studio.
So looking across all three segments, we're set up for a very good year from an operating perspective. One thing to
keep in mind is that intercompany eliminations are likely to be somewhat of a drag this year due to increased sales of
product from Warner Bros. to both Turner and HBO. That's a pretty big shift from 2013, when we benefited from a
positive swing in this line.
We also anticipate a higher effective tax rate as our 2013 rate included several favorable audit settlements and the
recognition of additional foreign tax credit carryovers. So between the swing in eliminations and the higher effective
tax rate, we estimate the impact on 2014 adjusted EPS to be $0.15 to $0.20. Despite that, we expect another very good
year in 2014.
We see a tremendous amount of opportunity across our businesses, and we're investing aggressively in our industry
leading brands to drive increased scale and long-term growth. At the same time, we're tightly managing our
non-revenue generating expenses in order to provide attractive near to medium-term financial results. All of that is
reflected in our outlook for low double-digit growth in adjusted EPS.
Turning to the next slide, which looks at our free cash flow, we generated very strong free cash flow, $3.5 billion in
2013. That's up almost 20% versus 2012, and that was mostly due to strong growth in adjusted operating income. Also,

cash taxes, cash interest, and capital expenditures were all lower year over year. The decline in cash taxes was
primarily a result of tax law extenders that were passed by Congress in January of 2013. That's been a positive driver
all year. And the decline in cash interest was largely due to slightly lower cost of debt and debt balances as we paid off
higher cost maturities early in the year and eventually replaced them with longer-term maturities in the fourth quarter.
Our use of working capital increased slightly as a result of higher participation at Warner Bros. Excluding Time Inc.,
we generated around $3.1 billion of free cash flow in 2013.
For 2014, keep in mind that, as a result of the expiration of certain favorable tax legislation and lower foreign tax
credits, our cash taxes are likely to be higher. In addition, we're now carrying additional debt, which will result in
increased cash interest expense. Still, we should have another year of very strong free cash flow.
Turning to the final slide, which looks at our net debt, we ended 2013 with $18.3 billion of net debt, and our leverage
ratio was 2.4 times. During the year, we took advantage of continued favorable market conditions to strengthen our
balance sheet by extending the maturity of our $5 billion credit facilities to 2018 and issuing $1 billion of new
long-term debt. In addition to investing in our businesses, we deployed just under $500 million in strategic M&A
transactions.
Also, as I previously mentioned, we returned almost $5 billion of capital to our stockholders in the form of dividends
and share repurchases. And as Jeff discussed earlier, we recently sold our office space in Time Warner Center and
intend to relocate our corporate headquarters to the Hudson Yards development at the end of 2018. That will result in a
net inflow of around $1.1 billion in 2014. Over time, we will essentially reinvest the proceeds into our new building.
And until we move, we will lease space in Time Warner Center.
The transaction will have a negligible impact on our earnings over the next few years, but we expect significant savings
when we ultimately consolidate our New York City footprint at our new headquarters. So I am pleased with how we
executed on our capital plan in 2013, and we're off to a good start in 2014.
As part of our planning for 2014 and beyond, we have decided to increase our net leverage ratio target from 2.5 times
to up to 2.75 times, with the expectation that we will get there over the next few years. In part, this decision is a
reflection that after the Time Inc. spinoff, we will have a less cyclical business mix with better secular trends.
We think modestly increasing our leverage will lower our blended cost of capital while affording us additional
flexibility that we can use to make investments in our businesses and to continue providing a significant level of direct
returns to our stockholders. At the same time, we believe it will allow us to maintain favorable access to the capital
markets across a variety of potential macroeconomic scenarios. We do not anticipate the change will have an impact on
our credit ratings, and we remain committed to maintaining solid investment-grade credit ratings moving forward.
In that context, I want to take a moment to discuss our capital allocation priorities, which are not changing. Our first
priority is always to maintain a strong balance sheet so that we can fully invest in our businesses. Next, we always look
at M&A opportunities that present themselves. But we have sufficient scale, so we don't need to do anything. Potential
transactions need to provide strategic benefits with reasonable execution risk and adequate financial return. That means
risk-adjusted returns need to be more attractive than other uses of capital, including share repurchases. Beyond that, we
are committed to providing meaningful direct returns to stockholders with a significant and growing dividend and
continued share repurchases.
If you look back over the last five years, you will see what that approach has yielded. Since 2008, we have generated
close to $15 billion in free cash flow, and we've paid out close to $5 billion in dividends. We purchased close to $15
billion of our shares, or 32% of our base. And we spent around $3 billion on acquisitions, and we've been able to do
that while maintaining our credit ratings and retaining the ability to access capital markets on attractive terms. So we
feel good about our approach and intend to continue on a similar path moving forward.
With that, I'll turn it back to Mike to start the Q&A.

Thanks, Howard. Joe, can you please open up the queue for Q&A? And as a reminder, if everyone could please keep
yourself to one or two questions so we can get to more people. Thank you.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator instructions] Our first question here is from Mr. Michael Nathanson from MoffettNathanson. Please go
ahead, sir.
<Q - Michael Nathanson>: Thanks. I have one for Howard and one for Jeff. Howard, welcome to the job. Before John
[Martin] left, John had signaled that programming costs in 2014 at the networks would run, I think, in the high
single-digit range. And now that you've separated out HBO and Turner, I wondered if you could help fine tune that
growth rate by division for 2014?
<A - Howard M. Averill>: Hi, Michael, thank you. Yes, you're right. For context, we'd actually set expectations for
mid to high single digit in programming costs in the Networks segment level, and that hasn't actually changed. But
when you translate it to our current segments, it's going to translate to more like high single-digit growth at Turner and
mid-single-digit growth at HBO. And the faster growth at Turner is really basically driven by sports. So for example, if
you took a look, this year we're going to have the first year of our baseball deal and the first year we're going to be
airing Elite Eight games and Final Four games. So if you look ahead also to 2016 and 2017, we're going to anticipate
an increase based on the NBA package. But all of this is consistent with what we've talked about in the past. And we
think by continuing to drive the revenue growth and tightly managing the rest of our costs, we're going to be in a
position to continue to drive margins at both Turner and HBO.
<Q - Michael Nathanson>: Okay, and then let me ask one for Jeff. This is a bit about TNT's strategy. In the past
couple weeks, we've seen three off-network procedural dramas, Person of Interest, Elementary, Blue Bloods, that may
have worked in the past on TNT, go someplace else on cable. I wonder. The decision not to acquire those shows, what
does that say about either procedurals, your pipeline, or the value of the show? So typically, you guys have acquired
procedurals, and this time you didn't. So what's behind that strategy?
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Okay, thanks. We still think that the mix of sports, originals, and acquired shows is the right
strategy. And just to your question, if you look at the data out there, five of the top ten scripted shows on broadcast in
the 2013 to 2014 season are procedurals, and two of the top five cable networks in primetime last year had significant
numbers of procedurals. So the evidence suggests that consumers still have a strong appetite for procedurals. And
remember, they are still quite important to filling the programming day and to helping build a schedule on which you
can then launch originals.
But we're expanding TNT into more serialized and unscripted series. So you can expect the mix to shift a little bit on
procedurals. But the value of procedurals and their place, whether on broadcast or cable, continues to be there. And you
could certainly see hit procedurals coming that are going up instead of down in terms of the audience and interest that
they draw. We will probably be a little more selective on them going forward for TNT. But in general, it's really an
evolution of the mix. And the basics as a strong point for TNT pretty much remain.
<Q - Michael Nathanson>: Okay, thanks.
<A - Michael Kopelman>: Thanks, Michael. Joe, can we have the next question, please?
Operator
Of course. The next question comes from Mr. Richard Greenfield from BTIG. Please go ahead, sir.

<Q - Richard S. Greenfield>: Hi, thanks for taking the question. On Netflix's earnings interview, Reed Hastings stated
that the addressable market for Netflix was somewhere in the range of 60 million to 90 million subscribers
domestically, well above the 33 million subs they're currently at. I'm curious. You talked about total subscribers. I think
that includes HBO and Cinemax. Where did HBO end the year specifically in terms of domestic subscribers? And how
do you think about growth as you look out over the next several years between subscriber growth and affiliate fee
increases?
And then just a tack-on question because I think it relates to the margin, you've been investing pretty heavily in
Cinemax. I know you don't break out their profitability. But is there any way to think about as you're investing in shows
like Banshee and new projects? How much is that 37% EBITDA margin on the HBO division weighed down by that
ramp up in Cinemax?
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Okay, thanks, Rich. Let's go to the first one on HBO and Cinemax. First of all, both of them
were up. HBO subs are about two-thirds of the total. In total, HBO/Cinemax together, we added 2 million subs last
year. We ended the year with over 43 million domestic subs. And remember, we also have 85 million or so overseas,
up quite a bit last year, so 130 million worldwide.
If you look at the investments in programming, and I'll take Cinemax in a second; I'd like to start a little bit at HBO.
We definitely think, and we're doing it, that we can grow the sub base on both of them both domestically and overseas.
You can see the result of those investments in programming and sub growth we've had in the last couple years. HBO
still commands very attractive rate increases, a very important part of what cable, telco, satellite companies offer every
month. And we have a pretty controllable cost base, and I'll get to the Cinemax question. So we do expect continued
healthy growth in adjusted operating income, as we've been doing.
If you add international to that, which is really fast sub growth, it gets even better. International is up over 15% in 2013,
and that was after an increase of more than 35% in 2012 and 25% in 2011. As we've been saying, we've been launching
new territories, like the Netherlands for HBO, Nordic, and India, and we do think those provide additional growth
opportunities for the brand overseas. We also, and shouldn't forget this, license our HBO content in about 150
countries. That's on top of all the international subs, and the demand there for HBO programming is really healthy. So
if you put that all together, pretty healthy opportunity for HBO going forward.
To your Cinemax question, this is what are we doing on programming. We think Cinemax is an underappreciated asset.
In 2013, we actually had more viewing at Cinemax than at STARZ and basically the same viewing at Cinemax as at
Showtime. It's very profitable for us, but it's even more important for our distribution partners as a companion brand to
HBO. We think there's an opportunity to make Cinemax, with all of that reach and viewership, stronger. And original
programming clearly becomes more important to premium customers as VOD gets more use both on TV and on
Internet devices.
So we are going to invest in original programming. It's quite economical at Cinemax. We had big success with the third
season of Strike Back. It averaged over 2.75 million viewers. The second season of Banshee did over 2.5 million
viewers. That's on a base of – I'm not going to give you exactly. This year, we're going to be launching The Knick. Stay
tuned, everybody, for that. We're going to add more series in the future.
But to your margin question, we really run HBO and Cinemax together. And on that basis, we have been and we will
be growing margins over time. And we think the Cinemax investment in programming is a pretty good leverage point
for revenue growth at Cinemax and at HBO.
<Q - Richard S. Greenfield>: Just as a point of clarification, when you said international up over 15% in HBO
subscribers, does that exclude the consolidation? Is that an organic growth rate for international subscribers?
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Yes.
<Q - Richard S. Greenfield>: Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: You're welcome.

<A - Michael Kopelman>: Thanks, Rich; Joe, next question, please?
Operator
Of course. Our next question comes from Mr. Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Thanks, good morning. You guys talked a couple of times in your prepared remarks
about feeling good about the trajectory of subscription revenue growth at HBO. And at the same time, that you noted
that 2 million subs were not revenue drivers last year. So can you just help us understand those two comments? What's
happening in the business from your distribution partner front that makes you feel good about an accelerating revenue
outlook at HBO, which seems to be what you're hinting at? I don't want to put words in your mouth. I was just
wondering if you could add some more color there.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Yes, thank you. You're right in what you're thinking. We think for our outlook for 2014,
we're in a great position from a content position on both of them, and we think that's going to yield sub growth, rate
increase growth, and international growth. So in the U.S., we grew 8% in the fourth quarter and 6% for the year 2013.
That did include a benefit of around 400 basis points – sorry, overall I'm saying. That included a benefit of about 400
basis points from the consolidation of HBO Asia and Nordic in the quarter, and it added about 100 basis points for the
year. So think of it as we ended up around 5%.
We did see – the rates were pretty steady and increasing domestically in the mid-single-digit range. There were healthy
sub gains, up 2 million subs in the U.S., more overseas. As we said on the call, those did not translate into as much
revenue growth due to the mix of sub additions. A lot of the sub growth was in the highest performing affiliates. The
sub trends outside the U.S. have been strong, big opportunities we just said. And including the unconsolidated JVs,
international subs increased by double digits in 2013. So does that give you the color that you were looking for? I do
want to emphasize that we expect improvement, but we're not looking for a dramatic step up domestically, but we think
it will be up in terms of revenue growth along with the sub growth.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: And if I could just follow up with a quick Warner Bros. question, you guys have talked
about the licensing business, your SVOD revenues in the past. I want to say $350 million or so a year, maybe a little
more. How did that shake out in 2013? And given your Netflix output deal, which is pretty unique at Warner Bros.,
what's the outlook look like for 2014 and the backlog or any expectations directionally on how that business is
trending?
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: As a starting point, we generated around $375 million in 2013. That was up slightly from
2012. We think it's at the top of our competitive set. And I do want to point out. That does not include the revenue,
SVOD revenue for the CW Network, which is pretty significant.
So we do remain in active negotiations with all the major players. We think we can grow above that in 2014, pretty
healthy plans we have for that. And a fair amount of that is probably going to come from international territories.
Everyone I think should keep it in perspective. It's a good, growing, but small portion of our revenue. It's only around
10% of our TV syndication revenue last year. That would be equal to about 3% of total film and TV revenue. And
maybe more important, what's very clear is that there's consumer demand for this content in an on-demand
environment. So all particularly true for past seasons of serialized shows, which had been less effective, as we all
know, in syndication on linear schedules. So we think that we're going to be able to monetize effectively and have
increases in this category going forward.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Thank you.
<A - Michael Kopelman>: Thanks, Ben. Joe, can we have the next question, please?

Of course. The next question comes from Mr. Doug Mitchelson from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Thanks so much. I wanted to focus on affiliate fees as well, a couple questions for Jeff. First,
Jeff, did you see a noticeable impact from bundling HBO on a video-light tier? I know it's early days. I think Comcast
had a broadband/broadcast/HBO video-light offer. And to the extent it is helping, should we expect a meaningful
expansion of the number of distributors that might launch that type of offer?
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: On the Comcast Internet offer, it's a relatively new offer. It's pretty targeted, but we're very
supportive of it. We've been saying for a while that it makes sense to work with distributors to increase penetration of
HBO in a mutually beneficial way. Broadband-only is a good thing for people to try. It could be an effective way to
reach the 8 million to 10 million homes that have broadband without multichannel. We don't think, and we'll see, that
it's going to have a material effect on the demand for the basic package. People that want that full TV video package
with broadband and all that are probably going to continue to do all of that. But to the extent that either some of them
move this other way, that's fine with us.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: I guess the second area is, in the past, you talked about sort of an over-the-top virtual MVPD
and that you didn't see a viable business model and you didn't want to license your networks unless you did see a viable
business model. There has been more progress this year. I think Intel was reportedly close to some deals before they
sold. And DISH is close to doing something pretty interesting with Disney on this front, and Sony is talking about
launching something over-the-top this year. Has your view about the viability of a virtual MVPD business model
changed at all? Do you think there could be activity on the Time Warner front in 2014?
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: It hasn't changed much. There has been more talk than action. Specifically, if you look at
Sony/Verizon, we talk to all of them all the time. Fine, we'll evaluate each of those as they come. We are absolutely
open to opportunities to grow our business. We are not philosophically opposed to it. If there's an offering, a virtual one
that serves consumers and that they want, and if it is something that we think is sustainable economically for us and not
something where you get a little money there and you cannibalize bigger money somewhere else, then yes, that would
be something we would consider or maybe do. We just haven't seen anybody come forward with a viable, powerful
consumer offering yet.
<Q - Doug Mitchelson>: Okay, very interesting. Thank you.
<A - Michael Kopelman>: Thanks, Doug. Joe, can we get the next question, please?
Operator
Yes, of course. The next question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: Thanks, I have two topics. The first is capital allocation. I'm not sure I heard the timing of
the $5 billion, when you would utilize that. And I guess as part of capital allocation, I know Howard touched on M&A.
But, I guess, Jeff, what's your view on – are you strategically complete? And if not, what parts of the business do you
think you're missing? You've gotten so much smaller over the last few years. Would you like to get bigger?
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: What was the first one?
<A - Michael Kopelman>: Capital, the pace of the buyback.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: The pace of the buyback.
<A - Howard M. Averill>: Yeah. So, Jessica, thank you. The pace of the buyback is going to really be driven by a
couple of different factors. It's going to be driven based on the cash flow generation, which as I pointed out in my
earlier remarks, we think is going to be strong next year. And it's also going to be dependent upon what comes along in
terms of M&A and how much we spend in terms of M&A activity. We just raised the leverage target, as we just
announced. And we're not going to give specific guidance on the buyback itself, but all of those things together are
going to be factors that drive it. And I would say sitting here today, you should expect to see probably the same pretty

much pace as we had last year.
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: On M&A, we pretty much have said what our philosophy is. We've tried to be disciplined,
spent close to $0.5 billion on acquisitions in 2013, a little under $700 million in 2012, and about $400 million in 2011.
So we've done things where we think that they both have returns and strengthen our position competitively,
strategically.
We do have, as both I think – well, Howard said it. We do have sufficient scale on all the things we're doing now, so
we don't have to do anything. Next question, since we do have scale, we're a pretty effective buyer if something comes
up where we could combine it with what we're doing and increase the profitability or sustainability of whatever we
buy. We basically look through the filters of execution, strategic fit, competitive augmentation, and risk of whether we
know how to manage the thing and whether it's really going to work out. We've been mostly focused on the deals we
have done on international opportunities, particularly on the network side, local television production, and games.
Those have tended to be smaller in nature, but we don't have an inability to consider larger things if they fit the criteria
that I was talking about.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: Okay, and then the second topic. Can I ask one more on a second subject, if that's okay? I
just want to ask one more question. So you said that Warner Bros. will produce 60 shows this year. And obviously,
there are others producing – sorry?
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: 61.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: I'm sorry, so roughly 60. Others are producing and there are clearly new startups. So the
question is, given the increase in original TV production supply, are you concerned at all about either how the market
will absorb all these shows, how the market will digest all this output?
<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: Thank you for that question. The reason we're at 61 shows is the market is coming to our
door and asking us to make the shows and sell it to them. So we've had a very vigorous demand and increase in
basically what we've been doing on all four broadcast networks, on pretty much all the different basic cable networks.
All of them are doing more shows.
So on your 60, we have 32 shows on broadcast. We have of those the most returning shows we've had in over 30 years.
Warner Bros. TV is the leading supplier of primetime programming to broadcasters again this year. So as the TV
networks, the broadcast ones, solidify their economics with retrans and so forth, it has worked. They certainly want to
produce shows that they themselves make, but they also want a healthy supply of quality shows to strengthen their
networks. And as the basically second supplier to all of them, it's been a good position for us. The cable network
business, whether or not just TNT/TBS, but FX, USA, A&E, AMC, a pretty good set of demands coming from them
too. So at this point, TV production and the revenue support for those shows that you can make if you're the producer
overseas from international licensing and from SVOD is going up. So it's a very strong business with very good returns.
<A - Michael Kopelman>: Thanks, Jessica. Joe, we have time for one final question.

All right. It looks like your next question comes from Alexia Quadrani of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Hi. Thank you, just a follow-up on all of your commentary on HBO and then a quick one
on Turner. On HBO, how much do you think the pricing strategy of other premium channels or SVOD providers like
Netflix influence your ability to push for higher rates, if at all?
And then on Turner, just any more color, Howard, maybe you can give us on the advertising revenue in the quarter. I
know you cited a dip in the industry demand and then of course the CNN challenge with tough comps. But the ratings
at TBS, how much did they influence the number? And you seem more optimistic about the outlook. Does that also
assume some further improvement at TBS?

<A - Jeffrey L. Bewkes>: All right, so on HBO first, obviously, it's been sitting in a package with pay-TV like
Showtime, basic cable for many years. So that's always been competitive. And there's no change in the pricing
environment for HBO in that regard.
If you ask about, as you did, the new subscription entries, whether it's Netflix, Amazon, Hulu Plus, et cetera, most of
those subs are complementary and doing something where, in fact, the highest – if you look at, I think Netflix viewing
for one is higher in HBO homes. HBO viewing is higher in Netflix homes. So those are add-ons. Those are homes that
want both the demand for not just pay-TV, but basic TV; so far, whether it's cord-cutting or cord-shaving, not
apparently affected by the additional online offerings, which are good and offer more library than current. So all that is
being gathered pretty well, and no, we don't see any discernible effect on subs or pricing in HBO from SVOD.
<A - Howard M. Averill>: Hi, Alexia. It's Howard. So as we did say on the call, advertising is up 1%, and that
included mid-single-digit growth in domestic entertainment, including kids and young adults. It was domestic news that
was down. It was down in the mid-teens, and that's due to the political comp. As far as ratings, there was a ratings
impact from TNT and to a lesser extent TBS. It contributed a bit against our expected growth. And as we mentioned,
there was a slow patch in scatter in November.
If you just look ahead to the first quarter though, we are seeing scatter pricing for the entertainments up in the high
single to low double digits over the upfront. And we're seeing strength across a pretty broad array of categories, so
food, packaged goods, fast food, auto. And demand for sports continues to look really strong. Additionally, we
mentioned that we're going to be airing the Elite Eight games in the first quarter. We didn't have that last year. That
could be a 200 or 300 basis point impact in the quarter.
And at CNN, the comparisons do get easier in the first quarter, but we are still seeing relatively soft demand. Overall,
one place where we're going to see some improvement is international, where there are easier news comps. In terms of
the Olympics, we do see some impact, including on sports, but we think it's going to be pretty modest. I think if you
take it all away, though, what we're going to end up with, we're counting on expecting an acceleration in that growth to
the mid to high single digits, as I mentioned.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Thank you very much.
Michael Kopelman
Thanks, Alexia. Thank you, everybody. Thank you for joining us this morning, and if you have any follow-up
questions, we're here to answer them. Have a great day.
