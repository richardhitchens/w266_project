Marillyn A. Hewson
Thanks Jerry. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on the call today. Before I begin, I want to offer
congratulations to our Lockheed Martin team for their outstanding performance that enabled the achievement of strong
first quarter operational and financial results while operating in a dynamic and challenging environment. Their focus
and efforts have our corporation poised for continued success in delivering solutions to customers and value to
shareholders.
While Bruce will cover the financials in more detail later on in the call, I would highlight some noteworthy financial
performance in the quarter that included growth in earnings per share to $2.33, 15% above last year's first quarter level.
Expansion of segment operating margin to 12.1%, achieving an increase of 20 basis points above last year's level and
generation of $2.1 billion in cash from operations.
Our continued strong cash flow is key to our cash deployment strategy to generate value to shareholders through share
repurchases and dividend payments. In the first quarter we repurchased over 5 million shares of stock for
approximately $460 million and paid slightly under $400 million in dividends. These combined cash deployment
actions returned over $830 million to shareholders in the quarter.
We continue to execute our strategy through solid performance on our core business and by winning key competitive
and follow-on awards to extend our franchise programs. We also expanded our international business activities and
continued our measured pursuit and exploration into adjacent new businesses.
Let me begin with a brief summary of our key order bookings in the quarter. Noteworthy awards included Aeronautics
receipt of an IDIQ award on the F-22 program for a 10-year fleet modernization and an extension under the
Raptor-Enhanced Development and Integration Program with a potential value of almost $7 billion. And our eight
long-lead funds for 29 new F-35 aircraft to the U.S. government.
Additionally, we were awarded funds for long lead acquisition of four F-35 aircraft for Japan. Mission Systems and
Training received $700 million for two additional Littoral Combat Ships increasing our LCS work backlog to six
vessels. And our Aegis team successfully won a competitive award for the Combat Systems Engineering Agent
Program. This award extends our multi-decade legacy and leadership on this important missile defense system.
Finally, our Space Systems team won a long lead contract to begin the construction of two additional spacecraft on the
SBIRS military satellite program for the U.S. Air Force. This award brings our backlog to four spacecraft and on this
critical national program that provides worldwide early warning detection of ballistic missile launches. These new
awards and our backlog of future work are direct indicators of the close alignment of our portfolio of products with
customers' strategic priorities and requirements and serve as a foundation for the future.
Turning to operational performance, our five business areas continued to execute with exceptional focus and skill in
providing critical services and products to customers. While the quarter contained numerous accomplishments, I would
like to highlight two notable successes and provide a brief update on F-35 key events.
First as part of the national strategy to pivot to the Asia Pacific regions, our Littoral Combat Ship, the USS Freedom,
began its deployment to Southeast Asia. We are extremely proud to have our ship chosen to do the inaugural
deployment of LCS class vessels to Southeast Asia. It is a testament to the maturity and capabilities of our innovative
multi-mission ship and we look forward to her contributions to the 7th fleet.
While visiting leaders at Pacific Command this quarter, I had the opportunity to go on board Freedom while she was
docked in Pearl Harbor en route to Southeast Asia. The pride of the crew in their ship and her capabilities was
inspirational and only serves to reinforce our critical role to provide these revolutionary warships to the Navy.
The next key operational achievement was accomplished by our Space Systems business with their successful launch of
the second SBIRS satellite for the U.S. Air Force. I have the privilege to be at the launch site in Florida in March with
our customer to watch the event. This satellite joins the currently deployed SBIRS spacecraft and expands the
constellation of early warning missile detection satellites. In this area of increasing proliferation of ballistic missile

threats from rogue nations, SBIRS provides vital intelligence and defense warning to our country and allies. We are
honored to be providing these critical national assets to our country and look forward to delivering the remaining four
satellites in our backlog.
Moving to F-35, key accomplishments in the quarter were deployment of CTOL aircraft to Nellis Air Force Base for
operational testing and evaluation and completion of the first operational mission conducted by Air Force pilots. The
first operational short take off, vertical landing at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, successful completion of the three
year Wing Flutter Testing Program on the CTOL version with clean results. And the first night time vertical landing of
STOVL aircraft at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station.
These accomplishments highlight the increasing maturity of the program. We're providing increasing levels of aircraft
capability and performance to the multiple service branches to enable expansion of pilot training and operational
evaluation of this revolutionary platform.
I'd like to now turn to the status of DoD budgets. Since we last spoke in January, the President signed into law the
consolidated and further continuing Appropriations Act of 2013. This act extended funding for the operations of all
federal agencies through September 30, 2013. It included full year appropriations for defense, military construction and
veterans' affairs. This continuing resolution will fund all other government agencies at last year's level.
With the approved FY 2013 DoD appropriations of $527 billion, our key programs continue to be supported and
funded under the full-year appropriation. Examples of that support we're seeing with the appropriations increasing
C-130J procurement to 16 aircraft from previously planned level of seven aircrafts and funding of almost $400 million
for the continuation of the MEADS program.
However, funding appropriated through this Act remains subject to the automatic budget cuts outlined under
sequestration. We are encouraged by recent alternative budget proposals offered by various members of Congress to
modify or eliminate the level of DoD budget reductions required under current sequestration. One version proposes no
additional budget reductions to Defense budget levels while another version proposes approximately $250 billion of
reductions from Defense over the next nine years. Adoption of either of these competing budget versions would
represent a significant improvement over the current $500 billion in budget cuts required under sequestration.
Beyond FY 2013 action, the President submitted his fiscal year 2014 budget proposal earlier this month. The proposed
level for the baseline FY 2014 Defense budget was outlined at $526 billion, a level essentially equal to the current FY
2013 appropriations level. Initial insight into program priorities contained in the President's FY 2014 request shows
strong alignment and budget support for a number of our key programs, such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, Littoral
Combat Ship, missile defense systems and higher quantities of C-130J aircraft.
It should be noted that the FY 2014 proposed budget does not account for the implications of sequestration that went
into effect in March, 2013. The impact of sequestration on our business has been minimal to date. And Bruce will
provide some modeling sensitivity on our 2013 financial outlook of sequestration in FY 2013.
Turning to the global security environment, rising tensions and threats on the Korean Peninsula coupled with the
ongoing conflict and instability in the Middle East only reinforce the complexity of maintaining global security. The
need for a spectrum of flexible and effective products to help maintain global security is growing more acute each day.
Lockheed Martin products are foundational assets in the preservation of global security.
Recent deployment of our products by the Department of Defense into the Southeast Asia region include placing F-22
fighters in South Korea and deploying the THAAD missile defense system on Guam, the Littoral Combat Ship with the
Seventh Fleet and Aegis missile defense systems. These deployments highlight the key strategic value and deterrent
capabilities of our unparalleled products to national defense. Our portfolio remains in direct alignment with this global
security mission and we look forward to providing critical defense and security solutions to domestic and international
customers.
I want to turn briefly to our focus and activity within international customers this quarter. Expansion of international
revenues remains a key component of our corporate strategy and we are on a path to grow international sales from

approximately 17% of total revenues last year to at least 20% in the next few years. As we've outlined previously, key
drivers of that expected growth will be higher levels of international work on the F-35, with growing levels of aircraft
deliveries to our partner countries, plus C-130J aircraft, F-16 aircraft and missile defense solutions, such as THAAD
and Aegis.
Direct in-country interaction and listening to the needs of customers are essential components to successful
international relationship building. This quarter, I had the opportunity to meet with key customers in Israel, United
Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Italy. Discussions centered on how our corporation can help them with their diverse
spectrum of security needs that range from fighter aircraft to missile defense systems to cyber security.
While in Saudi Arabia, we inaugurated our new in-country headquarters that will enable development of partnerships to
create products and enhance our offerings in technology, aerospace and security sectors. The common theme of the
meetings was the universally held belief that the global security environment is only becoming more complex and there
is a widespread desire to utilize many of our products and leading edge solutions to solve their most critical
requirements.
Before I ask Bruce to give you some color and details on our financial performance, I want to close of my comments by
providing some insights into three emerging technologies and adjacent pursuits of the corporation. As we've outlined in
the past, one of the new technologies we are examining is in the sustainable and alternative energy generation field
through a process called Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion, or OTEC. This technology uses the temperature variations
of ocean depth layers to power thermal exchange equipment and generate electricity.
We have created unique intellectual property and expertise in thermal exchange and recently signed a Memorandum of
Understanding to utilize our intellectual property and begin exploration of the design feasibility of a plant to generate
electricity on a commercial scale. This agreement is expected to lead to a contract that will fund our development effort
for a 10 megawatt pilot plant anticipated to be located off the coast of southern China. We are excited about the
potential future prospects of this technology to generate clean, renewable electricity.
The second adjacent market I'll give you an update on is our expanding commercial aircraft pilot training activities,
using simulators from our SIM Industries business that develops and manufacturers full motion and fixed base civil
aviation flight simulators for airline customers and independent pilot training centers worldwide. As a leader in
commercial simulators for Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 aircraft, SIM recently extended its product lines with
simulators for the Airbus A330 and Boeing 767, Boeing 777, and Boeing 787 aircraft.
SIM Industries' broad product offering enabled us to offer a very affordable training solution to the U.S. Air Force's
next-generation KC-46 tanker program. These growing activities and opportunities in this area demonstrate the synergy
that exists between the unique low-cost commercial offerings from SIM Industries and their applications to future DoD
programs. The Air Force is currently evaluating competitive bids for pilot training on the KC-46 tanker with a decision
on the winning bidder expected later this year.
The third new business opportunity area I'll highlight has recently emerged from our Advanced Materials Studies group
and is in the area of water purification. We recently received a patent for Perforene material, which is a molecular
filtration solution designed to provide clean potable water. The Perforene membrane features holes that are 1
nanometer or less in a graphene sheet and are small enough to trap sodium, chlorine and other ions from seawater while
dramatically improving the flow-through of water molecules. This flow-through is 100 times better than current reverse
osmosis systems, making it more effective at desalination at a fraction of the cost.
Access to clean drinking water is becoming more critical as the global population continues to grow. We believe that
this simple and affordable solution has the potential to be a game changer for the water industry. We're also
investigating other applications for Perforene such as biopharmaceutical separations and removal of chemical
substances and compounds from water used in oil and gas wells.
The pursuits I've highlighted today are only a few of the innovative and expanding portfolio of intellectual property and
products that offer future growth prospects for this corporation. We will keep you apprised of our progress in these
areas.

I'll now ask Bruce to go to through some of the details of our financial performance and then we'll open up the line for
questions. Bruce?
Bruce L. Tanner
Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments please follow along with
the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. Let's start with chart three, an overview of the quarter.
Sales in the quarter were $11.1 billion down slightly from last year, but ahead of our expectations at the beginning of
this year. Segment operating margin was strong at 12.1%, a 20 basis point improvement over the first quarter last year.
Our earnings per share were $2.33, up 15% from last year. We generated $2.1 billion in cash from operations and we
repurchased 5.1 million shares in the quarter. So I think we're off to a good start in 2013.
Chart four shows our sales for the first quarter versus – first quarter this year versus last year. Aeronautics sales
decreased by about 14% compared with last year. However, this was slightly better than our expectations when we
spoke in January as we had higher aircraft deliveries than planned in the quarter.
Our sales in the other four business areas were also stronger than expected, particularly in Missiles and Fire Control,
which also benefited from additional product deliveries and volume in the quarter. I should point out that with the
implementation of sequestration delayed until March 1, we saw a minimal impact to the quarter, but would expect that
impact to grow as we move forward. I'll discuss sequestration in greater detail in subsequent charts.
Moving to chart five and our first quarter segment operating results, our segment operating profit was comparable to
last year's level with the increase in margin offsetting the impact of lower sales in the quarter. We continue to have
strong program execution and are taking appropriate cost reduction actions as needed.
Turning to chart six and earnings per share, EPS in the quarter was 15% higher than a year ago, driven primarily by the
lower pension expense as a result of our contributions at the end of last year and the benefits of the R&D tax credit.
You'll remember that we mentioned on the last call that the first quarter would have the benefit of the full year 2012
credit as well as the 2013 first quarter credit and that's what we're seeing here. On a pension adjusted basis, our EPS
grew to $2.56 in the quarter.
If you'll turn to chart seven, we'll discuss our cash from operations in the quarter. As expected, our cash flow in the
quarter was very strong at nearly $2.1 billion; more than $1.5 million higher than the level last year, although last year's
level was reduced by a roughly $500 million pension contribution. We not only had strong operational performance,
but also had the benefit of a $540 million tax refund in the quarter resulting from our pension contributions at the end
of last year. We expect that ash generated this quarter will be the highest for the year as we have both pension
contributions and tax payments planned in future quarters that did not occur in the first quarter.
On chart eight, we'll discuss our cash returned to shareholders. We've returned over $800 million to shareholders this
quarter. Through our share repurchases and industry leading dividend yield. The level of share repurchases was almost
double what we did in the first quarter last year, and dividends were higher as a result of our 15% increase last
September.
Moving on to chart nine we'll discuss our updated view of the guidance we provided on the last call. You'll recall that
our January guidance did not consider the impacts of sequestration. Since then sequestration did become effective on
March 1. But as I said earlier, its implementation had minimal impact on our performance this quarter. Unless revised
by Congress, however, we would expect to see the effects of sequestration having impacts throughout the rest of this
year.
We tried to model these potential impacts by assuming a peanut butter spread of expected reductions to our U.S.
Government business awarded with FY 2013 funds. Or said differently, we did not assume any flexibility on our
customers' part to favor one program's budget over another. Using that approach we estimate a potential $825 million
impact to our sales in 2013. With the strong results of each of our five business areas in the first quarter though, we

believe our current sales outlook remains within the guidance range we provided in January and I'll explain that in more
detail on the next chart.
Chart 10 shows the methodology we used to develop our estimate of the impact of sequestration on our 2013 sales. At
the mid-point of our guidance we would expect just over three quarters of our sales or about $35 billion to be generated
from our year-end 2012 backlog. And we would expect sales to non-U.S. government customers from orders received
this year to be around $2 billion or so. Neither of these amounts is expected to be directly impacted by sequestration.
However, our original estimate of $8.25 billion of U.S. government sales from new orders this year is expected to be
impacted by sequestration. As we model the estimated impacts over the next three quarters, we project a reduction of
around $825 million in sales primarily impacting IS&GS, and MST.
On chart 11, we provide our updated guidance. Assuming the modeling from the previous chart and factoring in our
better than planned results in the first quarter, we now expect sales will be near the low end of our guidance range.
Even with the lower sales expectation, we are maintaining our segment operating profit and cash guidance reflecting
our growing confidence in our performance for the rest of 2013. And we're maintaining our earnings per share guidance
range of $8.80 to $9.10, though I'll emphasize that this range does not include restructuring charges, if any, associated
with sequestration as they're unpredictable at this time.
And finally, we have our summary on chart 12. The first quarter represents a strong start to the year with better than
expected sales volume and strong segment operating profit and cash from operations. These results continue to reflect
strong program execution, the proactive cost reduction measures we're taking and the strength of our portfolio. And we
continue to focus on actions that create value for our customers and our shareholders.
With that, we're ready for your questions. Allie?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Joe Nadol of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks. Good morning and a good performance.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Hey, Joe.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Marillyn, I actually had a question for you on the extensive comments you gave on the
non-defense portion of your business which is small, but seems like you're targeting quite a bit for growth. And really
just from two angles, one, because as you know, this has been a tough thing for defense companies to view in the path
to diversify during a downturn, so the two questions are, one, in your approach to the market, how are you orienting the
company to – really to impact commercial markets which has really been a difficult thing for companies to do? And – I
just mean in the – the difference in the customer base relative to the government, it's – comments there would be good.
And then secondly, from a risk standpoint, what kind of capital are you putting at risk and how are you considering that
going forward? Thanks.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Thanks for the question, Joe. I guess first off I would say, the things that you're seeing
coming forward are things that we've been investing in for a number of years. As a company, we're a technology leader.
We often talk about saying that we do hard stuff, we do difficult things and try to work on big things that are affecting
the global environment – the global security environment. So we're always investing in the future in that regard. And
we have 60,000 scientists and engineers that are working on things not only on our core products and services today,
but also looking at ways to give our adversaries an advantage or look at new areas that we can help in global security
needs.
So even as our customer budgets decline, we're going to continue to invest in these new technologies, because we think
that's really important that we do that. In terms of orienting us to commercial markets, I would say that the things that

we're doing right now are things that are, as I've said, we've been investing in for some time. And while it is a different
customer base, they are large projects, much like we do large projects across the corporation. In terms of the risk, these
are not big needle movers in the near term. We continue, we're not looking at a large cash investment. We've been
investing in for example the Perforene and the nanotechnologies for the past seven years. We've been investing in, the
Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion we've been working on since the 70s. We increased our investment in past five
years, but it's measured and disciplined investment that we make in R&D just as we do across the business.
So from that standpoint, it's a matter of not putting any capital at risk, but that we do expect these to be fully funded. In
fact, if you look at OTEC, that pilot plant will be fully funded by our partner as we bring our intellectual property
forward in that arena. In terms of the Perforene we did – we got a patent but we are now looking for opportunities to
partner on taking that one forward. So we partner with companies in the commercial market, that's what gives us the
capability to go into those new markets and that's how we'll approach those.

Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey Rob.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Marillyn and Bruce, a very nice quarter. If I could just go back to the sequester discussion for
a moment, I was going to ask Bruce, if you could give us a little bit more color on why we don't see more of an
earnings or margin impact from the lower sales or is it simply that that's already embedded in the range. And then more
specifically Bruce on your modeling discussion, you talked about peanut buttering, the GFY 2013 funding that impacts
this year, but what percentage of GFY funding for Lockheed is beyond 2013? I would imagine with the long cycle
nature of your product lines, it could be a large percentage.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So let me try and address both of those questions, Rob. So, why profit and cash are not
necessarily impacted or why we didn't change the guidance for those two elements versus what we did do for sales. A
lot of it is because of the first quarter quite honestly, and obviously we were higher in the first quarter for sales as well.
But we had good results, pretty much across the board, all five business areas beat our plan for them in terms of both
sales and operating profit.
I think as we looked forward for the next three quarters, we do expect to see some pressures for the reasons that I
described from sequestration. As I said earlier, they've not played out at this point, but we do expect them to happen in
the next three quarters. As we look out for the planned risk retirements and what we accomplished in the first quarter,
we think those are stronger as we sit here today than maybe we thought they'd be at the start of this year. And that's the
reason we didn't change the profit guidance. Cash flow obviously $2.1 billion in the first quarter, very strong, stronger
than we had expected honestly. And that's the other reason why we think that's going to carry on through the rest of this
year as well. That's the reason we didn't come down off of our cash as well.
I think your second question was, so how much of the FY 2013 carries over into next year? I made the comment Rob,
that the sales that we got from our backlog at the end of 2012 was about 77%. So, I think of that as new F – excuse me
FY – our calendar year 2013 sales originating 77% of which come from the 2012 backlog. That's not an unusual pattern
for us at all. I'll say, next year, we would expect it to look very similar to that.
So you should think of that as probably 25%ish, maybe a little less than that percent of our sales in 2014 will need to
come from orders received in 2014 and manifested into sales in 2014. So that pattern, as I look back over time, has
been a fairly consistent one, not at all unusual for what we are experiencing in 2013.

Our next question comes from Rob Stallard of the Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey Rob.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Morning.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: A quick question on capital deployment. Do you expect there to be more consolidation in the
defense industry as we see budget pressures playing out? And would you see Lockheed being participating in that? And
also to follow on from your comments Marillyn about these adjacent markets, would you potentially be interested in
acquisitions in more diversified areas, not just defense?
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Well, in terms of consolidations of the defense industry, I think as the spending contracts
we would expect that there would be more consolidation. It's just at what level. And it's been communicated to us by
our customers, they think at the prime level, it's about right in terms of the number of companies that are at prime. So it
would probably be at second or third tier or below that we will see consolidation. But I certainly expect that because the
economics will dictate that with the contraction of the budgets.
In terms of acquisitions into broadening our acquisitions, we are going to stay into the near adjacencies. We prefer to
do joint ventures and teaming where it makes sense. And we'll continue to look at our acquisition strategy as a
string-of-pearls approach and look at what will line up with the capabilities that we need in the markets that we want to
move into.

Our next question comes from Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey Doug.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: I'd like to understand how you are thinking about the longer term top line outlook.
Because on one hand if I look at the backlogs as they played out in this quarter means, as I look at it IS&GS appear to
be the most worrisome and that obviously could get hit by sequestration. When you talk about contracts and it's in the
budget it sounds like you are looking at a shrinkage overall in your top line.
And if I pair that up against the new ventures you are talking about going into, I mean I know that OTEC and the
reverse osmosis purification programs, those were going on 15 years ago. Are you looking at bringing those forward
more as a substitute for a contraction in the defense revenues or has something happened technologically that's caused
those to leap forward and become a more prominent effort?
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Thanks for the question Doug. Just to address where we see our growth, we do know that
our core domestic defense business will flatten, potentially decline. So, what we're focused on is growing our
international business. That's where we expect that to offset that and continue to grow. As I've said in previous calls
and today as well, we're currently at 17% of our sales, we expect to grow that to 20% over the next few years. So we
will continue to focus on where that demand is for our missile defense, our attack air, our air mobility, a lot of our C4
ISR satellite technologies. There's a whole range of products that there continues to be a strong demand for
internationally.
In terms of these adjacencies and some that I've talked about today, these are not needle movers in the near-term. These
are really things that we believe are long-term with large applications potentially in these technologies. And they are
not new to the horizon for us. As I've said, we've been working on them for a number of years. The fact that some of

them have come to fruition, we're dealing with different partners and different customers. And so they're ones that have
come about in the last few months that have come on the screen and we thought it would be appropriate to share with
you what's happening in those. But really our growth – our top-line growth will be on our core and near adjacencies
both domestically and internationally in the business.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Doug I might add just a little bit, I think on your last question you asked about sort of have
the technologies sort of aligned at this point in time. And I think that's probably a fair characterization. I think they
have sort of aligned here. We've been experimenting with some of the early materials that led up to the Perforene
products for probably the last seven years or so through our advanced materials organization. And that's sort of what's
just come out here. I think at the end of 2012 is what they – what the product that we think provides a sort of capability
that we've described with Perforene.
On the OTEC side, as Marillyn said earlier, we've been doing that literally since the 1970s. We actually had a pilot
plant in Hawaii off the coast of Hawaii that's been working, it's much, much smaller scale and the one we're talking
about building going forward. But we've had that operating for probably the last five years or so. So, some of the
technologies have come together, something has just been the ability to scale those technologies, particularly in the
OTEC side of it. And so, I think, that's what we're seeing. It's sort of the culmination of them and coincidentally they're
all sort of materializing here at the same time. Frankly, a very opportune time for us because that's where we are seeing
some pressure with our largest domestic customer.

Our next question comes from Jason Gursky of Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Hi, good morning everyone.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Good morning.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Hey just a clarification question and then a more meaty one. On the adjacencies, can you talk
about where you are, what percentage of revenue today, and what your targets are? And then is this a question of
potentially selling these intellectual property rights that you've developed here?
And then on the meaty question, Bruce can you talk a little bit about the cadence for cash for the rest of the year giving
all of the moving pieces with the pension contribution, the tax payment. And then we also – I think you've got the DoD
moving from net pay of 15 days into 29 days. I'm just wondering if that's going to have any impact on the cadence or
the cash for the rest of the year.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yes, Jason, good question. Let me try, I'll answer both and we'll see if Marillyn wants to add
anything to what I come up with. So on the adjacencies, how big. You should think of it as being fairly small, literally
as below 5% of our overall sales right now. We're hoping to grow that some going forward. The biggest elements we've
got right now are sort of in our energy business as well as our cyber security business. And those are two that we've
talked about fairly consistently on the calls. You should think of those as, as again being tough, I'll say low single-digits
percent of the overall sales of the corporation, hoping to grow those going forward.
The products that Marillyn described in her prepared remarks, would just add to that but not significantly I'll say over
the next five year period of time. We're just really trying to convey the message that we, one we, we like to think and
we do difficult and all these projects that we're talking about have difficult in their middle name if nothing else. And we
think we're aligning our capabilities and the innovative capabilities of our workforce with products – with problems
that need to be solved on a big scale and that's what we were trying to tee up for you.
As far as the cadence of the cash, I'm glad you asked that, I was hoping to work that in at some point in the
conversation anyway. So, obviously we're not going to do $2 billion a quarter when we're outlooking $4 billion for the
year. You should think – we had no pension contributions and a tax refund in the first quarter of this year. We should

be – over the next three quarters, we should have pension payments in the second and third. We'll actually have two tax
payments just the way the calendar lines up in the second quarter and then the tax payments in the third and fourth. So,
what you should see especially in the second quarter is we'll have cash flow down considerably; I mean probably to the
point of on a free cash flow basis slightly better than positive we're hoping. But down pretty significantly and then I
would expect it to grow up to the $800 million, $900 million in the last two quarters or so is what the expectation is as
we sit here.
You asked about the payment cycle and so forth. And I'll tell you we've – and I think the industry at large has seen
actually pretty good performance out of the payment offices where we get the most – the bulk of our collections from
our customer. They've been paying typically quicker than sort of the statutory rates that have been paid in the past.
What I'm watching for going forward in particular, Jason, is the effects of workforce furloughs on the part of the U.S.
government.
And particularly as that affects our paying offices. And so you can imagine a scenario where people will be furloughed.
I think the current think in the government is one day for 14 weeks in the months ahead. And the question is, is
everyone paying contractors as efficient in four days as they are in five? I've got to believe that's not going to be the
case. I would say though that that's expected to be an impact in the fiscal year and not necessarily for the calendar year,
because obviously the fiscal year will end in September and we would expect the next calendar year not to have those
sorts of furloughs, at least as we sit here today.

Our next question comes from Rich Safran of Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: I wanted to ask you about book-to-bill. So if I did it right, it looks you had book-to-bill of
roughly 0.6, and I think that's about what you did one quarter last year. So I thought maybe you could comment on
expectations for book-to-bill this year and how you feel about full year book-to-bill being either one times or higher?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, I'll try that one as well, Rich. So, I think your math is right. It was a 0.6 book-to-bill.
Actually as we look at the first quarter orders, we actually did better than we expected to do, pretty much across the
board for orders for all of our business areas. And in particular, I'll say, I think that's one of the reasons why some of
our short-cycle businesses like IS&GS and sort of the services component of MST, actually fared better in sales in the
first quarter is because we did actually receive slightly higher orders in the quarter than we had expected to.
Going forward, I think second quarter is going to be the lowest quarter from a backlog perspective of the year. And
then we would expect it to rise thereafter. So we expect second half orders to be higher than first half and the fourth
quarter to be the highest quarter of all the quarters, if you will. And that's our typical pattern anyway.
There is a couple of things I'll point to that you might be watching out for in the second quarter. We have a few high
dollar items mostly within our Aeronautics business area. So we'd expect to get the second order for, or close the
second order for 18 aircraft for, F-16 aircraft, I should say, for Iraq. Probably get an order for a couple of C-130s from
Saudi Arabia. There is a possibility we'll close on the Indian C-130, a second C-130 buy for India for six aircraft. We
still have six international aircraft on Lot 6 for F-35 that have yet to be sort of fully funded via an undefinitized
contractual action or UCA, that we would hope would happen in the second quarter. We should get additional funding
for even greater aircraft on LRIP-8 for F-35.
And then switching to MST we should be getting finalization of the MH-60 Denmark helicopter contract and some
ground radar business within MST. So those are sort of the dollar awards that you'll want to watch, the high dollar
awards.

Strategically there is a couple of big items as well, almost all of them within MST in the second quarter. So the Air
Missile Defense Radar, or AMDR, program we expect to be awarded in the second quarter. As with Space Fence, this
is the sort of the space debris tracking radar if you will from earth that we expect to happen in the second quarter. And
then lastly within MST, the KC-46 training activity that Marillyn mentioned in her prepared remarks is also something
that we would expect to domino, either late in the second quarter or early third.
The rest of the year, we're hopeful obviously we've got some missile defense products PAC-3's and THAADs, for a
number of customers within the Middle East. And then recently if you saw some of the FMS activity just came out, we
are hopeful to have some weapons on F-15s and some capabilities for helicopters with Saudi Arabia as well as the
potential to sell additional F-16s to the UAE.
So, whether that one will happen between now and end of the year it may be a little bit sporty, but we are focused on
that and hopeful that that could occur. I should mention probably that we have also got activities within Singapore and
South Korea for the F-35. Again, I am not sure if those will happen this year or not, but they are on the cusp, and ones
that we are watching very closely.

Our next question comes from George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Yes. Good morning, Bruce.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, George.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: One just little one and then one I'll put together. You mentioned a contractual settlement on
the F-16 in the quarter, could you kind of ballpark how big that was?
And then my more macro question is if you look at historically defense outlays and track them against military
contractors, very rarely does a military contractor vary a heck of a lot from the numbers. And if you look at 2014, the
outlays for procurement and R&D probably going to be down at least 10%. So I guess I ask the question why wouldn't
your revenues be down similar to what you would expect at the end of the year?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, so George, I'll take those. So the F-16 – the contractual resolution you should think of
that being in the – I'm not even sure it would approach $10 million, but think of it in the $10ish million range, maybe a
little less than that. So not a particularly huge item, but one that has been outstanding for quite a while and we're glad to
have it finally settled now. I literally think this is one that's probably been around, as have quite a few of these
contractual resolutions we've had settled in the past, for probably close to a decade, so it's good to get that one behind
us.
As far as the outlays, you were looking at the defense outlays versus the contractor. I'll remind you again that 61% of
our sales roughly last year were from the DoD, so there's a full almost 40% that's non-DoD. Obviously, the biggest
component of that is the international. We do expect as Marillyn said to grow the international component of our
business, which would help maybe explain why we don't go down to 10% you're talking about there.
And then what I'd suggest George is that even within that reduction in the procurement and R&D, you have to look at
the individual programs within the DoD budget, because not every program within the DoD budget is going down 10%
and it's tied into the priorities of the customer and our alignment of our portfolio with those priorities. So, we would
expect the F-35 to grow, our air missile defense programs to grow and help to offset that. And on the international side
obviously, as we mentioned earlier, the air missile defense components especially growing over the next few years that
helps to offset that reduction I think you're seeing in the – in sort of the high level math that you described.

<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you. I want to ask more of an operational question. For example, if we look at
Aeronautics, Marillyn, you were able to hold the decline, for example, in the C-130 to about $10 million, despite seeing
$175 million decline in revenues, which is a pretty impressive sort of action. And if we look across some of the other
businesses, despite difficult revenue numbers, the margins were pretty darn good. Could you talk a little bit about with
some detail on some of the things you're doing whether it's head count or floor space? And, because, no matter what
happens with the sequester, I think there's just going to be a relentless pressure on the business for a while.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Well, we're definitely focused on operational performance. So, I think you characterized
it well in terms of talking about it being operational, because we've been – we've – not only are we driving
improvement even as we reduced the rate on the C-130J, we were able to hold our position relative to profit on the
program. So, I think you're seeing the results of that.
And at the same time, we're very much across our business working on reducing costs and increasing efficiencies and
productivity in the business through a lot of activities, not just operationally with, on a particular program, but all of
that flows through to all of our programs. So, things that we're doing in getting out of facilities and reducing our
overheads and the efficiencies that come with just having a laser focus on costs across every element of the business is
helping us to bring in better performance. And then within the C-130J, I mean, as it moves through its courses, you
have a learning curve. And so, continuing to have productivity improvements as we continue with the rate of that
program.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, Howard, just an interesting little tidbit there. I know my Aeronautics friends have
pointed this out to me as we've done reviews with Marillyn and the leadership team there.
We've actually for the past few C-130s, since we started building them at 24 aircraft a year, the hourly rate, or the hours
it takes to assemble that C-130, we're actually performing better than we were – when we were delivering 34 aircraft a
year. So that's no small feat when you're on number what, 4,500 aircraft, not 4,500 – 2,500 aircraft through the line, and
at this stage of the product development or product manufacturing cycle, that we've been to make that. Those are real
live reductions and just one of several instances that we can point to, that are – where we're taking the right actions,
particularly on the manufacturing side of bringing down the product costs in line with the shrinking volume that we're
seeing.
Operator
Our next question comes from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Thanks. Good morning. Well, first one is a clarification. Bruce, I think you had previously
talked about $80 billion in backlog ending the year. And I can't recall if that was with sequestration or without and if
that number had changed.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yes. So Myles, I think what I've tried to tee up is that we always expect that we'd take a
downturn in the first quarter, probably get further down in the second quarter. I think at the start of the year, I said we
hoped to get back around the $80 billion mark. That's still obviously a goal that we have, but I think it's going to be
tougher assuming that the next three quarters are hit by sequestration. So those numbers, you remember them right, it
was the $80 billion but I'll say it's probably tougher as we sit here today because that did not consider the effects of
sequestration.
And of course, we would – you would think that orders in the fiscal year, since we had more of our orders obviously
coming from the fiscal year 2013 funds, would be more significantly impacted than would sales in calendar year of
2013 because less of those come from fiscal year 2013 funds. So, it would be a bigger number than the $825 million of
sales impact is what I would expect from an orders perspective. But we are not yet at this point giving up on that, and
hopefully as the quarters go by, Myles, we'll have a better idea of what that looks like and will be able to update that for
you as we go through the year.

<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes, thank you and great performance.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Thanks, Cai.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Thank you.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Bruce, one of the things you highlighted was that UACs were better than expected, it was
470, 35% of sales. That's substantially higher than it's been in any of the last couple of years. Where do you expect it to
be for the year?
And two questions: give us some color on the quarterly pattern as you did with the cash flow. And then, where
notionally can this number go in the future, is it likely to come down to more normal levels or is it still sustainable?
Thanks so much.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: You bet, Cai. So, UACs – at least as I look at Cai, we actually were a little bit lower in terms
of profit adjustments in the first quarter of this year as compared to what we did last year. So, think of it still in the sort
of mid 30%ish range but slightly less, I think about $15 million or $20 million less this year versus last year.
You asked for sort of the pattern going forward, we would expect it to be within probably the 30% to 35% range each
and every quarter going forward, probably down a little bit from last year overall. But of course, the sales and the
segment profit are expected to be down this year compared to last year, so that that's probably following suit for the
lower volumes that you see there.
Nothing really jumps out as I look at it as far as spikiness as we sit here today in terms of the pattern going forward.
That obviously changes as we do risk retirements. We do them when we retire the risk, not when we necessarily plan to
do the risk. So when I describe the pattern going forward, it's what we plan to do but we could obviously do better or
worse than that.
We really don't have a reason to believe that the future is necessarily going to look any differently than the past. I know
that's been the subject of a lot writing, but it's the same methodology we've used consistently for a long, long time. And
that's been our pattern. We've kind of described that over time. I think last year was a bit odd in a couple of quarters
because we had some large contractual resolutions that sort of jumped out that were not in our historical levels. But
going forward, what we see is still sort of in that 30% to 35% range and not much change from that, Cai.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: And then, you've mentioned that it was better than you expected. How much has that
changed, is that ...? You mentioned that as a plus for the full year to offset the lower sales. Is that – how much better
does it look now, approximately?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, I don't know that I've got the numbers off the top of my head, Cai, but I would say we
were not expecting to – we got the benefit of both volume obviously. I think on the last call, I had teed up that we were
probably going to be down $1 billion year-over-year in the first quarter. We ended being down, what, about $800
million. Again, across the board, all five business areas were better in sales, better in profit. The sales obviously
brought volume – with volume in terms of profit on those sales.
If I had to guess a number, I would probably offset maybe about $50ish plus million is probably what I would guess
that happened earlier and somewhat higher than we'd expected, Cai. And that's a little bit off the top of my head. And
we'll see what that looks like going forward, but again, I don't see a huge pattern shift as we go forward the next three
quarters from what we did in the first quarter.

<Q - David E. Strauss>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hi, David.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Bruce, going through your sequestration math as it relates to 2014, is there anything besides
international that would offset overall revenues potentially being down in the high single-digit range? And then
Marillyn, a question for you in terms of sizing the business for sequestration, you obviously highlight here further
restructuring in IS&GS. Can you just talk maybe broadly how you view the business size-wise head count, from a head
count perspective if sequestration does go through in full effect? Thanks.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yes, so David you asked me the first part of that question. So, again what I've tried to tee up
and I won't just simply repeat myself, but we do tend to have a very similar pattern as far as the amount of sales that we
derive from backlog year-over-year. So, as we've talked in the past, our long-cycle businesses, Aeronautics and Space
in particular get 90 plus percent of their sales in the following year from the backlog from prior years. That goes down,
probably IS&GS is our lowest business that gets in terms of the percentage of sales that are derived from previous
year's backlog, but think of that as probably 65ish percent. So 35% comes from new orders turning into new sales in the
year.
The thing about 2014 that I think we all have to remember is, so 2013 is the peanut butter or across-the-board cuts.
2014 with the new President's budget, there is no peanut butter cut. So they can actually cut whatever, I'll say aligns
with the strategy starting in government fiscal year 2014. That's different than what we saw or what we will see in
fiscal year 2013 and where I would offer up, this is sort of the proof of the pudding of whether or not your portfolio
aligns to the government's strategic interests or not in terms of the DoD's priorities.
We think ours does, we think ours has more staying power in that environment than in a peanut butter environment.
And that's what I think – David, I think is maybe not all that well understood but I think does make a difference as we
look into FY 2014 versus 2013.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: And Marillyn?
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: So, to address the sizing of the business for sequestration, now we are going to have five
of the businesses as we get more clarity from our customer. But frankly, it's difficult to forecast. I know Bruce talked a
lot about modeling. But it really was – the best we could do to model what that impact would be until we get better
insight on their planning for sequestration it will be difficult to say which programs get hit and therefore which
programs – what kind of head count might be modified accordingly. So there's a lot of uncertainty here. As Bruce said
though when you look at the budget request for FY 2014, it is certainly important not only to national security strategy,
but it also very much aligns with our portfolio.
We'll continue to invest in new technology, we'll continue to drive down our costs and I think we remain well
positioned to succeed in this environment going forward.

<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: I got one in. Hey Bruce, can you kind of discuss a little bit about the sales, before you'd say
sales for the quarter would be about $1 billion below and then you came in a little bit better on aircraft deliveries. But it
looks like almost across the board, MS&T, M&FC, IS&GS, Space all running ahead of what you said you would be
doing in the 10-K in terms of the full year. So, is there a reason why there was so much front ended and what does that
mean for the progression of the different quarters?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yes, a good question Sam. So, I tried to tee that up I think with Cai when he asked the earlier
question that we were higher in the first quarter than we expected. I teed up being about $1 billion down, we actually
ended up being $200 million down. So, there was $800 million of goodness there. Think of it as a couple of hundred
million within Aeronautics, so probably for a couple of C-130s earlier delivered than plan. The rest of this volume,
Missiles and Fire Control was up on just a percentage basis like 13% year-over-year in the first quarter. Most of that
was the phasing or timing of deliveries of products there. So, think of it as in particular tactical missiles, JASSM
missiles, the Multiple Launch Rocket System activities there. That's earlier than planned, but not necessarily an upper
for the year as we look at it at this – at the end of the first quarter.
We also saw higher volume just I'll say cost volume from a couple of awards including within SOF CLS and with
LANTIRN and Sniper activity within Missiles and Fire Control. Some of our short-cycle business, I'll say we were
very pleasantly surprised in the first quarter. I mentioned earlier that we were going to – that we actually exceeded our
orders expectations in the first quarter, even though you were looking at that as a 0.6 book-to-bill ratio that was actually
slightly better than we expected. And on our short-cycle business, we think that did translate into higher sales in the
quarter as well.
So, not sure if that will last throughout the year. That's one of reasons we've put the guidance out that we did. But we're
pleased to have that impact in the first quarter. I think some of that is because we frankly saw – I'll say sense of urgency
to get things under contract prior to the end of last year when we thought sequestration was going to start in early
January. I think we experienced a similar phenomenon at the end of February when the customer thought that
sequestration was going to get in effect on March 1. A number customers thought that obligated funds would not be
subject to sequestration if obligated prior to that. I think we got a bit of a rush to kind of get those under contract. I
think we're seeing the benefits of that on our short-cycle businesses.
So maybe just to finish off my long dialogue here, but going forward the next few quarters, I think our sales level are
going to be similar in the second and third to what we experienced in the first quarter. Maybe down slightly because
sequestration's largest impacts at least as we look for the rest of the year are going to occur in the second and third
quarters. Because you're kind squeezing the full government's fiscal year or sequestration cuts into the last two quarters
of the fiscal year.
So for us that's the second and third quarter of the calendar year. I think we'll see bigger reductions there. I do think
fourth quarter will be a larger quarter, the largest quarter of the year going forward even with the potential reductions
that have yet to be announced in fiscal year 2014 from sequestration. So, that's sort of how it ties up. Think of again the
next three quarters similar maybe a little bit down because of sequestration to the first quarter and then a pop up in the
fourth quarter.
