MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, and welcome to the Xerox Corporation Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Release Conference Call, hosted
by Ursula Burns, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. She is joined by Kathy Mikells, Executive Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer. During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the
web at www.xerox.com/investor.
At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and/or rebroadcasting
of this call are prohibited without the expressed permission of Xerox. After the presentation, there will be a
question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] During this conference call, Xerox executives will make
comments that contain forward-looking statements, which, by their nature, address matters that are in the future and are
uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.
At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.
Ursula M. Burns
Good morning, and thanks for joining our call. Today, we are reporting third quarter 2014 earnings. And in addition to
sharing our performance, I'll update you on progress that we're making against our overall strategy, and how we're
positioning ourselves for the future.
Overall, our business model is healthy. We have the benefit of a strong annuity business, a diversified portfolio, and
healthy cash flow. We delivered earnings at the high-end of our range and grew margin on a total Xerox basis. We're
making progress. We are the leader in diversified business process Services, and we are maintaining the leadership in

our Document Technology business, and we're investing in both businesses for the future. So here are some specifics
on the progress that we're making.
We remain the leader in Document Technology and its strong profitability continues to help fuel our growth initiatives.
We announced 17 new products during the third quarter, meeting market demand for continued innovation in this
category. We continue to strengthen our position in Services. We're implementing a new operating model and client
coverage strategy to improve signings performance and productivity. We continue to strengthen our leadership and
apply talent to areas where we see the greatest market opportunity.
We're bringing greater value to our Services clients with the use of advanced analytics that deliver insights gleaned
from our delivery model. A good example is in commercial healthcare, which was a standout again, this quarter. Here,
we recently launched Juvo, an advanced analytics platform that allows hospitals to analyze every aspect of the clinical
cycle of care. Our Document Outsourcing business is getting external recognition as well. Our three-tier Managed Print
Services strategy was called out by IDC for innovative leadership.
The Xerox Merge system, which uses data analytics to optimize parking demand and meter pricing, was a winner of the
2014 Promising Innovation in Transport Award. So across both Services and Document Technology, we remain
focused on our important stakeholders, delivering value for our investors, being the best partner to our clients, and
making Xerox a great place to work for our people.
So here is a look at our results and my perspective. We're reporting adjusted EPS of $0.27, which is at the high-end of
the range that we set. Our Document Technology business came in above expectations, while Services margin results
were lower than planned.
On the revenue side, Services grew modestly, and Document Technology declined in line with our expectations. Our
operating margin is up year-over-year, driven by strong margins in Document Technology. Services margins were up
sequentially, but lower than we anticipated, as a result of higher costs in government healthcare, as well as ongoing
strategic investments. And we continue to use our strong cash flow, almost $600 million in the quarter to deliver value
to stakeholders through dividends and share repurchases.
We're raising full-year guidance for share repurchases to approximately $1 billion. And we are making disciplined
acquisitions, targeted at enhancing our services capabilities. Most recently, we acquired Consilience Software, Inc., a
case-management and workflow automation software provider for government agencies. We have a talented and
dedicated team which we continue to strengthen. Our goal remains to provide leading products and services for our
clients and deliver the operational results expected of us.
With that, I'll turn it over to Kathy. Then, I'll wrap up and we'll open the call to your questions. Kathy?
Kathryn A. Mikells
Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. There were a number of pluses and minuses in the quarter, but overall,
we delivered roughly in line revenue and EPS at the high-end of our range with strong cash flow. We took a bit of a
different path to achieve that outcome with Document Technology profitability coming in stronger and offsetting lower
Services profitability. I'll cover both segment results as well as cash flow separately. But first, let's walk through
earnings.
Revenue in the quarter was down 2% at both actual and constant currency. In total, segment revenue trends were
largely as expected, with Services up modestly and Document Technology down mid single-digits. Gross margin of
30.8% was down 70 basis points year-over-year, driven by a decline in Services, as well as the greater mix of Services
at a lower margin.
RD&E was lower year-over-year as increases in Services were more than offset by productivity-driven reductions and
Document Technology. SAG was lower in both segments as we benefited from productivity initiatives as well as lower
pension expense. These improvements more than offset the lower gross margin and resulted in operating margin

expansion of 10 basis points year-over-year. Operating profit in total was roughly flat as margin expansion basically
offset the impact of the revenue decline.
Moving down the income statement, adjusted other net was $29 million higher year-over-year. Within that, O(I)D was
$35 million higher, reflecting a real estate gain in the prior year as well as higher litigation reserves this year.
Restructuring of $28 million was $7 million lower year-over-year and in line with our guidance.
Adjusted tax rate of 26.8% was 1 point lower year-over-year and at the high-end of our guidance range of 25% to 27%.
Adjusted EPS of $0.27 was a $0.01 higher year-over-year as growth in Document Technology operating profit roughly
offset the decline in Services. And below the line, higher O(I)D expense was more than offset by lower share count.
I'll now move to Services segment slide to review our results in more detail. Services revenue grew 1% and was flat at
constant currency, which was about 1 point lower sequentially, reflecting the impact of the Texas Medicaid loss that we
discussed last quarter.
Within Services, BPO growth increased to 2% from 1% in the second quarter with good growth in commercial
healthcare, litigation services and international. ITO declined 3% due to the impact of lower prior ITO signings, as
we've become more selective in where we participate in that business, with our main focus on improving our margins
and profit there. Document Outsourcing was flat year-over-year with continued strong growth in our SMB offerings
offset by lower equipment sales and enterprise.
We expect Services top line growth to remain constrained in the fourth quarter as several large new deals that have
been awarded are taking longer to get to contract, and some new business decisions that have been deferred are also
delaying the ramp of new work. This is negatively impacting signings as well which were down year-over-year. We
had previously anticipated better signings results throughout the second half, but are now seeing the shift to the fourth
quarter and early 2015 reflecting the decision and contracting delays. We have a strong pipeline of 7% year-over-year
and are continuing to ramp up sales hiring and training.
Renewal rate in the quarter was 82%, which is modestly below our target range of 85% to 90% driven by a lower ITO
renewal rate. The BPO renewal rate was above 90% in the quarter, albeit with less renewal opportunity. We have a
large BPO contract renewal that's been awarded and is in the process of being contracted, so that should help our fourth
quarter renewal rate and signings.
Shifting to profitability, segment margin was 8.9% in the third quarter, which was up 30 basis points sequentially, but
fell short of our target to get something north of 9.2%. We did see solid sequential margin expansion in BPO, even
when adjusting out the government healthcare Nevada HIX impairment charge from last quarter.
In Document Outsourcing, our margins are quite good, but are seasonally lower in the third quarter. And in ITO, we
took a temporary hit in margin as we proactively restructured a few contracts, seeking to improve the mix and
profitability of that business. Within government healthcare, we're making good progress, but expense levels are still
high as we continue to invest to improve the performance of the first platform implementation of our new Medicaid
platform. These impacts were more constrained in the third quarter, but are still a headwind year-over-year.
We've been realigning the services organization to better leverage our scale, gain efficiencies, and improve customer
value. We're aligning the organization to specific industries to improve our go-to-market approach and have
consolidated management of operational capabilities to achieve scale benefits. We believe this structure will also
enable improved execution. We continue to bring in additional new talents under Bob's leadership, and are focused on
accelerating productivity gains and delayering our old SBU management structure. In the fourth quarter, we expect
further sequential margin improvement, however, we're moderating our expectations in light of our third quarter results
and investments required as we push forward with our Services strategy. We expect margins to be between 9% and
10% for the quarter.
With that, I'll review Document Technology. Revenue in Document Technology was down 6% at actual and constant
currency, and was in line with expectations. Equipment revenue declines moderated versus the second quarter, and
although annuity declines were a bit higher, this was due entirely to the impact of finance receivable sales in the prior

year, which had a 1 point impact to revenue growth. From a geographic perspective, trends were generally consistent
with last quarter, with the U.S. stable, Europe improving, and developing markets weak, but with moderating decline.
Looking at product groups, we're seeing very positive results in the high-end with growth in both equipment and
annuity revenue. High-end annuity revenue grew the past two quarters, which is encouraging, as it reflects increases in
MIF and pages in this important segment. Mid-range was in line with overall Document Technology decline, while
entry performance was weaker.
The third quarter was a very strong quarter for new products, with 17 products launched and an additional three
launched in October. We extended our very successful ConnectKey platform into a number of entry multifunctional
devices, as well as into color and mono mid-range products. By further extending the platform, we provide even more
options for our customers looking to leverage our strong mobile, security and app development. This should position us
well in the fourth quarter and as we enter 2015.
Document Technology margin in the quarter was 14%, resulting in operating profit growth of 9%, despite the revenue
decline. The strong margin performance reflects benefits from restructuring and cost initiatives, as well as continued
favorable mix, positive transaction currency, and lower pension expense. Although a mix may not be as favorable in
the fourth quarter, we expect continued strong margin performance, down sequentially, but up year-over-year.
As we look to 2015, based on today's rates, we'd expect currency transaction benefits to continue. However, pension
expense will be a significant headwind. Pension settlement expense this year is expected to come even lower than we
previously anticipated, declining about $100 million year-over-year. The further decline relates to changes in the
discount rate used to determine benefits, with the rate recently published for 2015, coming in lower than 2014. This
naturally motivates individuals to wait to take their lump sum in 2015, when the benefit will be higher and will shift
more cost for us into next year.
This is the opposite phenomena from what we experienced from 2013 to 2014 when the discount rate increased, and it
adds non-cash volatility to our earnings. With the discount rates declining, we expect about $105 million of additional
non-cash settlement expenses next year. Our technology segment margins have been running well above our long-term
guidance of 9% to 11%, and even with the pension headwind, we'd expect we will be above the high-end of the range
against next year. I'll turn now to cash flow.
Cash flow from operations was $595 million in the quarter and $1.2 billion through September. As expected, cash flow
in the quarter was lower than prior year due to the positive impact of $316 million last year from the finance receivable
sales versus a net negative impact of $102 million this year, due to the loss of collections from previous sales.
Underlying cash flow which excludes the impact from prior year's finance receivable sales was $697 million in the
third quarter and $1.5 billion through September. With cash from operations, we continue to see the benefit from
working capital, which included some timing benefits within accounts payable this quarter. So overall, it was another
strong operating cash flow quarter.
Moving down the cash flow statement, investing cash flows were a $128 million use in the quarter. We spent $112
million on CapEx and $25 million on acquisitions for the recently announced Consilium acquisition, a provider of
case-management and workflow automation software that will strengthen Xerox's suite of offerings to state
government. Additionally in the third quarter, we exited the Xerox Audio Visual Solutions business, a small audio
visual business that was non-core and flowed into our other segment results.
Cash from financing was a use of $417 million, and included $251 million in share repurchases and $83 million in
preferred and common stock dividends. So to wrap up cash flow, with three quarters done, we're well-positioned to
deliver on our full-year cash flow guidance of $1.8 billion to $2 billion of operating cash flow, which equates to $1.3
billion to $1.5 billion of free cash flow. And as a reminder, we have no finance receivable sales planned in the fourth
quarter as compared to proceeds of $247 million in the fourth quarter of 2013.
Now, I'll quickly cover capital structure. We ended the quarter with $7.7 billion in debt, and in line with our original
guidance, we continue to expect to end the year with about $7.8 billion in total debt. Applying 7:1 leverage on
customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt is $4.2 billion, leaving core debt of $3.5 billion. We manage our

core debt to maintain a leverage ratio consistent with our investment grade credit rating, while financing debt has come
down over the past two years driven by the finance receivable transactions as well as lower origination. So we have a
pretty stable capital structure, and if we move to the next slide, I'll review where we are at on share repurchases and
dividends.
With our strong cash flow to-date, and taking advantage of our high beginning of the year cash position, we steadily
repurchased shares this year for a total of $730 million or 61 million shares through September. We continue to view
our shares as a good investment and we are increasing our full-year share repurchases to approximately $1 billion. Our
full year guidance for dividend payments remains about $300 million, and reflects our current quarterly dividend of
$0.0625 per share. When combined with the share repurchases, we now expect approximately $1.3 billion to be
returned to shareholders this year.
Before I turn it back to Ursula, I'd like to summarize our expectations for the fourth quarter and full year. We expect
Document Technology to continue to deliver strong margin, up year-over-year in the fourth quarter, but down
sequentially, driven by the new product launch timing and mix with full year margin above 13%. Revenue declines
remain down mid single-digits in constant currency and down an additional 2 points at actual currency in the fourth
quarter, given the recent strengthening of the dollar relative to the euro. As I detailed earlier, we're continuing our
investments and improvement actions in Services, and expect our fourth quarter margins to expand sequentially to
approximately 9% to 10%, with revenue growth flat to up 1%, with about 1 point of negative currency impact.
At the consolidated level, for the fourth quarter, we expect revenue will decline about 3 points, including 1 point to 2
points of negative currency. With adjusted earnings per share of $0.30 to $0.32 which includes about $0.02 of
restructuring. And for the full year, we now expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.11 to $1.13. As we look to 2015,
our EPS expansion will be constrained, due to the volatility of non-operational pension settlement expenses that I
discussed earlier.
With that, I'll hand it back to you, Ursula.
Ursula M. Burns
Thanks Kathy. I want to get to your questions, so I will summarize quickly. Our third quarter shows our strategy is on
track but we still have areas for improvement. We're seeing the benefits of strong operating profit from Document
Technology while we position our Services business for future growth. Our annuity-based operating model, diverse
portfolio and strong cash flow combine for a healthy and resilient business model.
We'll finish 2014 with a focus on three priorities; in Services, improving growth and profit through portfolio
management and improved productivity; in Document Technology, capitalizing on the most advantaged segments of
the business to maintain our leadership position in the industry, while maintaining strong profitability; and we'll
continue to generate healthy cash flow to deliver shareholder value.
Thank you. And now over to you, Jim.
James H. Lesko
Thanks, Ursula. Joining Ursula and Kathy today is Bob Zapfel, Head of our Services business. Also let me point out
that we have several supplemental slides at the end of our deck. They provide more financial detail to support today's
presentation and complement our prepared remarks. For the Q&A, I ask participants to please limit follow-on and
multi-part questions so we can get to everyone. And at the end of our Q&A session, I'll turn it back to Ursula for
closing comments.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang from J.P. Morgan.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Hi. Good morning. Thank you. Just wanted to first ask about the signings and the visibility
there. What's driving the push out and the project grants and the signings? Is it a cyclical issue or maybe client
priorities changing? Any color there would be great.
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: Thanks, Tien-tsin. This is Bob. I think you have to break it into big deals versus more
traditional. And I think, on the big deal side of it, we have seen elongated process largely associated really with
competitors protesting and those cycles running longer. So, on the big deal components we're very happy with our
success rate. They are taking longer to get to closure.
On the more traditional kind of volume of pursuits, our win rate remains very strong in the third quarter. Of the top 20
deals that we were pursuing, we didn't lose a single one, but our in-quarter conversion rate was lower than typical, and I
would say that's a little bit of a function of, where there is more that we need to do and that we're investing in relative to
our sales force and helping them get the larger deals or those top 20 deals over the goal line. So, hopefully that's
responsive to your question.
<Q - Tien-tsin Huang>: Sure. Then as we think about fourth quarter, and I guess, for the full year, is there a new view
on your signings target for this year? What needs to be achieved in order to see some growth next year? And, also, just
trying to understand a little bit more as a follow-on within ITO, it sounds like you did some contract restructuring. Can
you size that, and is there more to do there? That's all I had. Thank you.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: So if you look overall at the trends, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've
basically seen a slippage of when we were expecting to see year-over-year improvement in signings. And so as we look
to the fourth quarter, we'd expect to see year-over-year improvement. I mentioned that we had one large renewal, which
should occur in the fourth quarter. That should help both our renewal rate, as well as our overall signings.
With regard to ITO, which I think was the second part of your question, we're really managing ITO as a niche business,
looking to really have deals where we're partnering ITO with BPO, and we're getting an overall, I'd say, good margin
performance from that support, but not really chasing what I'd call bigger commoditized deals in ITO. And as a
consequence of that, we certainly expect that we're going to have a lower overall growth rate in ITO.
Now, we are still winning new business in ITO. We want a new contract this quarter in ITO. So it's a business that we
absolutely are continuing to pursue, but we're being more selective in terms of what we're pursuing.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Tien-tsin. If we could have the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross from Cross Research.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you very much. I had a question with regard to restructuring both on the Document
Technology side, as well as on Services. Just, how are you thinking about restructuring as you go into 2015? What kind
of opportunities do you think you're seeing? Because it seems like you basically reinvested some of the upside this
quarter on the Document Technology side into Services. So how do we sort of think that all flows through and we see
the opportunities in 2015? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Sure, Shannon. So if you look at restructuring, first thing I'd say is, we don't excite on
restructuring, right? A big part of the reason we don't excite on restructuring is, especially within our technology
business, it is the regular course of our business. I think we're incredibly disciplined and very good about it. So when

you look at what we've done so far this year, we've done about $0.02 kind of every quarter. We just guided to doing
another $0.02 in the fourth quarter. And so I think you can continue to expect, as you look forward, that we're going to
have those kinds of restructuring charges regularly.
In terms of the mix of restructuring charges, I'd actually expect that we're going to see a little bit higher mix towards
Services. Clearly, one of the things that we need to do is further ramp up productivity initiatives? And so I would
expect to see that mix change a little bit. But I'll just remind you that, from an expense perspective, we're always going
to be technology-heavy because those tend to be kind of our higher-cost workers, and we'll continue to do a lot of work
there.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: And maybe, Bob, can you talk about specific areas you think you can improve within
Services? And, again, how we think – what have you seen over the last several months that you've been there, and how
are you sort of thinking about opportunities in 2015?
<A - Shannon S. Cross>: Yes, Shannon. So I think, from an improvement standpoint, at the macro level, the two areas
that I would call out most visibly is, we really do think that we can improve our sales conversion, and we're taking a
number of actions there. One is beefing up the sales team, in terms of adding to the hiring. The second is a more
aggressive sales training program that we're leveraging. So I would say, one thing that I've kind of concluded after
seven months, is that there was more that we could do there. Ursula says to me, if you're winning all the time, you're
not covering enough because you should have a mix of wins and losses in the marketplace. So we're trying to broaden
our coverage. And then, I think, the second area that I would call out that we've been on, but that we will be ramping up
the pace is we have moved to a global capability model around our delivery teams, and kind of away from 2,500
strategic business unit structure to more managing delivery globally. And we believe that we can leverage that to drive
productivity increases that is part of what Kathy shared as we think about going forward. So those would be the two
main things.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks Shannon. If we can have the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Barclays.
<Q - Benjamin Reitzes>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Good morning.
<Q - Benjamin Reitzes>: Good morning. My question is around some of the things you said around 2015. It seems
like there is a $0.06 hit year-over-year due to pension vis-à-vis prior expectation. And I was wondering if we could talk
about at today's rate, what currency, if there is a bottom line hit the currency, what that is heading into next year and the
next quarter? And potentially if you have to have lower Services margins than expected, what that hit would be? I
mean, basically, I know you guys want us to wait for November 11, where I'm getting at is, the Street's at 120 for next
year, and if I pile these hits up, then the EPS starts to look pretty flat, unless the share count is materially lower for
2015. And I know you're going to want to say that at the Analyst day. But I'm wondering what you're trying to message
with 2015 on this call given all those puts and takes I just articulated. So if you could just explain that, Kathy, that
would be great. Thanks.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Sure. Okay. So I'm going to start by saying you just articulated a whole lot of puts and
takes, and so I'll try and cut a little bit to the bottom line. And we're obviously still wrapping things up and are going to
talk in a lot more detail, as you mentioned, at our November investor conference. So first, you're right. With regard to
pension settlements expense, I think we're trying to articulate a couple of things. So we now have visibility to this. We
print the discount rate once a year in the third quarter. We do our actuarial work and then we get visibility to pension
expense. Importantly, this is a highly-volatile thing, our pension settlements expense. It has to do with nuances of our
pension plan, the fact that we offer a lump sum and lots of people take it, et cetera. But it's a non-cash item. I think, if
you look overall at Xerox's cash conversion rate, net income to free cash flow, we have a cash conversion rate above

100%, and we have very, very strong cash flow.
If I look to currency, which is the other large item that you mentioned, which we're getting benefits from this year, if I
look at where rates are at today, with our currency transaction benefits, really flowing from the yen. If I look at where
rates are at today, our currency benefit should hold next year. If anything, I'd say maybe a little bit positive. But,
certainly, as I look at rates right now, they should hold next year. I talked about currency for the fourth quarter from a
translation perspective, and so that's putting some headwinds overall on top line. Those headwinds don't have a real
material impact, in terms of bottom line results for us. So that gives you, I think, a little bit of a feel for some of the puts
and takes, and I'd come back and say, importantly, I think you can continue to see our very strong cash flow results this
year. Our reiteration of guidance on strong cash this year, and as we look forward next year, we'd expect to have
continued very good conversion rate and cash flow.
<Q - Benjamin Reitzes>: All right. Just did I miss it? Did you reiterate the long-term Services ranges, or in terms of
margins, are we going to address that at the Analyst day, in terms of where we'll be in the future on the long-term
Services margins and your ability to be in that range?
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: So we'll address that at Investor Day. But, we haven't changed the expectation long-term
for our Services business.
<Q - Benjamin Reitzes>: Okay. Thanks a lot.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Ben. If we can have the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray.
<Q - George K. F. Tong>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. On Services margins, can you discuss
what positive or negative surprises you saw in the quarter? And what provides confidence Services margins can step up
in the fourth quarter?
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: Okay. It's Bob. From a negative surprises standpoint, obviously, we came in a little bit short
of where we had been, where we committed that we would come in. And I would say from a negative surprise
standpoint, we did make choices to invest more in a couple of the MMIS contracts. And as Kathy referenced, we had a
couple of IT Outsourcing restructurings that we felt that we could stay within the envelope of what the firm had
committed in terms of overall earnings and position ourselves for better profit downstream in IT Outsourcing. On the
positive side, we're really having really strong success in our commercial healthcare business, both in terms of revenue
growth and margin. And as Kathy mentioned, I think in the prepared, some of our other – Europe, in particular, strong
revenue growth and margin improvement. And our HR and learning and litigation business, also performed
exceptionally well. So it was a mix of upsides and downsides.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: If I can, George, one other thing that Bob has done is, we have kind of loosened the rein on
his ability to hire at all levels of the company, kind of little bit independent of matching costs to the – matching cost
decreases to the labor increases. So he is hiring at the high levels, at the intermediate levels and, as he said earlier, in
sales. We need to get the talent in across the board and we're not being cheap on that or we're not skimping on that.
<Q - George K. F. Tong>: That's very helpful. We've seen several quarters now of margin improvement in your
commercial BPO business. Can you go into a little bit more detail on what drove that improvement and what leverage
you have for further expansion?
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: Well, I think the main levers for future expansion are, what we're doing relative to these
global capability organizations that we've formed to really drive best practice of sharing across our delivery model. So
that's been a multi-quarter initiative on our part. We are largely complete, and we see that as a way to capitalize on
productivity initiatives right at the delivery model, which is the vast majority of our resources. I mean, sales is a
relatively small proportion of our head count and the vast majority of our team is in delivery. So I would say, going

forward, that's where we would get the yield. The previous improvement really more related to the labor initiatives
around optimists that you had visibility to from our investor meeting and previous calls.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, George. If we can have the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi. Good morning, team. Bob, two for you, if I could. The first one is, can you win in BPO
with sub-scale ITO? A lot of the vendors, Accenture, and Genpact, and others are really talking about bundling their IT
capabilities with BPO to lead for successful engagements and market share wins. Xerox has a bit of a different strategy
where your ITO is [ph] keenly (36:54) sub-scale. If more of the business does get aggregated, does Xerox have the
platform to be successful? And I understand your BPO is a little bit different than some of the vendors, but I just want
to hear your thoughts on strategy as you look at the parts that Xerox brings to table relative to the competition. And I
have a follow up. Thank you.
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: Yes, I do believe we can win because in our BPO business when ITO is a component of it,
the competitors that we face are not generally stronger in that ITO element. And I would say, Keith, that the decision is
made on the platform and the strength of the BPO offerings. So ITO in an integrated BPO play is really not the
determinative or decisional characteristic. And again, when we're competing in our BPO business, our win rate is very,
very strong, and ITO is an underlying element of that. And as either Ursula or Kathy mentioned previously, we had a
nice big new logo ITO win in the quarter as well, that was not directly tied to a BPO value prop, but was a pure IT
outsourcing play in the marketplace.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay. And thanks for that answer. My follow up is, your trailing 12 months signings are
down about 17%. Can you grow Services next year?
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: Yes, but we're concerned about trailing 12 months signings being done at that level as well.
So part of what's happened though is that, when you're not signing the really big deals, your term on the signings
shortens because it's these $0.5 billion deals that tend to have a long-term, and we have been winning much more with
the shorter term deals. So the correlation of revenue in signings is not quite the way that maybe we would have seen or
modeled in the past. We are focused on driving signings improvement, but even with the trailing 12-month dynamics
that you referenced, we believe we can grow revenue and improve our revenue performance. And as we've said, BPO,
we're now on our third consecutive quarter of improvement in our revenue dynamics, even with the signings results that
you referenced.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Yeah. And the only other thing I'd mention is, on new business, our trailing 12-month is
down about 6%. So...
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Keith. If we can have the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital.
<Q - Ananda P. Baruah>: Hey. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats guys on a pretty solid quarter. Two, if I
could. I guess the first is a follow up on Services for Bob and for Ursula. I guess, in the context of how you expected
the environment to feel, I guess specifically BPO, as we entered the year, does the environment still feel the same?
And there was a comment earlier that you're not changing your long-term view of your Services business model, but
has there been anything that shifted in the context – in the environment of what your – I guess, your mid single-digit,
the 5% to 7% long-term single-digit revenue growth model is predicated upon. Love to get your thoughts there. And
then I have a follow-up.

<A - Ursula M. Burns>: Yes, I'll just start with the environment question. I think that, overall, at the high level, we are
not seeing major shifts in the business environment, from a Services perspective. I mean, clearly, at the big deal, I think
that Bob talked about some of the dynamics that you have with the very large deals, where there is more of a
propensity, at least we've seen it, for people who move to actually protest and to actually hang in there a little bit
longer. That's not what we have seen in the past, but I think that may be what we would be living with in the future. We
are still confident on our ability to pull those deals out. We've been awarded them, but that's one thing.
But the rest of the business, I think, is operating pretty much like we would have expected it to. We are refining our
approach, particularly in ITO. We've spent a couple of questions on this already. ITO can grow, but the margin
contribution of ITO is something that is lower than the range that we want to actually play in. And we are actually
smaller there. So we're being very selective about how we approach ITO. And our change in that market space will
actually change some of the revenue dynamics, and for the positive, we think, some of the margin dynamics on a go
forward basis. And then, I'll have Bob take the rest.
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: The only thing I would add is, I think when I'm out in the marketplace with the teams and
with the clients, there is still a very good, in my view, high level of interest in leveraging partners, in what I would call,
shared services.
So ITO, I think, the dynamics are a little bit different in terms of kind of trailing growth rates based on market
dynamics. BPO, when you look at the areas that we have leadership positions in, I would view those still – I'm pleased
that I wouldn't have a view that the overall client interest is less than I expected when I joined the firm.
<Q - Ananda P. Baruah>: Got it. Thanks for that. And then just quickly for Kathy, the raise on the buyback, you've
had capacity over the last couple of years to do something in the neighborhood of a $1 billion, and you sort of ended
the year with a similar guidance of about $700 million. What is it about sort of raising the guidance to $1 billion right
now on this quarter that gives you – you have the cash flow to do it, so I know that gives you confidence. But I guess
I'm asking, has there been a philosophical shift within your approach to capital allocation that could continue forward
as we move along here? Thanks.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Sure. Yeah, I mean, so no overall philosophy change whatsoever. If you look at where
we're at on acquisitions, we've done a little over $300 million for the year. I expect that will get at least one or two
things over the finish line before the end of the year, but they're small.
And so right now, I think we will end up under-spending against up to $500 million. We're not going to end up
spending $500 million as I look out now. And clearly, I think we have a very good history of, to the extent we
underspend, we shift that under-spending towards share repurchases and that's clearly part of what we've done.
As I mentioned, we entered the year with a quite strong cash balance that put us in a very good position to have a much
more, I'd say, consistent approach to share repurchases this year relative to last year. You'll recall we were very
back-end loaded. But overall, I think, our philosophy is very consistent, and we will continue to have a very balanced
approach with regard to capital allocation.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks, Ananda. If we can have the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Brian L. Essex>: Hi, good morning, and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if I could point a
little bit towards the printing side of the business. And it looks like we've had a few quarters of accelerated decline in
that business. And I'm just kind of taking a look at how it's lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. And given the new product
releases and how you're positioning and restructuring in that business, do you think you could hit an environment
where you have low single-digit declines as opposed to mid single-digit declines? And if so what would it take for that
to happen?

<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: So right now, we're consistently saying, we expect mid single-digits. If you look at what's
going on year-over-year, specifically third quarter and fourth quarter, we have a little bit of headwind because last year
we did these finance receivable sales and that generated a $20 million gain in each of the third quarter and fourth
quarter last year. So that was worth about a point of revenue growth or revenue kind of headwind on growth this year.
We do have, I say, quarter-to-quarter timing differences largely associated with things like product launches with
people kind of waiting for a new product launch, and so we certainly get quarter-to-quarter differences. But at this
point, we see pretty stable declines in the mid single-digit range on an actual currency basis. I mentioned that will be a
little higher in the fourth quarter as a result of the dollar strengthening against the euro. But we're seeing pretty
consistent trends in the business.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: I think that if you look at our share, from a share perspective, you will see us marching along
pretty consistently from a share perspective as well. So I don't think that there is anything you can read into that we
read into market dynamic changes, and our positioning in the market we're strong leader, and I don't think that we are
losing any position in the marketplace.
<Q - Brian L. Essex>: Okay. And maybe one for Bob. It sounds like you had a pretty strong pipeline growth, and I
know the commentary was around, there was some large deal, elongation of signing cycles. Is that pretty much a
concentrated, whether it's in terms of government healthcare business, or is it a larger secular trend, or is there a
situation where you get past a glut of these large deals and maybe those signings accelerate and lead them to better
bookings through the end of the year? Maybe if you can provide a little bit of context of the mix of what's occurring in
those signings.
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: Yes, I would say on the larger deals, it's not concentrated in government healthcare, but it is
public sector. So it's both our government healthcare business and our broader public sector business where we've had
relatively large opportunities that, again, we're pleased with being selected. But getting the contract it's taking longer.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thank you. If we can have the next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna.
<Q - James E. Friedman>: Thanks, Jim. I want to ask first, Bob, with regard to – there's a distinction between
push-outs and protests, right? So if you were to – and protests seems to be the way of the world these days. So my
question is, if you were to add back the two large protests plus the renewal, can you give us an estimate of where
signings would have been in the quarter?
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: Well, each of the three large opportunities that we're referencing is over $500 million in total
contract value, and they would aggregate to close to $2 billion. But I would be careful to match now kind of add that to
third quarter. We were not expecting all of that yield in quarter. But that's the size of the three large transactions that
we've been talking about.
<Q - James E. Friedman>: Okay. Thank you. And then, Kathy, with regard to the discount rate, so for people with a
longer-term investment horizon, now rates move around each year. I realize that they are down in the discount rate that
you're calculating for the third quarter. Could you share with us some sensitivity analysis, say that we're up 100 basis
points next year, where would that leave the pension obligation? Thank you.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Sure. So where we see the most volatility in our pension expense is in the pension
settlements expense line item, and that's where people can really change their behavior, either delay or accelerate the
timing of taking their lump sum. If discount rates were more stable, I'd expect to see something closer to about $100
million of pension settlements expense annually.
<Q - James E. Friedman>: Got it. Thank you.

<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks very much. If we can have the next question, please, operator.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citi.
<Q - Jim Suva>: Thanks very much. And I have one question and I guess it's hard for me to direct if it should go to
Ursula, Kathy, or Bob. But feel free, all of you, to chime in. On one hand, I'm very pleased to hear that Bob has the
ability to hire more talent in investing services because I think that's what's really needed. But then on the other hand
when I see kind of the trailing 12 months signings down, thinking about the ramping of the New York medical contract,
and I'm sure you don't want to have issues when that ramps or stands up.
It simply starts to think about, does it mean that service margins, should they continue to be under pressure, or is it
more – and I'll comment on Bob's view on this, is it more an issue that Xerox has like misaligned costs, or too many
low-end contracts, or contracts that are non-exclusive variables to protect Xerox profits, and therefore you have some
changes and Xerox have to eat the cost because they weren't appropriately contracted out with more detail? If you can
just kind of help us around this big strategy question around strategy for Xerox. And, Bob, you're new, and Ursula and
Kathy have been striving to get Xerox Services up, it's kind of about totally top of the strategy, and what's going on and
what's going forward with the Services.
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: Yeah, Jim, this is Bob. Let me go first and then, obviously, Ursula or Kathy can add color as
well. I would not say that we have severe contract misaligned cost challenges. Any Services business is going to have a
little bit of a bell curve of higher margin deals that are further in the maturity cycle, and entry deals that take a little bit
of time to ramp up.
We had a handful of situations in IT Outsourcing that we tried to address in the third quarter, but I wouldn't have a
point of view that we're out of balance on that score. And if I go back to just your initial observations about adding
talent, I would add one piece of color, which is, we're really pleased, [indiscernible] (52:03) really pleased, that while
we have a very strong team in place today broadly, as we're trying to grow we are trying to add some incremental
leadership to the firm, and the interest level and accept rate, when we have been out trying to add a person to help us in
this new area or that new area, has been phenomenal. So there is – I feel good about both the existing talent that I had
the pleasure of joining, and in the selective places we're looking to add to our leadership a very, very strong interest
level and accept level of the people that we've offered roles to.
<A - Ursula M. Burns>: So my only add is, revenue engine going, cost base perfected by our move to this global
capability. There is no other magic here in the structural contract issues or anything like that. It is a fairly normal
business. It's hard to kind of get it totally contained. We're focusing on the amounts, how much can we bring through
these capacities, capabilities that we have and making sure we sign more business. And that's where Bob's energy and
efforts are focused.
<Q - Jim Suva>: Great. Thanks so much for the clarity.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks Jim. If we could have time for one last question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question for today comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thanks. Most of my questions have been answered. It's just on Services margins. This
year, what are approximately the Medicaid kind of costs are being assumed or you're facing, and how long do those
last? Is that a headwind into next year as well? Thanks.

<A - Ursula M. Burns>: The Medicaid cost – let me have Kathy get a little bit more specific, but they have been a big
headwind for us. A major portion of the shortage that we see in margins is driven by the Medicaid investments. But we
are seeing sequential improvement in those investments, even though they are high.
<A - Kathryn A. Mikells>: Yeah. I mean, the investments have been incredibly large. I'll just point to the impairment
that we took last quarter which was $20 million. I mean, if we look at this year-over-year, it has been a big headwind
for us, every single quarter. I mean, in total, we're probably approaching a $100 million number year-over-year. It's
been a huge investment for us, and it's been a big expense year-over-year. Now, as we look forward to 2015, the fact
that we've invested so much in 2014, should help us in 2015. Which doesn't at all suggest that we're not going to need
to continue some level of higher investment as we have a few more implementations that are still underway, but from a
year-over-year basis, this should start to become a tailwind for us.
<A - Robert K. Zapfel>: And I would just add, so we are driving for significant year-over-year improvement in that
component of a portfolio, but it will not be at our target long-term margins next year. So we will be coming of a,
unfortunately poor compare that we are delivering this year. We expect to drive visible improvement in 2015, but not
already be to our long-term kind of target margins against that portfolio of our business.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thank you.
<A - James H. Lesko>: Thanks Kulbinder. Okay. That's all the time we have for questions today. We thank you for
your interest. And Ursula, anything more to wrap up?
Ursula M. Burns
Our goal is to have the solid foundation in place so that we can support our changing business and the changing needs
of our clients, while still delivering value for our shareholders. I believe that we are on track to do just that.
