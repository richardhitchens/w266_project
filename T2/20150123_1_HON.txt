MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Honeywell's fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. At this
time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions following the
presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.
And I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Mr. Mark Macaluso, Vice President of Investor
Relations.
Mark Macaluso
Thank you, Lisa. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's fourth quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With me
here today are Chairman and CEO, Dave Cote; and Senior Vice President and CFO, Tom Szlosek.
This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at
www.honeywell.com/investor. Note that elements of this presentation contain forward-looking statements that are
based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change, and we
ask that you interpret them in that light. We identify the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in
our Form 10-K and other SEC filings.
This morning, we'll review our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2014, and share with you, our
guidance for the first quarter and full year of 2015. Finally, as always, we'll leave time for your questions at the end.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Dave Cote.
David M. Cote
Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone.

We delivered another excellent quarter, capping off a terrific 2014. In this fourth quarter, we delivered better than
expected operational performance in each of our key metrics, that's sales, margin, earnings and cash, meeting or
exceeding our guidance across the board. We delivered 4% organic sales growth following a 5% growth in the third
quarter, and we to continue to drive margin expansion, up 130 basis points excluding the impact of the fourth quarter
2014 Aerospace OEM incentives, which we discussed in detail last month.
We delivered earnings per share of $1.43, up 15% year over year or up 11% normalized for tax. So another quarter of
double-digit earnings growth and $0.01 above the high end of our guidance range with strong execution across the
portfolio.
For the full year, we increased sales on an organic basis 3% while continuing our seed planting with investments in
new products and technologies, high ROI CapEx, and expansion of our global footprint. We achieved significant
margin expansion with benefits from our key process and productivity initiatives, and we've been able to achieve all of
this in what continues to be a slow growth macro environment. The momentum we saw in the second half gives us
confidence in this year.
Our short-cycle businesses continue to improve with good organic growth in the Commercial Aftermarket business,
ESS, Advanced Materials and Transportation Systems, all suggesting a modest improvement in end-market conditions
overall. We're also seeing good momentum out of our long-cycle businesses building on our robust backlog. We
believe the portfolio is well positioned to deliver this year and beyond, enhanced by the smart gain deployment actions
we've taken over the past years.
While I believe the global economy could be a bit better this year than economists are forecasting currently, we will, as
always, plan conservatively in our outlook and remain flexible. As you'll hear in a moment, we continue to plan for a
slow to no-growth environment in Europe. We've hedged over 80% of our P&L exposure related to Europe, and we
remain focused on controlling our spend. As Tom previewed in December, we sold the final 1.9 million shares of B/E
Aerospace stock this quarter. To remind you, we originally received 6 million shares as part of the consideration for the
sale of our Aero Consumable Solutions business in 2008. At that time, those shares were worth about $150 million. We
sold those shares over the course of the last five quarters for a total of about $500 million. We've deployed the resulting
gains for restructuring and other actions to proactively position the company for future growth and profitability.
The actions in the fourth quarter will significantly benefit Aerospace over our five-year plan, and we believe we're well
positioned for future success with our Commercial OE customers as a result. Now, there continue to be a lot of exciting
things happening across the portfolio that drive those results, and to highlight a few, Honeywell Scanning & Mobility
delivered another quarter of double-digit organic sales growth, benefiting from new customer wins. Following the
success we've had with Intermec, HSM announced in December, the acquisition of Datamax-O'Neil, a global
manufacturer of fixed and mobile printers used in a variety of retail, warehouse and distribution, and healthcare
applications. This acquisition positioned HSM to expand in the $1.5 billion global barcode printing segment and builds
on their existing printing capabilities acquired with Intermec. The team is really excited about this acquisition, which
extends our global reach and provides scale and significant synergy opportunities.
Transactions expected to close this quarter. While our deal activity in this past year was modest, the M&A pipeline
remains robust. And we intend to maintain our disciplined process and extend our strong track record. We've also
talked a lot about our Solstice line of refrigerants, insulation materials, aerosols and solvents that have ozone depletion
of zero and a global warming potential lower than CO2. And that's a thousand times better than what it replaces. Earlier
this month, we announced that our Fluorine Products business has started full-scale commercial production in our
Baton Rouge, Louisiana facility of the newest Solstice product, HFO-1234ze. Now, that is one impressive, catchy
name, so I think we're going to probably stick with Solstice. We're seeing increasing demand for our entire Solstice
suite of low GWP materials. The lifetime value of signed agreements in 2014 exceeds $2.3 billion, and we have an
additional $1 billion plus under negotiation.
Process Solutions has also been a bright spot as we closed out the year. Organic sales growth accelerated in the second
half of the year, and orders were up double digit in the fourth quarter, supporting continued growth this year. HPS is

transforming project execution with LEAP, that is Lean Execution of Automation Projects, and is innovating to win in
the market with automation offerings across control and safety systems, field devices, plant optimization software and
services. We're also excited about the growth synergies from the work HPS and UOP are doing together. Our ability to
match UOP process and operating knowledge with HPS control and advanced software solutions will enable
unmatched operating excellence for our refining, petrochemical and gas processing customers.
You can expect to see more of our innovation on display at the March Investor Day, where each of the businesses will
highlight a number of HUE-influenced new products and roadmaps for our future growth and productivity. We also
plan to share with you how HOS Gold is evolving throughout the organization, which we believe is a key differentiator.
We held our annual senior leadership meeting earlier this month, and I can tell you that each of the businesses are hard
at work finding new and innovative breakthrough objectives to drive growth and margin expansion.
Having successfully performed against the five-year targets we set for 2010 to 2014, we're now focused on delivering
2015 and the five-year targets we issued last March for 2014 to 2018. 2014 was a strong start. Our business model
works. Having a strong portfolio with great positions and good industries; making sure the machinery works better
every day for our customers, suppliers, employees; and a culture that focuses on One Honeywell and evolving our
capability and technologies. From our culture, we get sustainability results.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.
Thomas A. Szlosek
Thanks, Dave, and good morning.
Let's begin on slide four, which recaps our fourth quarter results compared with the guidance we gave you last month at
the December outlook call. On the left-hand side, we've outlined the guidance we shared with you in December, and on
the right, you can see our results for the quarter as reported. I'm not going to walk through each line item here, but you
can see based on the checkmarks that we delivered or exceeded our guidance on each line item, including the top and
bottom lines. The incremental sales and segment profit enabled us to beat the higher end of our EPS guidance range
and also to fund incremental restructuring and other actions in the quarter.
There are a couple of transactions that occurred in the fourth quarter that are worth reminding you of, and again, they
unfolded exactly as we forecasted in December. First, we completed the sale of our remaining BEAV shares, as Dave
said, resulting in a $114 million gain, $0.14 per share on an after-tax basis.
The timing of the sale was important from a tax perspective, as we noted in December. The timing allowed us to offset
that gain with other items, and therefore incur very little income tax on the transaction. Also in the quarter, our
Aerospace business recognized the cost of certain commercial OEM incentives that became due when our customer
achieved contractual development milestones on platforms which will include Honeywell avionics and our mechanical
content. The cost was $184 million or $114 million on an after-tax basis. That's $0.14 per share.
As you know, we've won significant content in the Air Transport and Business Aviation sectors, and such upfront
incentives are part of the business model. And as you're also aware, accounting for these incentives is quite
conservative. Many others in the industry defer these types of costs on their balance sheet and expense them over the
life of the platform. We believe charging the incentive up front gives greater transparency to our OEM profitability in
the segment. Also, the OEM incentives position us well on the platforms already won, but also to win new business on
the content to be selected in the future.
I'm now on slide five, which shows the fourth quarter results without the Aero OEM incentives or the BEAV gain.
Sales of $10.5 billion increased 1% or 4% on an organic basis. The absence of Friction Materials and the strengthening
of the U.S. dollar were headwinds to reported sales growth in the quarter. You'll recall we divested Friction Materials
in the third quarter, so there will continue to be unfavorable sales headwinds throughout the first half of 2015.

We are encouraged with the growth momentum that is beginning to emerge. We achieved 4% organic sales growth in
the second half of 2014 compared with 2% for the first half and 2% for all of 2013. The growth we saw in the fourth
quarter was broad-based and resulted in better than expected performance across the portfolio. I'll provide more color
as we review the business groups in a moment.
You can see that segment profit increased 9%, with segment margin expanding 130 basis points. Our efforts to drive
commercial excellence supported by a differentiated technology continued to produce results. In addition, productivity
remains a key driver of margin expansion, offsetting inflation and our continued investments for growth.
EPS was $1.43, up 15%, consistent with our historical practice. This excludes the annual mark-to-market adjustment
for our defined benefit pension plan. In the fourth quarter, this mark-to-market adjustment was approximately $249
million or $0.23 per share, principally driven by lower discount rates in our German and Dutch plans. So the fourth
quarter reported EPS was $1.20. And for reference purposes, the mark-to-market adjustment in 2013 was $51 million
or about $0.05 a share.
Finally, free cash flow in the quarter of $1.3 billion, representing conversion of 119%, and an increase of 6% from
2013.
So overall, we generated very strong results in a relatively slow growth environment, and we increased our annual
dividend in the fourth quarter by 15% to $2.07 a share, continuing our commitment to growing the dividend faster than
the earnings rate growth, and a trend you can expect will continue.
On slide six, same fourth quarter results we're presenting on a reported basis. So as you can see, our reported sales
decreased 1%, and that was driven by the Aero OEM incentives; no change to the 4% organic sales growth in the
quarter that I showed on the previous page. So on a reported basis, segment profit decreased 2%, with margins
contracting 20 basis points to 15.9% in the quarter. Again, the only difference from the previous slide on segment
margins is the inclusion of the $184 million charge for the Aero OEM incentives.
Moving to net income, the BEAV gain and the OEM incentives fully offset one another on a net-of-tax basis. And
normalized for tax, EPS in the quarter increased 11% year over year. The rest of the figures on this slide are identical to
the prior fourth quarter slide.
I'm now on slide seven to recap the full-year 2014 results, again, without the impact of the Aero OEM incentives or the
BEAV gain. Full-year sales of $40.5 billion, up 4% or 3% on an organic basis. The primary difference between the
reported and organic rates is the Intermec acquisition net of the impact of the Friction Materials divestiture. We saw
good organic growth across the portfolio, including in Scanning & Mobility, the Fire and Industrial Safety businesses,
Transportation Systems, and UOP. Segment profit increased 8%, demonstrating strong sales conversion, and resulted in
a 70 basis point improvement in the segment margin rate to 17%.
All this resulted in earnings per share, excluding pension mark-to-market adjustment of $5.56 per share, up 12% over
2013, representing our fifth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth, and EPS $0.01 above the high end of our
December guidance range. Our reported EPS of $5.33 for the year again reflects the $0.23 mark-to-market adjustment
that I mentioned for the fourth quarter.
So finally, free cash flow was $3.9 billion, in line with our guidance. Free cash flow increased 16% year over year
despite an approximate 16% increase in CapEx investments in the growth areas we've previously shared with you,
mostly in PMT.
So let's move to slide eight to show the full-year 2014 results, including the impacts of the Aero OEM incentives and
the BEAV gain. To quickly recap, 2014 sales were up 3% on both a reported and organic basis to $40.3 billion.
Segment profit was up 5%, resulting in a 30 basis point margin expansion to 16.6%. So the Aero OEM incentives
reduced the reported growth from 4% to 3%, and reduces margin expansion from 70 basis points to 30 basis points. The
rest of the page again remains the same as the previous slide.
And now I want to move on to slide nine and discuss the businesses starting with Aerospace. This first slide highlights
the fourth quarter reported and organic sales growth rates for Aerospace. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of 2013,

Aerospace recognized an IP litigation settlement, resulting in a one-time royalty gain of $63 million in Defense &
Space that was offset at the time by OEM incentives in BGA. Both of these items were included in and therefore netted
out in sales and segment profit at the Aerospace level in 2013.
Total reported Aerospace sales were down 6% in the fourth quarter of 2014, driven by three items: the $184 million
OEM incentives that we discussed in our outlook call back in December; two, the Friction Materials divestiture, which
closed in the third quarter; and three, the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange on reported results. However, on an
organic basis, fourth quarter sales in Aero were up 4%, driven by strong execution across the portfolio, as each of the
three legacy Aero businesses accelerated growth in the fourth quarter compared with the first three quarters, and
Transportation Systems continued its mid-single-digits growth performance.
Organic sales growth in Aero has accelerated throughout 2014 like Honeywell. So if you recall, Aero was up 1% in
both the first and second quarters, 3% in the third quarter, now 4% to close out the year in the fourth quarter.
If I look at the individual pieces of Aerospace, starting with Commercial OE, sales decreased 14% on a reported basis,
driven by the net unfavorable impact of the OEM incentives. However, on an organic basis, sales grew 7%. And that
was principally the result of robust engine shipments and business in general aviation for the Bombardier Challenger
350 and Embraer Legacy 500.
Moving to Commercial Aftermarket, as you can see, 4% sales growth on both the reported and organic basis. The ATR
spares growth was balanced across both mechanical and electrical product lines, offsetting moderation in BGA RMUs,
that's Retrofit, Modifications, and Upgrade. Both airline and business jet repair and overhaul activity improved in the
quarter as well.
Defense & Space sales declined 3% on a reported basis, driven by the absence of the prior-year licensing royalty gain I
just mentioned. However, on an organic basis, sales were up 2% in the quarter. International programs continue to drive
growth with double-digit sales increases offsetting modest declines in our U.S. DoD and government service businesses
in the third quarter – or sorry in the fourth quarter. Finally, Transportation System sales declined 16% on a reported
basis, reflecting the third quarter Friction Materials divestiture and foreign exchange headwinds. On an organic basis,
TS sales increased 4% in the quarter as we once again saw strong volume growth in light vehicle gas applications
where we continue to see increased global penetration.
We also continue to see our European commercial vehicle volumes grow as we benefit from new programs following
the implementation of Euro VI emission regulations in the region. As you can see, the underlying business growth
trends across the Aero portfolio remain positive, consistent with the outlook we provided to you in December.
So now on slide 10, continuing with Aerospace, the fourth quarter sales results and commentary are consistent with
what I just discussed. So for the full year, Aerospace sales declined 1% on a reported basis, driven by the Friction
Materials divestiture and the impact of the OEM incentives. However, on an organic basis, sales increased 2%.
Aerospace margins contracted by 160 basis points in the quarter, driven by the OEM incentives. But excluding the
$184 million charge for the OEM incentives, segment margins in the fourth quarter were actually up 210 basis points,
driven by productivity, net of inflation, where material productivity continues to be a significant driver, also
commercial excellence and favorable impact of the Friction Materials divestiture. And for the full year, you can see that
Aero segment margins expanded 140 basis points, again, excluding the OEM incentives.
So let's turn to ACS results on slide 11. ACS sales were up 6% on an organic basis in the quarter, excluding an
approximate 3% headwind from FX. The growth came in above our guidance with both ESS and BSD finishing the
year strong. ESS sales for the products businesses were up 7% on an organic basis in the quarter, continuing the trend
of progressively stronger growth noted in each quarter of 2014. Scanning & Mobility continues to perform well, driven
by new product introductions and large program wins such as the U.S. Postal Service program we highlighted last
quarter.
In addition, we continue to realize integration benefits from Intermec, supporting the strong growth we've seen from the
combination of the two businesses. The pending acquisition that Dave mentioned of Datamax-O'Neil complements our
existing portfolio in the attractive barcode printing space acquired with Intermec. As for the rest of ESS, growth was

driven by new product introductions, further penetration in high growth regions, higher residential sales, which
benefited both EPC and security, and improvements in the non-resi market, which benefited our Fire and Industrial
Safety businesses. Building Solutions and Distribution sales were up 4% on an organic basis in the fourth quarter with
continued strength in the Americas Fire and Security Distribution businesses and acceleration in Building Solutions.
Particularly within Building Solutions, we saw a good growth in the Americas, as well as an increase in higher-margin
service business. Both the Building Solutions backlog and service banks were up mid- to high-single digits on an
organic basis, supporting our outlook and confidence for sales acceleration in 2015.
ACS margins expanded 70 basis points to 15.9% in the quarter. The businesses – the business continues to benefit from
good conversion on higher volumes and productivity, net of inflation, supported by our HOS initiatives, offset by
continued investments for growth. In addition, we continue to realize incremental synergy benefits from the
combination of Intermec with HSM. So overall, a very good growth and execution at ACS, and a lot more to come as
the team continues to coordinate the individual businesses more and more through Connected ACS, which is an
initiative to drive an enhanced degree of integration across the businesses, and in particular, in the supply chain, in
product development and in the marketing areas. Alex will talk more about this at our Investor Day in March.
So moving to slide 12 for Performance Materials and Technologies, PMT sales in the quarter were up – were $2.6
billion, up 3% on an organic basis, or approximately flat on a reported basis, driven by foreign exchange headwinds.
We'll address the impact of lower oil prices on the PMT businesses in a moment, but there was very little impact on the
PMT results in the quarter.
For the fourth quarter, UOP sales decreased 1% on an organic basis, and as a reminder, UOP had exceptional organic
growth in the fourth quarter of 2013. You'll recall they were up 17% last year, driven primarily by increased catalyst
sales. So a very difficult comparison year-on-year.
UOP executed very well, reflecting strong licensing revenue, which partially offset the lower catalyst sales. We also
continue to see strong order trends in gas processing, particularly at UOP Russell, giving us confidence as we head into
2015. And we anticipate further sales growth in 2016 and 2017 for the new capacity additions across UOP and also to
Advanced Materials, which come online in 2015.
In Process Solutions, organic sales growth continues to accelerate. HPS was up 6% in the quarter, while on a reported
basis, sales were flat as the organic – or the strong organic international growth was offset by foreign exchange
headwinds. HPS saw strong volume growth, driven by the Advanced Solutions software business and the HPS Service
business in all regions. Orders, backlog and service bank growth also continued at a strong pace, up double digits on an
organic basis in the quarter. And this orders growth increased steadily throughout 2014, which sets Process Solutions
up nicely for accelerated sales growth in 2015 and beyond.
Advanced Materials sales increased 4% on an organic basis, driven by double-digit sales and orders growth in Fluorine
Products as demand for our new low global warming potential suite of Solstice products continues to grow. This was
partially offset by a decline in resin and chemical sales in the low single-digit range, driven principally by the market
base pricing model whereby selling prices are closely tied to the market price of raw materials, most notably benzene,
which is highly correlated to the price of oil. While sales can be volatile, the pricing model largely protects the profit
dollars in resin and chemicals, even on lower sales. PMT segment margins were up 90 basis points to 16.5%, which
exceeded our guidance, driven by higher volume and productivity, net of inflation, partly offset by continued
investments for growth.
In UOP, the higher mix of licensing revenue in the quarter resulted in a tailwind to margin. HPS also converted
particularly well, continuing its successful business transformation and benefiting from the growth I mentioned in the
higher-margin Advanced Solutions software and service businesses.
I'm now on slide 13, labeled 2015 Planning Update. And similar to what we did in December related to the impact of
oil price declines on the portfolio, I wanted to address some of the major global trends affecting our portfolio and
explain how each of these items are impacting our plans for 2015. I'm going to start with oil price declines. Overall, we
continue to view the impact from lower oil prices as being net neutral to UOP and HPS. The upstream exploration and

production parts of the value chain continue to represent a relatively small portion of our portfolio, roughly 10% to
15% of the combined UOP and HPS businesses. And our upstream backlog has held firm. We are beginning to see
some delays further downstream in countries that are net oil producers, such as Russia and the Middle East, as refining
and petrochemical product decisions are deferred.
On the other hand, in countries that are big importers of oil, most notably China, India and the Southeast Asia region,
as we had anticipated, the lower oil price has stimulated more discretionary mid- and downstream spending, where we
are well-positioned. This is being borne out, for example, in Process Solutions where orders and backlog grew roughly
double digits on an organic basis in the quarter, as I highlighted earlier. So again, we think oil prices are neutral to the
UOP and HPS businesses at this time. However, we continue to monitor this activity closely as we look ahead.
Sales in resins and chemicals will be negatively impacted by lower oil prices for the reasons I mentioned earlier. But
while sales can be volatile, the pricing model, again, largely protects our profit dollars in this business, even on the
lower sales.
Finally, we anticipate we'll begin to see the favorable effects of lower oil prices on our cost structure, in particular in
our indirect spend, and we believe this will accelerate throughout 2015. Of course, it remains to be seen how oil prices
will impact the global economy should prices stay below $50 longer term. However, we continue this will be a net
positive for the economy and Honeywell over the planning horizon.
Turning to currency fluctuations, we've obviously seen a continued weakening of the euro. As we highlighted in
December, our 2015 plan is based on a euro exchange rate of $1.20 at the midpoint. We have hedges in place covering
approximately 80% of our euro P&L exposure. So whether we'll continue to be pressured on the sales line, our
euro-based earnings are protected. We also continue to see volatility across our other currency exposures, which, again,
are likely to result in headwinds to the top line. However, similar to the hedging we've done for the euro, the actions
we've taken largely protect our 2015 earnings outlook for these other currencies as well. And we'll continue to actively
monitor the situation.
The outlook for the U.S. economy continues to improve and we're expecting a positive uptick in our U.S. businesses as
a result. But we also remain focused on increasing our presence in high-growth regions. As a reminder, HGRs now
represent almost a quarter of our total business and are expected to drive 50% of the sales growth over the course of our
five-year plan. The population growth, urbanization and infrastructure development continue to create attractive
opportunities across our entire portfolio.
In China, we anticipate high single-digit growth in 2015, after a year of roughly mid-single digit growth in 2014. Our
initiative on becoming the Chinese competitor continues to accelerate and bear fruit. Investments in local sales and
marketing resources are targeted to the higher growth cities in China, where local economies are growing much faster
than the overall China GEP. Also, our One Honeywell approach, specifically in ACS, continues to drive cross-selling
opportunities across multiple channels. In addition, we're building a robust pipeline of new products geared toward the
macro trends in the region, namely air purification, energy efficiency and security. All these factors give us confidence
in accelerated growth for Honeywell in China in 2015.
In India, after the investments across the region slowed in the first half of the year while the elections unfolded, the
second half of 2014 was very strong for Honeywell. And we anticipate growth will be roughly high single digits in
2015, driven by our international Defense & Space business, new launches in Transportation Systems, new product
introductions in ESS across each of our major verticals, and growth in BSD from infrastructure projects and services.
In Russia where our exposure is limited, we have less than about $500 million in annual sales there, we continue to
have a strong backlog in our long cycle businesses. We expect Russia to continue focusing their available capital on
energy, so oil and gas, and renewal of their aerospace sector, two areas where our portfolio is well positioned to grow.
Our short cycle businesses in Russia have been impacted, particularly as it relates to currency devaluation, but again,
the exposure there is relatively small. While our management team is playing close attention to the issues facing the
country, we're also continuing to look for opportunities to enhance our business in the region.

In the Middle East, we expect continued double digit sales growth in 2015 after approximately 20% growth in 2014.
And this is driven by big wins in both the short and long cycle businesses as infrastructure investments continue. Our
portfolio is well positioned to benefit from, and even outpace in some cases, the attractive growth rates in these
markets.
Turning to the non-residential sector, we're encouraged by the expected acceleration of commercial construction
spending, forecast to be up approximately 4.5% in 2015, and the continued solid growth on the industrial side in 2015.
So as a reminder, roughly 75% of the ACS portfolio serves the commercial industrial markets, and our balanced
portfolio is well-positioned to capitalize on improvements in these areas. More specifically, on the commercial product
side, after modest growth to the first three quarters of 2014, we saw some acceleration in the fourth quarter with strong
growth in the U.S. We expect the U.S. to continue to drive further commercial products growth in 2015, as well as
acceleration in our high-growth regions, with strength in our ECC and fire systems businesses in particular.
In the industrial products markets, we expect higher sales of industrial safety equipment, particularly in the Americas,
which represents about half of our exposure. As for Building Solutions, the backlog from our projects businesses and
the service bank grew mid and high single digit respectively on an organic basis this quarter. And we continue to
expect energy efficiency projects to support global acceleration in 2015.
With regard to our pension plan, the net effects of higher investment returns and lower discount rates will drive a $125
million increase to pension income for 2015. Now we intend to fully offset that increase with restructuring over the
course of the year. In total, our international pension plans represent approximately 25% of our worldwide defined
benefit pension obligations. In the U.S., we ended the year with a discount rate of 4.08% and a return on assets of 8%,
which resulted in a U.S. funded status of approximately 95%. Globally, the funded status is about 94%. We do not
anticipate any 2015 cash contributions related to our U.S. plan.
Let me turn to slide 14 to summarize our outlook for 2015. Our full-year guidance is identical with what we shared
with you in December. We continue to expect sales in the range of $40.5 billion to $41.1 billion, up 1% to 2% on a
reported basis and up approximately 4% on an organic basis. The reported sales growth is expected to be lower than
organic, primarily due to the impact of the Friction Materials divestiture and the foreign exchange headwinds. We're
planning segment margin expansion of 100 basis points to 130 basis points, or up 60 to 90 basis points, excluding the
fourth quarter OEM incentives. We're projecting EPS, and this excludes the pension mark-to-market adjustment, of
$5.95 to $6.15, representing 7% to 11% growth versus 2014. The quarterly growth trends remain in line with our
prior-year results. And this range also continues to be based on a full-year income tax rate assumption of 26.5% and
share count held roughly flat to 2014 levels.
Free cash flow is expected to be in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion, up 8% to 10% from 2014, with CapEx
investments peaking at roughly two times depreciation. At a more normalized rate of CapEx investment, so around 1.25
times depreciation, we expect free cash flow conversion to be roughly 100%.
So I'm now on slide 15 with a preview of the first quarter. For total Honeywell, we're expecting sales of $9.4 billion to
$9.6 billion. That's down 1% to 2% reported but up 3% to 4% on an organic basis. Segment margins are expected to be
up approximately 110 basis points. And EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.36 to $1.41, up 6% to 10% versus
2014.
Starting with Aerospace, sales are expected to be up 3% to 4% on an organic basis or down 2% to 4% on a reported
basis, reflecting the year-over-year absence of Friction Materials as well as foreign exchange headwinds. We're
expecting positive organic sales growth from each of the four businesses in the quarter. In Commercial OE, we're
expecting sales up low to mid-single digits, driven primarily by new platform wins in BGA. The growth is driven by
favorable demand trends for high-value business jet platforms where we have significant new engine content.
In Commercial Aftermarket, we're expecting sales to be up low single digit, with continued repair and overhaul growth
as well as ATR spares growth in the quarter, driven by higher demand for both mechanical and electrical products,
partially offset by a decline in BGA RMUs against a challenging prior-year comparison.

Defense & Space sales are expected to be up low to mid-single digit in the quarter, driven by continued strength in
international businesses. In Transportation Systems, sales are expected be up mid-single digit on an organic basis but
down significantly on a reported basis, driven by the absence of Friction and the foreign exchange headwinds I
mentioned. On an organic basis, the growth in TS is primarily driven by new launches and strong light vehicle gas
demand in each of our three key regions, the U.S., Europe, and China.
As for Aerospace margins, we expect an increase of 100 to 120 basis points, driven by commercial excellence,
significant productivity improvements across the portfolio, along with a favorable impact on the margin rate from the
Friction Materials divestiture.
Turning to ACS, sales are expected to be up 4% to 5% organically, or flat to up 2% on a reported basis, with continued
mid-single-digit organic growth in both ESS and BSD. The difference between reported and organic rates reflects the
foreign exchange headwinds in the quarter.
The end markets where we primarily participate, residential, commercial, and industrial, are all looking moderately
better as we start 2015, and we continue to benefit from new product introductions and high-growth region penetration.
Also, the strong orders growth we saw at the end of 2014 in both the short and long-cycle businesses gives us
increasing confidence in our outlook for 2015.
ACS margins are expected to be up 100 to 120 basis points, with continued benefits from commercial excellence and
productivity net of inflation, while accelerating investments for growth in new product areas such as Connected Home
and in high-growth regions. Further, we expect to realize synergies from the integration of Datamax-O'Neil acquisition
after the transaction closes, as we did with Intermec throughout 2014.
In PMT, sales are expected to be approximately flat on an organic basis and down approximately 1% to 3% reported,
driven by foreign exchange headwinds and the impact of lower oil prices on resins and chemicals, a point I made
earlier. Excluding these factors, PMT sales are expected to be up approximately 4% in the quarter.
We're expecting UOP to be up low single digit, with gas processing sales expected to drive the majority of the growth.
In HPS, we're expecting organic sales up mid-single digit. The favorable orders and backlog growth we saw in 2014
will support the sales acceleration in 2015.
On the Advanced Materials side, we're expecting a low to mid-single-digit organic sales decline, principally driven by a
double-digit decline in resins and chemicals due to the factors I mentioned earlier. These declines are offset by
continued strength in our Fluorine Products business, which is benefiting from increased demand relating to the new
products, principally the Solstice product suite.
Also, PMT segment margins in the quarter are expected to be up 100 to 120 basis points versus 2014, driven by higher
volumes and productivity, as well as the favorable margin rate impact of the market-based pricing model in resins and
chemicals.
Let me move to slide 16 for a quick wrap-up. In 2014, we demonstrated once again that Honeywell can deliver on its
commitments in a relatively slow growth economy and amid some very volatile global trends, a reminder once again of
the value of our diversified and balanced portfolio, a management team focused on execution, and the strength of the
Honeywell playbook and T&A list. Combined, these enable us to add to our performance track record as we exceeded
guidance on sales, achieved significant growth in segment margins, and delivered double-digit EPS growth we
originally laid out last December.
We're going to continue investing in our future with a focus on profitable sales growth. This will continue to mean
investments in high ROI CapEx, in new product development, and in sales and marketing resources, particularly in
high-growth regions. The investments are paying off, and you can see it in our results.
As we turn our attention to 2015, we recognize the uncertainty in the macro environment. But this is not new for us.
We have and will continue to plan conservatively, and we're confident that our portfolio is well positioned for
continued outperformance.

Our order trends, both short and long cycle, point to accelerated sales growth for next year that should enable continued
strong improvement in our profitability. We're forecasting strong organic growth in 2015 and over 100 basis point
improvement in our margins as our HOS Gold initiatives are deployed across the portfolio. In addition, we have
significant restructuring savings in the bank for 2015. So we'll continue to execute in 2015 and beyond. We're very
excited about the upcoming year and have a lot of momentum across the portfolio as we head into year two of our
five-year plan. We look forward to tell you more on our March 4 Investor Day.
So with that, Mark, let's go to Q&A.

Q&A
Operator
Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Steve Winoker with Bernstein.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Hey. Good morning, all.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: After last quarter's multitude of congratulations, I'm hesitant to say it again, Dave, but I
will say nice quarter, and I guess I'll get blamed by all my colleagues out there for doing this.
<A - David M. Cote>: It's a shame to be nice. You wouldn't want to do something like that.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: You know what, I'm trying to be very cautious on that front. It's one of my development
needs. So anyway, listen, on last – on the outlook call, we spent a lot of time – you guys provided a great amount of
detail for thinking through the declining oil price impact across all your businesses. And I'm trying to compare that to
what Tom just walked us through. But the thing that really is of maybe concern to me is the midstream, downstream
commentary where in December, you really talked about how – that it was a net positive in terms of refined product
demand, investment downstream and other areas. What – I'd just like to get a little more color on that, particularly
around the impact of maybe narrowing oil and gas spreads on some of those investments that are happening out there,
just some more color on why we shouldn't be worried about this for you guys and why it's actually a good thing.
<A - David M. Cote>: I'll start with my perspective on it then turn it over to Tom for even more color commentary.
But there's a difference between the upstream and the mid-and downstream segments, as you know. And the mid- and
downstream, in my view, are going to be driven more by overall economic activity. The demand for that is going to be
driven more by overall economic activity than whatever oil prices are. As a result of that, I'm expecting to see increased
demand for refined goods and products, which is going to cause greater demand on the mid- and downstream side.
Offsetting that, at least in the short-term, is probably going to be some of the investments in places like Russia or in the
Middle East, perhaps some in Brazil but they'd already slowed significantly, that will be more than offset by what
everybody has to crank up everywhere else around the world. So that's kind of the overview that I see for it, and as you
probably know, I'm – for the first time in five years, I'm actually a little more bullish on where the global economy is
going than economic forecasters are. For the last four years, I've been more negatively, generally, and so far, that's been
a good call. But this time, I think it could be more positive than what they think because that impact to lower oil prices
is causing this major redistribution from oil-producing to oil-using economies, and those oil-using economies are quite
large. So overall, I think this is a good phenomenon, it's going to help drive more of that mid- and downstream
investment. Tom?

<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Again, what I would reiterate is the portion of our HPS and UOP business that's in the midand
downstream, number one. Number two, the backlogs, really backed up by the strong second half, particularly in
HPS, are really strong. If you look at HPS, the backlog on a constant currency basis is up 12% year-over-year, and the
UOP backlog is also up – or sorry, the UOP backlog is relatively flat, 0% to 1%. But when I look at UOP, it continues
to be a – always a lumpy business. Fourth quarter was a difficult comparison, as I said. We had 17% growth in the
fourth quarter 2013. But the backlog is as strong as it's ever been. It's holding up, and our growth rate in 2015, our
forecast for UOP is – that mid single-digit growth. So we're confident with all the indicators.
<A - David M. Cote>: And UOP is lumpy, but with a very positive trend line.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yes.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: And, Tom, you're not seeing any backlog price renegotiations? There's a lot of chatter
about that in the market.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: No, not at all. I mean, we probed and probed and probed this, as you might imagine. And
the only development I would say is deferrals on new orders where they're multibillion dollar investments where
decisions are being thought through carefully in the regions that Dave mentioned. But by and large, that's about the
only impact we've seen so far.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay, I'll hand it off. Thanks.
Operator
Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Scott.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: I'm glad to see you guys are bullish. We haven't had a lot of positive conversations in the last
couple of months. But maybe you can – I think your view on oil is pretty clear, Dave, but give us a sense of your view
on currency. And really, the angle I'm looking for is we've had such a violent move that – how does it change the
competitive landscape? Do you see guys who can come in from Japan or other high-cost regions like in Europe that can
now suddenly compete against you in areas where they couldn't compete against you before? Is that real or not real?
<A - David M. Cote>: As you know, the Japan phenomenon has been – the currency phenomenon has been a couple
years in the making, and I can't say that we ever saw much of an impact from any of that. I guess it remains to be seen
on what happens with the European competitors, but again, not seeing much of anything happening there. When it
comes to the overall currency, the – we've assumed the U.S. dollar would strengthen for a while now, and we're a little
surprised actually that it didn't happen sooner than it has. So I would say it's one of those things we've been kind of
counting on happening, and as you know, this is the first time in – well, this is my – going into my 14th year. This is
the first time we've ever had the euro translation, and it's solely because it seems like that was a 70% bet at this point.
Who knows, things have a way of changing in ways that you never predict. But I still think that the prospect of a $1.10
euro this year is entirely possible.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: The other thing I'd add, Dave, is the – our cost base.
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: We do benefit in some cases from the decline in currencies. Scott, as you're fully aware, we
have significant production capacity in China and Mexico and other parts of Eastern Europe. So we do feel like our
position from a supply chain perspective and cost base perspective does enable us to continue to compete with the likes
of the competitors you referred to.
<A - David M. Cote>: I think that's a good point Tom just made, Scott.

<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Okay.
<A - David M. Cote>: We have great presence in Europe already. We have a big base there, about 30,000 employees.
So we have a base to compete from.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Okay, fair enough. And then, guys, give us – I was encouraged by what you said about
non-res. Our forecast is actually a little bit higher than your forecast, so I hope we're right and you're not, right? But
either way, directionally, it's the right answer. But can you walk around the world a bit on that? What's really tough for
us to get a feel for is we've got great data in the U.S. on non-res or things that we can track. And then once we get
outside of the U.S., it starts to get a little bit more difficult. So can you walk us around the world and more in context in
maybe your order book or backlog or how you see it playing out in different regions?
<A - David M. Cote>: Sure, it would be pretty consistent with how we're seeing the economy. The U.S., we'd say, I
hope you're right also, we're a little lower in our estimation, but we think that continues to rise upward and is still kind
of a reflection of the great recession. And you heard us say at the time about V-shape in, V-shape out, slow in, slow
out, and non-res construction is more of a slow in, slow out. So we think it's a nice steady gain and that just continues.
You could argue there's some offset to that with the oil and gas CapEx, but that has really minimal effect on our
non-res construction business.
In Europe, consistent with the economy, it's going to be very slow. China, probably going to continue to be a mix. And
interesting phenomenon there because the Tier 1 cities that are experiencing more of the economic slowdown, they still
could use more housing. And in some of the Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4 cities where GDP is going to be growing faster, may
have been overbuilt a little bit. So that one's still to be figured out, but overall, we think it's still a net positive on
non-res construction. India, there could be an awakening in India, and I've never seen such excitement in the business
community in the 20-plus years that I've been going there. So I'm actually pretty encouraged about what they could be
doing, and in fact, I'm going there tomorrow to be there for the President's visit as part of this U.S.-India CEO forum.
And I really think there could be a takeoff there that we've all really been waiting for, for at least 10 or 12 years now.
And that one could turn out to be quite a good positive.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: The thing I would add to that, Dave, is – and Scott, to get to your question on the non-resi,
I look at our exposure in the products businesses in ACS, principally in fire, and in some of the commercial businesses
in ECC. As I said in my comments, the growth rate had been very nice, mid-single digits, approaching double digits in
some cases, so good trends there. And then in Building Solutions, where we have the – we provide both projects and
services in that same space, the order rates and backlogs have been good. If you look at the backlog overall for the
business, it's up about – it's up mid-single digits over last year. And it's across all the regions. It's actually double digits
in Europe, but that comes off a lower comparison. But overall, each of the regions are in that range. So we feel like it's
headed in the right direction.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: Well, that's encouraging. Well, have a safe trip to India, Dave. Give the President my best.
<A - David M. Cote>: Okay.
<Q - Scott Reed Davis>: See you. Thank you.
<A - David M. Cote>: Bye.

<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Hey. Just a couple things back to energy exposures and the like. On UOP in particular and kind
of the capacity that you put in place, do you guys have people contractually locked up there? Is there any kind of take
or pay, or if this thing does kind of unexpectedly take kind of a sharper turn for the worse, you're exposed there?
<A - David M. Cote>: The exposure is not that great, and it helps that we get upfront payments on the technology
licensing. So yes, if there was a severe downturn, of course we'd feel it, but I'm not that worried about it right now,
Tom.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Nothing that we're going to commit to.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Right, we are seeing a few refinery cancellations in the U.S., just two this week alone. I was
also just wondering on hedges, Tom, how those work? Is there – was there a P&L expense in 2014 to prep yourself
here for 2015, or is it – that running through on the balance sheet somehow?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: No, no. Good question, Jeff. All of the hedges qualify for mark-to-market accounting. I'm
sorry, qualify for not doing mark-to-market accounting. Sorry about that.
<A - David M. Cote>: I was going to say wait a minute.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: So the impact of the hedge instruments when they settle would be recognized at the same
time the underlying items that are being hedged are recognized. So there's nothing unusual, it's just the extent of the
currencies that we've gone out and hedged.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Okay. And I was just wondering if you could give a little more specific color on Aero spares.
You spoke to kind of after-market generally and kind of all-in with R&O, but what's going on in spares trends? Are you
seeing more activity over airplanes that might be fuel cost related or anything that kind of stands out?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: I'd say on the – it's a little bit of a dichotomy between ATR and BGA, but real strong
growth on the ATR side and mid-single digit growth on the spares. It's growing on BGA side as well, but not as
significantly. But we do expect those – that to improve and the ATR trends to continue for the – for 2015.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Okay. Great. Thank you, guys.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
<A - David M. Cote>: Who?
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Hey, guys. Good morning.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Mediocre quarter, but it's good enough these days.
<A - David M. Cote>: Good.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: So just on UOP. Just remind us how much of that business is new projects. And if you
were to see an air pocket in new projects, what kind of backlog do you have today to give you a little bit of leeway to
take action? So, for example, in the first quarter, if you saw that number go down 30%, when would that hit you
revenue-wise? Is that even a 2016 issue or is that more like a 2017 issue, or is it a 2015 issue?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: I guess I would consider the composition of UOP backlog, Steve, to answer that question.
As I said, the backlog has held up very well.
<A - David M. Cote>: Actually, I have a tough time – even in the recession, I don't think it was that bad though.

<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: I think on the capital side, a lot of these – where we come in on these capital projects is
toward the middle or the end. And so most of the capital is spent in the ground, and we come in and install the systems
and the technology. So the backlog is holding up. I would also say that if you look at the composition of the backlog,
it's in the catalysts, it's in equipment, and it's in gas. And in all three places, it's holding up, and there's really not any
material difference from what we've seen. So like Dave said, I haven't heard or seen anything in terms of potential
declines there.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Right. But I guess I'm just trying to understand what kind of visibility and timing
dynamics play into your ability to take action if you do see something like that.
<A - David M. Cote>: We'd have time to react not just there, but around the company.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Yes.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Right. And your orders and backlog in UOP, orders in the fourth quarter, and then what
your backlog ended the year at?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: I don't know that we disclose the backlog.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Wasn't it like $2.8 billion or something like that at the end of the third quarter? I know
you guys gave a number at your HPS day in November, I believe. No?
<A - David M. Cote>: Not off the top of my head, but we can get back to you on that one.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Okay. And I guess just one other question on capital allocation, any kind of change in
philosophy around buybacks versus deals here? Is anything getting a little more attractive as the market kind of bumps
around?
<A - David M. Cote>: I wouldn't say our philosophy has changed, and that's why you saw us increase the dividend
greater than the earnings rate this year because that's consistent with our five-year plan of raising the payout ratio over
this five-year period. So that's going to continue to be a priority for us.
And I'd say on the M&A pipeline, I'm actually feeling better about that than I have in these past few months. I always
felt good about it, but I'd say the work Roger is doing and the businesses are doing is improving that overall pipeline. It
doesn't mean anything is going to be happening soon, but I can say I feel better about it. I think there are some
increasingly, let's say, good properties that would be a very good fit with Honeywell if we can make them happen.
<Q - Charles Stephen Tusa>: Got you, great. Thanks a lot.
<A - David M. Cote>: You're welcome.

Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Hey, Dave. So you mentioned you're feeling more bullish on the consensus for five years, and
everyone else gets fearful as prices come in somewhat. It sounds like you might be about to deploy the balance sheet. Is
that a fair comment? You mentioned the backlog is looking pretty fertile, but just conceptually, is that correct?
<A - David M. Cote>: Just to make sure I understood, are you saying, am I getting ready to do something?
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Just given the asset – multiples have come down a little bit and you've got a more bullish view on the
economy than most competitors.

<A - David M. Cote>: I would never, of course, say anything one way or the other there, Nigel. I'd just say I'm
encouraged by the work the guys are doing on the pipeline and the stuff I'm seeing. And we've got the capability, and
we're just going to continue to be smart about it.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay, that's fair. And obviously, the commentary around Building Solutions is really encouraging.
Obviously, we've seen the pickup in general construction activity, but I'm wondering. The performance contracting
energy saving part of that portfolio, are you seeing similar trends there? And there's a bit of a debate that low energy
prices means that some of this work could get pushed out. Do you agree with that thought process?
<A - David M. Cote>: I guess you'd have to say yes, it's possible, but we're not seeing that because it's not like $50 oil
is cheap. It wasn't that long ago that we were concerned that it could be a recession if it hit $35. So $50 is not cheap. It's
cheaper than it was, but it's not cheap.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. Are you seeing similar trends on the Performance Contracting side, Dave?
<A - David M. Cote>: Yes, orders are good there.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay, and just a quick one on the hedge accounting, Tom. So the way that works is you take the full
impact on the top line and then the mitigation is through the COGS line?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: Actually, the items that we're hedging, we could get into a complicated accounting lesson
here, but the items that we're hedging are actually cost items, and we're doing it selectively throughout the portfolio. As
you can appreciate, we have a global supply chain and a lot of currency movements across borders. What we do is
focus on hedging the expense items, and that enables you to protect the overall P&L. But what that leaves open is the
top line. And so the top line is, in a lot of cases, exposed to currency movement.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Right. And then just quickly, I think you mentioned you hedged down to $1.10. Is that correct, Tom?
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: No. I said our plan was based on $1.20, and we've hedged at a rate that I think protects that
pretty well.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.

We'll take our next question from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Joe.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Dave, I guess since the last time I saw you, I've got to say congratulations to your Pats,
deflate-gate notwithstanding.
<A - David M. Cote>: Stop reading The Post and the news. Just they're having a ball, so to speak, with this.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Indeed they are, and they probably should. But moving on to maybe a question on capital
allocation, I just want to ask Nigel's question slightly differently. Valuations have come down, especially in oil and gas.
Has your priority in terms of where you're looking for the next target, has that changed at all just given clearly there are
more attractive valuations on the oil and gas side today?
<A - David M. Cote>: I would say – I'd back up on it, I guess, and say that great positions in good industries are still
going to be a fundamental for us. And secondly, pricing makes a difference. So there's a lot of stuff that we like in a lot
of different segments, many of which we've outlined for you in the past, and we're going to continue to look at. Does
pricing makes sense? Does it make sense today versus further into the future? And we tend to try to be pretty careful
about timing when it goes into even picking off a great position in a good industry.

<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Okay, that makes sense. And I guess given that this month, you just got back from your top
300 meeting, I'd be curious to hear how you feel about the progress that you guys are making in terms of pivoting the
company really to an organic growth story. The margin story's there, but really pivoting to organic growth and
improving your cash flow conversion over the next few years.
<A - David M. Cote>: Maybe the best way to say it is that coming out of that meeting, we had 300 unbelievably
energized people, even more so than I've seen in the past, and everybody's really pretty bullish, not just about what
we've done, but about where things are going. And HOS Gold and what we're doing to develop and fund the
breakthrough initiatives for the 76 enterprises is really energizing everybody around the world. It's just wonderful to
see.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Okay. All right. So pretty confident in the outlook there. And I guess maybe one last
follow-up question on TS. Tom, you mentioned that the growth has been really good, your exposure is predominantly
to Europe, and you've got auto builds that are expected to moderate in 2015. You mentioned in your prepared
comments that there's been increasing improvement in the light vehicle gas application. Is it – is your portfolio
positioned well for that opportunity? And maybe just a little bit of color there.
<A - Thomas A. Szlosek>: First of all, and what I'm referring to is the increased penetration turbos on the gas
combustion engines on light vehicles. That's just the trend that we're seeing in the U.S., China, India, everywhere. And
we're well-positioned to take advantage of that. We've got not just manufacturing capacity in each of those places, but
also local product development capacity and engineering teams that work with the OEMs in those regions. So I feel like
we're pretty well-positioned, and the growth rates support that.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Okay. Thanks, guys. I'll get back in queue.

And we'll take our final question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer & Co.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Thank you, good morning. Hey, a lot of detail already, just drilling into ACS a little bit.
It was nice to see a 6% organic number against the 5% organic comp a year ago in particular. I'm just wondering how
you guys are kind of parsing attribution here in terms of market spurts, execution against VPD and HUE and things like
that?
<A - David M. Cote>: Pretty well, overall. I'd say some of the businesses are doing extremely well within some of the
– Scanning & Mobility, for example, we'd have to highlight. The Gas Detection business has done extremely well with
it, and then I'd say everybody else is kind of in the middle of progress, but progress is good everywhere. It's really
working well.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Okay, thanks. That was all.
<A - David M. Cote>: You're welcome.

We're proud of what we've done, but even more importantly, we're excited about where we're going. Our business
model really does work. And while I believe that lower oil prices will lead to a slightly better global economy than
what's forecasted currently, we'll plan conservatively, as always, to ensure that we do deliver on our commitments to
you. We believe we're well-positioned to deliver on our five-year commitment to you and we look forward to seeing
many of you at our March Investor Day, where we'll share more about how and why we'll get there. And in the
meantime, the next – the following Sunday, in a very American sport, I hope we can all be patriots. Thank you.
