With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul M. Bisaro
Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call today. We are pleased to announce
another exceptional quarter for Actavis driven by strong profitable growth across each of our three businesses and
highlighted by the announcement of our proposed acquisition of Warner Chilcott, which I will address further in a
moment.
Let's begin first with our financial results. Second quarter net revenues increased 47% to $1.99 billion. Non-GAAP
earnings per diluted share were up 42% to $2.01. And adjusted EBITDA increased 42% to $475 million. In our Actavis
Pharma segment, net revenues increased 58% over the prior year period with U.S. highlights including the launch of an
authorized generic version of Zovirax ointment and re-launch of Vestura, our generic version of Yaz.
Outside the U.S., we delivered broad multi-country launches of generic Viagra and Zometa across Europe, a successful
launch of generic Crestor in Australia and we continue to launch our oncology injectable products around the world
with our latest launch of Docetaxel in Japan.
We recently announced settlements of several patent challenges providing for date certain launches of generic versions
of OxyContin and Intuniv in 2014, Ziana in 2016 and Zyclara in 2019. And we continue to strengthen our pipeline,
announcing patent challenges on a number of products, including generic Safyral, Diprivan, and AndroGel 1.62%.
In the first half of this year, Actavis has submitted more than 20 new filings in the U.S., many of them additional
first-to-file opportunities. As of the close of the second quarter, we had more than 190 filings pending at the FDA; 56
are first-to-files including 38 exclusive first-to-files.
In our Actavis Specialty Brands business, we experienced continued growth in key promoted products including
Rapaflo, Generess Fe, and Crinone and had 2 million prescriptions since launch for Rapaflo and 1 million prescriptions
since launch for Generess Fe.
We announced a strategic agreement with Valeant to license in Metronidazole 1.3% Vaginal Gel and we announced a
partnership with Medicines360 providing Actavis with U.S. and Canadian commercial rights to the Levosert IUD. Both
products are at the registration stage and, if approved, could be launched as early as 2014.
Also in the quarter, Health Canada approved FIBRISTAL, formerly called [ph] Ismia (05:16), for the treatment of
moderate to severe signs and symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult women of reproductive age who are eligible for
surgery. This product was licensed from Franklin Gedeon Richter, who are currently having a successful launch of the
product in Europe. We are launching FIBRISTAL in Canada in this quarter.

As I mentioned, however, the most significant news came in May when we announced our intention to acquire Warner
Chilcott Plc, a transaction that will create a leading global specialty pharmaceutical company with approximately $11
billion in combined annual revenue. We are aggressively planning for the integration of Warner Chilcott on day one,
working with the Federal Trade Commission and other regulators to receive approvals for the transaction, and
anticipate that we could close this acquisition as early as the beginning of the fourth quarter.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Todd to take us through the financial results in more detail.
R. Todd Joyce
Thanks, Paul. I will now review our results on a consolidated and divisional basis.
GAAP net revenues for the second quarter were $1.99 billion, an increase of 47% over the prior year reflecting strong
growth in all three of our business segments. Net revenues in our Actavis Pharma division was $1.569 billion, up 58%
year-over-year as a result of the acquisition of the Actavis Group and new product sales in key markets offset in part by
the impact of competition on our authorized generic versions of Concerta and Lipitor.
Ex-U.S. net revenues were $649.8 million, up 209% from the second quarter of 2012, primarily, due to the inclusion of
legacy Actavis. Actavis Pharma net revenues of $1.57 billion during the second quarter of 2013 consisted of net
revenues of $957.5 million in the Americas, $518.2 million in Europe, which includes Medis and $94.3 million in
MEAAP.
Actavis Pharma adjusted gross margin was 51.9% which was favorably impacted by Anda's distribution of Lidoderm
and the increased margins on our generic version of Concerta as a result of our contractual arrangement with
Ortho-McNeil-Janssen.
Moving to Actavis Specialty Brands, net revenues were $144.8 million, up 21% on higher sales of promoted products,
including Rapaflo, Generess Fe, Crinone, and the addition of Kadian. Gross margin increased to 76.2%.
Finally, net revenues from our Anda Distribution segment were $276 million, up 14% due to increased sales of
third-party brand product launches and higher sales to chain customers. Anda's gross margin for the quarter was 13.4%.
Consolidated operating expenses have increased significantly year-over-year as a result of the addition of legacy
Actavis. Consolidated GAAP R&D for the second quarter was $135.6 million, up 70% year-over-year.
We expect R&D investment to increase in the second half for both our Actavis Pharma and our Specialty Brand
divisions, which includes our biosimilar development programs. For the full year we still expect GAAP R&D expense
in the range of $550 million to $600 million.
Consolidated GAAP SG&A for the second quarter was at $461.4 million, up 92% over the prior year. For the full year,
we currently expect SG&A in the range of $1.65 to $1.7 billion as a result of higher acquisition, integration, and
restructuring charges. Amortization expense for the second quarter was $149.8 million.
On a non-GAAP basis, our income tax rate was 26.9% in the second quarter, down from 35.5% in the prior-year period
as a result of the acquisition of the Actavis Group. For the full year, we still expect our non-tax – our non-GAAP tax
rate to be in the range of 27% to 29%.
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes amortization expense, acquisition cost, and impairment charges, as well as other
items detailed in Table 4 of our earnings press release, earnings for the second quarter were $2.01 per diluted share, up
42% year-over-year as a result of growth across our Actavis Pharma and Actavis Specialty Brands segments. The
current quarter GAAP results includes an impairment charge following our routine annual impairment testing.
This accounting related non-cash charge resulted from combining the company's legacy Arrow business, which was
acquired in 2009, with the legacy Actavis Group business acquired late last year. Following the Actavis Group
acquisition and the appointment of the management team to run the combined company, the company was required to

establish multiple reporting units that must be tested for goodwill impairment.
This restructuring into multiple reporting entities resulted in an impairment of the goodwill within our newly formed
European unit. This charge does not impact our forecast for the legacy Actavis business or our consolidated outlook as
this reporting unit is trending in line with our current year forecast.
The restructuring charge is also not directly related to our recent decision to explore the restructuring or possible
divestiture of certain European businesses. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $475 million compared to
$333 million as a result of the addition of legacy Actavis and growth across the business.
Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $72.4 million and cash and marketable securities were $235
million at the end of the second quarter. Cash flow from operations was slightly lower this quarter due to the timing of
our corporate estimated tax payments and an inventory build related to planned product launches in the second half of
the year. Our total debt at quarter end was $6.35 billion and our leverage ratio on a pro forma basis was 3.66 times.
After another strong quarter, we continue our focus on deleveraging and maintaining a strong financial foundation to
support strategic growth initiatives within our global businesses.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Paul for an update on our 2013 forecast and concluding remarks.
Paul M. Bisaro
Thanks, Todd. I'll now provide an update on Actavis' 2013 forecast excluding Warner Chilcott. For Actavis Pharma,
our forecast includes a launch of generic Pulmicort and generic Exalgo in the fourth quarter. No change in our generic
Concerta estimates from the previous forecast, which includes an additional competitor in the third quarter. An
exclusive launch of generic Lidoderm; no additional competition in 2013 for generic Adderall XR; and no additional
competitors on generic Zovirax.
For Actavis Specialty Brands, our forecast includes no material Specialty Brand launches in the second half of the year.
So our updated 2013 forecast is as follows. Our estimate for full year net revenue is unchanged at approximately $8.1
billion. We continue to expect Actavis Pharma revenue to be between $6.3 billion to $6.5 billion. For Actavis Specialty
Brands, we continue to expect net revenue of between $550 million to $600 million.
For our Anda Distribution business, we continue to anticipate revenue to be between $1 billion and $1.2 billion. We
now expect adjusted EBITDA of between $1.96 billion to $2.03 billion. We continue to expect our non-GAAP
effective tax rate to be between 27% and 29%. And we are now increasing the low-end of our forecast of non-GAAP
EPS range by $0.05 and now expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $8.15 and $8.50 per share
reflecting a full year estimated shares outstanding of approximately 134 million shares.
In summary, we expect the momentum from the exceptional second quarter to carry forward into the remainder of this
year, as we continue to prepare for the integration of Warner Chilcott. And we will continue to execute effectively and
deliver results across all of our business segments. Again, I would like to thank all our employees around the world for
their hard work and dedication to the growth of our global organization.
With that, I'll turn the call back to Lisa for Q&A. Lisa?

[Operator Instruction] Your first question comes from Ronny Gal with Sanford Bernstein.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Morning, Ronny.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Good morning. Two questions. The first one is about the discussion regarding divesting your
Western European business. There are some obviously – I understand that financially this might not be the most
profitable business, but strategically, Paul, if you want to be a global generic company, it feels like you need the scale
and you need the presence in all those markets. And you probably need some of that to, as an infrastructure, for selling
branded products in Europe as well. Can you just give us your thought about where you are taking this business in
terms of what's going to be the focus going forward?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, sure, Ronny. I mean I think one of the things we're thinking about is a range of strategic
alternatives for these businesses. You did highlight several things we want to make sure we consider. One is the –
particularly the Specialty Brands business in those regions and that's part of the overall analysis as we look at the
strategic alternatives for some of these businesses.
Second of all, I would remind you that we're not really leaving these markets even though we would be exiting some of
the commercial activities within those markets. Because we would continue to supply the products of course through
not just our Medis business, but also to whoever might be the potential acquirer of some of those commercial
operations. But I will turn it over to Siggi for a little bit more color on those franchises.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yes, I think, Ronny, the situation for us is these six or seven markets we are considering
have that in common that the healthcare environment has changed. These are [ph] INN (15:49) and tender business
markets. They are – clearly there is a lot of volume coming from these markets. We feel we are very well covered with
the Medis business, we supply significant amount of volume through Medis.
But remember, we are exploring possible restructuring, which could include that we leave some of the businesses up
and running because in all these markets we have both Rx, we have OTC business and we have injectable hospital
business and you mentioned the Specialty Brands business which we are building up in Europe.
So even though we are exploring – one of the option we are exploring is a possible divestiture, I think restructuring is
also a high – high up on our list of things to explore exactly for the reasons you mentioned. But clearly we are not
leaving these markets. These markets have to be part of a global leading specialty company like we are today.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: And a follow-on, Paul, considering the thoughts about Western Europe and the big restructuring
charges, kind of begs the question, with hindsight, and I know hindsight is 20/20. If you look at your Arrow acquisition
and your Actavis acquisition, what do you think are the areas where the business surprised you positively – the
acquired business surprised you positively? And where did they underperform what you would expect them to do?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, I mean, I think that's a great question, Ronny. As we look back – and you are right,
hindsight is 20/20. There are parts of every acquisition that you wish would perform better than other parts. As I look at
the Arrow acquisition, for example, I think for Actavis, or at that point Watson, it was a incredibly strategic acquisition
that allowed us to build the infrastructure to be able to do the Actavis acquisition in 2011 – 2012.
I mean that was – without that first step, we just wouldn't have been able to be ready to do such a magnitude of an
acquisition and then do it as well as we were able to do it, integrate it, build it and get value for our shareholders. The
second thing to – the second thing to remember is also about Arrow as well, the markets in Europe were
underperforming our expectation; the U.S. business outperformed our expectation on Arrow.
So look – one of the problems you have when you – we do these kinds of impairment tests is you are looking at discrete
units as opposed to the whole. And if you look at it as a whole we would do the transaction over again because on the
basis of the whole we did extraordinarily well. Remember Crestor came from Arrow and Lipitor came from Arrow and
all these assets within the U.S. came from Arrow. So I just want to remind everybody that we would still do the deal
over again. This is – this exercise of goodwill impairment, I don't know, to me it's a little mystical.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Your next question is from David Amsellem with Piper Jaffray.
<Q - David A. Amsellem>: Thanks. Just a couple. On the Warner deal, bearing in mind that you cited the $400 million
in potential savings. I guess the question here is should we view that I guess as a bare minimum of savings given that
Warner itself is spending well north of $800 million in SG&A alone and there's obviously a lot of overlap in the
therapeutic areas between legacy Actavis and Warner. How should we think about that going forward?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure, David. I just want to – I probably should have started with this, just to remind everyone.
We are still subject to the Irish Takeover Rules, so we are very limited in what we can say about our – the details
surrounding the Warner Chilcott acquisition as well as our activities related to the integration preparation. But I would
say we have not seen any surprises. The $400 million that we talked about, which included operational synergies,
remind – just as a reminder, operational synergies which were the majority of those and then some tax synergies are in
there. We didn't include manufacturing synergies, we didn't include revenue synergies, we didn't include interest rate
synergies. So just think about that as you do the math in your head about what is an opportunity and we will be giving
more color at the close hopefully with – on what we think potential upside opportunities are with respect to the Chilcott
acquisition.
<Q - David A. Amsellem>: Okay, that's helpful. And then just a product specific question. This is on RESTASIS;
given the recent FDA draft guidance, what is your view on how difficult it will be to show equivalence on a product
like that? And is that a product that you have the ability and I guess the inclination to pursue?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: David, it's Siggi here. I think on – as you have seen in our portfolio, we have a
significant portfolio of ophthalmology products. We have seen the guidance like the rest of the world. We think a
development can be done. It is a high hurdle to overcome, but we don't comment on individual product, but this is right
up our expertise in developing ophthalmology products.
<Q - David A. Amsellem>: Great. All right, I will jump back in the queue. Thanks.

Your next question is from Tim Chiang with CRT Capital.

<Q - Timothy Chiang>: Hey Paul, you know, I wanted to follow up on the RESTASIS question, really [indiscernible]

<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Tim, can you come a little closer to the phone?
<Q - Timothy Chiang>: Oh, I'm sorry. Can you hear me?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yeah. Now we can.
<Q - Timothy Chiang>: Okay. I was just asking a follow-up on the RESTASIS question, in terms of capabilities with
[indiscernible] (21:48) do you guys have that in house?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yes, we have a partnership – we don't have the manufacturing capabilities but we have
a spine partnership with a partner that has that capability.
<Q - Timothy Chiang>: Okay. And then maybe one follow up question. On the gross margins on the generic side it
looked like those margins benefited from your Concerta relationship. I was sort of trying to think about how those

margins are going to change when you launch Lidoderm later this year? Are those margins going to continue to
benefit?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: I think if I take the first round, I think Lidoderm – this shouldn't affect, it should be flat.
As we see it going forward you should look at it as flat – there is an ups and down because also we build in a price
erosion every year there are new launches, Lidoderm clearly being the biggest one for the rest of the year. But we
assume for the remaining of the year it should be around flat.
<Q - Timothy Chiang>: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from Marc Goodman with UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Could you give us an update on the synergies that you are doing with Actavis and the Watson
transaction? Just give us a sense of how that's going and where we are relative to your expectations and if you have any
updates on how that's doing? And then second of all, can you update us on the branded pipeline and biosimilars work
that you are doing? Has there been progress in the past three months? Thanks.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Hey, good morning, Marc, it's Siggi here. I think on the Actavis synergies – on the
Actavis integration we are doing very well. I think, what we can say is that the integration in the U.S. is done. We have
restructured the company. We have one face to the customers. Basically, the people leaving the organization have
already left the organization.
With regard to the other overlapping markets, remember we have seven other overlapping markets: U.K., France,
Poland, Nordics, Australia as an example, and Germany. In these markets we have done a full integration due to legal
situations in – employment, legal situation in some of the European countries the full synergies have not been realized.
But we are working very hard on that and we have done a great job and the team has done a great job in integrating the
two businesses.
With regard to the operation synergies, the procurement synergies, we are well on track to achieve those. Remember,
when we announced the deal we told you that we would be the largest single purchaser of API from a third-party due to
the fact that others are – have so much of their own manufacturing. That really is coming true. We feel confident on our
operational synergies.
With regard to the R&D synergies, the first synergies we captured was on the overlapping products, there was about –
probably between 10% and 20% overlap on significant products where we could get some savings, which we captured
already starting 2012, end of 2012, and into 2013.
And then, since then we have announced closure of two development sites, one in Greece and another one in Malta as
part of the synergy captures within the new company. So I think overall, Marc, this is on the cost side we are well on
track, we feel good about it, we are operating as one company and I feel really good about the business as it's going.
With regard to the revenue synergies, which we didn't include in our $300 million over three years number, that's
coming too. It is much slower, as we knew, because we need to get registrations in international markets, that usually
takes about two years. But we are straightaway getting some benefit from our Anda business, distribution business in
the U.S. That clearly is benefiting us.
And we also think that when the Specialty Brands business will launch in Europe we have an infrastructure in most of
the countries already in place that will give us synergies later on when we launch the Specialty Brands products.
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: On the R&D front – this is Fred Wilkinson. Marc, thank you. Yes, we have
progressed very nicely on both the biologics front and the small molecule business. FSH has completed its Phase I
moving into Phase III by the end of the year. Amgen will comment I think in two weeks on the progress of the
biosimilars but we're very, very pleased with that partnership and the approach that's being taken there and think we're

very nicely positioned on the monoclonals that are in that partnership.
On our own front, I think we've had some real nice progress obviously FIBRISTAL got approved and is in the launch
mode up in Canada. We are progressing the [ph] Azmia (26:52) program nicely for the U.S. We're evaluating and will
be filing Generess in Canada. Levosert, we've received 10 approvals now throughout Europe, two of them in our
territory, eight in the Gedeon Richter territories. Diafert is progressing very nicely through its pivotal trial and should
have results here during this quarter. And then finally, to remind you, we've got a progestin-only PDUFA date of
December 26 that we will be watching very closely. So a lot going on and that's before we bring in the portfolio from

<Q - David R. Risinger>: Excuse me, I have a number of questions. I'll just rattle them off if that's okay. The first is -
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: We'll try to keep track.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: The first is -
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Go ahead.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: What's that?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: I said we'll try to keep track.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Okay. Well, actually why don't I just go one by one? So first, could you just comment on
whether you're going to have any capacity or supply constraints on Lidoderm when you launch it September 15?
<A - Robert A. Stewart>: Yes, this is Bob Stewart, David. What I'd say is that absolutely not. We have built on – built
on to our Salt Lake City facility a couple of years ago, and we have been steadily building our launch quantities and
launch build, which is significantly completed. So we are ready to launch, just waiting for the September 15 date to put
the product in distribution. And we've assumed very high generic conversion rates there. And so we're able to launch
the product and keep the product in supply and no capacity constraints.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Great. And I know that you're typically pretty conservative with your assumptions. Can you
just remind us when you assume another competitor enters the market, even though there is a lack of clarity on another
generic competitor entering?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: So – it is Siggi here, David. We assume that another competitor will come end of first
quarter in 2014.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Great. And then with respect to management's interest in capacity to pursue additional
acquisitions in 2014, can you help us understand how we should be thinking about additional deals going forward?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure. One of the things we are looking at all the time, David, as you know, is ways to continue
to invest in our businesses, our – both our Actavis Pharma business as well as our Specialty Brands franchise. We have
targeted and continue to target those areas where we think we can get the highest growth rates. And so for Actavis
Pharma, we're actively pursuing and looking at opportunities across Central and Eastern Europe, Russia, Southeast
Asia, also Australia, Japan; those areas where we believe we have the highest likelihood of fast growth.
We've also continued – we also continue to look for opportunities in Central and South America, because those areas
have high growth potential and we have – with the exception of Brazil and Mexico we – as you know, we don't have a
lot of coverage in that region. With respect to Specialty Brands, I think we've got to get through the close of Warner
Chilcott, but Warner Chilcott brings to us the two things – two new therapeutic categories that I think will give us some

exciting opportunities. We have done – if you look at the pipeline that we – the combined entity will have in women's
health, I believe it is second to none really, on the – not just on oral contraception but on a vast array of female health
issues. We'll be covering that and have a great opportunity there.
I think the GI and derm give us new opportunities to look for products not just for the North American markets where
we have now commercial infrastructure – strong commercial infrastructure on a combined basis in the U.S. and
Canada, but be able to roll out some of these assets into those infrastructures that we have through Actavis Pharma in
Central and Eastern Europe, Russia, Southeast Asia and those markets. So we're looking to find assets that we can
synergize across our network, and we are actively looking now.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: That's very helpful. And then high-level question, does the FDA ever give draft guidance
before generic applications have been filed?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: It's difficult for us to say anything about it, but we know they give draft guidelines after
an application has been filed at least.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Got it, okay. And then finally just a tidbit. On the other generics line – that was stronger
than we expected this quarter. Could you just provide some color on what's in there and why it was so strong?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yes, on other revenue the reason why it's stronger than expected is because we account
for the Zovirax AG in the other revenue line. It's because it's not in our brand packaging yet. When we transfer over to
the Actavis packaging we will account it as product revenue, but up until then we account it in other revenue.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Great. Thank you very much.

Your next question is from Randall Stanicky with Canaccord Genuity.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: May seem pretty obvious. But given that I didn't you talk about the pro forma accretion
update, should we still assume that better than 30% is the working target until we get a better update in October?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yes, Randall, that is the – we haven't changed any of those assumptions that we gave at the
close. So that is the current – and we haven't really seen any surprises. So we feel very comfortable with where we're at
and we'll hopefully give you more color at close.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Okay, great. And then, Siggi, just a question on the injectables market. Can you talk about
your build out there and how you see competitively that market playing out and your interest in getting a little bit more
aggressive in broadening your franchise there?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yes, Randall, I think the injectable market is still appealing. You never know what will
happen when more players come in and the competitors will fix their compliance situation with the FDA. What we
have done is, as already we have talked about this, we have reached an agreement with Sagent where we get back rights
to the oncology products they are distributing for us. At the moment we will get that back by the end of 2014.
But as you can see also from our Paragraph 4 filings, which have been announced, we are constantly developing
significant numbers of injectable products to expand the line. So we hope that by the end of 2014 when we have our
own injectable business unit we will be probably between 20 and 30 products ready on the market. We have two
manufacturing sites ourselves in – both in Romania and in Italy, but we also work with multiple partners.
We have taken the approach of focusing on the harder injectables both oncology but also quite, tough difficult products
to develop. We haven't shied away from 505(b)(2)s because it's easier to introduce a 505(b)(2) into the injectable space
because the switching takes place in the clinics or the hospitals. So the decision of the hospitals gives us opportunity
there.

So I think overall we are excited about it. We still don't want to go into the everyday injectables, the antibiotics, the
large volume parentals or anything like that. We want to keep it at the more complex level, not only on oncology, we
might go into CNS and other therapeutic areas, but what we try to have for our portfolio is a complex injectable
portfolio, not the biggest one on the market, but hopefully the best one.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: That's helpful color. And maybe just a really quick follow-up for Paul. The Pulmicort
appeals date – that is August 13, is that correct? And then how quick could we get a decision there?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, I think you are correct, that is the appeal date. And we hope a quick turnaround. But
again, judges do seem to work on their own time schedule. We have anticipated – I'm sorry, it's August 12, sorry that I
misspoke about that. Also we – as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have included Pulmicort in the fourth
quarter.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Got it. Thanks, guys.

Your next question is from Gregg Gilbert with Bank of America.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Good morning, Gregg.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Good morning, gentlemen, I have a couple. First – I think they're all Siggi, we'll see. First, are
you on track for approval and lunch of the relevant strengths of generic Exalgo in November and May respectively?
Or...
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yes, so – so we...
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Or could they get gummed up with the abuse deterrent debate and all that?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yes. I think we feel very good about the approval process. I think what we are working
on now is the REMS program. What is the requirement of the REMS program the FDA wants us to do? I think that
should be easily resolved before the November date. We feel comfortable around that. There's no other technical issue
we see outstanding with the application. And then the 32 milligram is in 2014 and it is the same situation. We feel very
good about the dossier itself, but we need to get to a conclusion what kind of REMS program the FDA will request us
to do.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Okay. And no other filers on that drug, right, that you know of?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: I can't – I don't know exactly. I know we are launching first on everything except the 32
milligram in November.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Okay. And then on Opana ER, I thought that was an interesting press release you put out. Can
you give us your latest thinking on what you plan to do there or what you're watching and waiting for?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: So, what we are doing there is basically we are watching the space. So currently – and
you see this yourself, Gregg, currently Impax has between 6% and 10% market share of the Opana market. I think as of
this week they're at 7.8%; they have been going down over the last few weeks.
I think we feel – we probably – we don't know what the opportunity is, but I think overall we expect to launch by the
end of third quarter, we are building inventory now. I think it's worth launching. But it's difficult though for us to say
how big the market is because Impax hasn't been so successful in the market so far. But I intend to launch this product
probably by the end of third quarter this year.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: And lastly, on generic Suboxone, I imagine that's been a pretty stable market. But do you still
think there's the potential for chipping away at some of the film business with some of the payer actions we started to
hear about? Thanks.

<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yes, I think, Greg, we saw the Caremark announcement about not having the thin film
of Suboxone on their reimbursement list. That could be a small opportunity. Obviously the Caremark is probably 5% to
10% of the overall brand, so it's not a huge up site overall. I think the bigger opportunity, as I've mentioned before on
the thin film, is many of the patients that get the thin film, they pay out-of-pocket, they don't have a healthcare
insurance. And I think those are the patients we want to introduce to the generics because with no couponing the
generics are still a less expensive alternative for this product. So I think that could be a bigger opportunity for us going
forward than maybe the Caremark having the thin film not reimbursed.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thanks. I'll ask one last one because I have to get Paul in the mix here. Paul, I'll ask you sort of
an ambiguous question. What do you think of the sort of tax rate land grab that is going on in the industry?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, I'm not sure what you mean by land grab. But I think everybody recognizes, and
unfortunately we have a tax structure in the United States that's putting companies in the U.S. at a disadvantage. And I
think we were able to – hopefully assuming the transaction goes through and we're able to complete the merger and
complete the restructuring and inversion, then we won't be at a disadvantage anymore. And I think other companies
have to take a look at that. It just makes economic sense.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thank you so much.

Your next question is from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
<Q - Chris T. Schott>: First question just was wondering if you would be willing to discuss Actavis' projections for
Warner Chilcott that were released in your S-4 in June. I think those numbers were well below Street expectations. And
I was just wondering if there is any color or commentary you could provide on those?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, Chris, I think probably the best way to think about this is that we're – those were what
were used during the evaluation process. Obviously things change over time. More information – we learn more
through the integration process. And I think, what I would prefer to do is wait until we close and can give you 2014
combined guidance and be a bit more thoughtful about how we do that and not be sort of limited by the constraints of
the Irish Takeover law.
<Q - Chris T. Schott>: Okay, sure. The second question was the combined company obviously is going to have a very
significant cash flow. It seems like some of the acquisitions or the business development targets don't imply very large
deals. I guess my question is do you see an ability to deploy a majority of the company's cash flow into business
development going forward? Or could we think about the company looking at things like dividend or larger share repo
over time?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yes, Chris, I think you know sort of our – first and foremost we're going to be looking at
paying down additional debt, giving – keeping ourselves and the ability to move quickly on large transactions should
they present themselves because we would have paid down our debt and have the flexibility to do so. So that's sort of
number one.
Second of all, we will deploy cash as we can. And you're right there may be small – a series of smaller transactions first
before anything of substance or of the magnitude like a Warner Chilcott or an Actavis deal is done. But, we of course
will evaluate all of those options as we go forward. Should we get into a position, though, where cash flow and we've
maintained the right debt levels and we're doing all the deployment of cash to support the businesses that we feel is
necessary, we would at that point look at other alternatives including potential dividends. But that I think is some time
away.
<Q - Chris T. Schott>: Okay, great. And then just one final question. Lonza, Teva today announcing their – kind of
formally dissolving their partnership on biosimilars. Just any thoughts you have on that, what it implies about any of
the difficulties or competitiveness of these markets going forward?

<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: Hey, I wouldn't actually read too much into it. If you looked at the Teva
biosimilar program, they at some point had bought enough different companies that they had multiple projects going on
the same product. And so, I think what they've done is probably very efficiently pruned their product line down to the
leading entities within their biosimilar portfolio. Lonza for the last year has been out selling or trying to solicit use of
space, so it has been obvious that the Lonza Teva relationship was not going to be as deep as it originally was.
<Q - Chris T. Schott>: Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from Douglas Tsao with Barclays.
<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: Good morning.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Good morning.
<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: First question for Paul on a topic that I know you feel passionately about. I was just curious to
get your perspective on the Supreme Court decision regarding settlements?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yeah, I don't feel passionately about this one at all. Well, I mean I think the first point I would
make is that we're very pleased that the FTC's position was rejected by the Supreme Court. We always thought it was
wrong headed and at least the Supreme Court agreed with us on that approach. I think the Supreme Court has delivered
us a workable solution, a workable opportunity. We will continue to pursue patent settlements as part of bringing
products to market prior to patent expiry. You know, notwithstanding, I would say the political noise that people raise
because they think that the words pay for delay actually mean that and they don't.
Again, it is always about the patent, it's about the patent, it's about the patent. Look at our Pulmicort case; we win the
District Court level and then get enjoined from shipping. So somebody needs to explain to the FTC as well as Congress
that it's about the patent office, it's about the way judges rule and at some point we'll get that message through.
With – again, with respect to the Supreme Court case, I think we are satisfied that we can move forward, we plan to
move forward. I am a little disappointed that they didn't – that they chose to try to split the baby, but I think we can live
with it and we will going forward.
<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: And so, ultimately you don't think this is going to have a meaningful impact on how you are
able to negotiate settlements with innovator companies?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: No, I don't think so. I think we'll have to take a second step, it will require us to go in front of
judges and explain the settlement. It is also possible this could be – ultimately turn out to be somewhat of a positive,
because we would or could potentially receive Noerr-Pennington protection on settlements once the District Court has
ruled that these things are pro-competitive. And that may make it easier actually to do a settlement and at least get
certainty around it and at least put to bed some of the ancillary litigation that follows this crazy pay for delay thing.
<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: Okay. And then just one follow-up probably for Siggi on Suboxone in terms of your
comments trying to go after cash paying customers. I was just curious in terms of your plan to execute upon that or sort
of operationally how you would go about marketing or targeting that patient population?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yeah, what we have to do, Doug, is basically we have to educate doctors in terms – we
don't have a sales force. You know the total sales force of the U.S. generic organization is about five people. So we are
not going to visit doctors, but there will be a mailing out informing them about this opportunity to save a significant
amount of money for the patients they are treating. So I think that is one thing.
Second thing is the market of the drug abuse clinics or the methadone clinics, they use a significant amount of
Suboxone. By introducing it there also we get the knowledge to the patients that need this drug going forward. So I
think with these two approaches, relatively inexpensive sales and marketing approach, but also looking at the clinics I

Your next question is from Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Good morning, Jami.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Most of the questions were already asked. But if you could just talk about the – what you see as
the biggest variables to your forecast at this point. My guess is that it would be Pulmicort and Concerta, but I'd be
interested in your views on that.
And secondly, do you view the Pulmicort opportunity as similar sized as you did earlier in the year now that time has
passed or should we think of it differently going forward if you win the appeals process? Thanks.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Hey, Jami, its Siggi here, let me take this one. I think you are absolutely right. The
biggest change to our focus is the Pulmicort. We have built that into an April launch. Remember we guided you to
Pulmicort with launch in the second quarter with the competition. We don't know if that competition – we felt that
competition probably wasn't ready at the time when we got the judgment down. So – but they could have caught up
whenever the decision of the next courts dates come through.
We still feel good about the market. The market is enormous. There's only two players in the market, AstraZeneca and
Teva. So we still feel extremely good about the opportunity. There has still been no other approval; it's only us and
Apotex. We feel good, we have enough supply, we have a good supply chain. So I think we feel extremely good about
the situation as it is, but who knows. Every month that passes allows the competitors to catch up. So we have to
evaluate the situation whenever the judge makes a ruling on that case later on.
I think with regard to Concerta, you said that would be a biggest difference to our forecast. I think overall, we are just
in line with our forecast. We said in the beginning of the year that Mallinckrodt would launch the product. They more
or less did that on time. We also highlighted to the market that there would be a slow uptick. I think that has come true.
We are still at about 75% market share with Mallinckrodt at about 22% market share. So it takes time to build that
market share for generic Concerta. It's – both are very complex products, but you need to have a quota – a secure quota
from the DEA. So overall, I think the generic Concerta situation has not surprised us; it more or less has confirmed and
validated our assumptions we gave in the beginning of the year.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from David Maris with BMO.
<Q - David W. Maris>: Two questions for you, Paul. First on the Supreme Court, just more specifically, do you think
that investors should be at all concerned any of your existing deals would be challenged by payers or state attorney
generals'? I know you can't predict that, but do you – internally do you think that that's a risk?
And then separately, one of your competitors – one of your more loquacious competitors at a recent investor
conference mentioned Actavis more than 10 times in it's, I don't know, half hour presentation, kind of – implying in a
couple different spots that the Warner Chilcott deal is a deal out of weakness and that you don't have the growth
prospects in generics that's why you're moving more to brand.
So first related to that, on a jump off situation, do you feel comfortable when you're going up against other generics that
your relationships with the retailers are as strong as ever? Are you seeing increased market share in the US, less market

share, and globally? And then separately, any other feeling about deals in brands versus more in generics and what the
outlook is on the generic side?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure. Well, let me first say that we don't feel any weakness with respect to ourselves and other
competitors. But Siggi, why don't you take what you're seeing in the marketplace and explain that first?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: I think overall, David, it's worth mentioning if you look at the IMS data, we haven't
seen it for second quarter, but for first quarter for the first time Actavis was the largest generic company in terms of
dollars in the U.S. We were about $30 million larger than Teva and about $200 million larger than Mylan. So – so I
think we have seen strength in the market, we are still growing. Also just look at the pipeline, do the comparison of the
pipeline, we are above 190 NDA's pending, I think that's a good indication of our growth prospects. We have 56
first-to-files, 38 of those are exclusive first-to-files and I think that's a good indication. I think if you do your homework
and compared to some of your – other more talkative companies, I think, we are in a quite a good situation in the U.S.
market. So – so we don't feel any weakness in the generics business; we really feel that the wind is with us now and we
are investing more in R&D than ever before.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yeah, and I would only add to that that we look at the pharmaceutical space holistically, maybe
that's the way to think about it. We believe that we are a pharmaceutical company and we will provide those products
that the markets that we operate in need. And those will include OTC, injectable, hospital, branded pharmaceuticals,
branded generic pharmaceuticals and generic [ph] INN (52:39) pharmaceuticals depending on the market need. Each
market will be in a different stage of development that we operate in and we want to be prepared to do whatever makes
sense in that market for us to be able to grow the fastest as possible.
So I don't want to – I don't apologize for our business model; I think it's the right business model. I think it's certainly
preparing us for what we hope is the brass ring, which is biosimilars in the end of this decade and into the next decade.
Turning to your question about the Supreme Court, unfortunately there is the possibility, and I think people should
recognize there is the possibility, that we could see additional ancillary litigation from the Supreme Court decision. It is
unfortunate what – that sometimes the Supreme Court creates opportunities for those kinds of things to occur. We will
of course defend our – that litigation if it does come up. We don't feel like there is a concern with any of the past
settlements that we've done, although only time will tell as to whether or not we run into any additional problems.
You know, I think there is one thing to always remember, when the Supreme Court brings a new rule of reason test, it
is – it's pretty accurate to say that consumers lose and the lawyers win. And being a former lawyer I can say that might
be a bad – a good thing, but it isn't really good for consumers.
Also I would say that we have not in any way lessened our commitment to challenging patents and bringing products to
market earlier than they would have otherwise but for the patent. Siggi gave you the statistics. I think right now we are
either number one or very close to being number one in the U.S. with the number of patent challenges. So, clearly we
believe that is a very good way to continue to grow our business and provide value to consumers and our customers.

synergies you expect to drive from Actavis and then Warner Chilcott as well. And have – have suggested there could
be substantial manufacturing synergies, particularly around the Actavis acquisition and integration of those operations.
But we really haven't sort of quantified that to any great extent and just attempting to do that in some form or fashion
here. I mean, if I look at sort of your cost of sales line coming out of the most recent quarter, I mean you're roughly at
$4 billion. And then I would think it would be quite reasonable to assume that several years out, upon integration or
completion of integration activities, we could be looking at cost savings somewhere on the order of 10% to 15% of that
number. And I just want to make sure that that assumption is kind of in the right ballpark.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, I'm going to turn that over to the operations guy.
<Q - Robert A. Stewart>: So Elliott, this is Bob Stewart. We're not going to guide you to a specific percentage or a
number at this point other than to just say that we constantly look at our manufacturing network and that's both internal
as well as external contract manufacturing organizations that do supply us products around the world. We're always
looking at opportunities to lower our cost and benefit from low-cost manufacturing locations.
With the Actavis transaction we picked up a number of them such as our facility in Bulgaria, which is a very low-cost
manufacturing location for both Europe and will ultimately become a supplier for the U.S. as well.
After the Warner Chilcott transaction we will reevaluate the manufacturing network again and, you're absolutely right,
there's manufacturing synergies that are out there both in terms of conversion synergies as well as additional
procurement synergies and we'll continue to work through that. And then, as Paul mentioned before, that when we
close and we can become a little bit clearer in terms of what that the longer-term synergy numbers are, we would
probably look to include some direction around manufacturing synergies at that point.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yes. You know, I would add one other thing, Elliott, and that is capital spending avoidance.
Because of the way that we are – we are constantly – and Bob and his team are constantly evaluating what the future
pipeline looks like and what our needs are going to be and we are already moving to – to evaluate – or to move our
manufacturing network to support even a different style of product development than we do today. For example, we
have mostly solid oral dosage forms today.
But as we look out over the next few years we are going to be moving into other dosage forms. We have programs in
place now to make sure that we have maximized the solid oral dose facilities, but we can move into and then – but also
maximize the non-solid oral dose facilities and not have to face huge CapEx adjustments later on to build that capacity.
So the process is already underway and so there is a capital avoidance piece to this as well. And if you look at our
CapEx spending, I am pretty pleased that we were able to keep that very, very nicely under control this year.
<Q - Elliot H. Wilbur>: Okay. Then just one quick follow-up here as well for Siggi. I mean, you have already
commented a couple times on the generic methylphenidate or Concerta market here but just wanted to maybe ask a
couple additional questions here. Is it – I mean is it fair to say that things have basically shaken out exactly as expected
and specifically thinking about price with Mallinckrodt's entry and then ultimately Kremers Urban launch here, and
have you learned anything about potential additional competition?
I know it's embedded in guidance for the year. There is a couple other applications pending, I think Impax's travails are
fairly well known. But this has been a market where historically, at least on one occasion, we've been surprised by a
filer and an entrant. I'm just wondering if you learned anything new about the competitive landscape there in terms of
competitors who might emerge other than potentially say Impax in 2014? Thanks.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yes, Elliott, I think with regard to the market itself it has been very, very close to our
assumptions beginning of the year. Mallinckrodt and us, you know it takes time to build up market share. Obviously in
the beginning Mallinckrodt only launched the 27 milligram, then they brought the two higher strengths to the market.
We are still alone on the 18 milligram, Kremers – basically the [ph] cut co (59:43) is coming to the market. We are
expecting them any day. They have not launched yesterday but we think they should be launching any day with the 18
milligram on the 27 milligram. And then we expect them to come with the two higher strengths, probably at the end,
180 days after the launch from Mallinckrodt in the first quarter. So I think overall it is a stable market, it takes time to

build up inventory. It's not a big movement in the market. Three-player market is still a very good generic market.
Obviously there's a price erosion in the market whenever a new company comes to the market. But overall it's exactly
as per our expectation.
With regards to other competitors, just like you said, we have been monitoring Impax's application for a number of
years. We don't know when that comes. We have said we don't expect other competitors this year. Next year – we
haven't heard anything new in terms of competition, but keep in mind there could be a Paragraph III filer out there
because of the patent situation. So we don't necessarily have to know where it is. But overall we will update the
guidance for 2014 later, but there are probably one, two, three out there but we don't expect any new competition this
year.

Your final question comes from Jason Gerberry with Leerink Swann.
<Q - Jason M. Gerberry>: Paul or Siggi, on Advair – and correct me if I am wrong, but it seems like if I had to
characterize Actavis, you guys seem to be in sort of a watch and wait mode regarding the U.S. draft guidance here. And
I'm just wondering if you can talk a little bit about what you are looking for in terms of competitor development, you
know in the next 12 months and when you guys think you might need to get in the game if you want to be there at
market formation in the 2016 timeframe? That's my first question.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yeah, Jason, I think the first challenge of developing a generic Advair is clearly on the
device. There's quite a few devices out there, but what you have to do in the U.S. is you have to be able to use the
patient leaflet instructions in the same way as for the brand. And what the brand has done extremely well, they have
trademarked the device very well. So that is the first challenge to go through. So then the second challenge is to get the
right PK out of the device and out of the formulation. And then the third challenge is the pharmacodynamic, to show
the clinical equivalence between the brand and the generic. So these are three, in a way, linked challenges, but the
individual challenges we are all facing, all the generic companies. What I can say is we are in good dialogue with the
regulatory agencies, what requirements will be and – what requirements could be later on.
There is no draft guidance, but we are not sitting and waiting for guidance, we are working actively on development of
respiratory products. Challenging, as I said. What needs to happen to be there in 2016 market formation – obviously it
would help to get the guidance out, but also at the same time, I don't think any of the companies developing respiratory
generics or [indiscernible] (63:22) generics are sitting and waiting. As one of the previous questions was sometimes
when you have filed an application that leads the FDA to give out a draft guidance.
So follow this space, it is a very high hurdle, I think a very complex development, especially on the U.S. side. Some of
the other regulatory agencies have been more open to take a PK data instead of PD data. Hopefully the FDA will lean
towards that later on. But the device complication on the PK profiling is quite a lot of challenge to overcome even
before you get the endpoints that the FDA would guide you to.
<Q - Jason M. Gerberry>: Okay. And if I could just squeeze one quick one in on Concerta. Where do you guys stand
with your own Anda product? It's my recollection you guys, I think, amended your Anda back in 2010 to conform with
what the FDA was looking for. Just kind of curious where you are at in the review cycle there and if you are confident
you can get an Anda approval before the contract with J&J comes to an end? Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yes, Jason, we're very comfortable that our approval will come before that time is – before it's
needed. Everything is on track for us. Again, it's not been an application we have been actively pushing with the FDA.
If we can have any say in what applications they are working on that's not going to be first on the list for us. We have
other things that we would rather get first.
<Q - Jason M. Gerberry>: Okay. Thanks, guys.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: All right. Thank you.
