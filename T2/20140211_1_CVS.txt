During the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than one question with a quick follow-up so we can provide more
callers with the chance to ask their questions. Please note that just before this call, we posted a slide presentation on our
website that summarizes the information you'll hear today as well as some additional facts and figures regarding our
operating performance and guidance. Additionally, please note that we filed our annual report on Form 10-K this
morning, and it's currently available on our website.
During this call, we'll use non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance, including
free cash flow and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations you can find the definitions of these non-GAAP
items, as well as reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our website. And
as always, today's call is being simulcast on our website, and it will be archived there following the call for one year.
Now before we continue, let me read the Safe Harbor statement. During this presentation, we'll make certain
forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
Accordingly, for these forward-looking statements, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking
statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We strongly recommend that you become
familiar with the specific risks and uncertainties that are described in our SEC filings including the risk factors section
of our most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K.
And now I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo.
Larry J. Merlo
Okay. Thank you, Nancy, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I'm very pleased with our
fourth quarter results, with adjusted earnings per share coming in at the high end of our guidance, at $1.12 per share,
capping off a terrific year. For full-year 2013, we delivered strong growth in revenues, gross margin, operating margin,
and earnings across the CVS Caremark enterprise. Excluding one-time benefits in both 2012 in 2013, adjusted earnings
per share increased nearly 16% with PBM operating profit increasing nearly 15% year-over-year, and retail operating
profit growing 10%. And Dave will discuss our financial results and guidance in greater detail during his financial
review.
So with that, let me provide a brief business update highlighting our progress since we met at Analyst Day in
December. As you know, last week, we announced our decision to exit the tobacco category, a category which we
believe is inconsistent with our growing role in the changing healthcare marketplace. Simply put, this was the right
decision at the right time. There is a far greater focus emerging on health outcomes, managing chronic disease, and
reducing costs. And exiting the tobacco category more closely aligns us with the goals of patients, clients, and
providers, positioning our company for future growth. It's also important to recognize that we're doing this from a
position of strength.
The response to date has been overwhelmingly positive across an array of key constituents, including customers,
clients, both current and prospective, benefit consultants, legislators and policy makers, and public health and Medicaid
officials. All of whom see the health benefit as well as the role that pharmacy can play in advancing smoking cessation
and better managing chronic disease. Again, this decision puts us in full alignment with the goals of not just our clients
and patients but others across the healthcare delivery chain to include physician practices and hospital systems. Since
our announcement, we are already hearing increasing dialogue about the concept of quality or outcomes-based
pharmacy networks. And as we move forward, we believe quality and outcomes will be important measures of success
in the rapidly evolving healthcare marketplace.
Now one of the questions that frequently has been asked over the past week is, what about the other products we sell?
Well, let's be clear. You cannot compare a bar of chocolate or a bag of chips to a pack of cigarettes. Those products
used in moderation will not harm one's health. The same cannot be said about tobacco. There is no amount of tobacco
use that's considered safe.

As we stated last week, the decision to exit the tobacco category does not affect our 2014 segment operating profit
guidance, our 2014 earnings per share guidance, or our five-year financial targets provided at Analyst Day. Our
business is strong, and we have near-term offsets to the profitability impact of this change. We strongly believe this
decision will further strengthen our position as a healthcare leader, further differentiate us from competitors, and better
position the company for growth going forward. And Dave will touch further on the financial implications during his
financial review.
Now let me turn to some early observations about the impact of the Affordable Care Act. While we all know
enrollment on the public health care exchanges was slow and bumpy at the outset, all signs point to improvements in
the enrollment process and increasing awareness among eligible consumers. The latest data now shows 3 million
exchange enrollees, but it's still pretty early to say definitively what the impact from the public exchanges will be in the
short term.
With regard to Medicaid expansions, there are positive signs that enrollment is increasing. In January, HHS reported
that December Medicaid determinations were up 73% over a three-month baseline period in states expanding Medicaid,
obviously a positive indicator.
Now although it remains to be seen how many people ultimately gain coverage this year, we are encouraged by the
recent progress, and we believe CVS Caremark is well positioned to serve these new customers across our enterprise
assets. Furthermore, we are well positioned as an enterprise to support our health plan partners. We offer a variety of
capabilities that help them engage, educate, enroll, and manage the care of individuals in exchange products. Our
strong relationships with health plans have allowed MinuteClinic to be broadly included in exchange products and for
CVS/pharmacy to be part of many limited and preferred pharmacy network relationships across the country. So overall,
we're happy with the progress that we're seeing, and we continue to expect a modest net positive benefit from health
reform this year.
I also want to touch briefly on our recently announced 10-year agreement with Cardinal Health to form the largest
generic sourcing entity here in the U.S., the world's largest generic drug market. We're bringing together two of the
most knowledgeable and experienced generic sourcing teams in the world, teams with a track record of working
collaboratively to drive results. The structure will be simple and it's designed to be flexible to marketplace changes and
easy to do business with through centralized decision-making. And with our combined volume and capabilities, this
venture will help spur innovative purchasing strategies with generic manufacturers that create value while enhancing
supply chain efficiencies. And as we stated previously, we're excited about this venture; our teams are already hard at
work with the goal of being operational by July of this year.
Moving on to an update on the PBM business. Since Analyst Day in December, our results for the 2014 selling season
have not materially changed. With nearly 90% of our renewals complete, client net new business totals $2.4 billion,
with our retention rate at 96%. And remember that this net new business excludes the impact from attrition in our Med
D PDP business. As Jon referenced at Analyst Day, we lost $1.3 billion in 2014 revenues related to last year's CMS
sanction, and as you're also aware, we are pleased that CMS lifted the sanction at the end of December. And now that
we're out of sanction, we are once again able to enroll new choosers who age into the program, which is expected to
help offset any ongoing natural attrition.
And then later this spring, we look forward to also enrolling low-income subsidy auto assignees as defined by the CMS
process. We currently have about 3 million lives in our PDP, and we see significant opportunity to grow the business
over the long term. And with the changes that we've made to strengthen the Med D management team, along with the
remediation steps we've taken, we believe that our long-term growth goals in the Med D space are very achievable.
As for the 2015 selling season, it's still too early in the season for a substantive update, but I can tell you that the
marketplace is active, and we are very well positioned to both retain business and gain share with our unique suite of
capabilities and strong service record. Now as you know, we currently provide retail mail and specialty PBM services
to the Federal Employee Health Benefit Program. Many refer to it as FEP, and those contracts are up for renewal for
2015. At this point in the process, there is nothing to report in regard to these contracts other than to note that we are
very happy with our FEP relationship as well as the service and value we are providing to FEP and their members. And

we expect to know the results of the RFP process sometime during the first half of this year.
Let me update you on our progress related to our long-term strategic agreement with Aetna. The migration of Aetna's
commercial business to the CVS Caremark platform has been completed, and we've been working with the Aetna sales
team to ensure that their clients now have access to CVS Caremark's differentiated offerings. Programs such as
Maintenance Choice and Pharmacy Advisor are currently being offered to their clients to help them save money while
improving member health, and our joint efforts have been successful to date. In addition, we're also working with
Aetna to implement and administer their exchange offerings and other government programs resulting from the
Affordable Care Act.
Turning to our specialty business. Growth remained strong in the fourth quarter, as revenues were up approximately
22% year-over-year. The growth was driven by drug price inflation, utilization, new product launches and new clients.
And as we noted at Analyst Day, we expect to see significant growth in the Specialty Pharmacy space, and we are
well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity.
Last month, we completed the acquisition of Coram, a market-leader in specialty infusion services and enteral nutrition.
This provides us with a new set of capabilities to manage, not just the cost of infused drugs, but also to reduce the
length of hospital stays and to help patients move from higher cost sites of service, like hospital outpatient centers, to
more cost-effective locations, such as the patient's home or a physician's office. No other organization brings the range
of specialty assets, the depth of experience or the integration of care that the combination of CVS Caremark and Coram
is now able to deliver.
In addition, our new Specialty Connect offering remains on schedule for its 2014 roll out. The Specialty offering, think
of it as being analogous to our Maintenance Choice program for traditional maintenance medications. Specialty
Connect integrates our mail and retail capabilities, providing both choice and convenience for members, while
preserving the central clinical expertise that leads to better health outcomes. And we're looking forward to having this
fully-implemented this year and are excited by its prospects.
And finally, the acquisition of Novologix last year has provided us with an unmatched claims editing technology. And
through Novologix, plans can manage drugs paid under their medical benefit with the same level of precision that is
routinely expected for PBMs, leading to significant cost savings for the plans. We're now reviewing thousands of
claims daily for our largest Novologix client, using this unique technology, and we expect to be able to assist many
more clients as we work towards a broader roll out.
So I think you can see why we're very excited about all of the ways we are raising the bar in Specialty, as we develop
innovative offerings that capitalize on our unique ability to optimize cost, quality and access in the specialty pharmacy
arena.
Now moving on to the retail business, we had another solid quarter. Total same-store sales increased 4%, while
pharmacy same-store sales increased 6.8%. Our Q4 volumes were muted, given a slow start to the flu season, compared
to strength in the prior year with flu-related scripts down nearly 10% year-over-year.
In Q4, pharmacy same-store sales were also negatively impacted by about 230 basis points due to recent generic
introductions, and that's a 90 basis point decline from the impact we saw in Q3. Pharmacy same-store scripts increased
3.8% on a 30-day equivalent basis, and the growth in our Maintenance Choice program continues to result in a
greater-than-historical rate of conversion from 30-day to 90-day scripts.
Now as you know, our goal this past year, 2013, was to retain at least 60% of those scripts we gained during the
impasse between Walgreens and Express Scripts, and I'm pleased to report that we exited 2013 with the retention rate
ahead of our expectations. Our numbers have held steady now for several quarters, and we expect no further loss as a
result of the impasse's resolution. And given that these scripts are now part of our base business, there will be no need
to provide updates going forward.
As for the front store business, comps decreased 1.9% reflecting a decline in traffic, partially offset by an increased
basket size. And recall that we're comping against a very strong cough and cold season we experienced in December of

2012, and our cough and cold business was down about 5% in the quarter.
As far as the seasonal business goes, we had a very good Halloween season, while Christmas was roughly flat to last
year, keeping in mind that we had one less shopping week between Thanksgiving and Christmas. And on a two-year
stack basis, our front store comps were 2%, notably better than the 1.1% two-year stack front store, performance we
saw in Q3. Our front store margins were up slightly this quarter. And with our ExtraCare loyalty card, we continue to
drive engagement among our members through personalized value across all channels. And as you've heard us say
many times with 15 years of testing, refining, and fine tuning, we're better able to optimize our promotions and drive
profitable sales. Overall, roughly 85% of our front store sales and 70% of our front store transactions use ExtraCare,
and today, despite almost universal availability of loyalty programs, customers continue to rate our program
substantially above the rest and have significantly higher engagement levels.
Now one of the many ways we offer value to our customers while driving profitable sales is by using ExtraCare to
drive trial usage and restore brands. For the 13 year, store brands represented about 17.8% of our front store sales, and
our goal is to move that to more than 20% over the next few years with opportunities identified across a number of
categories. Customer acceptance continues to grow and our store brand quality has never been better, and we continue
to innovate to meet our customers evolving needs.
Turning to our new store program, we opened 77 new or relocated stores, we closed two during the fourth quarter,
resulting in 58 net new stores in the quarter. And for the year, we opened 247 new or relocated stores, closed 13,
resulting in 156 net new stores, and that equates to 2.4% square footage growth.
Let me briefly touch on MinuteClinic, which delivered more than 10% growth in revenues this quarter despite the
tough comparisons with the strong flu season in 2012. We opened 74 net new clinics in the quarter, including clinics in
new states and markets such as New Hampshire and the San Francisco/San Jose Bay area.
We reached a milestone, ending the year with 800 clinics across 28 states in the District of Columbia. And as our
President of MinuteClinic, Andy Sussman, noted on Analyst Day, we plan to open at least 150 new clinics this year.
And our long-term goal is to create a national platform that supports primary care by providing integrated, high-quality
care that is convenient, accessible and affordable.
Now those of you who attended our Analyst Day probably remember Andy's video that highlighted our new TeleHealth
at MinuteClinic pilot program. I'm happy to note that we have now launched 28 sites in L.A., San Diego and Orange
County, California, and our California nurse practitioners are now providing patient care remotely through
sophisticated video technology and audio equipment with licensed vocational nurses assisting patients. And we plan to
expand this exciting pilot to a second state later this year, and we look forward to the results.
So with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review.
David M. Denton
Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone. Today I'll provide a detailed review of our 2013 fourth quarter results and
review our 2014 guidance. And as I typically do on these calls, I want to begin with a wrap-up of last year's capital
allocation program and how we've been using our strong free cash flow to return value to our shareholders.
In the fourth quarter, we completed the accelerated share repurchase program that we began in October and
repurchased approximately 26.6 million shares for $1.7 billion. So for all of 2013, we repurchased approximately 66
million shares for $4 billion, averaging just over $60 a share. We have $693 million remaining on our 2012 share
repurchase authorization, in addition to the $6 billion our board authorized in December of last year. Additionally, we
paid $268 million in dividends in the quarter, bringing our total for the year to $1.1 billion.
We finished the year with a payout ratio of 23.9%, and our strong earnings outlook this year, combined with the 22%
increase in the dividend we announced at Analyst Day, puts us on track to achieve our targeted payout ratio of 25% at
some point during 2014, more than a year ahead of our schedule. So between dividends, and share repurchases, we've

returned approximately $5.1 billion to our shareholders throughout 2013. Our expectation is that we will return more
than $5 billion to our shareholders again in 2014 through a combination of dividends as well as share repurchases.
We generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow during the fourth quarter and approximately $4.4 billion for all of 2013,
down $771 million from 2012 levels. The decrease in 2013 was driven by an increase in accounts receivable due to the
timing of payments from CMS in connection with our Medicare Part D business, partially offset by improved inventory
management as well as strong earnings growth. We had mentioned on our last call that 2013 free cash flow might fall
short of our expectations, and in fact, we did end the year short of our goal. This is driven by the timing of certain cash
receipts being delayed from late 2013 into early 2014, and as a result of this timing shift, we are raising our 2014 free
cash flow guidance by $400 million to a range of $5.5 billion to $5.8 billion.
Aside from these timing items within receivables, we made great strides in improving our cash cycle through better
management of payables and inventory, especially within the retail segment. Our retail cash cycle improved by nearly a
day and a half in 2013, and we remain committed to further improvements as we move forward. For the year, our net
capital expenditures were $1.4 billion. This included $2 billion of gross CapEx, offset by $600 million in
sale-leaseback proceeds. This level of CapEx was more or less in line with prior year spending levels.
As for the income statement, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations came in at $1.12 per share at the
high end of our guidance. GAAP diluted EPS was $1.05 per share. The quarter was somewhat atypical, as you know,
largely due to the timing of Med D profits as well as the timing of break-open generics relative to 2012. But our
operating segment each perform near or above the high end of expectations. And let me quickly walk down the P&L.
On a consolidated basis, revenues in the fourth quarter increased 4.6% to $32.8 billion.
In the PBM segment, net revenues increased 5.2% to $19.6 billion. This growth was attributable to drug price inflation,
particularly in our specialty business as well as new specialty clients and products. Partially offsetting this growth was
an increase in our generic dispensing rate, which grew 110 basis points versus the same quarter of LY to 81.1%.
In our retail business, revenues increased 5.6% in the quarter to $17.2 billion, driven primarily by strong pharmacy
same-store sales growth. As far as gross margin, we reported 19.3% for the consolidated company in the quarter, a
contraction of approximately 75 basis points compared to Q4 of 2012. Within the PBM segment, gross margin declined
100 basis points, again versus Q4 of 2012 to 6.2% while gross profit dollars decreased 9.2% year-over-year. The
decline in profit dollars was primarily attributable to the shift of Med D profitability from Q4 into Q3, as expected and
previously discussed.
Also contributing to the gross profit dollar decline were fewer claims in Medicare Part D due to the loss of lives.
Partially offsetting these drivers was the improvement in GDR. Gross margin in the retail segment was 30.7%, down
approximately 55 basis points over last year. This decline was largely driven by continued pressure on reimbursement
rates, partially offset by the 110 basis-point increase in retail GDR to 81%.
Additionally, our private label sales increased 50 basis points as a percent of front-store volume to 18.6% in the quarter.
Total operating expenses as a percent of revenues moderately improved from Q4 of 2012 to 12.6%. The PBM
segment's SG&A rate was essentially flat at 1.6%, while SG&A as a percent of sales in the retail segment improved
approximately 55 basis points to 21%. Within the Corporate segment, expenses were up approximately $16 million to
$198 million. Our continuing efforts with respect to cost control once again allowed us to deliver very good results
across the enterprise. Operating margin for the total enterprise declined approximately 60 basis points to 6.8%.
Operating margin in the PBM declined approximately 95 basis points to 4.6%, while operating margin at retail was
essentially flat at 9.7%.
For the quarter, we exceeded our estimates for operating profit growth in both the retail and PBM segments. Retail
operating profit increased a solid 5.8%, exceeding expectations by approximately 135 basis points, reflecting better
generics performance. PBM operating profit declined 13%, some 200 basis points better than our guidance range. The
PBM benefited from favorable purchasing economics and better-than-expected specialty growth.
Going below the line on the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter decreased approximately
$25 million from last year to $135 million, due primarily to lower average interest rates. Additionally, our effective tax

rate was 39.2%; our weighted average share count was 1.2 billion shares, only slightly higher than anticipated.
Before turning to guidance, I want to call your attention to an immaterial accounting correction that was disclosed in
our filings today. It relates to how we recognize revenue in the retail segment, and it had a minor impact on our
prior-period financial statements. And historically, we've recognized revenue from the sale of prescription drugs in our
pharmacies at the time the prescription was filled as opposed to when the prescription was picked up by the customer,
as required by GAAP. For substantially all prescriptions, the bill date and the pickup date occur in the same reporting
period, and the effect on both revenue and income from recording prescriptions upon fill as opposed to delivery is
immaterial. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we began recognizing revenue when the script is picked up by the
customer. This immaterial correction is reflected retrospectively in the historical financial statements that are presented
in the Form 10-K that we filed this morning, so you can find all the details there.
Now let me switch gears and update you on our guidance. You can find all the details in the slide presentation that we
posted this morning on our website, but I'll focus on the highlights here. I want to start with the first quarter as we are
revising our EPS ranges upward to reflect a stronger quarter in the retail segment than we previously anticipated. We
now expect consolidated revenues to increase 4.25% to 5.5% in the first quarter, adjusted earnings per share of $1.03 to
$1.06 per share, and GAAP diluted EPS of $0.97 to $1 per share. This is $0.07 higher than our previous guidance and
equates to adjusted EPS growth of 24.25% to 28.25%.
Now about half of the $0.07 upward revision is simply a profit timing adjustment versus our original plan.
Additionally, strong underlying trends in our retail pharmacy business are continuing into our 2014 outlook, especially
as it relates to generic performance. The ongoing strength in our core retail pharmacy business will help offset the loss
from our decision to exit the tobacco category, which I'll talk more about in just a moment.
As a result, while we are maintaining our retail revenue growth guidance of 3% to 4.5% for the first quarter, we are
increasing our operating profit growth guidance to 14.5% to 16.5%. Our first quarter guidance for the PBM segment
remains unchanged, with operating profit growth up 21.25% to 28.25%. As you know, last week we announced our
planned exit from the tobacco category. On a 12-month basis, we estimate that we will lose $2 billion in revenues,
about $1.5 billion directly from tobacco sales and another $0.5 billion from the rest of that shopper's basket. That
equates to approximately $.17 per share on an annual basis. Given the expected timing for implementing this change, it
will cost $.06 to $.09 per share in 2014, almost entirely a back half of the year impact.
Now let me switch gears and speak about our full-year outlook. For the full year, including the impact from exiting the
tobacco category, we are able to maintain the company's previous earnings and segment operating profit guidance. This
is due to the strength of our core business trends noted earlier as well as other profit enhancing initiatives which we
expect to offset the $0.06 to $0.09 shortfall. Within retail, we're lowering our 2014 top line expectations to reflect the
elimination of the tobacco category throughout the year. For the year, we now expect retail revenue growth of between
0.75% and 2%, a reduction of approximately 125 basis points related to tobacco, and comp growth is now expected to
be down 0.25% to up 1%. Comp script growth remains unchanged. As we exit the tobacco category, we will break out
the impact to our reported comp on a quarterly basis until we cycle through this change so you can see our underlying
performance.
We continue to expect retail operating profit growth for the year of 7% to 8.75%. PBM guidance remains unchanged,
and I'll point out that with a strong top line finish in 2013, the jump off point has moved up, so maintaining revenue
growth guidance of 7.25% to 8.5% means that the dollar range actually shifted up by about $275 million. PBM
operating profit is expected to be up 6.75% to 10.75%. Given the top line changes I just noted, we expect full-year
consolidated net revenue growth of 4.25% to 5.5%. We have fine-tuned the yearly guidance for revenue eliminations
and now expect the percent of segment sales eliminated to be approximately 10.6%. We also continue to expect
consolidated operating profit margins to expand 15 basis points to 25 basis points.
We still expect adjusted EPS to be between $4.36 and $4.50 a share. This reflects strong year-over-year growth of
10.25% to 13.75% if you exclude the impact of the legal settlement from the third quarter of 2013. GAAP diluted EPS
from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $4.09 to $4.23 per share. We remain confident with these
ranges despite our decision to exit the tobacco category by October 1, and we remain committed to utilizing our strong

Larry J. Merlo
Okay. Thanks, Dave, and as you've heard this morning, we had a strong finish to 2013, and we're having a strong start
to the new year, and I just want to acknowledge and applaud the efforts and hard work of our more than 200,000
colleagues who are responsible for that.
So that said, let's open it up for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim
Securities. Please proceed.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: So, Larry, a quick question on tobacco. It's pretty easy to quantify the negative part of this.
As you guys made this decision, how did you try to get your arms around the positive piece, i.e. share that Caremark or
retail might pick up because of the stand you took? Were you able to do that – I mean you're not going to say it
publicly, but were you able to get your arms around what that share benefit could be?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yes, John. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I mean, John, I think as you heard us talk
last week and we reiterated it this morning, this decision is about CVS Caremark playing a growing role in our health
care system. So if you go back to Analyst Day, we talked a lot about our strategy to gain share of a growing pie, and we
believe that this decision positions us to do that. As we move forward, recognizing that, you think about the retail
customer, you think about whether it's the client; be it an employer health plan. But there's also a new customer
emerging, provider groups and hospitals, and I think that the decision that we made to acquire Coram I think puts an
exclamation point on that, in terms of the role that we'll play with hospitals in terms of delivering care.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Okay. And then I guess just as a follow-up on your first quarter guidance. So the retail
business performing at a much better rate than what you had talked about in December. So a lot of that is generic. So it
sounds like retail gross margin rate substantially better than you would have thought. But you also mentioned timing
issues being half of the benefit. Where's the timing coming from?
<A - David M. Denton>: Yeah, hey, John. This is Dave. I think, as I said in my prepared remarks, about half of the
raise of the $0.07 is essentially a shift, if you will, or cadence shift, if you will, around the quarters from our profit plan.
And quite frankly, we just – as we looked at – as we exited 2013 and we recessed our forecast for the balance of the
year, some of the profits that we thought were going to kind of happen later in the year actually are kind of happening a
little sooner. So we just kind of readjusted our plan. So you'd expect half of that is just a shift, the other half is kind of
underlying strength in our business, driven primarily by, I'll say, generics within our business.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - David M. Denton>: Thanks, John.

<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. So I just wanted to understand a little bit. I know
you – I think, Dave, you said you raised the first quarter by about $0.07. We have a $0.06 to $0.09 headwind from
tobacco. But it seems like you're being pretty conservative with your full-year outlook, given the strength in the first
quarter. I mean, the strength in the first quarter is something you think is going to end? I'm just trying to understand a
little bit why you're looking to take a little bit more conservative view on the full year.
<A - David M. Denton>: Yeah. Scott, this is Dave. Here we are on February 11. We've got a lot of time ahead of us. I
think, as we've said, our core businesses are performing nicely. We continue to kind of manage the business kind of at a
very detailed level to deliver both top line and bottom line results, and this is our best estimate for the balance of the
year and we'll see how it plays out. And clearly, we do have a headwind from tobacco and we're working to manage
that offset, and were working – I think the teams rallied around this cry to get that done and we're working to get that.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: Okay. Then I had one that's a little bit more strategic. I was in your new flagship store in
Columbus Circle with your kind of updated format, and just understanding strategically with Helena there and where
you see maybe the remodels going? Where you see retail going? One thing not talked about, you're taking tobacco off.
Maybe something else is going to go there? So I just want to more strategically understand the plans for the retail
segment and try to get those comps back positive. It seems like there's an enormous amount of opportunity there.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah. Scott, it's Larry. I'll start and then Helena can jump in with her thoughts as well. I mean,
obviously, when you look at that 8-feet to 12-feet that tobacco commands today, there'll be something replacing that
space and, to be clear, it's not going to make up $2 billion in revenues, but it will be something. And there are some
things that are being tested, as we speak, and we'll make a decision on that over the next several weeks. But I'll turn it
over to Helena and she can share her thoughts, especially with her being new in her role.
<A - Helena B. Foulkes>: Okay. Thanks, Scott. I guess just stepping back a little bit, I've been in the role for about six
weeks. I think in general what I'm seeing is, as you heard today, the business is fundamentally strong, and our focus is
on executing and accelerating growth for the future. We're certainly focused on building on our foundation of
pharmacy strength, and they're focused even more on differentiating our service where we can leverage our enterprise
assets. We're seeing this tobacco decision as an opportunity to connect even more with consumers as an expert in health
and beauty, and to build our loyalty with them. And as we focus specifically on the front store, it's really around driving
what we'll call smart growth, and I think there, it has three elements. The first is taking ExtraCare to the next level, the
second is focusing on our core strength in health and beauty, and the third is driving our store-brand penetration.
<Q - Scott A. Mushkin>: All right. Perfect. Thanks for taking my questions. I really appreciate it, guys.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thanks, Scott.
<A - David M. Denton>: Thanks, Scott.

Our next question comes from line of Frank Morgan from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
<Q - Frank G. Morgan>: Good morning. I appreciate your comments, Larry, about the near-term offsets that are
available for you out there, but I was just hoping you might be able to prioritize the offset, things like the new generic
joint venture, the Coram, the SilverScript, the accelerated buyback, like how would you prioritize the order of those in
terms of their ability to offset this and actually still offer offset and upside rather than just filling the hole from tobacco?
<A - David M. Denton>: Frank, this is Dave. Maybe I'll start with that. I think first and foremost, as you can see as our
underlying business is performing at the moment at a very solid level. I think without going into a series of programs
that we have in place, because there's not one silver bullet around the offset here as we're working across multiple
levels to either manage sales, margin, and expense to kind of, I'll say, fill the hole that – from a profit perspective that
has been generated from the reduction of tobacco sales. I do think. I will tell you that we are not using share repurchase
to offset that. We're trying to fill the hole at the operating profit line, and we're not using share repurchase to fill the

hole from and EPS perspective. So we're focused on the operating profit line from that perspective, Frank.
<Q - Frank G. Morgan>: Okay. Thanks. One in a different direction, just on the Novologix, is this a incremental
revenue opportunity for you? Or is this just a value-added service that you're making available to your existing clients?
And if it is a revenue opportunity, can you talk a little bit about what potential is there? Thanks.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yes, Frank. This is Jon. So I think you should think of Novologix as being in a
value-added capability that enables us to help plans manage their specialty spend on the medical side, and we believe
that this capability will lead to our growth in specialty fulfillment of drugs that are billed under the medical benefit. We
think it's to our overall specialty strategy.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: So, Frank, I describe it as an enabler that allows us to win more business in the marketplace.

Our next question comes from line of David Larsen from Leerink Partners. Please proceed.
<Q - David M. Larsen>: Hey, guys. Congratulations on a good quarter. Can you just give us your latest thoughts on
exchange-based plans and the profitability around those scripts? Are you actually seeing any volumes? And any
thoughts there? Thanks.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yes, David. I'll start and I think the others will jump in here. I mean it's very early, and I think
as we had discussed I think a few months ago as this question came up, we see the profitability, similar to our health
plan business, and recognizing that we, different than the health plan business of the past, we believe there'll be an
opportunity going forward to introduce many more of the cost management tools that have been widely accepted in the
employer space, but not as accepted in the health plans base. And we see that tide beginning to turn.
<Q - David M. Larsen>: Okay, great. And then just one more. I think on the retail side, 6.8% same-store pharmacy
growth, that looked very good, I think that was the best growth rate in six quarters. What drove that?
<A - David M. Denton>: Dave, I don't know that there was any single item that drove that. It was disproportionate to
other quarters. I think it reflects the ongoing growth in our Maintenance Choice product and the adoption of that, and
nothing out of the ordinary.
<Q - David M. Larsen>: Great. Okay. Thanks a lot.
<A - David M. Denton>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Hi. Thanks very much. Good morning. Larry, you made a comment earlier where you talked about
outcome-based pharmacy networks. Can you help me to understand how that will work? Is that going be more of a
risk-based relationship? Is there an opportunity for upside for incremental profits based on keeping the patient adherent
to the drug? How should we think about that?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yes, Lisa. It's a great question and one that we have given a lot of thought to in making the
decision about tobacco products. And I'll give you two examples of where we think the decision will make a difference.
You look at ACOs and physician practice groups today, their increasingly focused on outcomes because more and more
of it is being linked to their reimbursement rates, and a key area that ACOs are focused on is the role that tobacco plays

in exacerbating a lot of chronic conditions that are driving costs up in the health care system. So many of these ACOs
have developed a number of metrics to track this, the results of their programs take aim at smoking cessation and again,
the use of these products as part of their reimbursement models.
You think about all the different ways that we serve millions of customers each and every day through our retail
pharmacies, our MinuteClinics, our patient and pharmacy counseling through Caremark channels, and we see our
decision more fully aligning with outcomes-based reimbursement models taking root, and we think that we'll become a
pharmacy of choice for these entities and physicians. And I think another example is what I had alluded to earlier in
one of the early questions about the role that hospitals play and the fact that with the Coram asset now, that creates a
different dialogue with hospitals and their physicians.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: And then, Larry, it's only been a week since you made the announcement. Obviously, I applaud
you for making this decision as a healthcare provider. Can you talk about has there been any change in the last week as
far as patients recognizing this, customers recognizing this? I know you said you've had good feedback from whether
it's your customer or the benefit consultants, et cetera, but have you actually seen any increase in volume on the
pharmacy side from this or is it just too early to tell?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: No, Lisa, I think it's way too early to tell. Obviously, the news was well publicized across the
country in a variety of channels and a variety of stakeholders weighing in support of the decision. Everything that we
have at this point is really anecdotal. We've heard from our store teams and our field teams across our retail and PBM
businesses, again all positive. So we'll see how that plays out going forward.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thanks, Lisa.

Our next question comes from line of Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
<Q - Robert P. Jones>: Thanks for the question. Just wanted to follow up on specialty. You mentioned new clients in
specialty helping drive sales in the quarter. I was wondering if you could share any more details on where you're
winning in the specialty space. And then I guess, can you give us any sense of your expectations for Specialty Connect
and how that could increase penetration in your PBM client base this year?
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yes, so this is Jon. It's interesting, as we're moving forward with the selling season and
we're off to a pretty strong start, we're actually seeing an increase in standalone specialty RFPs, and we think are
extremely well positioned to take advantage of that. And so as we think about the strength of specialty, I think it's not
any single capability, but it's our suite of capabilities that are leading to our growth in this segment.
As we also think about the rollout of Specialty Connect, which is now underway, you see a lot of patients actually
walking into retail stores today that end up getting turned away. It can be 20%, 25% of specialty prescriptions that start
in a retail store. We will now have the ability to take care of those customers and fill those prescriptions by connecting
our specially backend and clinical capabilities with our retail asset. And it is interesting, customers with Specialty
Connect have an option to either have their prescription mailed to their home or office or mailed to their local CVS and
pick it up at the CVS, and we see very similar to Maintenance Choice about half the customers want it sent to their
local CVS where they pick it up and the other half want it sent to their home or office. So we're very bullish on this
opportunity. It's differentiating in the marketplace, it's resonating with clients and it's resonating with patients.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Hey, Bob. I think it's – it's Larry, I'll just tag on with one other point. And it goes back to
something that we had talked about at Analyst Day, and the fact that clients are seeing high double-digit growth in
specialty, okay, their appetite to do something different is much different today than it was in the past. And recognizing
that the patients that are on specialty med, they're dealing with some complex issues, but the fact that these costs are
growing 17%, 18%, 19%, people are more willing to entertain programs that can bend the cost curve than they have in

the past, and to Jon's point and in our prepared remarks, we feel that we're very well positioned to serve the client needs
in a variety of ways.
<Q - Robert P. Jones>: No, I think that all makes sense. Just a follow up on the selling season, and I know it's really
early, but any anecdotal things you can share with us as far as what clients are asking for? If anything is resonating
more this year, whether it be restrictive formularies in our networks? And then I guess just generally, how would you
characterize the pricing so far as you've gone through renewals and early in the RFP cycle?
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yes. So, Robert, this is Jon. I'll take that. It's interesting, our client forum that we had in
the fall of last year, I asked, and these were large employer clients, what was their number one priority as far as us
helping them manage their drug spend, and it was unanimous that specialty is their top priority, and they are looking for
help to manage those escalating costs that Larry referred to. And, our capabilities now enable us not to just manage
specialty under the pharmacy benefit, but we've expanded our capabilities to manage under the medical benefit.
So I think that's what's different as we move into the selling season, people are very focused on specialty and the
capabilities. I would characterize the selling season is off to a strong start. We're seeing activity early on from health
plans and government, state governments or government entities. We expect the employer activity to be strong, and if
you remember, this past selling season we said RFP activity was down slightly. It appears to be returning to a more
normalized level. And as far as the pricing environment, I would say it's very consistent with what we've talked about
over the last several years, since it's very competitive but continues to be rational. We think we're well positioned with
our size and scale and capabilities and differentiated products to be very successful in the marketplace.
<Q - Robert P. Jones>: Great. Thanks so much.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Thanks, Bob.

Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee from Cowen & Company. Please proceed.
<Q - Charles Rhyee>: Yes. Thanks. Hey, I wanted ask a follow up on a question on specialty. As we think about the
market, we are starting to have particularly in the biotech space the introduction of sort of oral medications, particularly
as I'm thinking about sort of Hep C here. Can you talk about how that is being dispensed through Caremark and also in
the retail channel? And how do you envision this as you think about other medications that are coming out, sort of these
high-cost drugs that are no longer injectable? How are you treating this? Do you see this is a big opportunity in the
retail space for you? And then how do you approach that with payers as well? Thanks.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yes, Charles. This is Jon again. And there has been some new oral drugs that have been
introduced in the Hep C space, so Sovaldi and Olysio are two examples. If you look at the treatment cost to treat these
patients either over a 12-week or 24-week period it's somewhere between 80,000 and 90,000 and up to over – north of
100,000, so these are very expensive drugs that still require big investments in inventory, clinical expertise, and
follow-up. We need to make sure these patients on these very expensive therapies actually take the medications over
the course so that that investment actually results in a favorable outcome.
So our approach is these are specialty drugs for Hep C. We do have the capability to – with Specialty Connect to
service these patients in our retail stores, so even though the route of administration may move from injectable to oral,
we don't see a significant shift in how these specialty drugs are going to be handled. And with Hep C specifically, the
current drugs obviously are combined with drugs like interferon that require special handling and are injectable. So
that's an example of why we think it'll continue to be treated as specialty.
<Q - Charles Rhyee>: That's helpful. And as a follow up, are you seeing any sort of pushback from payers at this point
around these therapies given the cost?
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Well, I mean, I talked about how -

<Q - Charles Rhyee>: I guess particularly since the patient population is big.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yes, I talked about from a cost perspective these high-cost drugs and therapies are our
clients' top priority, and so when clients start on these therapies, they are very interested in making sure that the patients
are appropriately managed and that they complete their therapy and they get the desired result. Hep C is a great
example of that. So that's why the special handling and capabilities we have at specialty serve the needs of our clients
with these very expensive treatments.
<Q - Charles Rhyee>: Great. Thank you.

Our next question comes from line of Tom Gallucci from FBR. Please proceed.
<Q - Tom L. Gallucci>: Good morning. Thank you for all the details. A couple of follow ups. Dave, on the generic
strength in the retail business, just curious what sort of the underlying drivers are there? Are you thinking it's stronger
volume or better purchasing? And I guess where I'm going with it is, does any of this sort of leak over and benefit the
PBM side of the business as well?
<A - David M. Denton>: Hey, Tom. It's Dave, good question. I think as you know, we work hard and focus a lot of
energy on managing generic profitability. It's very important to us, and there's a lot of efforts underway to do that. I
would say there's a combination of not just one thing that's improving our performance here, it's a combination of many
things, and you touched upon them a little bit. One is we clearly continue to drive generic utilization, shifting obviously
branded drugs into the generic equivalents and actually just, even where we have a generic brand or a generic product
available, actually pushing GDR even further there. We're always very focused on figuring out how to lower the cost of
goods sold in those generic products and our procurement efforts are focused against that. I think later in the year as we
have our joint venture up and running, but we're not really thinking about that at this point in time.
And then finally, kind of establishing I'll say win-win arrangements between payers and ourselves to figure out how we
reduce both pharmacy costs and lower overall health care costs by driving utilization in generics. So all three of those
components are playing important roles. As we think about it. I would say in the very short term a lot of the – I'll say
the outperformance in generics are happening in generics that are more likely dispensed in the retail locations as
opposed to in the mail locations. So at the moment the profitability beat is being funneled more into the retail
dispensing channels. So, hope that's helpful.
<Q - Tom L. Gallucci>: Okay. Great. Yeah, that's great. Thanks, Dave. The other question I had, Larry, I know you
touched on a little bit more your earlier remarks around outcome-based pharmacy networks. I guess some of the idea
behind the Caremark CVS integration was adding this value to the payer, Pharmacy Advisor and whatnot. Do you see
yourselves as retailers contracting as sort of a preferred provider on a value-based sort of a basis anytime soon? And
what sort of metrics do you think would be included in contracts like that?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Well, Tom, another great question. And the answer to that is yes, Tom, I think that there are a
variety of metrics that could be included in that, from something as simple as dispensing the low-cost therapy whenever
possible, largely generics, to keeping people adherent on their medication, something we've talked a lot about. And you
could define that by – we talked about that at Analyst Day, you can define that by a medication possession ratio. So
yeah, I think that that's the direction that pharmacy needs to go, and we're certainly prepared to move on that.

<Q - David G. Magee>: Yes. Hi. Good morning. First question on the generic side, as you look at the conversions
planned over the balance of the year, has the timing with regard to that and the benefit, has that changed in your
thinking?
<A - David M. Denton>: No, Dave, this is Dave. Not substantially. As you know, the break open generics are pretty
modest in 2014, so we have not changed our expectation about that or timing of that.
<Q - David G. Magee>: And then secondly, more of an intermediate term question, with regard to ACA, if you think
about that over a 3-year period, how would you rank the impacts on your business from all the change there?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Well, maybe – Frank (sic) [Dave], maybe I'll start and I'll ask the others to jump in there. The
biggest one is, on the Affordable Care Act, is really about driving new members into the healthcare pool. So over the
next several years, you're going to have something like 35 million Americans who enter some form of health coverage,
and with health coverage will drive utilization within our channel. So I do think that you'll see that. And you'll see that
expansion happen really in two areas: both kind of in the exchange market, whether that be mostly the public exchange.
But also in Medicaid, as the level of availability for Medicaid increases you'll see that expand as well.
<A - David M. Denton>: And, Dave, consistent with what we've said in the past, we see a more immediate benefit
coming from Medicaid expansion than we do the exchange – the growth in exchange population occurring more over
time.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: And I do think that the second piece of that is the next evolution, as we talked about earlier
today, from a strategic perspective is as the healthcare system evolves, again, back to outcomes and net performance
metrics, you're going to see reimbursement focus on those – in networks being driven by those who can perform well
and effectively in managing care and managing costs down. And I think we're very well positioned to take advantage of
that over time.
<Q - David G. Magee>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thanks, David.

Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
<Q - Zack W. Sopcak>: Good morning. This is Zack Sopcak in for Ricky. I wanted to ask, Larry, you had mentioned
the positive feedback you had gotten on the tobacco decision and one of the sources was the federal government.
You've heard from HHS and from the administration, as well. I was just curious if you anticipate any kind of a positive
impact to your government business, as you're going to bid this year from that?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Well, yeah, it's a great question. I mean obviously, as we've discussed, we think that our
decision creates even further alignment with our clients. So I would think that all things being equal, okay, that this
certainly gives us another check next to our name. But I think that we still have to be priced correctly and we still have
to serve the client correctly. So this decision doesn't take the place of the basic blocking and tackling elements that we
work hard to serve our clients each and every day.
<Q - Zack W. Sopcak>: Okay, great. Thank you. And I was just wondering if you could give any incremental color on
the tobacco shopper, and if that profit contribution has declined in recent years or been flat or up? And then also if that
shopper tended to be a utilizer of prescription services as well?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, I'll take the – let me start, and then I think Helena will jump in, as well. I mean, we do
not see this decision having any negative impact on our pharmacy business. It's quite plausible; it could have a positive
impact, okay, recognizing the response from the healthcare community, in terms of this action. I think the tobacco

business at CVS/pharmacy is one that has largely been convenient space. As a matter of fact, if you look at tobacco
transactions, about 97% of those transactions are pack unit sales, not carton sales. So there is a convenience element of
that purchasing that will go away, and maybe I'll ask Helena just to comment on the related sales associated with the
tobacco purchase.
<A - Helena B. Foulkes>: Sure. So as Larry said, we are not a destination for the category. The other data point that I
would add to that is, if you look across the whole industry, only 4% of cigarettes are even sold in all of drugstores. So
it's never been an important part of sort of the overall category sales. So we think that we've done our job, in terms of
estimating the sales that come along with those, and you see those in the estimates. But in general, that, I think, is sort
of isolated around the front store impact. It's very hard to tell what other impact there will be. Certainly the feedback in
the last week has been overwhelmingly positive. People really feel like this is the right thing to do, positioning us as the
healthcare leader. And there's been really significant passion among consumers and our employees and a lot of
stakeholders. So all of that makes us feel somewhat optimistic.

Our next question comes from line of Robert Willoughby from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
<Q - Robert M. Willoughby>: Hey. Larry and Dave, in the past you had a slide that did show the CVS share of
Caremark accounts. Can we get that on a quarterly basis? Do you have the metric for the quarter where that has trended
to?
<A - David M. Denton>: Well, Bob, you're right, we have shown that. We showed that Analyst Day at about 30%.
And we'll take your feedback under advisement, and more to come.
<Q - Robert M. Willoughby>: And for forecasting that, Larry, can I give you 1 point a quarter, or is that just too
aggressive?
<A - David M. Denton>: We're not going to answer that one today, Bob.
<Q - Robert M. Willoughby>: I'll ask tomorrow. Thank you.
<A - David M. Denton>: Thanks Bob.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thanks Bob.

Our next question comes from line of Ajay Jain from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed.
<Q - Ajay Kumar Jain>: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Actually, most of my questions have been asked already, but I just
had a housekeeping question on cigarettes and if that business is already excluded at this point from your comp base,
based on how you're reporting front end comps both for 2014 and for all the corresponding period last year?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: No, it's not excluded. Those sales are in our comp base. What will happen as we cycle into the
back half of this year, we produce comps, we will give you the impact of this on our comp. So you can get the sense of
our underlying true performance in front store.
<Q - Ajay Kumar Jain>: Okay. So based on how they're going to be reporting, so then your front end comps could be
somewhat understated for the next couple of quarters, since the sales impact would have been higher from a year ago.
Is that the right way to look at it?

<A - Larry J. Merlo>: When we get to the back half of the year, yes, that's true. Because right now, we said we need
to exit by October 1. So it's really more of a back half 2014 dynamic than it is the first half of 2014 dynamic.

Our next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly from Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Hi. Good morning, guys. Just a couple of follow-ups for you. First on tobacco. Could you tell
us what percent of your most loyal customers end up purchasing tobacco? For the U.S. in total, right, it's like 20%, but
it's less for women, then it's less again for the elderly. And where I'm going with this is, is there any risk that you could
possibly lose the non-tobacco trips of that customer? And how is that sort of factored into the $2 billion that you've
talked about?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yes, Ed. It's Larry. Ed we've done a lot of analysis with all the information available to us. And
as you've seen in the numbers, based on that work, we believe the related businesses account for about – on an
annualized basis about $0.5 billion. So you can think of it for every tobacco dollar that we forego, there is a companion
sale of about call it $0.30 on that tobacco dollar that moves along with it, okay? And we're estimating that that would
be part of the lost sales.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: And is that companion dollar, is that what's in that tobacco basket? Or is there...
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yes, it is.
<A - David M. Denton>: Tobacco shopper.
<A - Helena B. Foulkes>: Yes.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Okay. So I guess you'll have to monitor sort of what goes on with those non-tobacco trips of
those customers, I guess, right?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: That's right.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thanks, Ed.
<A - David M. Denton>: Thank you. We're going to take two more calls, Frank.

Our next question comes from Meredith Adler from Barclays. Please proceed.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Thanks very much for taking my question. Obviously, a lot of my questions have been asked.
But I would like to talk just a little bit about Specialty Connect and just understand a little bit better how it has actually
functioned at the store. I think you said you would connect a specialty customer who walks in with a new script with
somebody at the specialty pharmacy. Is that something you do at the moment? Or do you have a follow up afterwards?
I guess I'm just – and then I'm assuming that the pickup, if it's done at a store, is in a temperature-controlled packaging
as if it would have gone to their home. It isn't handled as products by the stores. Am I getting that right?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Meredith, it's Larry. Let me start, and then I'll ask Jon to pick up where I leave off. There is one
important premise, Meredith, with that specialty customer today, and there are many, many examples where that
customer goes into a retail environment to get their specialty meds filled, and they can't. Okay? And the pharmacist

cannot help them. They turn them away. Okay? And it has to do with all the complexities. It's much more than just the
fact that that particular pharmacy may not stock a high cost product. So it starts with that premise, and then, Jon, I'll let
Jon pick it up from there.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yes. And then, Meredith, all this is powered by technology that connects the retail store
with our specialty platform, and it guides the store staff through the onboarding process of this patient, and I think that
really is the differentiator here. A lot of these products, retail pharmacists just don't see, they aren't familiar with, and so
enabling this through technology, connecting it back to specialty, providing a pathway for the clinicians to speak to that
patient around either special training or questions, or follow-up that needs to occur, and if you talk to our specialty
patients, they actually talk about their pharmacist. They talk about the retail pharmacist, and they talk about the
specialty pharmacist. And they view that as a care team that's taking care of them and giving them the flexibility to get
their medication in the way that's most convenient for them.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: So you don't envision this person bringing in a specialty script as dealing with a one-time
situation of filling it and then somehow completely turning over the relationship to the specialty pharmacy, but it would
continue to be a partnership? Is that right?
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yes. Right. So, Meredith, that's exactly right. It's going to be a team that is helping this
patient, the retail team will be able to answer some questions, and the specialty team will answer other questions for
their patients. One of the challenges for specialty patients, it's a challenge for the physician and it's a challenge for the
patient, because we're now opening up 7,600 points of access, as opposed to what we have now, which is really just
specialty mail, it's going to make it much easier for the physician and it's going actually get that patient on that therapy
sooner. And that care will happen through that team, and it's all connected and powered by the technology platform that
we have seen, that now we can see that patient or this enables us to see that patient across our enterprise and all our
platforms.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: And just a real quick follow up to that, are you planning to train the technicians? I mean, my
interaction at a CVS store is mostly with a technician, not with a pharmacist. So are they in this loop? Or do you plan to
keep it just with the pharmacist?
<A - Helena B. Foulkes>: Sure, Meredith. This is Helena. Yes, we're rolling this out across the chain, as we do any
retail program. We've got full training for pharmacists and technicians, I think the beauty of the technology that Jon just
described is from a store team perspective. This looks like filling any other prescription that they fill, and so it's not a
completely new process to them. It looks very much like filling a normal prescription, so to speak, and that's been one
of the things that has given us the most positive reaction so far from our store team.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thanks, Meredith. Okay. Last question, please?

Our last question comes from line of Ross Muken from ISI Group. Please proceed.
<Q - Ross J. Muken>: So maybe I thought I'd start first on the MinuteClinic. What have we seen in terms of the types
of things folks are coming into the store for? Are we seeing a broadening out maybe of the types of treatment people
are seeking? And I'm just curious from like a capacity utilization perspective in some of the older stores or the sites that
have been in place, how fast do we see them get up in terms of the newer ones to some of the legacy levels?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, Ross, it's Larry. I mean, I think what we're seeing is a heightened awareness and
consumer acceptance, which if you look at the earlier markets, as we have been able to increase the number of clinics
within that market, obviously there's a halo effect to the older clinics. I think that our MinuteClinic team is working on
broadening the scope of services provided and that is in development, and that's in development with the 30-some
hospital affiliations that we have established acknowledging that we are triaging patients from MinuteClinic to the

institution and vice versa. I think the other important point is the fact that MinuteClinic is seen as a value-added benefit
by our PBM clients, and many of those are adopting MinuteClinic programs that offer reduced, or in some cases zero,
co-pays and that too has driven utilization. So I think it's an evolving story that as we move to the future, you will see
us expand our scope of services, but we'll do that in collaboration with our care partners.
<Q - Ross J. Muken>: Great. Thanks, Larry. Maybe a quick one for Dave. You're still carrying a pretty good amount
of balance sheet capacity. You guys have done a great job of tuck-ins the last few years, Coram obviously the recent.
How would you sort of characterize the tuck-in M&A environment just in terms of activity, the number of assets out
there that potentially you could be interested? Obviously you can't talk about specifics, but I'm just trying to get a sense
for tone because it feels like in general the M&A market's gotten a little bit more active to start the year.
<A - David M. Denton>: Yes, Ross. This is Dave. I don't know that I can comment too much on that. I would just say
that as we have been very clear, is that we do generate a substantial amount of cash flow, that we're putting that cash
flow to use first in dividends and share repurchases, but just as importantly, putting that cash to use kind of on the
M&A side. I think if you look across our business, I don't think we see any holes as far as an asset complement that we
need to be successful in the marketplace. Having said that, I do think there's opportunities for us to continue to do
bolt-on acquisitions, harness the synergies, increase our scale, and continue to deliver superior service to either existing
customer base or reaching new customers. So I think again...
<Q - Ross J. Muken>: Okay. Great, thanks, Dave, and congrats, guys, on a number of great announcements.
<A - David M. Denton>: Okay. Thanks Ross.
