Phebe N. Novakovic
Thanks, Erin. I will keep my remarks relatively brief today. I think the numbers are pretty straightforward and largely
speak for themselves. Earlier today, we've reported first quarter earnings from continuing operations of $1.71 per fully
diluted share on revenue of $7.3 billion, operating earnings of $871 million and net earnings of $595 million. We beat
the analyst consensus by $0.07, and we're ahead of analyst expectations on revenue as well. We're also somewhat better
than our previous guidance and ahead of our own expectations.
I should point out that the diluted weighted average shares outstanding was 347.2 million for the quarter, 7.4 million
shares below the fourth quarter of last year. I've asked Jason Aiken to give you a little more insight into our share
repurchase activity when I conclude my remarks. Free cash flow from operations was $341 million, approximately 57%
of net income. This is typical for the first quarter. But I should add that we expect a particularly robust second quarter
from a free cash flow perspective, driven in part by advanced payments on international orders.
In many respects, the story for the quarter is about the order books, particularly in defense. We ended the quarter with a
total backlog of $56 billion, up approximately $10 billion over last quarter with particularly impressive growth in
Combat Systems backlog. Marine Systems backlog grew, and IS&T had a modest gain after adjusting for some of the
backlog in the U.K. that was transferred to Combat Systems. Interestingly, we have more funded backlog at the end of
this quarter than we have had any time in the last three years. The same is true for total backlog. We also look forward
to a strong second quarter intake, particularly in Marine Systems, with the anticipated booking of the Block IV
Virginia-class multi-year contract. The underpinnings of our defense businesses are clearly solidifying.
Compared to the first quarter 2013, revenue was down less than expected, $80 million or 1.1%. On the other hand,
operating earnings were up $24 million or 2.8%. Our operating costs and expenses were $104 million less than a year
ago quarter, leading to a 50-basis-point improvement in margins, 11.9%. This is very strong operating leverage.
Net earnings were up even more than operating earnings, 4.2% versus 2.8%, primarily due to lower tax rates. EPS was
up 5.6% over the year-ago quarter as a result of better operating earnings, lower tax rates, and lower share counts.
Let me provide some commentary and a little bit of perspective around the results of our operating segments. First,
Aerospace. Sales are up over Q1 2013 by $347 million, 19.5% and essentially flat sequentially. Earnings outpaced the
year-ago quarter by $94 million, about 30%. Compared to Q4 2013, operating earnings are up $56 million or 16%
principally due to mix shift and continuous improvement on [ph] 6 – 550 (4:18) production and completion efficiency.
This resulted in 19% margin for the group.
Again, Jet Aviation's continuing profitability made a nice contribution. Orders were not strong in the quarter, but need
to be viewed in the context of a very robust fourth quarter 2014 order book. We are off to a very good start in the
Aerospace Group.
Marine Systems, revenue was off 1.5%, $25 million, compared to the year ago quarter. The sequential story is similar
with respect to revenue. However, operating earnings were up $7 million, 4.4% against the year-ago quarter, and the
same sequentially. The real story in the quarter is the 10.4% margin rate, which is really topnotch and better than
expected. All of the shipyards performed well in the quarter. Backlog grew $837 million in the quarter, with
significantly more to come in the second quarter, as I mentioned a few minutes ago.
At Combat Systems, compared to the first quarter of 2013, sales were down $236 million or 15.2%, and earnings were
down $79 million or 36.7% on a margin of 10.3%. It is important to note, however, that these results were impacted by
a $29 million restructuring charge at ELS as a result of reductions in our Austrian operations, which were consolidated
into Spain and Switzerland. If we disregard that charge, margins would be 12.5%. Despite the restructuring charge,
ELS is expected to have operating margins around 10% for the year.
The big story here is the large international order that finally came through. Total backlog is up $10.2 billion over the
year-end number. Each of the Combat Systems businesses built backlog in the quarter. You should see steady revenue,
earnings, and margin rate performance improvements throughout the year in this group.

IS&T, the revenue in this business group is holding up well in this difficult environment. You might recall that our
guidance to you was to expect a revenue decline of 20% year-over-year. Well, it didn't happen in the first quarter.
Revenue in the quarter was off $166 million or 6.8% against the year-ago quarter. It was off 15.2% sequentially.
Operating earnings of $183 million in the quarter were only $2 million less than the year-ago quarter on a
40-basis-point improvement in margins. On a sequential basis, operating earnings were $13 million lower or 6.6% on a
70-basis-point improvement in margins; once again, exhibiting nice operating leverage. Total backlog for the group
was down $43 million from year-end, but that includes a $248 million transfer of backlog from our U.K. business to
Combat Systems. Absent that transfer, IS&T backlog actually grew. So once again, IS&T is off to a good start.
When thinking about the rest of the year, we are increasing our EPS guidance to $7.05 to $7.10 from our initial
expectation of $6.80 to $6.85. The increase assumes currently anticipated operating performance and the share count
reduction realized in the first quarter. Think about the quarterly performance as lower in the second, flat in the third
quarter, with a strong Q4 finish.
I'd now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Jason Aiken.
Jason W. Aiken
Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll take just a few minutes to review some financial items with you before we
start the question-and-answer period. Net interest expense in the quarter was $22 million versus $23 million in the first
quarter of 2013. For 2014, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $90 million. At the end of the quarter,
our balance sheet reflects a net cash position, that's cash in excess of debt, of $385 million, a decrease of $1 billion
from the end of 2013. This decrease was due in large part to our activities on the capital deployment front, which I'll
address in just a minute.
We don't have any scheduled debt repayment until January of next year, when $500 million of fixed rate notes will
mature. Our effective tax rate was 30.1% for the quarter, slightly lower than expected, primarily as a result of the
closeout of the 2012 tax year. For the full-year, we still expect our effective tax rate to fall between 30.5% and 31%.
We expect cash contributions to our pension plans for 2014 to be around $550 million to fund our obligations. The bulk
of funding is scheduled to occur in the second half of the year, specifically during the third quarter.
As an update to our capital deployment plans, I'd like to address our activities in the first quarter. As you'll recall, we
entered into an accelerated share repurchase plan in late January to repurchase 11.4 million of our shares. This
exhausted our remaining repurchase authorization and, in early February, our board authorized the repurchase of an
additional 20 million shares. Since then, we repurchased 3 million more shares during the quarter. In total, we deployed
approximately $1.7 billion on share repurchases and dividend payments in the quarter. In March, our board declared a
dividend increase of more 10%. That's the 17th consecutive annual increase. Our intent in 2014 is to return essentially
all of our free cash flow to shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet.
At the end of the first quarter, we have $4.3 billion of cash on the balance sheet and are well positioned to execute our
capital deployment strategy during the coming quarters and achieve the objectives that Phebe has articulated for 2014.
Erin, that concludes my remarks and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A.
Erin Linnihan
Thanks, Jason. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to
participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue.

[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line of Jason Gursky of Citigroup. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the call. Good morning. Just a quick question on
Gulfstream. You mentioned the bookings there being down quarter-on-quarter after a really nice finish to last year. I
was just wondering if you could remind us of the seasonality that we typically should expect with bookings at
Gulfstream, just to kind of help everybody get prepared for the rest of the year, kind of based on what you see in your
pipeline at this point. What do bookings look like on a quarter-to-quarter basis throughout the rest of the year?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So the new aircraft sales opportunities continue to look very good and we've got strong
customer interest, but we're still seeing extended negotiation periods in order to get the order closed. And what that
drives is some difficulty in being very specific and precise about the quarterly progression. So our orders have tended
to be a little lumpier, light in the first quarter, building, with a strong fourth quarter finish. That's the pattern that we've
been looking at for a while. And this year looks about the same with no material difference. But the order interest or the
activity is very, very strong, it's just when we get the closure and that's what makes it difficult for us to be real clear and
specific on quarter timing.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: And the mix that you're seeing at this point, is it still favoring the large-cabin versus the
mid-cabin?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah, so we've talked the last couple calls about understanding our mix and our order
activity and when you've got a four-year backlog on the 650s you're not likely to see – in fact, it's almost impossible to
get a one-to-one book-to-bill. So what we follow very carefully is the order activity and sign-ups for our large-cabin,
mature aircraft, the 450 and 550. And 60% of the orders in the quarter were for those two models. So again, very, very
strong, very strong for the 450 and 550.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: That's helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard of Royal Bank of Canada. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Thanks very much. Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Morning.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Phebe, just to follow up on that. I was wondering if you could comment on the pricing you're
seeing in the new and used business jet market at the moment, and also if you've seen any impact from the recent
activity over in the Ukraine and Russia?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah, so pricing is holding up nicely in the pre-owned market and looks to be stabilizing
in the large-cabin market, particularly on the 550. In the mid-cabin, we see a little bit more pricing pressure, but that is
nothing new. This is consistent with what we've seen in the past. And so far, the activities in Ukraine and Russia have
not affected our operations. Our Moscow operations are continuing and Gulfstream hasn't seen any material activity.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Great. Thanks very much.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Thanks. Good morning. Good quarter. Phebe, could you – I could go through them one by
one, but maybe the segments and your outlooks, have they been revised much? Particularly Combat and the margin if

you wanted to explicate kind of the margin guidance you're looking for as well as Aero guidance for margins and
maybe IS&T sales.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah, so we didn't give specific updates for the segment guidance and we're holding to it
at the moment. We will update it in the second quarter when we've got more clarity about where exactly the puts and
takes are across the business, but we're confident enough to have increased our overall guidance and feel very
comfortable with that. With respect – and I'll just tell you, with respect to Combat, which you asked in particular, we're
still holding to our 14% – low- to mid-14% range. And Aerospace, we're still looking at the 17% margin range. So
nothing's changed and we're very confident in both of those numbers.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Okay. And the upper IS&T sales?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: IS&T sales were stronger in the first quarter than we'd anticipated and we have good
order activity. But again, IS&T sales are pretty lumpy, driven in large measure by our healthcare business which is
highly seasonal and we usually only get about a quarter of advance notice when it comes to the customers' interest in
increasing the sales volume.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Okay. Good enough. Good quarter. Thanks.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Thanks.
Operator
Next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, Joe.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks. Good morning, Phebe. Wanted to dig into the Aerospace margin a little bit. I hear
you on maintaining the guidance for now, since it's early, but you've beat December by a couple hundred basis points,
last year, obviously Q1 was a very strong start, maybe the way to phrase this is give us a couple of reasons why we
shouldn't get too far in front of you on the Aerospace margin side.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Other than the obvious. Let me talk a little bit about the margins in the quarter versus our
budget, and they're attributable to two primary factors: lower-than-anticipated pre-owned sale and better-than-expected
G650 cost performance. So, going forward, we don't see that margin performance repeating for a whole host of reasons:
mix shift, supplier costs, timing of other expenses. So when we factor all of those into our thinking at the moment, we
don't see that kind of upside to margins over our guidance.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay, thank you.
Operator
The next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Good morning, Phebe.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, Ron.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Big picture question for you. If you stand back and observe the operating profit of the
company in the quarter, nearly what, 46% of it was from Gulfstream. So General Dynamics now looks like it's almost
half a commercial aerospace company and half a defense contractor. How do you think about that strategically and
about the positioning of the company when you think about deploying capital and those sort of things?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So we like our strategic positioning, I like that balance between aerospace and defense.
And our defense businesses, as I've pointed out and we've seen now quarter-over-quarter through the last year, are

holding up very, very nicely. With implicit growth in the Marine Group, which we don't talk a whole lot about and
doesn't get a lot of attention, but in addition to Block IV, we've got considerable revenue upside for the next several
years as we move increasingly into a higher replacement and we gear up even more on the two a year of Virginia-class
construction. So, there's some upside in our – versus our current sort of sales profile on the defense side driven
primarily by Marine Group but not exclusively. We've stabilized Combat and IS&T is continuing to hold its own. So I
like where we are with respect to our balance between our commercial aerospace and business jet market and defense.
When you think about capital deployment, clearly we need to – we will and we do make investments where we believe
we're likely to get a good return. And you'll see over the last, frankly, almost decade now, we've been heavily investing
in Gulfstream and that investment is beginning to pay off. It was very purposeful, our capital deployment strategy at
Gulfstream because we believed and history has proven us correct, that it was a business jet market and our place in
that market was a good market to invest in. So I think that the rectitude of that series of decisions many years ago that
we're continuing to follow makes an awful lot of sense. So I think, going forward, you can expect the same kinds of
behavior for us, where we see an opportunity to grow very accretively and profitably, we will.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Okay, great. Thank you very much.

Next question comes from the line of Doug Harned of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: I'm interested in the Minsheng order, which was just announced. I think it is a very
interesting situation but I'm trying to understand, the majority of the airplanes in your previous, the 2011 order, those
have still not been delivered. And I'm curious what your expectations are regarding the timing of the deliveries in this
very large order over the next several years?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So I think the underlying assumption in your – at the beginning of your question on
Minsheng, we have delivered a number of those airplanes. Going forward, we have conservatively booked that order,
the order was for 60 aircraft and another 20 options and we were conservative in our booking of those firm orders. So,
as we go forward, we like – that's a terrific business for us, Minsheng is a close partner. We have a very good
relationship with them, and we see that as steady. It'll come in episodic orders, speed orders, but so far we like where
we are.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: I'm assuming that this is something – this s really a long-term situation that's very tied to
what happens in China in terms of demand. Is that fair?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yes, it is fair, but we have a history with Minsheng that when they place an order, they
mean it. And when we declare it and we move it from estimated potential contract value into firm orders. We've got a
lot of deposits and we have a slot and a delivery profile, so that's – again, this isn't a big pop with no substance. When
we announced these orders with Minsheng, the full intention is to execute. And with all commercial exposure, right, it's
going to be driven by macroeconomic factors, but so far, there's considerable demand for these airplanes in China.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Very good. Thank you.

little how you think GD's position domestically here, both Combat and Marine on some of those core programs? You
touched upon it on the Virginia-class and the Ohio-class replacement, but maybe just how you're thinking about given
the DOD outlook.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So a couple of things. Absent a significant change in the threat environment or return to
the sort of self-destructive government behavior of across-the-board spending cuts, we believe that we have troughed,
at least in our programs – and I would point you to the strong backlog as a harbinger of our sales performance. The
majority of our programs are programs of record and as we've talked about before, they tend to fare better in a funding
constrained environment. So Combat's going forward profile is heavily dependent and tied to international orders.
We've seen those orders begin to come in. There are more out there in our pipeline, frankly, fairly robust. The
investment spending on both Army and the Marine Corps is at sustainment levels and we factored that into our plan.
And we're comfortable that those programs that we have in our plan are executable and that the funding is available.
And for Marine, I touched on the two big drivers of Ohio replacement and the Virginia-class two a year. We also see
continued interest in commercial containerships and tanker markets. So those, again, those orders for the commercial
Jones Act shipbuilding tend to be a little bit more episodic, but we still have a healthy pipeline that we are continuing to
explore with our customers.
So if I step back – and IS&T, IS&T has again largely, we believe, stabilized itself with the growth engine there being
GDIT, not surprisingly. Our ISR business is stable, with longstanding programs of record, and our networking and
communication business has downsized itself in response to the revenue decline and, again, has programs of record that
they're continuing to execute on. So across the board, I think that we're, on the defense side, very well positioned.
Again, I'd point you to our backlog.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Thank you.

The next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein, Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, Sam.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Hi. Wanted to see if you could talk a little bit more about Combat Systems, and I'm just
trying to understand a couple of things. One is an order of magnitude, in terms of the advances, benefit you expect to
get in Q2. And then trying to just think about how do you go from a 10% margin now to a 14% margin for the year?
You mentioned the ELS restructuring charge; even if you take that out, you still have to have some high-teens type of
margins and I'm not sure what drives that.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Sure. So let me talk a little bit more about the Q1 margins. I mentioned our $29 million
charge. We also have some contract mix changes across the groups that will normalize as we go through the year
quarter-over-quarter. And you will recall that we moved the specialty vehicle, the U.K. Vehicle Program, out of the
backlog in IS&T and into Combat, and that is a conservatively-booked program, given the state that it was in at the
beginning of 2013. So those are some of the margin pressures we saw in the first quarter.
With respect to going forward, I think that this group has aptly demonstrated their ability to reduce costs faster than
revenues decline. We've seen quite a bit of operating leverage from them. If you think about Combat Systems, at the
height of their revenue in I think it was 2009 kind of crowding $10 billion, we've seen a 40% decline in margins, and
yet last year we had – in revenue, last year we had 15% margins and this year we're looking at 14%. And I don't see
anything in our backlog or in our performance here to-date that would suggest that we're going to have headwinds on
margins.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. And any sense in terms of the Advanced benefit you mentioned in the second quarter?

The next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland of Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Good morning, Phebe and Jason.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi.
<A - Jason W. Aiken>: Good morning.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Quick question, Phebe, about your comment on the 650. You noted you had better cost
performance there in the quarter. I wondered if you might give us some color on whether that was recurring or
non-recurring in nature. How should we think about the implications there for the learning curve relative to your prior
comment?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So we're continuing to come down that learning curve and our 650 margin performance
on both the green airplanes and outfitted airplanes is improving quarter-over-quarter. So very nice operating
performance on the 650, and we expect that to continue. Certainly, we're going to – the learning curve will flatten out
as we go forward, but so far we expect to see additional margin improvement on both green and outfitted airplanes.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: But there wasn't anything in the quarter specifically that benefited the program?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: No, no, these are repeatable.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: That part of our margins are repeatable.

The next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Phebe, if we could just dig into IS&T a little bit more, obviously you did outperform the
expectations and the guidance here in the quarter. How much of that is – it sounds like you think that's potentially
sustainable, or is it just that the Army pressure is somewhat delayed and maybe not even fully a 2014 event? And I
guess I'm speaking more to the C4 side.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So C4 saw the largest decline in the quarter, in line with our plan, and as you will recall,
we talked quite a bit at the end of last year and the beginning of this year about our attempt to de-risk our Army
exposure. C4 has done that. So what we see right now going forward for C4 is they've got almost everything in – or all
their revenue in their backlog. So I think that they can see some stability from a revenue perspective based on our series
– our expectations going forward. And again, their programs of record, particularly WIN-T, are really doing quite
nicely. Each one of those businesses had a book-to-bill of 0.9 or greater. So that also tells me that there's good support
for our products. So they've got – C4 also, let's recall, has exposure to the U.K., and Canada, and fairly robust exposure
in both markets. So that helps offset some of the uncertainty we've had in the past about Army spending.

<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: So the 33% reduction in sales you talked about in January, is that off the table, or are you
simply saying you're absorbing it well enough with strength elsewhere?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah, I thought I gave you around a 20% decline.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Well, 20% overall for the unit, right?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah, yeah, so for – it's too soon for us to walk back from that decline. We had a good
first quarter, a good book-to-bill. But I don't want to get out ahead of that because, as I mentioned earlier, one of the big
drivers, in fact the largest driver in IS&T revenue is going to be our healthcare business and that is very, very seasonal
and we usually, or what our experience has been over the last year and a half, we only get a quarter worth of, notice or
warning that we're going to have to up our activity.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Right, right. Well, maybe another way to ask the same question is: was the President's
budget with the draw-down in Army down to the mid-400,000 level, is that already contemplated in your guidance?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yes.

The next question comes from Cai von Rumohr of Cowen & Co. Please go ahead.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes. Thanks so much, Phebe. So, if we could maybe get a little more color to help us
reconcile the downtick in margins at Gulfstream from 19% to, like, 17% plus, 17.6% for the year. I mean, if, in fact,
you're doing well on the G650 with more learning curve improvement to come, I would think that would be a margin
plus as we move forward. And you also mentioned used biz jet sales being weak. I mean if they're higher, I mean, I
assume they're not hugely loss leaders and the volume looked so good in that quarter. I still have a little trouble
understanding how your guide for the year isn't quite a bit low.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So the pre-owned, and I – let me give you a little bit more color on this. The pre-owned
sales activity it was lower in the quarter than we had anticipated, but we still expect to take pre-owned in the remainder
of the year. That obviously has a – is margin headwind. We've also going to have some mix shift that we're
anticipating, timing of some other expenses, and we've got supplier costs that we are factoring into our thinking. So it is
650 performance continues to be good. But as we go to produce more mid-cabins, we're going to see a – those are
lower margins, particularly on both of those 280 and the 150, and that provides – that causes some headwind in margin
activity. So it's really the mix shift, supplier costs, and timing, that make us properly cautious about the margin
expectations for the year.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Okay. But it looks like your guide, I mean, as I take it, of large-cabin deliveries, you did 25
and aren't we looking for something like 118 for the year? And so while yes, we do have an uptick coming in terms of
the mid-size, you also have it on the larger planes in the mid-size, are considerably less revenue. So I guess I'm still – is
it something a jet or services, that is changing the mix? Because the things you explained just on the surface, the mix
doesn't look like it's that much worse.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So our – the 450 is a lower-margin airplane than the 550. In fact, the 650 margins have
now exceeded the 450 margins, largely because of the supplier costs that we've talked about before and those increases

in supplier costs hit the 450 pretty robustly. So the service activity we anticipate, continue a good strong level of
service activity, very, very strong in the quarter. And going forward, jet continues to be profitable. So I really go back
to our mix shift on 450s and mid-cabin, higher pre-owned, our supplier costs, and then the timing of just some other
expenses. So it really is premature for us to get out there and project. I don't see it at the moment. 19% or 18% margins.
Doesn't mean we also...
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: So your estimation is basically that within the large-cabin, the mix is shifting pretty sharply
toward the 450, which is the lower-margin product?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Right. Well, not pretty sharply, but it is shifting.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Okay.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: And those margins have been compressed for the reasons we talked about.

The next question comes from the line of David Strauss of UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Good morning, Phebe.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, David.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Wanted to ask about the balance sheet. Even with the big quarter in terms of share repo, you
sit in a net cash position, I know you committed to returning 100% of free cash flow this year but would still be in a net
cash position, could you just talk about thoughts on the balance sheet, any kind of leverage levels you're thinking about
or just utilizing – looking to utilize the balance sheet a little bit more. Thanks.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Let me give you the sort of overarching view and then I'll let Jason give you some more
color. But, we use our balance sheet when we believe that there's an appropriate opportunity to make accretive
investments. We have sufficient cash flow for this year to support the kind of share repurchases and dividends that we
anticipate. So I, frankly, like where we are. We like our credit rating. We want to retain it. We don't see any reason to
leverage the balance sheet to get a quick pop in share repurchases that aren't necessarily repeatable in the next year; this
is too much of your future flexibility. It's not where we want to be.
<A - Jason W. Aiken>: Yeah and just to add to that. Maybe I think in the quarter you saw that we did essentially "use
the balance sheet to the tune of $1 billion", that was really to the effect of the ASR and fulfilling the commitments that
we made last year to return free cash flow to shareholders. So that was, in effect, our use of the balance sheet, if you
will, for this year. And as Phebe articulated, the plan, at this point, we've got sufficient free cash flow forecasted and
plan to return that to shareholders through dividend and share repurchase.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Thank you.

The next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, George.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Phebe, since you're not changing any guidance at this point on the sectors, is it fair to
assume that the increase in your EPS is coming primarily from the share buyback because you historically don't ever
factor that into your guidance?

<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: It comes from three things; maintaining the – or at least anticipating the EPS based on our
current share count. We see operating improvements that are driving about half of our current increase in our estimate
on EPS, and – but we are not in a position to parse those operating improvements with any detail among the four units.
That's why I think I'm far more comfortable in giving you that kind of color on the second quarter when we've got more
clarity about where we've been through the half of the year and how the rest of the year shapes up.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. And one follow up, the 650, it's been lots of discussion in the papers that used planes
are commanding like a $10 million premium to what you're selling them for. I mean what's your plan as far as
increasing the rate on that 650?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: You mean the – what do you mean, the production rate?
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Production rate. Yeah, increasing the production rate given that demand seems to be so
strong.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So we want to – as you know, our past behavior will influence us going forward. We raise
our production rates when we're confident that we can execute the – efficiently, green deliveries – and profitably, green
deliveries and outfitting. You will recall on the 650 we spent the majority of last year working through the – what we
call the disequilibrium on the retrofits so we're mindful that we had a pretty steep hill to climb that we effectively put
behind us. But it seems to me a bit, I guess, imprudent, to get out there and begin to pump up the production rate until
we've gotten more experience on a quarter-by-quarter basis on both the green deliveries and outfitting. So we're
properly balanced at the moment. We'll consider increases in rates. We do that at the end of every year, and then that's
how we set our guidance for you in the following year.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay, thanks very much.

The next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel of Jefferies.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Phebe, I think last year, you might have termed 2013 as a back-to-basics year.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yes.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: And so what's 2014 going to be about?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: More back-to-basics. I don't think you can ever get away from the absolute requirement to
improve your operating performance, quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year. You're never good enough. You're never
done. So that is going to be a strategic focus and tactical execution of this management team going forward. In
addition, we are – I think it's been clear from our behavior, heretofore, in the year that we anticipate the deployment of
all – most if not all of our free cash flow in dividends and share purchases. So that is something we were not able to
accomplish last year that we will, so increased focus on the shareholder-friendly cash deployment and more blocking
and tackling on operations, return on invested capital, expanding margins and managing for cash. It's just never done.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Just to follow up on that and I agree that makes a lot of sense. But somewhere in here you
need to make sure that there is the right investment for the future of each of the businesses. So you don't want to
harvest too much to – and you clearly talk about whether it's Jones Act ships or Ohio-class or this new opportunity
internationally. But could you give us a couple of other examples where in a couple of the other business units we're
seeing new product that is also going to provide some of this basic or organic growth?

<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah. So you quite rightly point out that in the Marine Group, we have organic growth
potential. And therefore, as you would expect, we have invested in the Marine Group, largely in infrastructure and
capital structure, since those are capital-intensive businesses. In Combat, what we have – really, our raison d'etre of the
last year and for this year as well is to size that business accordingly. But we make investments as we go along in those
lines of business where we see a profitable return. So I think you can see that in our expectations on ELS. We've
invested fairly significant investments in restructuring. Why? To make that business more competitive. And we're
beginning to see the fruits of that labor.
That's also true in the U.K. We've had significant restructuring charges in the U.K. that make us more competitive and
position ourselves for, again, organic growth, and that's in the IS&T business. Our Intel and ISR business, we continue
to invest in appropriate with the returns we expect in the market. Our IT services business is a low-investment business
by definition. So I don't really see an organic requirement to invest in the IS&T business. In C4, we invest
appropriately, in Canada and the U.K and right-size the business in the United States for the demand.

The next question comes from the line of John Godyn, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - John D. Godyn>: Hey. Thank you for taking my question. We've heard a lot of questions on the Aerospace
segment, but I wanted to ask one more. Phebe, last quarter you mentioned that there would be a dramatic rise in fourth
quarter margins as you thought about the cadence throughout the year. Just given with the performance in the first
quarter and what we've heard about your guidance for the full year, I'm not sure if that is still valid.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: I think – I will anticipate I think where he was headed in this question. We pulled some of
the margin performance into the first quarter so I expect the fourth quarter to be lighter than first quarter. That is
different than we had anticipated when we gave the guidance, which was light in the first quarter and then building
with a strong fourth quarter. We still expect a strong fourth quarter but not at the same level, for all the reasons that
we've articulated this morning
<Q - John D. Godyn>: And perhaps the more important kind of take-away from this is, I think that had given some
investors confidence that as we thought about 2015, the exit rate was robust and we'd be set up for continued margin
expansion in Aerospace. Is that framework still right?
<A - Erin Linnihan>: They can also hear, I'm here. Must have logged out. Can you go tell Brian that we logged out?

<Q - John D. Godyn>: Hi, this is John, can you hear me?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yes, it's a good thing that our communications products are more reliable than this thing.
Who knows what happened.
<Q - John D. Godyn>: Glad to have you back.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: I apologize.
<Q - John D. Godyn>: What I'd asked was, I think the comment about fourth quarter seeing a ramp had given some
confidence on continued margin expansion in Aerospace in 2015. Is that still the right framework to use today with the
new guidance?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So I think as we think about 2015, it's obviously too soon to tell and we will – there are a
lot of factors that will emerge over the course of the year that will influence and inform our margin guidance, but we
anticipate that aerospace will continue to have very strong margin performance, both at Gulfstream, both this year and
– but equally important in 2015 at Gulfstream as the 650 continues to come down its learning curve, and also at Jet
Aviation, which is increasingly profitable. So nice performance at Jet and their position to increase their order book,
they solved their operating challenges, and so I expect more upside and margin ignition from Jet.

The next come question comes from Pete Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.
<Q - Pete J. Skibitski>: Yes. Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi.
<Q - Pete J. Skibitski>: I just want to ask one more on Marine and maybe a follow up. Phebe, it looks like Marine
repair, that business has been a real great growth driver for you over the last four or five years. I know you've done
some deals there but I'm just wondering with the Navy fleet staying at a pretty low level and being kind of tasked
increasingly around the world, is repair kind of an ongoing growth story for you from that perspective?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah, so I think somebody asked it, so I know somebody asked a question earlier about
investments. This was a place where we made an investment. I was EVP of the Marine Group and I felt very strongly at
the time that we needed to expand our repair footprint and we did that so that we're now bi-coastal. In fact, we are
heavily represented in four of the five Navy home ports, and we did that purposely with the expectation that as the fleet
ages, repair work will increase. I frankly like repair work in general. It's steady. It's fairly predictable performance and
very predictable performance if you know what you're doing and we do. So it's been a nice – on the surface side, it's
been a nice growth engine for us. We also just recently won up in the Pacific Northwest a very large repair contract for
CBMs, so that again expands our footprint bi-coastally.
On the submarine side, submarine repair work tends to come from two sources , one, excess workflow from the public
yards and, second, emergent demand as the fleet experiences issues while undersea. So in both of those instances,
we've seen fairly lumpy, but when we get it, pretty profitable submarine repair work.

<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Your assumption is quite correct that we've liked those investments and the return on
those investments that we made in the surface repair business.
<Q - Pete J. Skibitski>: Got it. Thank you. And just one follow up on Marine. I'm just wondering as you ramp in
commercial volumes, you guys have won a lot of order there, if there's going to be any negative impact to Marine
margin. And then a similar issue on Marine margin – or similar question about this recent Virginia submarine payload
module issue, if that would be any impact to marginal rate.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So the – for very high-performing shipyards, which our shipyards are, margins change
quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year, almost entirely based on mix. So you would expect that when we get increase –
get a new order, we're going to see some margin compression. As we come down our learning curve, you'll see margins
expand. That's true on both the Naval shipbuilding side as well as the commercial shipbuilding side. So NASSCO has
had very, very good margin performance on both its Navy and commercial shipbuilding work revenue, largely driven
by just performance improvement quarter-over-quarter, day-after-day.
The payload issue, we don't anticipate any margin compression on the issue that has come up with the North Dakota.
We've discovered that in concert with our Navy customer and are addressing the requirements to do a complete
inspection. So no real – I mean it was a surprise, and unfortunate, but we are – the Navy's got that with us well under
control and it's – frankly, it's a supplier issue and we will address it.
<Q - Pete J. Skibitski>: Got it. Very helpful. Thank you.
