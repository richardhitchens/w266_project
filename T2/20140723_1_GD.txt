Good morning. I am pleased to report that we had a very strong quarter at General Dynamics with revenues of $7.47
billion and income from continuing operations of $646 million. We reported EPS from continuing operations of $1.88
per diluted share, $0.07 ahead of the year ago quarter, and $0.11 per share better than consensus. While revenue was
$360 million lower, 4.6%, than the year ago quarter, income from continuing operations was $6 million higher on the
strength of 12.7% operating margins, a 40-basis point improvement.
Sequentially, revenue was up $209 million, and earnings from continuing operations were up $50 million on a 70-basis
point improvement in operating margins. You will note in this quarter that we took $105 million after-tax charge in
discontinued operations for the planned sale of our Axle business.
Let me turn briefly to the first half of 2014. Revenues were down modestly 2.7% against 2013. However, earnings from
continuing operations were up over 2.6%, and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were up $0.17, or
5%. In short, we are off to a good start, ahead of our internal plan and ahead of external expectations, leading to an
improved outlook for the year.
With respect to cash, we had $791 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter, about 122% of net income
from continuing operations. We had $1.132 billion for the first half, 91% of income from continuing operations. And
we fully expect a very strong third quarter.
With respect to share repurchases, in the quarter, we repurchased slightly less than 10.7 million shares for
approximately $1.2 billion. We have purchased somewhat in excess of 25 million shares in the first half; however, do
not expect share repurchase activity at this level in the second half of the year. We front-end loaded the share
repurchase program. We will be in the market but at a more moderate pace.
An important part of the story in the quarter, and for that matter, in the previous quarter as well, was a substantial
intake of orders resulting in significant increases to backlog. We ended the quarter with a total backlog of $71.1 billion,
up from $55.9 billion at the end of the last quarter. Most of the growth occurred in the Marine group, with the award of
the Block IV of the Virginia-class submarines. The IS&T group also enjoyed a $468 million increase in total backlog.
You may recall that the story in the first quarter was the tremendous growth in backlog in Combat Systems. In short,
the company's backlog and total potential contract value is at its highest point in the last four years. This provides the
solid bedrock upon which growth will be built.
Let me give you some perspective on the segment reporting for the quarter and for the half. I'll then conclude with
some comments on the outlook for each segment for the remainder of the year and give you our updated EPS guidance
for 2014. First, Aerospace. Aerospace had a good quarter, with modestly lower revenue, 2.8%, on mix shift, timing of
deliveries and absence of pre-owned sales. However, stronger than anticipated margins at 19.2%, 30 basis points better
than the year ago quarter, kept operating earnings down only $5 million or 1.3%.
Let me provide you with some complexion on the quarter. Gulfstream enjoined continued improvement in 650 [G650]
green manufacturing and completion margins that more than offset continued mix shift. Jet Aviation again, made a
good contribution with double-digit operating margins. For the first half of 2014, Aerospace revenues were up $289
million, or 7.5%. Operating earnings were up $89 million, 12.7%, a further manifestation of Jet Aviation's contribution
and the continued performance improvement at Gulfstream. This is all reflected in a 90-basis point improvement in
operating margins for the first half of the year versus the first half of 2013. All in all, a really superb first half with a
very nice order take in the second quarter. There was particularly strong interest in the G550 in the quarter.
Combat Systems, once again, demonstrated disciplined performance, reporting 15% margin on revenue, only 0.5% less
than a year ago, resulting in modest increase in operating earnings over the year ago quarter. Our domestic businesses
had particularly strong margins on cost reduction initiatives and program performance. ELS, which had been impacted
in the first quarter by additional restructuring charges, returned to profitability with double-digit operating margin that
we expect to improve on an accelerating basis through the remainder of the year. All in all, a strong performance in a
tough market environment.

For the first half, revenues are off 7.2% against the first half of 2013. Operating earnings are down 16.5%, principally
as a result of the restructuring charge at ELS in Q1. However, we expect operating earnings to be very strong in the
second half. More on that subject when I provide guidance.
Marine group revenues were higher than in Q2 2013 by $92 million, 5.2%; but operating earnings and operating
margins were down 2.2% and 70 basis points, respectively, entirely as a result of mix shift in the quarter. Nevertheless,
both revenues and operating earnings were up nicely on a sequential basis. For the first half, Marine group revenues
were up $67 million, or 2%; and operating earnings are up $3 million, almost 1%, on slightly lower margins. Margins
were still a very respectable 9.8% for the first half.
IS&T. IS&T is the place where we expect a tremendous revenue pressure for the year. You may recall that our initial
guidance was a 20% decline in revenue year-over-year. Fortunately, we are doing somewhat better than expected.
Revenue was off by $387 million, or 15.2%, compared to the prior year's second quarter and also down somewhat
sequentially. On the other hand, operating earnings were down only $10 million, or 5.1%, a 90-basis point
improvement in operating margins. The story for the first half is even better. Revenues were down $553 million,
11.1%, but operating earnings were down only $12 million, 3.1%, on improved margins. This was very good operating
leverage.
Let me provide you some guidance for the year for each segment, compare this guidance to what we told you in
January, and then wrap it up with our EPS guidance for the year. For Aerospace, our guidance to you in January was to
expect revenue of approximately $9 billion, and operating margins around 17%. We now believe revenue will be off
that figure by about $250 million, the largest single driver of which is lower-than-anticipated pre-owned activity. On
the other hand, margins are expected to be about 18% for the year, resulting in higher-than-anticipated operating
earnings. The 18% margin guidance for the year implies some pressure on margins in the second half, largely due to
mix shift and increased R&D spending.
For Combat Systems, our previous guidance was to expect revenues to be off on unadjusted 2013 revenue by 4% to
4.5%, with margins around 14%. We now expect revenue to be off 2.8% from adjusted 2013 revenue or about $5.7
billion. Margins will be higher, around 15%, resulting in higher-than-predicted operating earnings.
In Marine Systems, we previously guided to revenue growth of 2.5% and a margin rate in the 9.5% range. We now
expect revenue growth over 2013 of 4.5% and a margin rate of about 20 basis points better than previously forecast,
once again resulting in higher operating earnings.
For IS&T, we previously guided to a revenue decline of 20% and a margin rate of 8.2%. It now appears that revenue
will be down 15% and the margin rate should be about the same as our previous guidance. Once again, this will result
in higher than previously expected operating earnings for the year.
In summary, all this rolls into revenue for the year around $30.2 billion, an operating margin of 12.5%, and a return on
sales from continuing operations of 8.5%. So higher than previously anticipated operating earnings, a somewhat lower
tax rate, and a lower share count permit us to increase our EPS guidance for continuing operations to between $7.40
and $7.45.
The progression through the remainder of the year is that the third quarter will look a lot like the second quarter, with a
very strong fourth quarter to finish.
I'd now like to turn the mic over to Jason Aiken, to give you additional detail.
Jason W. Aiken
Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'll touch on just a few miscellaneous financial items before the
question-and-answer period. As Phebe mentioned, the results for the quarter include a charge of $105 million in
discontinued operations. In the quarter, we engaged in a plan to sell the Axle business in our Combat Systems group.
This action requires that we assess whether the price we expect to receive for this business is sufficient to cover the

carrying value of its net assets, including an allocation of goodwill. This assessment resulted in the charge you see in
the quarter in discontinued operations. The estimate will be trued up when the sale is completed, which we expect to
occur by the end of the year.
Net interest expense in the quarter was $24 million versus $18 million in the second quarter of 2013. We had additional
interest income in 2013 that reduced the net interest expense in that period, and for 2014, we expect interest expense to
be approximately $90 million. At the end of the quarter, we're in a net debt position, that's debt in excess of cash, of
$69 million. This reflects a $450 million swing from a net cash position in the prior quarter due to our activities on the
capital deployment front, which I'll address in just a minute.
As a reminder, we have $500 million of notes maturing in January of next year, and we'll make a decision as we get
closer to the end of this year as to whether to repay or refinance those notes. Our effective tax rate was 30.2% for the
quarter, slightly lower than expected as a result of higher international earnings which carry a lower tax rate. Based on
our experience so far this year and the growing impact of international earnings, we're now expecting the full-year
effective tax rate to be at the low end of our previous guidance of 30.5% to 31%.
We continue to expect cash contributions to our pension plans for 2014 to be around $550 million. As a reminder, most
of that funding is scheduled to occur in the third quarter of the year. With respect to capital deployment in the quarter,
we continued our commitment to deploy capital to our shareholders while maintaining a strong balance sheet. Phebe
gave you the details of our share repurchases a few minutes ago. And in total, we expended almost $1.5 billion on share
repurchases and dividend payments in the quarter. And over the past 18 months, we've returned over 115% of our free
cash flow to our shareholders.
At the end of the second quarter, we have $3.8 billion of cash on the balance sheet and are well-positioned to continue
to execute our strategy and achieve the objectives that Phebe has articulated for 2014.
Erin, that concludes my remarks, and I'll turn it back over to you for the Q&A.

Q&A

[Operator Instructions] Please stand by for your first question. And your first question comes from the line of Robert
Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Good morning, Rob.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Wanted to ask you, Phebe, on the Aerospace, you've done so well with the margins here,
and you're guiding down a little bit on mix and R&D, I think, in the second half of the year. But given that you've
traditionally level loaded your R&D, even if you should come out with a new program in the fall, might we expect that
this guidance continues to be a bit conservative, especially with continued improvement at Jet?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Let me walk you through that a bit. As you quite rightly point out, we anticipate seeing
some margin compression from mix shift and higher R&D, and that's net R&D because we do not anticipate the same
level of launch assistance. So that is – we level load our R&D, but launch assistance drives some variability.

<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Okay.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: And we have fewer Jet contributions going forward. But I think it's a good opportunity to
spend a moment on Aerospace margins a bit, and to give you a little additional color on what drives the variability
quarter over quarter in these lines of business. The fundamental principle that I think we have to keep in mind is the
underlying operating performance at each of these businesses is getting better quarter over quarter. And if it weren't, I'd
tell you.
So what does that mean? Well, this means that there are other factors in these very complex businesses that impact
margins, none of which is necessarily material, but in combination, they can have some impact on a quarter-by-quarter
basis. We've got mix shift between large-cabin and mid-cabin and service mix, also on volume by the way. And it
depends on the kind of service volume. The more complex service work you get, the higher margins you carry.
And for Gulfstream – and this is true both at Gulfstream and Jet. For Gulfstream as an OEM, the more parts that they
sell out of warranty, the higher the margin. So there is even within the inter-service business some various margin
variability. With respect to Jet Aviation, you get margins that are, quarter over quarter, somewhat driven by where we
are in contracts. Think about Jet as a construction contract and what they do, particularly with respect to completions.
With newer contracts, we start off with a lower margin and then build as we come down our learning curve. So, again,
that drives some variability.
Sales expenses at both businesses change and, as I noted, launch assistance is lumpy. And of course, as you all well
know, pre-owned is almost always a zero-margin business. So I think taking – I thought it was worth just spending a
little bit of time talking about why it is that we see some variability. I emphasize, again, though, that the operating – the
fundamental operating performance remains improving quarter over quarter. So I hope that helps.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Phebe. No, that's very helpful. I wanted to ask if also with the 650, are we at the point
where that's margin-accretive? And you mentioned better order flow there, obviously, you've been sold out for a long
time. Is the order renewal or the, what I would consider, new momentum, maybe it's not, is this a function of a change
in the end market or is it because the other guy is now probably fairly sold out so availability is no longer a
differentiator?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Well, availability is a differentiator to the extent that you actually have product. I think
the way to think about – you had a couple questions here, but let me answer your last one first – I think the way to think
about 650 demand is that we continue to see demand in that – for that airplane, new demand. And we have added, not
in large quantities as you would expect when there's a four-year wait, but we have added almost every single quarter
650 orders. So that continues. There's a lot of interest in that business. And by the way, as we work through – on that
line of business and that airplane, as we work through the backlog, we have accelerated the availability dates by about
two quarters. So that's a benefit to our customers as well.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: So that's higher rate?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: It's a higher rate. And you would expect that as we have come down our learning curve
and as we continue to move green airplanes through the manufacturing line and then into the completion centers. With
respect to margins, I believe that I – 650 margins, I believe that I told you – I told the Street maybe last quarter that we
have exceeded the 450 [G450] and are working our way up to the 550 [G550] but that's probably several quarters away.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Thank you very much.

<Q - David E. Strauss>: Phebe, on IS&T, you did revise the revenue guidance of now down 15%, but still calls for a
pretty significant – a larger decline in the second half of the year. Can you just talk about what's driving that? And then
on Combat margins, it looks, if I got it right, the 15% margin guidance looks like it's implying a pretty big pickup in the
back half of the year. If you could just comment on that as well. Thanks.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah, so let me address your last question first. I told you all in the first quarter that
Combat margins would significantly and quickly recover and they did, and they will even more. I mentioned in my
remarks that we took a $29 million restructuring charge in Q1 at ELS. And with that behind them, that business hit
10% margins this quarter, and it – we expect them to continue to improve over the course of the year, and both of our
businesses continue their strong performance. So it's pretty much in line with what we had anticipated going forward,
they're just doing better than we had thought, and that's why we're raising our margin guidance for the year.
With respect to sales on IS&T, we had believed that the front end would be – the first half of the year would be
somewhat front-loaded, and it does imply some sales slowdown in the second half, and that's consistent with what we
had anticipated. We were pleased that the sales decline was less intense than we had thought. And by the way, that was
across an entire spectrum of the businesses at both our IT business and our intel business and comms business. So that
was a nice sales performance in the first half.
And then some of the decline in sales that we anticipated, I think I told you guys before that this was – we were risk
adjusting our plan for Army exposure, and that has happened. But I would note that some of those, we're seeing
indications that some of those lines of business are beginning to stabilize. For example, in our tactical ISR, comms,
computing, modeling and simulation are all – we took our declines, but they're holding up pretty well. IT services work
for the Army is also holding up nicely.
What continues to be a weakness and a weakness that there isn't a whole lot that we can do anything about is in the
sustainment and repair business. The Army is taking all their work into the public depots, so as a result, we're doing
almost nothing for the Army in that line. So I think that addresses both of your questions.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Great. Thank you.

Your next call comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please proceed.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Phebe, two quick questions. Mix was worse in Q2 than Q1 but the margin was a little
higher in Q2 versus Q1 in Aero, so I – just wondering what your explanation for that was. And then the other one is, I
assume the book-to-bill would have been above 1 time if I took out the fact that it was probably below 1 time for the
650. And you're still expecting 118 large deliveries for the year. Thanks.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Okay. Let me – I had a little trouble following the puts and takes on the first part of your
question, but let me address the orders because I think that's kind of what you were getting at a little bit. We had a
book-to-bill of about 9 times, and it was really a good, good, strong order quarter for us. We had said that what we're
seeing is a lot of interest in the pipeline, it's just taking longer to close. And so we found that we have some variability
in our order intakes quarter over quarter and that's what has happened this quarter, a lot of those orders came to fruition.
So it was a nice quarter.
By the way, I've been tracking for you all, the 450 and 550, which is where we look for the – where we would like to
see in the moment the order activity. And once again, for 450 and 550, they were 75% of the order book. The 280
[G280] was also strong. With respect to our green deliveries, we set a target every year that is – it's a plan around how
many green deliveries that we intend to have in the quarter or in the year. And it's primarily driven by a whole host of

factors. We have frequently taken it upon ourselves to sometime to re-phase those deliveries. So you noted that we had
slightly fewer deliveries in the second quarter than the first quarter but that we were – we anticipate upticks in
particularly the large cabin orders in the deliveries in the second half of the year.
So all of that is meant to say that some of the timing – some of the deliveries on green has been a question of timing,
and we've re-phased that. So I think we're looking, at the moment, which could change, at about 116 large deliveries
versus 118 large deliveries, and again, simply driven by timing. You'd be surprised how frequently customers ask for
slipping the green delivery or the completions delivery into the second quarter – or into the next quarter, subsequent
quarter or the subsequent year, so again, it's nothing but timing.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. And on the first quarter, what I was getting at was you had 29 large deliveries and 6
mid-size deliveries versus this quarter, 26 deliveries and 7 deliveries, so I figured the mix was worse this quarter, yet
the margin this quarter was 19.2% versus 19% in the first quarter. So you kind of overcame the mix maybe because of
650 productivity...
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: You got it.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: That's it. Improvement on the 650 and also on the 280. But you got it, 650 did very well.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. So why won't that continue in the second half?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Well, because of all of the reasons I've just explained. We've got some mix shift among
those three kinds of categories, large-cabin, mid-cabin and service, and we've got higher R&D, and Jets contribution,
while good, is going to be less. So those three factors are a compression on margins.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. Thanks very much, Phebe. Good numbers.

Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes. Good quarter, Phebe.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Thank you, Cai.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Could we shift to NASSCO? Maybe tell us a little bit about the commercial shipbuilding
business, how it's doing and the prospect you have for new orders.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: For a number of years we talked about the impending return of the Jones Act market, and
it came. And since that market has picked up, we have contracted for 10 Jones Act ships. It remains a very attractive
market to us, and the pipeline remains fairly robust. And we are constantly in communication and dialogue negotiations
with potential customers. It's a good market. It's a price competitive market, as you might imagine.
But I would note that this is not a place – not a market in which we compete solely on price and are willing to use price
as a differentiator. It just puts too much risk in our profitability. So we're in the midst right now of ramping up a
number of our new commercial orders, and that has some – you didn't ask this question but it's implied – margin
compression in the group. But again, that's simply a question of moving from MLP – mature MLP and coming up the
learning curve – or down the learning curve on commercial. So it's a nice market. It fills out NASSCO workloads very,
very well. We've learned to build these ships efficiently. So it's – I like it.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Given that basically you're building essentially the same ship, should we expect the margins
there to improve so this becomes a mix plus as opposed to currently a mix negative?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Over time, absolutely, but you'd expect that from those shipyards, right?

<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: By the way, these are not exactly the same ships, so don't think about it as a serial
production on exactly the same specs. So there are differences. But that said, this yard will perform – will have better

Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Joe? Hello, Joe.
Operator
Joe, your line is now open, Joe.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hey.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Phebe, on the AxleTech divestiture, this is, I think, one of the first portfolio decisions you've
made after you mentioned last year you were overhauling the M&A procedures internally. I was wondering if you
could comment on the process you went through in deciding to divest. Why you're doing it and whether you're looking
at further divestitures, if this sort of opens the gates to a little more portfolio activity?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Sure. Just to give you a little bit of retrospective, AxleTech was for us, for many years, a
very, very good business, as we were the merchant supplier for almost all of the variants of MRAP. We made a lot of
money on that acquisition years ago. As the war wound down and the government decided not to initiate a program to
repair or retrofit MRAPs, the fundamentals of that Axle market changed dramatically. And now, the – what we see is –
think about it this way, a complete inversion of the demand curve on commercial with the demand curve of defense
work. So that told us that – and we believe, by the way, that's a systemic change. So that told us that the value
proposition really no longer obtained, for us, and that we believed, and I still do, that a commercial-facing owner could
be a better steward of the company.
So I think you can expect us to respond to the market when we believe that there've been systemic changes and reacting
according to our shareholders' best interests. We have done a number of little pruning through more like very small
lines of business, really limited in products, just as again, we see changes in the market. But when we put together ATP
and OTS, we did a strategic analysis of every single one of our lines of business and what was core and where we
thought that we could add value, and this was one of those businesses that we felt could do better with a different
parent and a different home.
So I think you would expect us to react to our market. I don't see any major divestitures on the horizon. We've tinkered
within the IS&T portfolio, but nothing that changes the nature of that portfolio. So these will be opportunistic as we
proceed and we make these decisions fairly deliberatively, and we have a very disciplined process for executing the
sale. So I think this was a wise move and is good for all involved.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: No, that's helpful. Can you provide us with the expected level of proceeds from the
divestiture?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Well, not yet. Everybody who is a prospective buyer would be listening, so we will
disclose how we do after we finish the transaction. Fair enough?
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Got it. Okay. Yes. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Stanford Bernstein. Please proceed.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, Doug.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: Hi. I – you're in a position at Gulfstream now where you've got G650, unique position in the
market, you said that the 550 has strong interest, yet right now, you're at the lowest level of backlog in aerospace in
more than five years. And I'm just trying to understand how to fit that level of backlog with the program strengths you
have.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So, Doug, I've tried to articulate this before. Think about our backlog as driven primarily
by and predominantly by the 650 order book that we took in five years or six years ago. That backlog provided for five
years or six years of sales activity on the 650. We are drawing that down, and I think that's indicative, as you would
expect and totally wholesome, and I believe that that's an implied from the acceleration in the availability times by
about two quarters, which I just told – we just discussed a few minutes ago. So we had a book-to-bill of 0.9 time. I
don't worry about the level of the backlog, given the duration of that large program. I think it's very wholesome.
There's nothing that we see in the order activity us causes us concern. Our pipeline is very robust. It's robust on the 650
as well. I think the customers and potential customers will be happy that they don't have to wait for quite such a long
time for their airplanes. So I don't worry about this. This is not some harbinger of a market issue, at least with respect to
us, that I think you need to be worried about or our shareholders need to be worried about.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: Well, do you see a point here as you start to – as you increase that availability take rate up,
should we expect the backlog to eventually turn up the other way as you start to increase rate, or is this something
where you see this kind of level as sort of the right level going forward?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Well, look, it will all depend on a number of factors, right, including how we think about
new airplanes that we may bring into the market. So the right level of backlog is the backlog that you can – that
sustains reasonable sales growth and allows us to continue to be a very profitable company. And I think that we've got
that now, and I don't see any sign that that's going to be particularly troubling. I don't have a target backlog. That ebbs
and flows.
The 650 was such a large order that you have to think about it more like some of the big ship orders. It was big and it
was binary. That's unusual in the business jet aviation market, right. So it has perturbated that backlog. But if you look
prior to the 650 announcement, our backlog was pretty consistent, driven by the economic environment. And as we've
added more airplane models, we've increased that backlog, and then the 650 just changed the nature of that backlog. So
I think we've all gotten used to seeing it, but it was an anomaly. Because rarely do you ever see, I don't think ever has
anybody ever seen, that kind of big and binary change, more like the ships, right.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: No, I understand. It's just that when I look at the numbers today and you think of sort of
backlog to revenues, the numbers are actually even lower today than they were prior to the 650 launch in terms of that
ratio. So I just wanted to understand if you saw an issue there, but it sounds like you're seeing things as pretty much
where you want them to be in terms of demand.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yes, and absolutely. And let me just also say that I think the entire industry right around
the run-up to the Great Recession, the market was unhealthily overheated. So I look to see – I look at backlog to ensure
that we have enough in our order book to sustain a growth in sales and a growth in profitability. I'm very comfortable
where we are now, and I see no signs in our market that it's super heated or that we experience any particular anomaly
or something that we should be concerned. That's why I've been reporting to you all where we are – where we look
every quarter in our backlog as the 450, 550 orders because you can't add materially to the 650. That dynamic, with
respect to the 650, will change as we shorten the availability times, right.

<Q - Doug S. Harned>: No, that absolutely makes sense, and certainly that's one of the things that we've looked for is
as you have this upward pressure to see when you can take those rates up and even get more availability.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: And there you have it. But we're not about to pre-announce that. We do that – we make
our rate decisions based on very disciplined analyses of factoring a whole lot of independent variables, right. So that's
within our – I think in our to-do list, right.
<Q - Doug S. Harned>: No – makes sense. Okay. Thank you very much.

[Operator Instructions]. And your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please proceed.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you very much.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, Howard.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: How are you, Phebe?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: I'm good.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: First, actually, I want to ask Jason a question. I figured you didn't want him to be there
neglected. And it looks like the way you bought back stock, it was very much back-end loaded when you look at the
share count, so that we should we should expect a fairly sharp decline sequentially in shares outstanding in the third
quarter versus where you were in the second quarter. Is that correct?
<A - Jason W. Aiken>: When you say at the end, at the end of the third quarter or maybe the end of the second
quarter?
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: No. Excuse me, I apologize. It appears as if you bought most of the shares towards the end
of the second quarter, because the difference between the weighted share count in the period and the share-end number
is fairly significant.
<A - Jason W. Aiken>: I wouldn't necessarily go to that conclusion. The activity was spread right throughout the
quarter, and what you may be seeing is the offsetting impact of stock option exercise activity and other factors that go
into the weighted average calculation, but no anomaly driving the share count or the repurchase activity toward the end
of the quarter.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Okay.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Howard, we did a accelerated share repurchase in the first quarter, but the second quarter,
it was just steady Eddy, consistent buying throughout the quarter.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Okay. That's helpful. And then second, Phebe, you've focused a lot on making a difference
in costs as an effective competitive tool. Could you address a little bit of how that's helped you either win some
business or position you to win some business both at Combat Systems and at IS&T?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Absolutely. One of my favorite subjects. Let me give you the easiest and most glaring,
frankly, examples. At ELS, we had a cost structure going into 2013 that was so high it made them anti-competitive.
They just couldn't win any orders. So we needed to get after that cost structure, and we did it quickly, disciplined – in a
disciplined fashion. We did the same thing at GD UK. And the results we're seeing is in GD UK, we actually had a –
and C4 owns GD UK – we actually had a contract that we had been disqualified from because of high cost reopened for
us to go back into the competition because we had lowered our costs so dramatically. And in a head-to-head
competition with multiple other suppliers, we won.

I mean, that is a simple and, I think, powerful example of what rightsizing your business can do. It's the right thing to
do for your shareholders, for your customer, so that we can provide the services at competitive rates. And the same
thing is happening in European Land Systems. So those are the two obvious examples, but we're seeing that
throughout. As C4 Systems has reduced its business and restructured its business dramatically since the fourth quarter
of 2013, they've increased their order activity, particularly in their overseas markets, Canada, the Mid East. And to the
extent that they're going in head-to-head competitions, we've been doing very, very well in our capture rate.
The same thing is true with our intel business, and the same thing is true with our IT business. So I'm very pleased with
the performance of these companies as we focused on getting back to the basics of operating excellence. And they've
got more to go, but they've made progress.
Combat Systems has had a long track record of disciplined response to their market and anticipating changes in their
market and getting after their fixed costs quickly. There is no such thing, as we say, as fixed costs, they'll ultimately
turn into variable. So they have rightsized their business even in advance of the change in their market conditions, and I
think you can see the result of that in their margin improvement, in their margin performance.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Just to follow up on Land Systems or Combat, I'm still sort of looking at sort of the market
color for opportunities, can you, either geographically or product line or some way characterize how there's been very
specific interest?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So we continue to see within our Land Forces, U.S. Land Forces line of business interest
in terms of sustainment levels, right. So we anticipated that, and we see that, so not a lot of, I don't believe, new
opportunities on that front. We are, however, engaged in a number of international opportunities with all of the three
businesses in our Combat Systems. But the timing of – the clarity around timing of international orders has been a little
elusive, so I'm not about to speculate, but we're in negotiation on several potential contracts, and we'll see how those
turn out. But there's still a lot of interest. The world hasn't gotten any safer.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you very much.

And your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Hi. Just wanted to follow back up on the AxleTech discussion. Can you just size that
business? And I'm trying to just think about how much of the original sales decline was because of that business; and
then the absence of it, how that's playing into the Combat outlook for the year.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: You can sort of infer that from the restated sales numbers. But that business has for the
last, really, year, undergone a precipitous decline in sales and inversion of demand. So I'm not going to parse out
exactly the size, but you can – when we get around to selling it, and disposing of it, and finalizing the contract, we'll
give you a little bit more clarity. But it was responsible for some of the decline, clearly, you can see that.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. And then you had mentioned about risk adjusting for the U.S. Army business. If I
remember right, going into the year, you implied kind of a 40% reduction year-over-year. Can you talk about where
you stand year-to-date and what you're expecting now from U.S. Army business?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah, so that business is consistent, other than the sustainment end of that line of
business, which really hits the IS&T business units more than it does the Combat Systems business units. We're down
to around 20% and declining.

Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please proceed.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Good morning, Phebe, and good quarter.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Thanks, Carter.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Just a question regarding announcements made by peers yesterday on two fronts. The first,
obviously, your partner on the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Program took a pretty sizable charge with the completion
of that renegotiation with the customer, and they've lengthened out the entry and the service dates on some of those
aircraft. I wondered if you could speak to the impacts that you may see from that and how you'll go about evaluating
that.
And then secondly, Lockheed, who I think is a sub-contractor on the Scout vehicle to you, was talking about a pretty
sizable award they were excited about from a potential standpoint from the UK. And I wondered if you could speak to
timing, and size, or just general color about that opportunity and what it could mean for GD UK. Thank you.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah, let me talk about MHP. For the first time in many years, this program has a stable
way forward and has upside opportunity. We did not take a charge on that program. We don't intend to take a charge as
a result of the renegotiation. We are the supplier for Sikorsky. We have developed over the years a very good
relationship with our supplier. We've been very supportive with our prime, we've been very supportive of them. And
this was a very significant risk reduction result for us, and we have stabilized. And going forward, there'll be some
upside. So that was very, very good news.
On the SV vehicle, Lockheed may have more information than we do. But this is one of the many, many markets that
we continue to investigate. And we're there, we're the prime on the SV – the development phase of the SV, and how the
British government and the Ministry of Defence chooses on a going-forward basis to think about the production
contract is something we still have to work out with them, but they're going to make that call.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: How would you think about the significance of that order relative to some of the other big
orders you've talked about in Combat in the past?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Well, it would be a nice order. And again, that is entirely driven by the druthers of that
customer and what they want to see in near term production. So the developmental program went from a very risky
position to one that we've stabilized that, and we've gotten it back on track, technically, schedule-wise and we've done a
good job. That Land Systems team did a very good job. I'm a big believer that if you don't build the platform, you can't
integrate it. So they built those platforms, they know them, it's their core competency, they're probably one of the best
in the world, if not the best in the world at that, and they were able to turn around a very Red program. So it's an
opportunity going forward, but that will be dictated in its entirety by our customer.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Thanks, Phebe.

<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: On Gulfstream, just to maybe follow up on some of the previous questions, the increase in
activity that you've seen, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about the G550, can you speak about regionally
where you've seen it? Is it out of the emerging world, is it out of Europe, is it out of the U.S.? Where are you seeing
maybe the tick up in demand?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: In each one of our airplane models, what we've seen is North America is 50% of the
orders for the last 18 months, so pretty consistent North America involvement and activity in ordering. Sometimes
that's small fleet – corporate fleet replacements or individuals. But I got to tell you, the vast majority of the orders are
from Fortune 500s and both primarily in North America public and private companies, but also international public and
private companies.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Okay. And in the mid-size market, have you seen much of a pickup there yet or is that still
kind of bouncing around?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah, the 280 – and thank you – the 280 had a nice quarter. And that airplane gets
overshadowed by the 650, but it is a terrific airplane in its space and in its niche and it's doing well. It fits a discernible
need with great capabilities.

<Q - Robert Stallard>: Phebe, also related to your peers, it does seem that a couple of them have been picking up their
M&A activity since the start of the year. Are you in any way tempted to get back involved in this game?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: We've seen – look, I'm not going to speculate on that -we've seen a bit of a trickle, but a
trickle does not a trend make. So it's hard to know the maturity of the M&A market, but so far, we're not there.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Okay. And then as a second question, really a follow-up to Ron's question, have you seen any
changes in the pricing dynamic for new aircraft?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: No, our prices are holding up nicely.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Great. Okay. Thanks so much.

<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, Myles.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Maybe talk about the capital deployment for just a second. I know you made mention of the
$500 million note coming due in January and your decision hasn't been made to refi or repay it yet. And I just wonder,
is that in any way going to play into how you're going to deploy free cash flow for repurchase? It looks like there's
about $1 billion after dividends of free cash flow you'll have in the second half of the year to maintain this neutral
position you have now on net debts. I think about that as your repo target unless I have to think about the refinance or
repayment of the note as well. So if you can maybe – are those two connected?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Well, I think – if you think about it, that note is due in January. We really haven't gotten –
we really haven't put our – focused our attention on 2015 capital deployment, but you can rest assure we intend to be
shareholder friendly as we have in this year.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: And then clarification, are you still holding 40 mid-size deliveries in 2014 or is it just picked
up in the mid-size in terms of demand, so maybe it's a little bit less?

Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please proceed.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Good morning. Phebe, just a quick question on margins. Wondering if you could just give
some updated thoughts on what you think normalized margins at Jet Aviation are going to be over the longer term. And
then the same for Combat Systems, just long-term structural margins in that business for the next several years as you
look at all the cost activities that you've taken over the past couple of years and the mix of business going forward.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Jet Aviation has been a story all about walking out of the shadow of the valley of death.
And their margin performance has been increasingly positive quarter over quarter. They have some variability on a
quarter-to-quarter basis, but the underlying operations have done very, very well, and will continue to do well. From
every indication we see, all of the metrics we watch, the EACs we build, everything I see is on the upward trajectory.
And I think it's too soon to have – for me to give you a definitive – where ought the sustaining margin to be. I have an
aspiration that I am fully confident that Jet will make, but that's an internal discussion that we have to have, but they're
on the right path.
Now, Combat, I think Combat, it's all going to be about their orders, which they have stabilized their order, and then
their performance on those orders. And these lines of businesses have demonstrated that they are very good operators.
So I don't want to get out ahead of myself for 2016, but we ought to see some nice margin improvement in Combat.
There's nothing structurally that's keeping them from not continuing to build their operating efficiency and add to it.

any risk to your guidance from a CR that goes to November, December?
