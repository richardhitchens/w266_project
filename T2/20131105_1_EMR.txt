I'll start with the highlights of the quarter as shown on page 2 of the conference call slide presentation. Fourth quarter
sales grew 2% to $6.8 billion, with underlying sales increasing 1%, which was 2% excluding the embedded computing
and power business.
A slow economic environment continued, especially in mature markets. Growth was also hampered by difficult
comparisons from the Thailand flooding recovery and a large network power project in the prior year. Market
conditions were varied but have been improving modestly overall as underlying orders excluding embedded computing
and power grew 4% in September.
Profitability was strong, with a record level of segment margin at 19.5%, up 70 basis points from the prior year.
Earnings per share were $1.18, up 6% from the prior year excluding impairments and repatriation charges. Cash flow
remained robust through the quarter, completing a record year of performance. All businesses closed the year with
strong execution, providing solid operational momentum into next year.
Next slide, the P&L summary. As I mentioned, slow economic conditions limited sales growth to 2%. Despite the
sluggish growth, gross profit margin expanded to a record level. Operating profit margin subtracted 30 basis points as
stock compensation increased $53 million and pension expense increased $12 million.
A goodwill impairment was recognized for the connectivity solutions business, which is reported in the network power
segment separate from the network power systems business. EBIT margin was unchanged, excluding impairment
charges.
We repurchased 10.1 million shares for $623 million in the quarter reflecting accelerated buybacks from cash
anticipated to become available from the embedded computing and power divestiture.
Excluding one-time impairment and tax charges, earnings per share increased 6% to $1.18.
Next slide, sales growth by geography. In the fourth quarter, underlying sales grew 1% with the U.S. down 1%, Europe
up 1%, Asia up 4%, including China growth of 7%, Latin America up 10%, Canada up 4%, and Middle East and Africa
up 1%. Currency translation added 1% for reported sales growth of 2%.
For full year 2013, underlying sales increased 2%, with the U.S. flat, Europe down 3%, Asia up 2%, Latin America up
11%, Canada up 4%, and Middle East and Africa up 13%. Currency translation and divestitures together deducted 1%
for reported sales growth of 1%. Emerging markets continue to lead growth, increasing 5% with and 7% without
embedded computing and power in 2013.
Moving to slide five, cash flow. Strong operating cash flow growth was driven by working capital improvement and
earnings growth. Free cash flow also increased at a double-digit rate, reflecting robust conversion from earnings. Trade
working capital as a percent of sales improved 90 basis points, helped by the slower market conditions and efficient
balance sheet management. Cash generation remained strong throughout 2013, reaching $3.6 billion for the year.
Next slide, business segment earnings. Business segment margin expanded 70 basis points, despite $12 million higher
pension expenses and the flooding recovery in the prior year. Excluding impairments, the corporate expense increase
was primarily related to higher stock compensation, which increased from the third quarter due to the higher fourth
quarter stock price. The tax rate included $37 million in repatriation taxes related to the embedded computing and
power divestiture.
Moving to slide seven, process management. Process management underlying sales grew 6% with North America
down 1%, Asia up 9%, Europe up 10%, Latin America up 21%, and Middle East and Africa down 2%. Currency
translation deducted 1% for reported sales growth of 5%.
Energy and chemical industry investments remained elevated globally, supporting the continued growth. Sales growth
was tempered by the Thailand flooding recovery in the prior year, which reduced sales growth by about 6%.
Growth was balanced across the portfolio, led by high single-digit growth in the systems and solutions business.

Strength in Asia, driven by 8% growth in China, and Europe supported by North Sea projects, more than offset slower
market conditions in North America. Process management's solid growth momentum is expected to continue into next
year, with project activity in North America expected to accelerate in the second half.
Next slide, industrial automation. Industrial automation underlying sales decreased 4% with North America down 8%,
Asia up 6%, Europe down 7%, Latin America up 1%, and Middle East and Africa up 21%.
Currency translation added 1% for a reported sales decline of 3%.
Demand for industrial goods remained weak throughout the quarter, especially in North America and Europe. The
power generating alternators business declined the most, as channel destocking continued but at a slower rate, and
renewable energy projects were also particularly weak. Solid growth in Asia was led by the industrial motors business.
Order trends have been improving with growth in the quarter after protected weakness. End markets are improving,
particularly in Asia and Europe, and we expect modest sales growth to return in the near term.
Moving to slide nine, network power. Network power reported an underlying sales decline of 3% with North America
down 2%, Asia down 3%, Europe and Latin America down 6%, and Middle East and Africa up 9%. Sales growth was
unfavorably impacted by about 3% from a large Australian project from a prior year quarter.
Global information technology and telecommunications end markets remained weak. Data center demand declined
modestly, with growth in Asia and Europe offset by weakness in North America.
Telecommunications infrastructure investment decreased globally, but recent orders suggest improvement, particularly
in China.
Embedded computing and power declined sharply, reducing total segment underlying growth by 1%.
Margin expanded 110 basis points, benefiting from cost containment and restructuring savings. Positive orders are
expected to continue in the network power systems business as market conditions improve modestly in Europe and
Asia.
Next slide, climate technologies. Climate technologies underlying sales increased 5% with North America up 4%, Asia
up 10%, Europe up 3%, Latin America up 12%, and Middle East and Africa down 11%.
Currency translation added 1% for reported sales growth of 6%.
The U.S. air conditioning business increased modestly with double-digit growth in residential, partially offset by slow
commercial demand and service weakness. China's residential business was up double digits, leading growth in Asia.
Work in Europe benefited from a modest market recovery and favorable comparisons.
The global refrigeration business reflected strength from industrial and transportation market improvement. Moderate
growth is expected to continue in the residential and refrigeration businesses with modest improvement in commercial
markets.
Moving to slide 11, commercial and residential solutions. Commercial and residential solutions reported and
underlying sales grew 4%, with North America up 4%, Asia up 6%, Europe up 5%, Latin America down 3% and
Middle East and Africa down 10%. Residential investment in North America continues to increase steadily, with
growth led by the professional tools and food waste disposers business.
Margin expanded 150 basis points primarily due to cost containment and return on restructuring investments over the
past two years. Momentum in North America residential markets is expected to continue in the near term with modest
support from nonresidential markets.
Next slide, fiscal 2013 highlights. Sales growth of 1% was led by 5% growth in emerging markets, which increased at
37% of total sales for 2013. 40.3% was a record gross profit margin, reflecting continued technology and cost
repositioning investments. EBIT margin excluding charges was essentially flat, impacted by a stock comp increase of
$121 million and a pension expense increase of $55 million. Share repurchase of about 20 million shares, or $1.1

2013 completed the 57th year of consecutive dividend increases, which contributed to a total payout ratio of -

conditions in Europe and Asia in particular.
Based on global gross fixed investment forecast of 2.5% to 4% growth, Emerson's 2014 outlook is as follows:
underlying sales growth 3% to 5%; reported sales change of minus 1% to 1%, which reflects the embedded computing
and power transaction expected to close before the end of calendar 2013; slight operational margin expansion;
acceleration of growth programs to invest ahead of improving global economics; earnings per share growth excluding
goodwill and tax charges of 4% to 7% with reported earnings per share growth of 33% to 38%.
The board of directors voted to increase the first quarter dividend 5% to $0.43 per share. Other business segment
financial metric forecasts will be provided at the annual investor conference in February 2014.
And with that, I'll turn it over to David Farr.
David N. Farr
Thank you very much, Pat, appreciate it.
I want to welcome everybody to today's call. I want to thank everybody across the operation of Emerson both at the
corporate and operating levels for a strong performance in the second half of this year, and delivering what I believe is
very good global performance and operating performance.
It was a very unusual year, as we all know, with a lot of turbulent economies out there, a lot of things happening, but as
our business slowed down the second half of the fiscal year, the organization rallied around what needed to get done,
they delivered some incremental sales, and they delivered very strong profitability and cash flow, and I owe a debt of
gratitude to all this operation across the company in showing how Emerson can execute and do it well.
As I look at what we did this year with solid EBIT margin on a consolidated business, strong operating EBIT margins
at segment level, record levels, excellent cash flow, operating cash flow, and a great job on getting just the operations
running the way they need to run and we truly appreciate that.
Unfortunately we had to take another charge as we sold EC&P. That's not a good thing, and obviously not a great
situation for us as a company, but we're getting behind EC&P with the divestiture being done sometime at the end of
this fiscal quarter. We have repatriated the cash that had been sitting over there in Asia, in China, it's been brought back
and we've actually started buying back about two-thirds of the stock with that additional funds that we wanted to turn
back to shareholders from the EC&P divestiture. I am very pleased to say that.
We also took another small impairment charge on a small business left over from the Jordan acquisition of about 10 or
12, 13 years ago, and one small part of an acquisition we had done in the connectivity area, and we are keying this up
to sell this business, it's just not strategic to us and is a business we don't want to focus and go on, do any additional
acquisitions there and we'll sell that sometime in this fiscal year.
As I look at the global economy right now, I'm not going to get into a lot of the specifics here, because I will do that in
February , when we get into more, I mean, strong guidelines as what happens as the calendar year unfolds. But as we
look at the global economy right now, we're seeing the gross fixed investment improving a little bit to that 2.5% to 4%
range.
Fundamentally what we're seeing at this point in time is a modest improvement in Europe. We believe that Europe's
going to grow someplace around the 1% to 2% range. Not a lot of momentum, but it has turned positively, positive on
the growth standpoint. We had a positive growth actually in Emerson for the fourth quarter in our European business.

The key issue for us, though, is that must continue. If it doesn't continue and it slips back in recession, or no growth,
then we're going to have a more challenging 2014.
We believe that the U.S. will continue to improve moderately, not a very strong recovery but moderate growth. And
we've seen continued improvement in our China business over the last couple months and quarters really. And so we
expect that to continue.
Relative to our Latin America business, we believe that we'll still continue to have another good year in Latin America.
I'm a little bit more concerned about the Middle East and the turmoil and the fact that there's been a lot of investments
there and with the price of oil coming down a little bit, it could be a slowdown maybe staying at high levels of
investments, but not growing like we saw over the last couple of years.
Relative to Southeast Asia, I still think we'll have pretty good growth there. So, overall, when you put it all together, we
see decent top-line growth this year, which is important for us. But I'm not going to get into specifics of Emerson,
where I break down Emerson sales by various regions until that February time period, so I know you'll ask but I'll bow
out and not say anything about that until February.
As you know, we've seen very weak global fixed investments over the last two and a half years. We have worked very,
very hard to protect certain technology investments, certain growth investments. We have worked very hard to
strengthen our global competitive cost structure, and given the record levels of profitability we see this year and what
we're going to forecast next year at the EBIT margin line, we are in a good cost position.
The last three or four months internally the company has been focusing very hard on prioritization of where we think
the growth opportunities are across Emerson, and we have decided to increase our investments, reinvestments in these
growth opportunities, and the reason for that, as we reviewed with the board for the last two days, is we believe the
wind is starting to shift to our back. We believe that for two and a half years of really keeping things really tight and
looking where things happen, the time is to pivot and to increase our investments, and that's what we're doing.
We believe very strongly that we have a lot of growth opportunities, both from a technology standpoint, across our
service organizations as we roll them out, across our solutions capability, and equally important, we're going to invest
incrementally over $50 million in upgrading our Oracle systems, which are very, very important to us relative to our
network power systems and also within our climate technology business as we go forward as a global franchise. We
need to continue that integration and make that investment in the controls of Oracle for the next couple years. Very
important for us.
But as I look at the opportunities relative to our – in technology investments to really move our growth curve ahead and
look at the disruptive technology opportunities out there that we want to invest in, we have more today than we've had
in a long, long time, and the time is now to pivot. .
We believe we'll be facing moderate growth on our fixed investment around the world for the next several years. We
see nothing fundamentally saying it's going to be a huge surge, but moderate growth and you're going to see economies
doing well, some economies not doing well, and you're going to see this rolling moderate growth, I think, could see this
for four or five years.
So what we're trying to do right now is take our selective investments and try to drive a little bit premium growth
through that, we have a very strong cost structure, and make those investments to strengthen this company for the
future, the near term future being two, three, four years out. We need to make sure that we can drive as much growth
through these internal investments, which are high-quality and we have the cash, we have the balance sheet and that's
what we're going to focus on.
That's what we reviewed with the board for the last couple days, and I feel very strongly as we focus those issues and
we'll talk about some of those issues in February. I'm not going to share those ideas with you right now on a conference
call. We are focused very much on trying to drive premium levels of top-line sales growth with a moderate global gross
fixed investment environment.

So before we open it up for questions, again I want to thank the global operation for their strong operating performance
the last five or six months, both at the corporate level, getting the job done and at the operational level getting the job
done. We closed strong as a company. Our orders -- underlying orders are starting to improve a little bit, the wind's
shifting and it's time to pivot to make some incremental growth investments that will give us incremental growth as we
come out this what I call moderate growth period here for the next couple years.
With that, I want to open up the floor for questions. Again, thank you very much for joining us today.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Scott Davis with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi, good afternoon, guys.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Scott.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Dave, I wanted to dig in, I know you don't want to comment on the specific businesses, but on
guidance a little bit, you mentioned Oracle as being an investment you need to make, but when I look back at other
time periods where you've had mid-single-digit core growth like 2005, 2007, 2008, you put up pretty big conversion
rates, nice operating profit improvements off of that. What makes this – what makes 2014 different to that extent,
where you don't think you can still drive that kind of incremental profit?
<A - David N. Farr>: I think the difference is if you look at the underlying gross fixed investments that we saw at that
time period, they were higher levels. So we're looking right now maybe GFI can be growing 2.5%, 3%, maybe getting
up close to 4%. That's the difference.
If you look at the GFI, on a global basis is not mixing up as strongly as it was in historical. We need to make those
investments. We've been really keeping things tight. We've delivered very good levels of profitability. And
fundamentally as I look at it and shared with the board, we actually have unique opportunities to increase these
investments to try to grow a little bit faster, and if we get a better GFI, then we will do better. But right now as I look at
this global fixed investment, we're looking at moderate recovery. And we've not seen – if you go back in time and look
at it, you'd be seeing four, five, and five-and-a-half types. It makes a big difference than two-and-a-half and threes.
That's what the difference is, Scott.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay, that's fair. A little bit of a clean-up question, I'll pass it on. If we go back about a year
ago, there were some challenges with your receivables, now we've seen a pretty big pickup in cash conversion. Does
that mean that the receivable issue has been largely fixed?
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: Yeah, hello, Scott. This is Frank. We had very good improvement in the receivables this
year. We had about a $100 million improvement in the past few receivables and good improvement in the underlying
performance as well. So the receivables were a big contributor to the strong cash flow.
<A - David N. Farr>: They did a great job, the whole team. And I think that one of the issues there, as I – it's just the
stress points around the world right now, you would think that people would pay with low cost of money, but people
are actually making it tougher to pay. They're working every angle they can on that one. But they did a great job. If you
look at it, we've probably got close to $100 million out of inventory, $100 million out of receivables, and that really
helped us setting record levels of operating cash flow and free cash flow. Good job by everybody out there.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay, very helpful.
<A - David N. Farr>: Thank you very much, guys.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Thanks, good afternoon.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Chris.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Good, thanks. Just riding the wave of the Red Sox World Series here in Boston.
<A - David N. Farr>: Oh, man, that could have gone a whole few minutes about that one. Okay. Congratulations, they
did a good job. They outplayed us. It's always nice to play in the World Series though.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Just have a question about the pervasive sensing press release that you had out,
doubling the traditional $16 billion sensing market over the next 10 years. Is that kind of a direct read on how you
expect your – you know, that 45% of process to track?
<A - David N. Farr>: From our perspective, that part of sensing process, that actually is one area we're putting
significant investments in coming – talking about the pivot point as one area that we really want to do well because
we've done extremely well in our wireless business, and we have now set the target to $1 billion number for our
wireless business.
One thing that's happened as we look at the global process market and even industrial market, they want more sensing
out there because of all the environmental rules, regulations, safety rules. And so we are spending additional money in
our instrumentation, process world, and also industrial world to come up with a better level of sensing. And that's why
we think the number of points in sensing are going to double over a long time period here. And that's a very good thing
for us, given our presence and our technology capabilities. But that's clearly one area that we have pivoted and put a lot
of money in right now and will be for the next couple years.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Great, and then in industrial automation, sometimes things can move pretty quickly
there. So with orders certainly have inflected, any sense that this could take off a bit more than the tone that you want
to project at this point?
<A - David N. Farr>: You know, I think the key issue for us is Europe has started to turn positive, unfortunately
France's economy has not turned yet. That is a concern, and we're very strong in France. Asia has turned for us, which
is a good thing. The thing to watch for us in this business is Caterpillar.
If Caterpillar starts seeing more, what we call [ph] the genta (25:37), the power industry, their power business is
starting to pick back up, then you'll see that take off. But until that happens, you're not going to see any strong pickup
in that business. But it definitely – all the dynamics are turning positive, which are a good sign, and they've had a
couple tough two-and-a-half years here after a very strong 2011, so I think you're going to start see the second half be a
little bit better for those guys.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Got it, thanks.
<A - David N. Farr>: You're welcome, thanks.

<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Good afternoon, guys.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Shannon.

for Oracle. Do you have an overall number for what you have in mind for this ramped growth investment?

<A - David N. Farr>: Not really. Not that I'd share with you. It's definitely, you know, when you think about – if you
look at what things we had to deal with this year, obviously we're clearly not – you know, we're not putting that to the
P&L, we're going to offset it through these investments, so that gives you a good idea. If you look at the positives, we
had the headwinds with the stock price last year, headwinds with pension, we had the headwinds – what other
headwinds? We had the pension and the stock, those were the two big ones.
What we're doing is I want to put the money back into the business. We're healthy from a financial standpoint, put the
money back in the business and really try to ramp up our technology window here as we try to figure out how to drive a
little bit more growth. Because we're very profitable internally, if we can get more growth through these technology
programs, as you guys know, we will deliver high levels of profitability.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Yeah, no, that makes sense. And actually, when you're calling out your record gross
margins, you talk about technology. As you get these investments in there, I mean, is there more room up on the gross
margin line?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, I think we've set a number. Help me correct, did we talk about trying to get to 42%, is that
the number I talked about?
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: Yeah, as a 2015 target.
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, we're looking. The number in the back of my mind based on investments we're making
based on mix of business is around 42%.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Yeah, so you still feel good – ?
<A - David N. Farr>: I feel real good – because that allows us, you know, technology, that's how we drive our
profitability, it's technology. We've – we do a lot of stuff on a cost standpoint, but really technology that we allow, you
know, develop for our customers and gives us a real competitive edge, so we'll update everyone in February on that.
But I think the number I remember talking about is around that 42% level that we're trying to target for GP as we
continue to mix this business up.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: And then just one quick one on these process acquisitions, the two that closed. Are
those in the revenue guidance yet? And are we going to have some kind of acquisition accounting related to them kind
of in 1Q here that we have to think about?
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: Yeah, we've got – it's a little more than a point of growth in the revenue guide and, yes, we
will have purchase accounting on them in the first quarter in particular. So we will – we'll have some drag in the first
quarter, actually, from those acquisitions, and profitability will be pretty modest as a result for the full year because it's
pretty significant purchasing accounting in the first quarter.
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, but that's normal setup there. But they're going to be a good growth business, they're good
margin businesses. So they'll start coming through, I would say, by 2015. If you use this commercial paper, obviously it
contributes. But that's not how we look at things. We look at our cost of capital. And so from that standpoint, it's not
going to be much contribution this year, and it will start kicking in in 2015.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay, great. Thanks, guys.

you touched on this at your analyst day last year, or earlier this year, but can you talk about sort of what you're seeing
now and what's embedded in guidance?
<A - David N. Farr>: What type of people did you hear that from? You said intellectual – what did you say? What
companies did you hear this from?
<Q - Adam Michael Baumgarten>: Just sort of broadly in speaking with some companies, nothing major, but just sort
of challenging.
<A - David N. Farr>: Oh, okay. I thought you mentioned some kind of industry. I'm sorry.
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: He said electrical equipment.
<A - David N. Farr>: Electrical equipment, okay. Now from our standpoint, pricing – as we did talk in February,
you're exactly right, and I have talked in conference calls. With net material inflation continued to stay, I would say,
slightly negative and not really turn up yet, you're seeing pricing – our pricing power soften a little bit. It's still slightly
positive. It's less positive this year than last year. This year, I'm talking about 2014 versus 2013. We are still slightly
green. I expect that to happen.
As we get into this, I'm real concerned about this pivoting, but we've not seen any level of inflation. Therefore net
inflation of our material costs have continued to come down a little bit, and our pricing obviously follows that down
behind it. But we're trying to make sure we stay ahead of that. But right now, I would agree with those other comments.
Pricing is a little bit softer out in the marketplace, but it's still slightly positive, less positive than 2013. That's a very
good observation.

<Q>: Hey, This is Charlie for Julian.
<A - David N. Farr>: Charlie for Julian, what happened to Julian?
<Q>: He's in China right now, so I'm not sure if he's on.
<A - David N. Farr>: Oh, man, I hope he's getting some business for us. Did he take an order book or something like
that?
<Q>: I hope so. Just had a question about the cash. Almost $3.3 billion in cash, 13% of your sales, you know, net
leverage, I don't know, a half turn; you feel like the tailwinds are at your back and you're making some growth
investments, but what do we with the cash? This is the biggest cash balance I've seen ever for you guys. You talked
about stepping up M&A in the press release, how does the pipeline look, which segments do you like, maybe just some
color there?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, I mean, right now we are definitely stepping up and reviewed that with the board the last
couple days. We've done a couple already in the first month out of the box in the New Year. We're really trying to
figure out how to get about $1.5 billion done this year. We definitely have the cash flow, we like generating the cash.
At this point in time, there's not going to be any what I'd call big, big deal out there. We're looking at small deals from
the $400 million, $500 million, $600 million top level deals.
Pipeline looks pretty good for us. It's very much focused on process, focused on industrial space, focused on the
climate space. We might be doing some joint ventures, too, but right now we're focusing on those three key areas
relative to our deal transaction. If we do not see the deals unfolding, then obviously what we'll do is we may pivot to

more share repurchase. Right now we've already booked – we're trying to bank, what, $900 million for the -
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: $900 million.
<A - David N. Farr>: $900 million for the year, but if we see that obviously we're not getting the deals done and we
have very strong cash flow generation, then you're going to see us – we'll probably take up the share repurchase back
up. But that's where we are right now, and we probably will sell one or two businesses this year at this point in time.
We – as you well know, we like to focus on cash because without cash you can't do anything, and we've had a very
good 12-month period here with cash generation.
<Q>: So is there a number that you're comfortable running the business with, just a cash number on balance sheet?
<A - David N. Farr>: Not really, I mean, we don't – we don't pick a number like that. It's not – I don't pick a number.
We go through periods we generate more cash, we go through periods we spend more money in acquisitions. Last
couple of years, we passed more money back to our shareholders. We're running, I think, the last couple of years in the
low 60% of our operating cash flow back to shareholders.
We are comfortable right now with the level of deals and the cash generation to be in that low 60s. And it's – and that's
where we're comfortable with. I don't look at a number per se in my balance sheet, how much cash I want in the
balance sheet. It's what I see where we need to spend the money, how we spend the money internally. And then if we
have money left over, we send back somewhere around the 60%, 62%, 63%, 64% back to our shareholders. That's what
we do.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Yes, just a question in terms of leverage from the fixed investment growth to the top line. I
thought that historically it was more like 1.5%, and maybe I'm splitting hairs here, but it seems it's more like 1.2%. And
I'm just wondering if this is just rounding or is it a mix issue as to which geographies are growing this time around?
<A - David N. Farr>: You're looking through GFI, the issue really boils down to as follows, what I've communicated
over the years, as we go above 3% we start getting a little bit of a spread relative to – is it 1.1%, 1.2%. As we go above
4%, the number gets to above 1.5%. As we start getting above 4.5% to 5%, sometimes we can start getting 2%, so it's a
function of where that level is.
The level right now, when you're looking at 2.5%, 3%, basically that's not enough to drive a higher leverage growth for
us. And what we're trying to do right now, we're going to be running GFI at the say 3% or 3.5% range for multiple
years. At 4% or 5%, 6%, I'm going to try to figure out how to widen that spread by some technology, sort of disruptive
technology type investments that allow us to get a little bit more growth in a slower GFI environment. That's what
we're going to play out here, because I do not see GFI going up to 5% or 6% range like we saw on most recoveries
around the world in the last few years. That's what you normally see, but we don't see that right now.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: And for your growth do you get more of a boost if it's emerging market growth versus developed
markets? Is that the right way of thinking about it, if there is more spread in EM?
<A - David N. Farr>: There's definitely more spread in the emerging market than we do in the mature market because
of the market share potential. You look at our mature markets, the U.S. and Europe we have a higher level of market
penetration already, so in the emerging markets when we get GFI and we get a little bit more growth from penetration,
that's why you see a little bit higher spread. You're exactly right.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Just a follow-up question, what's the margin in network power ex-embedded?

Thank you, our next question comes from the line of John Quealy with Canaccord. Please go ahead.
<Q - Chip Moore>: Thanks. It's actually Chip Moore for John. On network power you talked about some weakness in
the North American data center space this quarter. Maybe you could just expand on some of the trends there versus
what you're seeing in some of the other geographies.
<A - David N. Farr>: I think that in North America there's definitely been a slowdown in what I'd call IT spending in
the second half this year. We've seen it across the market space. We're seeing a little bit of pickup in Europe. We're
seeing pickup in Asia. The real spread slowdown has been in North America. And, you know, I think there's going to
have to be – I think it has to be more resolution a little bit to what's going on with the government; what's going on
relative to a little bit the financial institutions, where there's a lot of IT spend typically, before we see that marketplace
pick back up.
I don't see that happening in the very near future, so we're going to be very cautious relative to underlying growth in the
network power systems space until we see North America pick back up, but right now it's pretty weak.
And then for-someone asked about network power systems for the whole year EBIT. The number is around 10.5%,
network Power Systems for the full year in 2013. Okay. Next question.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Thanks. Good afternoon or good morning from here in China, actually.
<A - David N. Farr>: Oh, early, early riser, Steve. Way to go! What city are you in?
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Hey, we don't mess around, especially when you guys put up some of those growth
numbers. Hey, listen. So, the first question is, remember the $50 million or $100 million that you used in Accelerate -- I
think it was Accelerate 2011 or 2012 programs, are you going to give us some detail as you think about spending this
new $50 million in February, or any high level now about how that program ended up faring out in light of the overall
end market weakness, as we think about handicapping the additional investments that you're now putting into the
business?
<A - David N. Farr>: We'll definitely do that. I think the key issue for us is we started 2011, 2012 and early 2013.
When you think about it, we went through probably a two-year period there where GFI was under 3%, and we actually
grew. Historically, if we were down this 2%, 3% in GFI, we would not have top-line or underlying sales growth. So,
the programs actually did give us some incremental growth. But I will – I'll give you more clarity in February,
obviously I want to be very careful about it, how much, but I'll give you more clarity, and I'll give you some feel for
how the other programs work, Steve. I'll definitely do that for you.

<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Great. And in terms of your assumptions for 2014, we've talked in the past about the, you
know, cheap gas impact on U.S. petrochemicals demand, or overall chemicals, and how that is particularly, or should
be good for Emerson, versus some of your peers. Can you give us some thoughts about how you're looking at that? Is it
just a much longer timeframe, or is that part of your thinking for 2014?
<A - David N. Farr>: It's part of our thinking for 2014. The process business around the world's had a very good
investment. You take Middle East, Latin America, Asia, we see in the second half of 2014 some of those programs
kicking in.
So you're going to see process which had a basically down U.S. business this year because of the strong 2012 they had.
We expect them to grow and grow very nicely in the second half of 2014 as these investments start kicking in late
2014, early 2015.
As you know, these are long cycle investments. These are fixed plant and equipment investments these companies are
making. A lot of permitting comes through this. They're moving down the path right now. We're winning the projects,
we're getting the business. We would expect some of that money to start being spent in the second half of our fiscal
year in 2014, and really starting to build out as they get more and more approvals across the United States. It's
definitely coming, and we see it happening.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay, and just a cleanup question on that, on the price cost commentary you had.
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: A little more clarity on the fourth quarter itself, and what your material inflation roughly
was versus the actual pricing you realized?
<A - David N. Farr>: I don't have the numbers off the top of my head right now. It was positive. I was definitely
green. I mean, I don't – I mean, positive pricing and net material inflation was negative, but I don't have the number
right now. Do you have a number there, Pat? We should – why don't you ask Pat, but it's definitely positive, but clearly,
as I said earlier, I see that the spread is definitely getting tighter, it's still a positive green because the net material
inflation continues to go down and obviously our pricing is going to be pulled right along with that, so – yeah, so
positive price – I mean, for the whole year, I mean, it's a positive price cost at this point in time. Not a big number, but
it's a positive price cost.

<A - David N. Farr>: Okay, that's why you're with Honeywell then, huh?
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Well, they're part of the solution with their respirator mask now.
<A - David N. Farr>: Well, give my best to all my Honeywell friends there then.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Will do. Hey, Dave, on underlying revenues outlook, I know we shouldn't get too euphoric
about 100 basis points, but it is better than what we talked about last quarter going three to five. So, can you comment
on what the swing factors are on inching that up?
<A - David N. Farr>: There's really two factors. One, I feel a little bit more positive about Europe because we now
have – we've had positive – a positive quarter in Europe. The indicators continue to move upward positively. They're
not moving rapidly, but they're getting up more positive, and our customer base is feeling better. And the financial
stability is pretty good. So I see that moving along, so I feel a little bit more confident with that number. So I'm looking
at probably a little bit higher growth there.
The second one now, as we've seen for the last five or six months within China, our business actually started
improving, we had underlying growth for the quarter over 6%. And so I feel with based on the order trends I'm seeing,
based on the customer feedback I'm seeing right now, I feel a little bit more positive on China. Those are the two
reasons why that number's moved up, Deane.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Got it. And then can you size for us the piece of Jordan that you're planning on selling this
year?
<A - David N. Farr>: I should have told you earlier. It's about $100 million. It's small. Less than $100 million.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Okay. And then you said you could be selling two businesses. Was Jordan one of those two, or
there's – are there actually three?
<A - David N. Farr>: There's another business that I don't want to talk about yet, but there's another business that I'm
looking at – a business – it's just basically not going to grow for us and I'm not going to make a strategic investment.
And what I'd rather do is take the money off the table, off our balance sheet and pass it back to the shareholders.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: And approximate size of that unnamed business?
<A - David N. Farr>: Not going to give you that right now. If I gave you an approximate size, there would be a lot of
speculation out there.

<A - David N. Farr>: I'm looking forward to the lawsuit now in court, that's going to be interesting. That's going to be
interesting.
<Q - Rich M. Kwas>: Two questions: Non-res outlook for next year? Seems like some other companies are a little
more favorable about North America non-res. What do you think? How do you think that plays out as 2014 unwinds
for you?
<A - David N. Farr>: Every indication says that non-res will be more favorable. It looks to me right now it might be
more rear end loaded for our fiscal year, so we won't get much of a positive kickback. If it started happening sooner in
the calendar year of 2014, then we get more kickback positive input. Right now, it looks to me like it's going to be later
in the 2014. But it definitely looks to me like intercare, just based on our customer base, is that it is starting to pick
back up. I'm just looking at my own North America bricks and mortars and expansion stuff, and I see us having to
spend some more money in the second half of 2014, too, so my own indicators inside Emerson say the same thing.
<Q - Rich M. Kwas>: That would be ultimately a more positive mix for climate, et cetera, maybe later next year?
<A - David N. Farr>: Climate – climate, industrial also process, we would see a pretty good lever point there. And if it
happened quickly, clearly, that would help us both from a sales growth standpoint and a profit standpoint. That's
something that would be a positive surprise for us.
<Q - Rich M. Kwas>: Okay. And then the other question is on pension and the incentive comp, the tailwind. I think,
Frank, you talked about a combined $0.08 to $0.10 tailwind in fiscal 2014 last quarter. Is that still intact or have the
numbers changed?
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: Yeah, it's $0.10 and maybe a little bit higher as we close out the year on the pension, it's
probably about $70 million on the pension, and the incentive comp is about $40 million to $50 million.

<Q - Jamie Sullivan>: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Jamie.
<Q - Jamie Sullivan>: A question, on process management. You've talked about North America, the MRO side being
a little bit soft, just maybe your thoughts on that inflecting in 2014?
<A - David N. Farr>: You know, it – based on what we're seeing, based on, you know, what's being done across the
businesses, again, I still think that we're going to see an improvement not in the first half of this year, but more in the
process business starting sometime in the March/April/May time period. That's what I see based on talking to our
customers right now. They're still digesting the huge investments they made in 2012.
So I think that it's definitely – it's being discussed out there, our customer base has got the money to spend, it's a
question of are they ready to take on new projects, and I think they're going to start doing that as they get into the
springtime of 2014. So we see that coming at us, but it's more of a second half type of thing for us than a front half.

<Q - Mark Douglass>: Right. Okay, on climate, you were up double digit in U.S. Resi. It seems like you might be
out-pacing the market in your orders. Was it inventory build, was it something temporary? And does that give you
really a lot of confidence going into 2014 here? I assume so?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes, there's definitely not an inventory build in our customer base. There was – actually, the
pipeline had been so – had been taken down so low that there was a pretty good surge – there's obviously some new
transition going on to the next generation product which we're participating in. We saw a pretty good recovery there
late in the year, which is very good. I like where we look at this point in time going into the next year. I expect our
climate business to have a good growth year, both here, Europe and in Asia. They're due. And so I'm looking forward
to that.
<Q - Mark Douglass>: So are the new products that you – that helped drive in this quarter, there's going to be some
carryover into next year, too?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes, definitely, definitely. I mean, typically, typically this business does not just go one or two
quarters and then stop. It typically cycles pretty well. So I think we're due. They've had I think about had

two-and-a-half, three years of flat growth and now they're due. Inventory's pretty tight out there, but it's a very cyclical
business, our customer base waits till the very last second to start building.
<Q - Mark Douglass>: Right.
<A - David N. Farr>: Okay.
<Q - Mark Douglass>: And then final question on capacity. You know ex-dividends you're going to pay in 2014, the
share repurchases. What's your expected capacity over the next 12 to 18 months given your free cash flow and levering
up.
<A - David N. Farr>: What do you mean by capacity? I mean, how much free cash am I going to generate next year?
What do you mean by capacity?
<Q - Mark Douglass>: No. How much could you have available with leverage with free cash flow to put towards
M&A?
<A - David N. Farr>: Several billion dollars, I mean, you're – from our – if you look at our yearend financial
statement and our cash generation, you're looking at $3 billion, $4 billion, $5 billion we could do.
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: Easily, we've got strong cash flow and debt capacity. More than we're going to need.
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, more than we need at this point in time, exactly. But we've got the capability out there
and as we look at the interest rates being as low as they are, we'll take a hard look at the second half of next year, do we
want to do anything more relative to our ladder of a debt ladder, which we've kept in pretty good shape as these low
interest rates have been happening for a while now.
<Q - Mark Douglass>: Your comments on M&A is basically you don't really see enough to spend all of it at this
point?
<A - David N. Farr>: No, no. No, I don't.
<Q - Mark Douglass>: Okay, thank you.
<A - David N. Farr>: You're welcome.
Operator
Thank you and at this time I'm not showing any further questions. I would now like to turn it back to management for
any closing remarks. Please go ahead.
<A - David N. Farr>: Again, I want to thank everybody for joining us today. I hope all the people in China are safe
and don't get too much smog in their lungs, and I do want to thank again all the operating people both at the corporate
level and the divisional level for the excellent performance they did in the second half of this year as they brought
home a very good fiscal 2013 and I feel very good about returning to a very decent growth and very good earnings
growth as we look into 2014. Thank you, bye.
