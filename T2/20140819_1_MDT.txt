MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Vanessa and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to
welcome everyone to the Medtronic First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to
prevent any background noise.
After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would
now like to turn the call over to Mr. Jeff Warren. Please go ahead, sir.
Jeff Warren
Thank you, Vanessa. Good morning, and welcome to Medtronic's first quarter conference call and webcast. During the
next hour, Omar Ishrak, Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Ellis, Medtronic Chief Financial
Officer will provide comments on the results of our fiscal year 2015 first quarter which ended July 25, 2014. After our
prepared remarks, we'll be happy to take your questions.
First, a few logistical comments. Earlier this morning we issued a press release containing our financial statements and
the revenue by business summary. You should also note that some of the statements made during this call may be
considered forward-looking statements and that actual results might differ materially from those projected in any
forward-looking statement.
Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ is contained in our periodic reports
filed with the SEC. Therefore, we do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement. In addition, the
reconciliations of any non-GAAP financial measures are available on the Investors portion of our website at

Also, unless we say otherwise, references to quarterly results increasing or decreasing are in comparison to the first
quarter of fiscal year 2014 and all year-over-year revenue growth rates are given on a constant-currency basis.
And finally, today's earnings call does not constitute an offer to sell or solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or
solicitation of any vote or approval. In connection with the proposed Covidien transaction, Medtronic Holdings Limited
has filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 that includes a preliminary joint proxy statement of
Medtronic, Inc. and Covidien Plc that also constitutes a preliminary prospectus of New Medtronic. The registration
statement is not complete and will be further amended. After the registration statement has been declared effective by
the SEC, the final joint proxy statement prospectus will be mailed to Medtronic shareholders and Covidien
shareholders.
You should review materials filed with the SEC carefully as they will include important information regarding the
proposed transaction, including information about Medtronic and Covidien, the respective directors, executive officers
and certain other members of management and employees who may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of
proxies in favor of the proposed transaction. Please also review the disclaimer page at globalmedtechleader.com for
additional information on forward-looking statements and other important information on the proposed transaction.
With that, I'm now pleased to turn the call over to Medtronic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Omar Ishrak.
Omar S. Ishrak
Good morning and thank you, Jeff, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. This morning we reported first
quarter revenue of $4.3 billion which represents growth of 4% and Q1 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.93
growing 6%. Our Q1 revenue growth is in the middle of our outlook range for the year and within our mid-single-digit
baseline goal. Our overall organization again delivered balanced growth with strong performances in some areas
offsetting challenges in other parts of our business.
Significant this quarter was our performance in the U.S. where we grew 6%, the highest growth in this region for five
years. We believe mid-single digit growth in the U.S. can be sustained over the coming quarters based on the
momentum of our new products. Therapy innovation contributed over half of our global growth this quarter. When
combined with our focus on globalization and economic value, further enhanced our pending acquisition of Covidien,
we are well-positioned to further improve our competitive position and long-term growth profile.
As we have done previously, we intend to quantify, communicate and execute on each of our independent growth
factors. Our new therapies growth factor contributed 200 basis points to our overall growth in Q1, which is well within
our previously stated expectations for 150 basis points to 350 basis points. As I mentioned earlier, execution on several
key new product launches helped drive growth this quarter and looking ahead we believe our robust pipeline will
contribute significantly to our future growth.
Starting with the Cardiac and Vascular Group, our Reveal LINQ miniaturized cardiac diagnostic monitor, along with
strong above market performance in AF Solutions, are driving clear growth acceleration. This helped propel our
Cardiac Rhythm and Heart Failure business to 4% growth, a level of performance that we have generally not seen since
the core implantables market slowed down four years ago.
Over the past few years, the Cardiac Rhythm and Heart Failure team has systematically executed on a strategic plan,
delivering multiple new attractive growth drivers including AF and heart failure management products and services,
predictive diagnostics and deep miniaturization technologies. All of these growth drivers are clearly resonating in the
marketplace, more than offsetting pricing pressure in the more mature parts of the business.
Another highlight in Q1 was the strong execution by our Structural Heart team on the ongoing U.S. launch of the
CoreValve transcatheter valve. With the patent dispute behind us, our team is now laser-focused on what really matters
ensuring more patients have access to this life-saving therapy. The early results have exceeded expectations as we have

been aggressively opening new accounts and have captured over 40% of the U.S. market in just two quarters of
launching CoreValve.
Looking ahead in our Cardiac and Vascular Group, we will launch our recently approved Attain Performa quadripolar
lead system in the U.S. in the next few weeks, which coupled with our proven AdaptivCRT algorithm is expected to
improve our U.S. high power share as it already has in Europe and Japan. We also continue to make progress in a
number of other meaningful products in our pipeline, including our SEEQ cardiac diagnostic patch, CoreValve Evolut
R transcatheter valve, Resolute Onyx drug-eluting stent, IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon and Micra leadless
pacemaker.
It is worth noting that in Q1, we realigned our four CVG businesses into three business units organized around disease
states with a specific focus on comprehensive disease management. These changes allow us to better capitalize on
important trends in our global markets, including the general trend among global reimbursement models to focus
increasingly on disease outcomes versus discrete episodes of care, the growing importance of longitudinal patient
management in the cardiac rhythm and heart failure space, the increasing level of collaboration between physician
specialties and the newly-formed heart teams in the coronary and structural heart market, and finally the growing focus
on new technologies for peripheral vascular disease management and the aortic and peripheral market.
Turning now to our Restorative Therapies Group. Strong growth in neuromodulation and solid performance in surgical
technologies offset modest decline in Spine. In neuromodulation, the RestoreSensor SureScan MRI spinal cord
stimulation system and Activa DBS system continue to drive growth.
We also saw a resurgence of growth in Gastro/Uro due to improved procedure volumes. In surgical technologies our
team has balanced performance across ENT, neurosurgery and advanced imaging. We are excited about the recently
launched NuVent Sinus Balloon System. NuVent marks our first entry into the attractive sinus balloon dilatation
market, and we expect it to steadily take share in what is currently a $200 million opportunity.
We also strengthened the breadth of our neurosurgical portfolio through the acquisition of Visualase last month.
Visualase's MRI-guided laser ablation technology is an important addition to our portfolio of therapies for
neurosurgeons and broadens our overall market-leading RTG neuroscience portfolio.
In Spine, while revenue declined 3%, we believe factors weighing on Q1 were temporary and our plan to return to
growth in FY 2015 remains on track. Spine's overall performance in Q1 was primarily reflected by U.S. Core Spine,
which faced short-term pressure from inventory rebalancing and the timing of new product launches.
In addition to our recently approved PRESTIGE LP Artificial Cervical Disc, we are expecting to completely refresh our
anterior cervical plate portfolio and launch new interbodies with advanced materials and functionality over the coming
quarters.
Our Spine performance was also affected by year-over-year decline in BMP. However, we have now seen four quarters
of sequential stability in underlying demand for BMP, which should provide easier comparisons starting in Q2.
In Diabetes, the strong U.S. launch of the MiniMed 530G system with Enlite is driving solid double-digit growth in
both insulin pumps and CGM. Our focus on selling and supporting the pump and sensor as an integrated system is
translating into global share gains in insulin pumps and U.S. share gains in CGM.
The MiniMed 530G is the only system on the market that automatically stops insulin delivery if glucose levels fall
below a predetermined threshold, an important step towards our goal of developing a fully automated artificial
pancreas. Multiple peer-reviewed studies have demonstrated the value of our threshold suspend feature, including
publications in the New England Journal of Medicine and JAMA. Looking ahead, we're preparing to launch the
MiniMed 640G and 620G in international markets in Q2.
Our next growth factor, emerging markets, contributed 130 basis points to our overall company growth, which fell 20
basis points short of our minimum 150 basis point expectation. The main issues this quarter were in China and India.
Our Greater China region grew 6% as we dealt with some near-term challenges in the distributor channel and
management changes. We expect China to quickly return to double-digit growth for the remainder of the fiscal year.

India also had a difficult quarter declining 7% as we faced disruption from distributor terminations and inventory
rebalancing. We're executing a definite plan for optimizing our India distributor channels, and but this will take the
remainder of the fiscal year before we return to double-digit growth.
In both India and China, we are developing direct partnerships with healthcare providers of all sizes. In the long term,
this will result in the highest levels of business conduct standards, give us more direct contact with our end customers,
and unlock significant margin.
While India and China fell below expectations, our Middle East and Africa region continues to be an impressive source
of emerging market growth with results up 30% in Q1. We have a strong strategic plan in MEA executing on both large
channel wins as well as channel optimization opportunities.
Latin America also had a good Q1 with strong double-digit growth in Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. And in our Central
and Eastern Europe region we were encouraged to see that Russia returned to growth in Q1.
Despite the short-term challenges in certain regions, we remain confident and enthusiastic in the long-term outlook of
emerging markets. We continue to focus on developing new public-private partnerships. For example, I was recently in
China finalizing an agreement with a large sub-province.
Over the past nine months, we met frequently with local government officials there, quickly aligning around the need to
dramatically increase access to hemodialysis therapy. Our discussions resulted in a comprehensive partnership whereby
we will manufacture Medtronic hemodialysis products locally in return for manufacturing and commercial incentives,
including guaranteed purchases and support for accelerated regulatory approvals.
As we execute on these public and private partnerships as well as market development and channel optimization
strategies, we expect our emerging market growth to steadily improve and consistently contribute 150 basis points to
200 basis points to our overall growth.
Finally, service and solutions, our third growth factor, contributed 50 basis points to our overall growth, which was
within the 40 basis points to 60 basis points annual range that we have targeted. Our Cath Lab Managed Services
business continues to grow in Europe with numerous long-term contracts representing over $0.5 billion of revenue. We
continue to grow this business both within Europe and in other regions around the world and are in discussions with an
additional 150 healthcare systems.
Our Cardiocom business also continues to deliver strong results, driven in part by a growth of over 50% in patient
access support services for providers. We view Cardiocom as an important healthcare services platform to deliver
comprehensive integrated care solutions in the future.
Turning to the P&L, we made appropriate business trade-offs in Q1 to deliver on the bottom line. Non-GAAP EPS
growth was approximately 200 basis points above our revenue growth, in line with our targeted expectations. In
addition, we delivered $1 billion in free cash flow in Q1 after adjusting for certain litigation payments. And we
increased our dividend by 9%.
We remain focused on reliably delivering on our baseline financial model: mid-single-digit revenue growth, EPS
growth 200 basis points to 400 basis points faster than revenue growth, and returning 50% of our free cash flow to our
shareholders. To achieve these goals, we continue to execute on our three primary strategies: therapy innovation,
globalization and economic value.
We believe the Covidien acquisition will accelerate these strategies, bolstering our long-term market competitiveness
as well as the sustainability and consistency of our financial performance. In therapy innovation, Covidien's impressive
array of industry-leading products enhances our existing portfolio, offers greater breadth across clinical areas, and
creates exciting entry points into promising new diagnostics and therapies.
We believe Medtronic's deep clinical regulatory reimbursement and market development expertise will help accelerate
the rapid adoption in markets around the world. Our globalization strategy will also benefit from the power of our

combined companies. From a financial perspective, we will have a $3.7 billion Emerging Markets business that we are
confident can sustain double-digit growth over an extended period of time.
Covidien has extensive emerging market R&D and manufacturing, while Medtronic has well-established clinical
expertise. These capabilities applied across a much broader product offering will significantly increase the number of
attractive solutions that we can offer to governments and major providers.
Finally, this transaction enhances Medtronic's ability to deliver economic value to a broader range of stakeholders. The
value proposition of Covidien technologies primarily delivers hospital efficiency while the value of Medtronic's
chronic disease therapies are generally realized in post-acute settings. When combined, these complementary solutions
will create a robust and unmatched integrated health franchise. We feel that our industry-leading products, clinical
economic expertise, global footprint, and financial strength will position us to be the preferred partner for physicians,
hospital systems, patients, payers, and governments around the world.
In addition to being highly strategic, the Covidien acquisition is also extremely attractive financially, with achievable
cost synergies that are expected to make the transaction accretive in the first year on a cash basis and within two years
on a GAAP basis. The combined company will also generate significant free cash flow, which can be deployed with
much greater flexibility.
While there's been a lot of media and political noise about inversions, let me clarify that when the transaction closes,
Medtronic will continue to pay significant U.S. taxes and increase our investments in the U.S. On taxes, we will
continue to pay federal, state, and local income taxes on all U.S. earnings as well as Social Security taxes, property
taxes, and the medical device tax. Cumulatively, these taxes represent more than 45% of U.S. income and we expect to
pay a similar rate post-close.
In addition, this transaction will put us on an even playing field with foreign companies regarding use of
internationally-generated profits. This structure will allow us to invest much more aggressively in the U.S. and based
on that, we have committed to investing an incremental $10 billion over the next 10 years. These investments will
result in more high paying U.S. jobs.
We have a proven track record of creating U.S. jobs with our past acquisitions. For example, with Sofamor Danek,
AVE and MiniMed, we have created nearly 10,000 U.S. jobs since acquisition. More recently with Cardiocom, we
have more than doubled the work force in just 12 months. We also expect additional job creation with our recently
completed acquisitions of Visualase and Corventis, two U.S.-based companies. Our level of U.S. job creation will only
accelerate following this transaction.
In our view, acquiring Covidien is good for Medtronic, for our shareholders, for patients, and for the med tech industry,
and ultimately good for the U.S. economy. We remain fully committed to the Covidien transaction, which we expect to
close in calendar fourth quarter of 2014 or early 2015. Our integration planning efforts are well underway, led by Geoff
Martha, who is reporting directly to me. The integration team is staffed with top talent from both Covidien and
Medtronic and they are actively developing a comprehensive integration plan. In the end, we understand the success of
this transaction will depend on our ability to execute this integration plan upon closing.
Gary will now you take you through a more detailed look at our quarterly results. Gary?
Gary Lee Ellis
Thanks, Omar. First quarter revenue of $4.273 billion increased 5% as reported or 4% on a constant-currency basis
after adjusting for a $34 million favorable impact of foreign currency. Q1 revenue results by region were as follows:
growth in the Middle East and Africa was 30%; Latin America grew 14%; growth in the U.S. was 6%; greater China
grew 6%; growth in Central and Eastern Europe was 5%; other Asia-Pacific grew 4% with Western Europe and Canada
region declining 2%; Japan declined 5%; and South Asia declined 7%. Emerging markets grew the combined 11% in
Q1 and represented 13% of our total sales mix.

It is worth noting that results in Western Europe were negatively affected by a difficult comparison in Germany where
customers made advanced purchases of CoreValve product in Q1 last fiscal year in anticipation of the since-resolved
CoreValve injunction. Japan's performance was also affected by difficult comparisons from strong product launches in
the prior year as well as the biannual R-Zone adjustments.
Q1 diluted earnings per share on a non-GAAP basis were $0.93, an increase of 6%. Q1 GAAP diluted earnings per
share were $0.87, a decrease of 6%, driven primarily by the favorable change in fair value of contingent consideration
payments in the prior year. This quarter's GAAP to non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments included a $30 million net
restructuring charge, the final charge related to the initiative we announced last quarter, and a $41 million charge for
acquisition-related items primarily associated with transaction costs in connection with the pending Covidien
acquisition. It is worth noting that on a cash basis, Q1 diluted earnings per share were $0.99, an increase of 5%.
In our Cardiac and Vascular Group, revenue of $2.254 billion grew 3%. Results were driven by growth in low power,
structural heart, aortic and peripheral and AF and other, partially offset by declines in high power and coronary.
In Cardiac Rhythm and Heart Failure, formerly known as CRDM, revenue of $1.256 billion grew 4% and included $19
million of combined revenue from our Q2 acquisition of Cardiocom and Q3 acquisition of TYRX. High power revenue
of $627 million declined 5%. As we have noted over the last several quarters, we believe the best way to view the high
and low-power markets is on a rolling two-quarter basis given the variability in quarter-to-quarter dynamics.
We estimate that the global high power market growth profile is flat to slightly down with low-single-digit growth in
international markets offsetting low-single-digit declines in the U.S. We estimate we gained about a point of
international market share on a rolling two-quarter sequential basis, driven by the success of our Attain Performa
quadripolar CRT-D lead system, which was offset by CRT-D share loss in the U.S. Our U.S. growth is also affected by
difficult comparisons given where we are in our high power replacement cycle.
Going forward we expect our U.S. high power performance to improve as we launch the recently approved Attain
Performa system into the U.S. market during Q2. This system, with its differentiated AdaptivCRT algorithm, has
performed very well in international markets. In fact, in markets where we have launched the Attain Performa system,
our CRT-D share is up 160 basis points.
Low power revenue of $525 million grew 10% driven by the strong global launch of Reveal LINQ in our diagnostics
business. In June data from the CRYSTAL AF trial were published in the New England Journal, which showed our
Reveal monitor detected AF better compared to standard care in patients with recent cryptogenic strokes.
We continue to make progress on our global clinical trial for Micra and expect CE mark by the end of this fiscal year
with U.S. approval to follow in FY 2017. Micra, the world's smallest leadless pacemaker, is a true innovation in pacing
and features a novel delivery and fixation mechanism specifically designed for this new approach to prevent perforation
and dislodgment while still permitting repositioning and capsule retrieval.
Recently at Cardiostim, one and three-month data were presented on the first patients to receive Micra showing
successful implants in all patients with no major post-implant, device-related complications. AF Solutions grew over
30% as we continue to gain share in the AF market. Results were driven by robust growth of the Arctic Front Advance
CryoAblation system, which grew over 30% as well as strong double-digit growth from the international launch of our
PVAC Gold Phased RF system. We continue to enroll VICTORY AF, our U.S. pivotal study of phased RF
technologies in patients with persistent AF.
In our Coronary and Structural Heart business, which is the consolidated legacy Coronary and Structural Heart business
units, revenue of $766 million grew 1%. Coronary declined 2% although this performance was above market, driven by
2% growth in drug-eluting stents on the continued strength of our Resolute Integrity DES. Worldwide DES revenue in
the quarter was $279 million including $101 million in the United States and $24 million in Japan.
In the U.S. our DES share remains stable sequentially at approximately 30% despite a competitor's ongoing product
launch. Reported revenues in our Structural Heart business grew 6%. However, after adjusting for the difficult TAVR
comparisons in Germany that I mentioned earlier, our Structural Heart business grew in the upper teens driven by

exceptional performance from our transcatheter valves.
Making the same adjustment, we estimate that the global TAVR market is growing at around 30% including over 30%
growth in the U.S. Our global transcatheter valve revenue in the quarter was $131 million. The U.S. launch of
CoreValve is proceeding extremely well, with our U.S. share exceeding 40% in the second quarter of the launch. We
received FDA approval for high-risk patients in June adding to the extreme risk indication that we received in late Q3.
Our team is aggressively activating new centers with a presence now in 160 U.S. centers well ahead of our original
plans.
In international, we have completed enrollment in our CoreValve Evolut R CE mark trial and are expecting approval of
this differentiated next generation recapturable system with its 14 French equivalent delivery system later this fiscal
year. In addition, we expect to start enrolling our U.S. IDE study, Resolute R later this summer, a 250-patient
single-arm study with 30-day follow-up.
In our Aortic & Peripheral business formally known as Endovascular, revenue of $230 million grew 5%, or 7.0% after
adjusting for the divestiture of our Pioneer Plus product line in the voluntary product we call the below the knee DCB.
Aortic revenues grew 7% as our market-leading Endurant II and Valiant Captivia stood grasp and each gained two
points of share in the AAA and thoracic markets respectively.
Reported revenues for our Peripheral business declined in the mid-single digits in Q1. However, after adjusting for the
discontinued product lines just mentioned our Peripheral business grew in the high- single digits with strong
double-digit growth in SFA DCB products. During the quarter, we submitted our final data to the FDA for the
IN.PACT Admiral SFA drug-coated balloon and we were recently informed by the FDA that this PMA application will
be granted expedited review status. We now expect U.S. approval for IN.PACT Admiral by the end of this fiscal year.
Now turning to our Restorative Therapies Group. Revenue of $1.603 billion grew 3%. Results were driven by growth
in Neuromodulation and Surgical Technologies offset by declines in Spine. Spine revenue of $743 million declined 3%
with declines in core spine and BMP offsetting growth in Interventional Spine. Core Spine declined 2% with U.S.
declines offsetting international growth. Both the global and U.S. Core Spine markets appear relatively flat.
Our U.S. Core Spine business is expecting to launch a number of new products in FY 2015, but only limited set
quantities of a few of these products were available in Q1. We believe these new products will help drive a return to
growth in our Spine business in FY 2015. In addition to developing leading spine technology, our business continues to
focus on procedural innovation in our surgical synergy program, which integrates enabling technologies, surgical tools,
spinal implants and our expertise.
Interventional Spine, which primarily consists of our balloon kyphoplasty product line, grew 4%. U.S. Interventional
Spine growth was boosted by stabilizing trends in the use of BKP as well as our increasing participation in more
segments of the market. In the international markets, double-digit growth was led by strong performances in both
Germany and Japan. While there's still a lot of work to do in this business we are encouraged by these results.
Turning to Surgical Technologies, revenue of $381 million grew 5% with steady growth across all three businesses.
ENT grew in the mid-single digits driven by growth in monitoring and powered systems. ENT recently launched the
NuVent EM Sinus Dilation System, which is generating strong customer acceptance and is expected to contribute to
growth going forward.
Neurosurgery grew 3% with solid growth in Midas Rex power equipment, partially offset by fewer upgrades in large
capital equipment. In Advanced Energy, strong adoption of our proprietary Aquamantys tissue sealing and PEAK
PlasmaBlade technologies in the orthopedics, spine, breast, and cardiac device replacement markets drove solid
double-digit growth.
In Neuromodulation, revenue of $479 million increased 11% driven by solid growth in Pain Stim, DBS and
Gastro/Uro. In Pain Stim, our SureScan MRI spinal cord stimulation system continues to show strength in the market,
including positive surgeon feedback on leads durability and AdaptiveStim automatic stimulation adjustment.

In DBS, our neurologist referral development program in the U.S. and the strength of the early stim data in
international markets, which shows DBS provides superior benefits for patients with early motor complications from
Parkinson's disease, continues to drive double-digit new implant growth. Our Gastro/Uro business had solid growth in
Q1 driven by a rebound in implants in the United States.
In our Diabetes Group, revenue of $416 million grew 12%, driven by the ongoing U.S. launch of the MiniMed 530G
system, which includes the Enlite CGM Sensor, a smaller, more comfortable and more accurate sensor. In Q1 we
started the limited launch in Europe of MiniMed Duo with its combined CGM sensor and insulin infusion set. Early
feedback has been very positive due to the enhanced comfort and single insertion site.
At the ADA Scientific sessions in June, we announced a new strategic alliance with Sanofi, focused on developing
novel type 2 drug device combinations and care management devices. In July, the results of our OPTIMIZE trial were
published in Lancet, which showed that Medtronic insulin pumps deliver better glucose control for people with
insulin-dependent type II diabetes than multiple daily injections.
Looking ahead, we plan to launch our next generation MiniMed 640G system with predictive low glucose management
in international markets in Q2. Our MiniMed 620G Japanese language system is also expected to launch in Q2, which
will be the first integrated system in Japan. In addition, we are making good progress on our sensor pipeline as we
continue our advancement towards a closed loop system.
Turning to the rest of the income statement. It is worth noting that all of my forward-looking comments on outlook and
guidance do not contemplate the expected closing of the Covidien transaction. The Q1 gross margin was 74.1%. After
adjusting for a 30 basis point negative impact from foreign currency, the Q1 gross margin on a non-GAAP operational
basis was 74.4%.
The gross margin continues to include significant spending on additional resources, mostly diverted from R&D to
address quality issues in Neuromodulation and Diabetes, which negatively affected the Q1 gross margin by
approximately 40 basis points. The Q1 gross margin was also negatively affected by product mix shifts in Cardiac
Rhythm and Heart Failure as well as the R-Zone pricing adjustments of Japan, two items that will likely affect the gross
margin for the remainder of the fiscal year. Looking ahead, we continue to expect the gross margin for fiscal year 2015
to be in the range of 74.5% to 75% on an operational basis with Q2 expected to be at the lower end of this range.
First quarter R&D spending of $365 million was 8.5% of revenue. We continue to invest in new technologies as well as
generating clinical and economic evidence to drive future growth. We would expect R&D expense in FY 2015 to
remain around 8.5%.
First quarter SG&A expenditures of $1.506 million represented 35.2% of sales. After adjusting for the 10 basis points
positive impact from foreign exchange, Q1 SG&A was 35.3% driven by investments to drive CoreValve sales as well
as higher incentive payments due to the outperformance of new product launches. We continue to expect FY 2015
SG&A to be in the range of 33.7% to 33.9%, implying leverage of 50 basis points to 70 basis points on an operational
basis. For Q2, we expect SG&A to be around 34.5% on an operational basis.
Amortization expense for the quarter was $87 million. In FY 2015, we continue to expect amortization expense to
remain in the range of $85 million to $90 million per quarter. Net other expense for the quarter was $51 million
including net losses from our hedging program of $9 million. This result was favorable to our prior expectations due to
net certain litigation gains, milestone income from a Diabetes meter partnership and the accounting treatment on TAVR
royalties.
We hedged the majority of our operating results in developed market currencies to reduce volatility on our earnings
from foreign exchange. However, there is a growing portion of our profits that is un-hedged especially emerging
market currencies, which can create some modest volatility in our earnings.
Based on current exchange rates, we expect FY 2015 net other expense to be the range of $335 million to $375 million,
which includes an expected $125 million impact from the U.S. medical device tax, an incremental $13 million over FY
2014 as well as increased royalty expense from the Edwards agreement. For Q2 FY'15 we expect net other expense to

be in the range of $80 million to $90 million based on current exchange rates.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $5 million. At the end of Q1, we had approximately $14 billion from cash and
investments and $12.8 billion in debt. Based on current rates, we would expect Q2 FY 2015 net interest expense to be
in the range of $5 million to $15 million. Our non-GAAP nominal tax rate in Q1 was 19.1%. For FY 2015, we continue
to expect our non-GAAP nominal tax rate to be in the range of 18% to 20%, and we expect to be at the upper end of
this range until the presently-expired U.S. R&D tax credit is reinstated.
In Q1 we generated $1 billion in free cash flow net of certain litigation payments. We remain committed to returning
50% of our free cash flow, excluding one-time items, to shareholders. In Q1 we paid $304 million in dividends and
repurchased $1.1 billion of our common stock. In June, the Medtronic board of directors increase the dividend by 9%,
the 37th consecutive year of increased dividend payments. As of the end of Q1, we had remaining authorization to
repurchase approximately 42 million shares for a quarter average shares outstanding on a diluted basis were 1.005
billion shares.
It is important to note that the cash we received from stock option redemption which was $154 million in Q1 will also
continue to be used to repurchase shares on the open market to partially offset the dilutive impact. These share
repurchases are incremental to our commitment to return 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders. For FY 2015, we
would expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be approximately 998 million shares, including
approximately 994 million shares in Q2.
Let me conclude by providing our fiscal year 2015 revenue outlook and earnings per share guidance. We continue to
believe that constant currency revenue growth in the range of 3% to 5% is balanced and realistic for fiscal year 2015.
While we cannot predict the impact of currency movements, to give you a sense of the FX impact if exchange rates
were to remain similar to yesterday for the remainder of the fiscal year, then our FY 2015 revenue would be negatively
affected by approximately $40 million to flat, including a negative $20 million to nearly zero impact in Q2.
Turning to guidance on the bottom line. We continue to expect FY 2015 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the
range of $4.00 to $4.10. Based on current exchange rates, this implies earnings per share growth in the range of 6% to
9% on a constant-currency basis after taking into account the currently expected $0.05 to $0.07 negative foreign
currency impact to earnings.
As in the past, my comments on guidance do not include any unusual charges or gains that might occur during the
fiscal year. In addition, as I mentioned earlier, our outlook and guidance do not contemplate the impact of the expected
Covidien transaction.
I will now turn it back over to Omar.
Omar S. Ishrak
Thanks, Gary. And before opening the lines for Q&A, let me briefly conclude by stating that Q1 was another successful
balanced quarter. We continue to strive to reliably deliver on our baseline expectations. As we presented at our investor
conference in June, we expect our continued efforts to deliver consistent and reliable performance, combined with a
disciplined capital allocation, will enable us to create long-term dependable value in healthcare and looking ahead, we
believe this will be further strengthened and diversified by Covidien acquisition.
With that, we will now open the phone lines for Q&A. In addition to Gary, I've asked Mike Coyle, President of our
Cardiac and Vascular Group; Chris O'Connell, President of our Restorative Therapies Group; and Hooman Hakami,
President of our Diabetes Group to join us. We're rarely able to get to everyone's questions so please limit yourself to
only one question and, if needed, one related follow-up. If you have additional questions, please contact our Investor
Relations team after the call.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan.
<Q - Mike J. Weinstein>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe I can get a couple in just on the
product front. So first is the 40% plus share comment in transcatheter valves I'm sure caught people's attention. Can
you just talk about how that progressed over the quarter? And I ask because, obviously, you were dealing with the
potential injunction overhang in the first part of the quarter and you resolved that with the settlement with Edwards in
late May. So can you just talk about that commentary? Was that 40% plus comment true for the whole quarter? Or was
that particularly true in maybe the back half of the quarter?
And then the second product I was hoping to get an update on was the IN.PACT Admiral drug-coated balloon. I believe
you submitted the data on the final module at the end of May. Do you have any update from the FDA on whether you
will need to go to an advisory panel? Thanks.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Mike, I think you can take both of these.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Sure. So the transcatheter valve side, of course, that comment about 40% market share is a
U.S. statement. We basically have been proceeding with the launch as we described it actually a little bit ahead of
schedule in terms of the total number of accounts that have been opened and the training of those accounts. And we
actually are getting a little higher share in the accounts we've activated than we were expecting when we were talking
at the Analyst Meeting.
So we think our overall market share position's in the low 40s and depending on how you want to treat royalty income,
which our competitor treats as revenue, we tend to exclude it for purposes of that calculation on overall market share.
On the IN.PACT Admiral that we have heard from FDA in terms of the fileability of our PMA. They have accepted it
for filing with no major deficiencies. They have told us they are going to treat this as an expedited review. They have
not yet given us a definitive answer on whether a panel is going to be required or not.
<Q - Mike J. Weinstein>: Okay. Perfect. Let me ask one follow-up. Can you just comment on the regulatory path for
the Covidien transaction, how things are progressing with China, the U.S. and any other geographies of note? Thanks.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Things are progressing, Mike, as we have thought. I think the schedule for the end of the
calendar year or early calendar 2015 is what we expected when we started the process and it still holds. The China
approval is a little slower. It takes a little longer and oftentimes after the process starts, after we've made some progress
in the U.S. and Europe. So things are going along just as we had expected. There are no major surprises and I think we
still expect this to close, as I said, towards the end of the year or early next year.
<Q - Mike J. Weinstein>: Thank you, Omar. I'll let some others jump in.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Okay. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Hi, Matt.
<Q - Matthew J. Dodds>: If we look at the expense side on gross margin and SG&A, you came in a little lower than
we thought on gross margin and a little higher on SG&A. The full year guidance is really unchanged. You've got a big
improvement it looks like in the back half of the year. I guess for you, Gary, for the gross margin are a lot of these
issues going to linger? Or are some temporary other than FX? And then on SG&A, how much of the CoreValve launch
and this incentive pay was front-end loaded meaning that it was really focused in the first quarter and it will drop?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Gary?
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yeah. I can take both of those, Matt. I mean as far as the gross margin goes we do expect the
gross margin will improve as we go through the year. There was, as we indicated, it was a little lower here in the first
quarter due to some things that we've known about, which are the quality cost in Neuro and Diabetes.
We also ended up having this was the product mix having a little bit lower ICD revenue in this quarter before the new
product has been launched and with LINQ, which is a little bit lower margin product. That had a mix issue into Q1, but
as we go forward and ICDs pick up again we should be back up in the 74.5% to 75% range as we indicated.
We also expected the issues you addressed on the quality side within Neuro and Diabetes as we go through the year
that will also start to come down and, as you indicated, FX we, obviously, assume will start to become a minimized
issue as we go through the rest of the year. So 74.5% to 75% with Q2 improving but still be kind of at the low end of
that range and then continuing to improve as we go through the year.
SG&A was a little more here in Q1. We kind of had expected that. We knew we were launching a lot of these new
products with LINQ, CoreValve and we just knew we were going to have some higher expectations around the
expenses on those items. But it was in line with basically our expectations and as we go through the rest of the year
those investments will, obviously, will start to leverage as the revenue continues to build in both those product lines.
And so we're expecting that the guidance we gave for SG&A in total still remains on track and we're not concerned
about it at this point.
<Q - Matthew J. Dodds>: Can I ask a quick follow-up to Mike? Okay?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yeah. Go ahead.
<Q - Matthew J. Dodds>: All right. So, Mike, now that the litigation's over, can you say on CoreValve are you still
capacity constrained? Or is that not an issue because it was a good quarter right out of the chute in the U.S.?
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Well, we've been staying ahead of the demand. It's been challenging for our operations
groups to stay ahead of the demand but they have been doing that and we have not done any bulking of product or
advanced purchase of product. So we're essentially selling as we implant and we expect that that will continue here
during the next quarter.
<Q - Matthew J. Dodds>: Thanks, Mike. Thanks, Gary.
<A - Jeff Warren>: Yeah. Next question?

Your next question comes from the line of David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Good morning. Maybe just one for Omar maybe a quick follow-up. Omar, just I appreciate
your comments on the deal and the commitment relative to Covidien. I wonder if you can comment at all on this
transaction under various different transaction structures, whether they may be remedies proposed by Treasury or
Congress or pursuing this deal, it would add an inversion structure. You talked a little bit about that on the day of the
deal announcement. I would if you could sort of update us on your views about the commitment to this transaction
under different scenarios?

<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yeah. Well, as I've mentioned repeatedly and consistently, the strategic benefits of this
transaction are very clear which I laid out today and earlier. We are excited about that. We feel as we go through our
integration planning process, we feel even more confident and excited about the strategic benefits of this combined
company. So that's the driver for the whole thing. But we can only plan a deal structure based on facts and what the
current regulations and law are. And so that's why we structured it the way we structured it.
If those things change before the close then we'd have to take a look at what those changes reflect and see what we can
do to structure a new contract of some sort. But in all cases, the strategic benefits do not go away and are clearly not
affected by any legislative or regulatory changes. So that's the way we're looking at it. It's pointless to speculate on
what those new changes could be. It could be a variety of things, if any, so we prefer to stay away from that and stay
focused on getting the regulatory actions taken care of as quickly as possible and then get this transaction closed and
start to reap the strategic benefits.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Great. Very helpful. And then one other important element of the strategy, obviously, is
emerging markets and I know you talked about it in your prepared remarks, but maybe you could just help us
understand really two things. It sounds like there are underlying distribution changes in both India and China. Maybe
help us understand why you're undertaking these distribution challenges. Is it really for greater long-term revenue
growth? Was it to respond to recent revenue depression? That would be very helpful. And then do you think this
quarter or sometime in the next two quarters we could see a trough in the growth rate in either India or China? Thank
you.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yeah. Thanks, David. First of all, the distribution changes, as you correctly point out, we're
making are long term in nature. Look, we view emerging markets, like I said before, as a key growth driver not just for
the next few years but for decades, literally decades because that's the nature of the opportunity. We're only addressing
the premium segment when we get to value segment and the underserved, this is going to go on for a very long time.
And as a result, if you really talk of the long term, the revenues from these regions will be big and certainly at par with
what we get from developed markets. And we cannot have in that kind of a scenario go through indirect channels of –
where we do not have direct control with respect not only to business conduct standards, but also and more importantly
with respect to direct connection with our customers because we have to develop these markets. So these are changes
that we have to undertake.
In addition, some of the management changes reflect upgrading some of the people because the nature of the business
is more sophisticated than it once was. So these really are platform changes that we're making. They're necessitated by
our long-term aspirations, and we feel we can cover it within our present business profile. And so we're going ahead
and making these changes which we feel will have a positive impact not only in our relationships and long-term growth
but also on our margin in these regions, which already is good but can improve further. So that's essentially the outlook
and the strategic thought process behind emerging markets.
In terms of our trough, we are projecting both India and China to be double-digit growth, China certainly in the
mid-teens and India maybe even close to that by the end of the year, in other words, for the full year. And so that will
require an acceleration in the second half. I think it'll be different between India and China. There's still some variables
in this so I can't be certain but that's certainly our projection as of today that going into the second half of the year, we'll
start to see a noticeable acceleration of growth in both of those regions.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Thanks. Thank you very much.

<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Question. Omar, I was wondering if you could just maybe comment a little bit about some
of the revised numbers that Covidien put out within your proxy just in terms of the outlook. What gives you the
confidence in the longer-term growth profile there? And what, if anything, have you learned or makes you more
confident in the revenue trajectory or perhaps even the cost synergies with some of the early work under your belt with
the transaction?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I've been visiting many of the sites and understanding their products. A number of early
observations that I have: first of all, Covidien has a track record and has built a track record of revenue growth in the
mid-single digits, and they have a diversified enough revenue pool, both geographically as well as from a product and
customer basis, that appears to me that it's quite sustainable, and fairly tolerant of one-off market dynamics here and
there, whether it be product or geography. So that is reassuring. We knew that going in but a deeper dive confirmed
that.
Equally importantly, as we go to the different sites, the future growth platforms that we can build by accelerating some
of the technical technology integrations or channel integrations, there appear to be a lot of possibilities. I think our
biggest challenge will be to focus and make sure we prioritize the ones which will have the right returns and not go
after ones that are potentially big but have perhaps returns, which are more risky or even longer term.
So I think the prioritization exercise will be our biggest challenge. We've already stated that the two areas, which will
be the highest priority, are in peripheral vascular and in neuroscience, and those are like many integration teams
progressing and going ahead in those areas. The others will be longer term.
In Surgical Technologies and their surgical solutions, there's clearly opportunity both in terms of product integration for
common call points as well as technical technology integration in future products. In addition, some of their capital
equipment products and their monitoring products have longer-term synergy impact on both our Hospital Solutions
teams as well as our Home Monitoring business in Cardiocom. I think that's about all I can say, Kristen, at this point.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. And then just on the cost synergy side, do you still feel confident that that at least
$850 million number is the right number?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Yes. I don't think there's any sort of doubt around that. I think all the work that we're doing is
confirming that that's an achievable number.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. Then just last question.
<A - Jeff Warren>: Thanks, Kristen. Next question.

Your next question comes from the line of Bob Hopkins from Bank of America.
<Q - Robert A. Hopkins>: Thanks. Can you hear me okay?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Sure. Yeah. Go ahead.
<Q - Robert A. Hopkins>: Great. Good morning. So I wanted to ask two quick questions first on the CRM market
outlook, excluding LINQ, which obviously is going very well, it looks like the CRM market is just a little bit worse
than we thought this quarter, and I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the market dynamics in CRM? Is
pricing a little bit worse than you thought? And what, at this point, is your outlook for CRM market growth as you look
forward?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Go ahead, Mike.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: So I think the overall low power market actually looks quite encouraging. I think we've seen
stabilization of the market demand although we are seeing, obviously, some renewed pricing pressure. I mean we're
now looking at 3% to 5% declines in ASPs in the U.S. in both pacing and ICDs currently. However – and that's because

we basically have anniversaried the major launches that we've had. However, obviously, we're about to enter a new
launch cycle on the high-power side with CRT-D, and we think that's going to help us in terms of improving the overall
pricing dynamics.
In terms of the overall unit market growth, we are seeing essentially flattish unit growth in the ICD market with low
single-digit increases in initial implants being offset by declines in the replacement cycle mostly because of where we
are in our replacement cycle. So we believe the market going forward is flattish and that's what we're planning for,
although it's encouraging, from my perspective, to see overall U.S. implantables growth for us at 4%. I mean we
haven't seen that in quite some time and so, obviously, it's a good time to have a product like LINQ being added into
the overall mix for implantables.
<Q - Robert A. Hopkins>: All right. That's helpful. And then, Omar, I just wanted to ask one question for you as a
follow-up on the emerging market commentary that you've made thus far. Specifically on China, I was wondering if
you could just provide just a little more detail on the specific changes that you're making in China currently so we can
get a better understanding of the outlook for China long term and understand why those changes are being made?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I think this is mostly harmonizing our distribution channels and also making sure that we've
got processes in place so the inventory levels are right, and thirdly to make sure that specific programs will allow us to
go direct to certain major customers to start with. And maybe one other point here, we're also starting a program to go
after tier two cities in China where there's a lot of opportunity. And there we're thinking of certainly some combined
products into a single channel around cardiology primarily.
So those are the changes that we're making. The biggest impact ones are really sort of fine-turning our distribution
channels themselves, the specific distributors and harmonizing them, streamlining them; more focused, fewer of them
because that's essential to be able to maintain control both from a business conduct perspective as well as a
end-customer reach perspective.

Your next question comes from the line of Bruce Nudell from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Omar, regarding the transaction, some people
on the buy side have a little bit of consternation about the prospects for the minimally invasive surgery franchise of
Covidien. And on the other hand, you're going to have a broader playground to work in and more applications that you
could tailor this. But specifically, people are somewhat concerned about J&J resurgence, robotics, et cetera. How do
you view the long-term prospects of that series of applications?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: I've had a chance to visit two of their plants where they work on these areas, both in terms of
the minimally invasive area as well as their Advanced Energy businesses. And you really have to look at the two
together because some of the tools are integrated with their minimally invasive products to create actually a more
integrated offering than many of the competitors have.
So I felt, I left those visits with a clear sense that there's a lot of focus on innovation, on next-generation products and
from a position of strength not from a position of catching up, which actually in these areas make quite a difference
because some of these product lines require a lot of clinical expertise and clinical know-how and clinical intuition, if
you like, in their development, and I felt that the teams that I visited have very strong experience in those areas, good
product positions today and very exciting technology plans for the future.

So there's competition always and J&J's a good competitor, but I've got every confidence in the teams there in place in
Covidien. So the people that I've met are absolutely capable of not only competing against any one, both from an edge
and adage perspective but also from a technical and clinical know-how perspective.
<Q - Bruce M. Nudell>: Thanks. And I guess my follow-up either you or Gary could speak to, clearly the
administration wants some changes in the inversion attractiveness and one of the things that's difficult to model or at
least more challenging for us to model, if the law does change, how will you kind of assess the value of access to
ex-U.S. cash? Just schematically, how should we be thinking about that value if worst, in fact, does come to worst?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Look, this is difficult for us to model, too. We don't know what it's going to be and it's pure
speculation, so at this stage, we just did the model based on the current law and we're really not wasting our time trying
to figure out five different iterations that may or may not happen. So at this stage, we're just sticking to what we know.
<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yeah, Bruce, just to add, obviously, we've been clear that one of the advantages of outside the
strategic benefit of Covidien is that we do get access to our o-U.S. cash and that's the question that's going to have to be
addressed, if there are changes to any rules or regulations, we're going to have to determine how do we get access to
that because that's going to be the benefit of it. But as Omar said, right now it would just be pure speculation on our
part and we're not even doing any modeling because we have no idea whether there will be changes at all as we move
ahead. We're just trying to close the transaction.
<A - Jeff Warren>: Yeah. Thanks, Bruce. Next question.

Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Taylor from Barclays.
<A - Jeff Warren>: Matt?
<Q - Matthew C. Taylor>: Hi. I wanted to ask on emerging markets and you talked a little bit about some of the
changes in China and India. There has been a couple reports about China looking to really source some more products
locally. I wondered if you could talk to how that could impact your strategy longer term and whether it just means you
need to change the structure of some of your partnerships and how you may be able to continue to win there if the
market goes more towards local products?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: You know there hasn't been any broad move of that nature in China that's consistent across the
whole country for all products. So I'm not sure that that'll be driven by broad-based regulation. However, China's a big
enough market on its own with unique customer requirements that local manufacturing of various sorts will be
something that's going to happen in China and so we're committed to that.
As you know, we already have strong local manufacturing in orthopedics and spine where we've established it over
many years and accelerated by our recent acquisitions. We have also, just last quarter, finalized a agreement with
Lifetech, which will allow us to manufacture pacemakers locally, and then finally, as I mentioned on the call building a
very promising partnership with one of the sub-provinces for the manufacture of hemodialysis equipment and that
platform may also grow to include other products.
Covidien, by the way, also has very strong manufacturing and R&D capabilities in China. So put together, we will have
enough options to be able to go local in China, depending on what the regulations may be. But we hope that we don't
have to wait for regulations but are on the leading-edge of this and doing it because of true customer demand that we
sense so that we can fulfill local needs in the most appropriate fashion. So I think we're very well-positioned to take
advantage of any change or otherwise in China for manufacturing.
<Q - Matthew C. Taylor>: Thanks. And I know you're focused on closing the transaction and you can't speculate on
what's going to happen. I think it's been a little bit surprising to see some of the rhetoric. Some of the things that are
being said by politicians are erroneous. What has surprised you most about some of the potential changes that are being

talked about? And do you feel like your message about investing in the U.S. and tax is resonating with Capitol Hill?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Look, I think it's fair to say that our message around reinvesting in the U.S. has been positively
received by everybody. I think that's fair. And I think in the mix of this is beyond Medtronic. It's just an overall number
of transactions that are potential that's causing some consternation, I guess.
Again, there's not much we can do about those things. We're going to put our message out there as accurately as
possible and in as genuine a fashion as we know how. And then focus on the strategic benefits and make sure that we
know how to dial those in. I think that's all we can do at this stage. I'm not prepared to comment on any political
sentiments that may be there.

Your next question comes from the line of Josh Jennings from Cowen & Company.
<Q - Josh T. Jennings>: Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks a lot for taking the questions. Just two quick ones for
Mike Coyle to follow up on Bob's question on the CRM business. If you think about the U.S. ICD business as being
one of the anchors to corporate-wide growth, you do have a new quad-pole system that's been approved, but can you
help us, Mike, take us through some of the puts and takes of the pressures that you've been experiencing? You did
mention in one of your previous comments about the replacement cycle for Medtronic specifically.
But I think, Chris O'Connell, one of the other anchors to top line growth has been the Spine business. The projection is
to get back to growth in fiscal 2015. Can you talk about the path to get back to at least market growth rates for the U.S.
ICD business?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Before Mike and Chris jump in, I do want to point out that although those are both important
markets, the level of diversification that we now have across our entire business makes us much more resilient due to
changes in just those two market segments. And we continue to go ahead in that dimension, not because those two
markets aren't important, but because there are several others as well. And to the degree that we can diversify our
overall business and continue to do so, it is a very important initiative for us. So with that, I'll let Mike go ahead and
talk about the ICD market.
<A - Michael J. Coyle>: Yeah, first relative to ICD is that I think the challenges in the quarter are U.S. challenges. If
you look internationally, [ph] the fact that (1:07:35) market share capture and overall market growth and so we expect
the CRT-D product entry is going to be a big aid to that issue. But as Omar pointed out, the fact that we actually are
able to see growth in the overall implantables segment because of the addition of the new product category essentially
in LINQ is really going to help drive growth there.
And you're, obviously, now looking at a low power segment that is, in this reported quarter, is showing market growth
in the 3% to 4% range, which we haven't seen in that segment for quite some time. So we have a very diversified
product portfolio across CVG with a number of new growth drivers to offset areas of flat performance and, obviously,
that's showing up in the numbers this quarter.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Chris, do you want to comment as well?
<Q - Josh T. Jennings>: Great, thanks.
<A - Christopher James O'Connell>: Sure. Josh, on Spine, as Omar stated, the U.S. core was a little soft in the
quarter and we were expecting some of that really due to the timing of some of the new product launches. As you
know, we just got FDA approval on PRESTIGE LP, which is a really exciting development. We had some revenue for

that modeled in Q1 that we're now into Q2 on. We also mentioned the BMP, which was down in the quarter, but we've
just anniversaried the Yale results and, as Omar pointed out, we've had four sequential quarters of underlying stability.
So those factors and some other real positives, international spine, particularly the developed markets, is doing well and
growing better than it has in recent quarters and we had a positive Kyphon quarter and are encouraged by that. So when
you put all that together, particularly the new product cadence in the U.S., we think we have a good pathway towards
growing the U.S. Spine business this fiscal year.
<Q - Josh T. Jennings>: And one quick follow-up on the IN.PACT – yeah.
<A - Jeff Warren>: You got one last one?
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Go ahead.
<Q - Josh T. Jennings>: Yeah. Just a quick one on the IN.PACT franchise, two data sets in drug-coated balloons have
at least top line data for IN.PACT and the full data set for Lutonix. Can you talk about the international marketplace
there for peripheral balloons? It sounds like you grew double digits and then also when we may see a publication from
the IN.PACT study? Thanks a lot.
<A - Christopher James O'Connell>: Yeah. Just to keep in mind right now the overall drug-coated balloon market is
like a $50 million to $60 million global market so we have that very nice growth with the SFA indication outside the
U.S. north of 20% but we haven't yet published the data, that we're expecting to happen here in the fall which we think
will be a nice catalyst for international market growth. And, obviously, as we've seen in a lot of market segments the
U.S. PMA approval tends to be a catalyst for global growth as the data really gets validated and then published and
assessed and, obviously, that's the kind of data we have with the IN.PACT Admiral SFA. So we are anxious to see U.S.
approval. We think that will be a catalyst not only for growth in the U.S. but also internationally.
<A - Jeff Warren>: Thanks, Josh. One last question.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: One big picture question in Q2 calendar year, all of the public hospital companies saw
an improvement in procedure volume in the U.S. but that didn't show up in most med tech companies Q2 results except
yours and yours seem to have been driven largely by new products. So can you talk about what you're seeing from a
procedure standpoint in the U.S. through July?
And then just for my follow-up, I'll throw it out now, I'm sure the TAVR worldwide market growth numbers caught
people's attention. I think you said the U.S. and worldwide was growing over 30%, so can you talk about what you're
seeing and what's causing that acceleration since you launched CoreValve? Thank you.
<A - Omar S. Ishrak>: Let me take the first one. I think you're right, in fact, I know you're right, our growth in the
U.S. was driven by innovation, by our new products and their launches and their uptake as opposed to general
procedure volume growth, which was sort of low-single digit if not flat overall. So I think, as we expected, the impact
of more patients coming into the system, if any, is not something that affects the med tech companies because we're
generally focused on acute care and the level of patients that eventually flow through to acute care from the increased
coverage that's in place now is just relatively small and so that's why we're not really seeing any dramatic change in
procedure volumes.
However, we're very encouraged and excited by seeing the impact of new products, which goes to show that innovation
in this market, no matter how flat it may be and whatever people may say about it if you have true innovation, you can
get growth in the U.S. So that's exciting for us. Do you want to take the...

<A - Gary Lee Ellis>: Yeah. And then on the TAVR market growth, obviously, there've been a number of important
catalysts that have taken place over the last six months with data, obviously, both the extreme risk and high risk patient
populations and the mortality benefit in the high risk patient population is itself a catalyst for the approval by FDA of
those expanded indications, the entry of one of our competitors into Japan and the fact that there are more companies
now talking about TAVR in Europe because of the essentially trialing of their new products. All of those things are
basically validating the broader role that TAVR can play in the treatment of aortic stenosis and that's what is driving
the overall market growth.
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: Thanks for taking the questions, guys.
Omar S. Ishrak
Okay. So thanks, everyone, for all your questions and we look forward to updating you on our progress in our Q2 call,
which we anticipate holding on November 18. And with that and on behalf of our entire management team, I'd like to
thank you all again for your continued support and interest in Medtronic. Thank you and have a great day.
