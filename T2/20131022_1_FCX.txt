Before we begin our comments, we'd like to remind everyone that today's press release and certain of our comments on
this call include forward-looking statements. We'd like to refer everyone to the cautionary language included in our
press release and presentation materials and to the risk factors described in our SEC filings.
On the call today, Jim Bob Moffett, our Chairman of the board; Richard Adkerson, Vice Chairman, President and Chief
Executive Officer, Jim Flores, Vice Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Freeport-McMoRan Oil &
Gas. And we also have another, a number of senior executives in the room today with us.
I'll briefly summarize the financial results and then turn the call over to Richard, who will be referring to our slide
materials located on our website. As usual, after our remarks, we'll open up the call for questions.
Today, FCX reported net income attributable to common stock of $821 million or $0.79 per share for the third quarter
of 2013, which compared with $824 million or $0.86 per share for the third quarter of 2012. The third quarter 2013
results included net charges for unrealized mark-to-market losses on oil and gas derivative contracts, totaling $98
million to net income or $0.09 a share. As you'll see in the third quarter, our results benefited from a return to normal
operations at Grasberg and we had a significant contribution from a full quarter of results from the recently acquired oil
and gas business.
Our consolidated third quarter copper sales totaling over 1 billion pounds were 13% above the year ago period. We had
higher production throughout our global mining business and our gold sales were 50% above last year's third quarter
because of anticipated higher ore grades in Indonesia. Our third quarter sales of oil and gas totaled 16.5 million barrels
of oil equivalent. That was about 10% higher than our July 2013 estimate of 15 million barrels of oil equivalent, that
primarily reflected, as Jim will be talking about, strong performance in the Eagle Ford and the Deepwater Gulf of
Mexico fields.
Our third quarter 2013 average recorded copper prices of $3.28 per pound were below last year's third quarter of $3.64
and gold prices of $1,329 were just over 20% below the year-ago quarter. Oil prices were strong in the quarter with
Brent pricing averaging almost $110 per barrel and the realization by our oil and gas division was – oil realization was
$106 per barrel before hedging impacts.
We generated strong operating cash flows of $1.9 billion in the quarter; that was net of about $300 million in working
capital uses and our operating cash flows exceeded capital expenditures of $1.6 billion during the quarter. We ended
the quarter with total debt of $21.1 billion; that was similar to our June 30 balances. Our consolidated cash balance
totaled $2.2 billion at the end of June and that was, at the end of September and that was reflecting a $1 billion
supplemental dividend which was paid during the third quarter.
I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard, who will be going through the slide materials.
Richard C. Adkerson
Good morning, everyone. You've heard us talk about, all throughout 2013, about the word execution and that's been the
theme for our management team as we combined our new oil and gas business with our existing mining business. And
what's so good about this quarter, as you saw, it was the first full quarter of oil and gas operations. We had strong
execution across all of our business, and that's really what we're going to be focused on going forward.
Kathleen talked about the strong margins and cash flow for the quarter, and that reflected solid operating performance
from our global mining business, and particularly important was the improvement at Grasberg and its operations, as it
is now returning to more normal grade access because of our mining sequencing and improved operating performance
at that important asset.
Really happy to report that today in Indonesia, our last night, we signed our CLA agreement for the next two years. The
good news with that is that we avoided any kind of work stoppage. The strike two years ago was a major negative for
all the stakeholders involved there and with this new CLA agreement, we are going forward on a more positive basis
with our workforce in general and with the union. Both sides are – while neither side got everything it wanted, both

sides are very happy with the results and it's an important step for our company.
And the quarter reflects the significant contribution from our oil and gas business and that's very exciting. Jim is going
to be talking about the details of that in a few minutes. Our expansion projects in our mining business progressed. The
Morenci expansion is on track for completion in the first half of next year. At Cerro Verde, we've completed 70% of
the engineering. Construction is in progress. I visited the operations a couple of weeks ago and it was good to see the
ground works making great progress and we're starting physical construction, ordering equipment and going forward
with that project.
In the oil and gas area, the Lucius development is progressing, so that we would have first production next year and
that's a very exciting project and really a precursor for other things that we can be doing from an exploration standpoint
in the Deepwater of the Gulf of Mexico.
We're continuing to emphasize throughout our operations the need for cost and capital discipline and that is a theme for
all of our efforts in these marketplaces and the cash position, debt position that Kathleen talked about reflect the fact
that we paid $1 per share supplemental dividend the 1st of July.
And looking at the financial highlights, which for your information are included on page four, and that Kathleen talked
about it, reflects the strong volumes, the improvement in our unit cost situation from a mining standpoint. Net unit cost
is now – for the quarter was below $1.50 a pound. So we have high margins there, down from $1.85 in the second
quarter and then we have strong volumes, very strong margins in our oil and gas business. 90% of that revenue is
driven by oil products and that gives us the kind of strong margins that we have.
From copper market standpoint, I was at APEC in Bali and then at LME Week and there was a lot of talk about Asia,
economic activity, and the levels of demand. China remains, of course, the important global user of copper and the
source of copper growth globally. The demand in China during this year has been stronger than many people expected.
The Chinese are confident about their economy going forward and all our indications from our business there is
optimistic. What we're also seeing is improvement in the U.S. demand in sectors that are important to copper usage.
Construction, both residential and commercial, automobile activity is very positive and despite all the political
uncertainties associated with economy, our business and our customers' business in the U.S. in the current conditions is
progressing well, and we're seeing some initial signs of improvement in Europe through some demand activities.
Globally, premiums for downstream copper uses are strong. Consumer inventories remain low and the demand side is
positive. Many people are pointing to copper supply issues and as Grasberg and Escondida have returned to more
normal levels of operations, that's providing more copper. There's some development projects that are going to be
coming on stream in the next two years, but the projected surpluses that people are pointing to are small in relation to
the overall marketplace and lots of things can happen that would change that outlook as it has over the past 10 years
when we've seen our copper supply continually underperforming expectations.
And longer run, the delay in projects, companies cutting back capital is – points to a supportive supply situation for
copper in the long run and we remain very optimistic about that.
The slide 6 shows our unit cost by region and our sales by region. During the third quarter, we saw improvements in
every region where we operate, most notably at Grasberg as it has returned to higher grades and more normal
operations.
And as we look forward, the higher volumes of Grasberg as we complete mining from the open pit over the next few
years will be very supportive of our overall cost structure. Volumes performed well, particularly in North America, Red
Conger is here, and as I mentioned Grasberg, we had a very strong quarter in Africa, even though at the very end of the
quarter, we and other miners there were affected by power deliveries, that's something we're working with the
government on to rectify but our team there is doing a great job in running the business and managing the mining and
logistics operations there.
We were short of our expectations even though volumes were up in South America because of ore characteristics both
the Candelaria and El Abra. These are kind of short-term issues that we manage our way through. It was a good quarter

with our volumes up – just weren't up as much as we had initially expected and we're working to deal with that as we
go forward into 2014.
The oil and gas business has its regional operation results summarized on page seven. You can see very strong margins.
California, historically a high cost place to operate, with the kinds of levels of global oil pricings and the nature of our
revenue realizations there, it is a high margin business. And then you look at the Eagle Ford, the onshore South Texas
shale play and the Deepwater in the Gulf of Mexico, you can see just how attractive operations are in that business.
And then from operating results, California was on expectations. Eagle Ford, which with its gas, liquids production
averaged 46 million BOE a day. The operations there went very well and the Deepwater outperformed. We benefited
from the fact we didn't have – we had a quiet storm season through the end of September and no interruptions there.
But overall, it's really gratifying to see just how well our new business activities operated there.
Grasberg, you can see on page 8, the details of my comments about returning to more normal levels of operations
where our mill rates was at 200,000 tons a day. Copper grades were essentially at our reserve grade levels and our unit
cost levels were down from that. We expect a strong volume situation going into the fourth quarter. We're going to
have some unusual sales activity in that quarter. We're expecting we'll have a fairly large intercompany sales deferral
because Atlantic Copper has been engaged in a turnaround that occurs every eight years. That's being completed, but it
will result in some deferrals of intercompany sales during the fourth quarter, that we think will have an impact of about
$0.05 a share. But operationally, we are anticipating a good quarter and we're certainly off to a great start this year, I
mean, this quarter in October.
Our projects, which I mentioned at the outset, are going well. The Tenke project is essentially complete other than
adding a new acid plant there. That project was on time and within budget in a very difficult place to achieve that kind
of performance. And Cerro Verde is progressing as is Morenci.
Our exploration activity continues. It reflects to what we've been doing over a long period of time. We're analyzing
results from the extensive amount of core drilling that we've done. Over the past six years, our actual budget for next
year is down and that just reflects the nature of where we are in the process and the lack of emphasis on exploration.
The real underlying strength of this company has to do with our proved and probable copper reserves which at $2 mine
plans are over 100 billion pounds and then resources beyond that which have already been identified beyond those
proved reserves is another 100 billion pounds and that gives us the ability to have very long life, continuing production
and the opportunity to develop new growth projects beyond the ones that we're working on currently.
Jim, why don't you take over and let you talk about our oil and gas business.
James C. Flores
Right, Richard. Thank you and good morning, everyone. Looking on page 11, looking at the oil price curves, it's
always a great place to discuss the oil business especially when it's a strong curve like what we've seen and the market
we feel is pretty stable. You've got a lot of political unrest. You've got a lot of market swings in the WTI that we're not
experiencing because of our location of our reserves being on the coastal areas of the United States and the Gulf of
Mexico where we're pricing at our California spot or our LLS off of the Brent pricing. And as you see or hear more and
more about the increases of production coming out of the Bakken, the Permian, and so forth, they're really going to
have widening differentials in the Midcontinent part of the United States.
And our projects won't have to suffer those differential widenings, and therefore, we'll be able to maintain the margins
that Richard and Kathleen alluded to in their talks and so forth, because we believe our oil and gas business is a high
margin business. It's reflective in the numbers that came out here in the third quarter, we expect to protect that. One of
the interesting things, when you grow production 10% above your plan, your costs go down, because we have a large
fixed cost of components through our oil and gas business on the operating side, just like on the mining side, and as
production goes up, you divide those costs by a fixed number and that's why you see our costs going down from $19 of
BOE to $16.80 for the quarter which is a real big improvement. It points to the statement Richard made about

execution, execution, execution, is where our oil and gas business has really turned on.
We've also seen a strong oil price to help that margin as well and the disciplined capital spending and so forth, we
obviously stayed within budget and were able to execute in spite of the awesome task of putting two companies
together with a third one in our three-way merger that closed June 3. So, I can't tell – say enough about the guys and
gals in the oil and gas group that build the [indiscernible] (19:04) have an outstanding quarter in spite of all the
disruptions of who reported to who and find out whose email worked and whose email didn't. So, great job all around
there.
Flipping to page 12, the operating assets are very consistent, while we talked about in the transaction and also as far as
going forward, you could see where our oil business in California, Eagle Ford and Gulf of Mexico is the focus of our
company with almost 98% of our assets. Obviously, the gas business is large but with prices impaired where they are,
like we had forecast, it's going to – it will be a small piece for our business until that market has price recovery
sometime in the future. We've got the details here with a lot of strong attributes. I'm not going to go through them to
save everybody some time, but the third quarter 2013 operating cash margin of $1.1 billion is a great place to start for
this important growth business for the company.
Flipping to page 13, the Lucius deepwater project is one of our significant projects coming on next year. Besides the
initial drilling, starting in the fourth quarter at our Holstein field in the Gulf of Mexico, this is going to be a very large
production and our operator. Anadarko is working to make sure we have this production timely in the second half of
2014 and all indications that we're going to be able to accomplish that. So, looking forward to our 23.33% interest at
80,000 barrels a day and the gas production related to it.
On page 14, we can see more of a pictorial depiction of our deepwater Gulf of Mexico business. You can see our
production facilities in red; those are our large facilities that have a quarter of a million barrels of production capacity
running at about 25% right now or 65,000 barrels a day. Remember, our intent here is to take our – that infrastructure
and fill it, and fill it by drilling new wells on adjoining prospects, joining leases in our existing fields by redeveloping
it, that's what our business plan is all about and those are the projects in blue that we plan on subsea tieback into our
infrastructure.
Great rate of return projects, 50% to 60% rate of return projects. This is the cornerstone of our CapEx budget in the oil
and gas business. On top of that, we have our Lucius project in green and our Phobos discovery that we're looking at
developing for the later part of this decade. Those are both Anadarko operated and there's a little star over here on the
left called Tara, that's an exploratory project, that's very high potential like Lucius that we're going to be drilling
mid-year when one of the drillships show up in about the second quarter. So stay tuned for some exciting results from
that.
Speaking of exploration, on page 15, our ultra-deep activities, we continue to lead the industry here with several great
partners like Energy XXI, Moncrief at Chevron. We are in the process of moving into completion modes with
production tests at Davy Jones 2, Lineham Creek, and Blackbeard West in 2014. Other than that, we're drilling a very
significant exploratory well in Lomond North and we're looking forward to getting those results hopefully by year-end.
At the same point in time, we've got one to two wells planned next year to really capture the exploration phase of this
project and then we'll have to evaluate how we want to develop it and in what timeframe basically to be market
responsive to what the gas price is doing and we've got plenty of time, we've got the resources obviously to do it.
Richard, that's brief but that gives everybody kind of a taste and I'll turn it back over to you.
Richard C. Adkerson
All right. Thanks, Jim. All right. Pulling this all together and seeing what our outlook is for 2013, our sales outlook
continues to, after adjustments around the 4.1 billion pounds of copper, our gold is 1.1 million ounces for 2013. Again,
this is essentially rounding for adjustments. 92 million pounds of molybdenum and 37.5 million barrels equivalent for
oil, that's up a bit from our previous guidance. And Kathleen reminds me which – thank you Kathleen for always doing

– when I was talking about Eagle Ford, I said millions rather than thousands, so make sure that we're talking about
thousands of equivalent barrels there at Eagle Ford earlier. Our unit cost continues to be the same. We're working to try
to constrain costs, increase volumes and our unit cost for oil is down a bit with our positive operation results.
At $3.25 copper, that would give us operating cash flows in the range of $6 billion and that's after a $300 million
working capital use. That number always moves around as we get to the end of the quarter and each $0.10 change in
copper for the remainder of 2013 is a 90 – is our variance in operating cash flows.
Capital expenditures continue to be estimated at $5.5 billion. Then, as we look forward to production volumes over the
next two years beyond 2013, you can see increasing volumes for copper and the 2015 reflects the target that we've had
with our three expansion projects and the restoration of Grasberg to more normal levels to get up in the 5 billion lb. a
year range.
Gold volumes reflect again the positive situation at Grasberg and the growth in oil production reflects Lucius and other
improvements and activities there in offshore. And then as we go beyond 2015, we see really significant growth
continuing.
Unit production cost situation is on page 18. We show the details of where that is. It's essentially really in line with
where we gave guidance in the second quarter – and then our sales by region are outlined at the bottom of the page.
Again, the volumes are consistent with previous guidance and we'll work to beat it.
Our EBITDA and cash flow models are shown on page 19, showing varying copper prices from $3 to $4 and then with
2013, and for 2014 and 2015 averages, EBITDA ranges from $10 billion to $15 billion and operating cash flows from
$8 billion to $11 billion. Then the increases that comes into play in 2016, which is very significant shows 45%
increases there as we get our projects on stream and get those additional volumes in place and you can see how that
varies with copper prices. Going with EBITDA $15 billion to $21 billion in operating cash flows, net of taxes and cash
interest of $12 billion to $16 billion.
The sensitivities that we present for your use are shown on page 20. Big sensitivity, of course, is copper prices where
$0.10 means $325 million of operating cash flows on our annual basis.
Our capital expenditures are shown on page 21, showing roughly $4 billion a year for the 2013, 2014 and 2015 and oil
and gas CapEx, $2.7 billion, $2.9 billion for the next two years, again, in line with our funding from its cash flows.
After 2015, mining projects will drop off with the completion of Cerro Verde. So our CapEx would drop-off. Our
volumes will increase and we'll get the benefit of our expansion projects.
We remain committed, as our board has instructed us to, to maintaining a strong balance sheet. We have a good track
record of doing that. We have set a target of reducing our debt to a $12 billion level, that's an approximation over the
next three years. That includes continuing our common stock dividend at its current $1.25 per share annual rate. With
our large resource base, our strong cash flows and capital discipline – we can do – our board has challenged us to find
ways of advancing our debt reduction target and we have a great set of assets that allows us to consider a range of
alternatives for doing that. That could include things like asset sales, joint venture arrangements, special purchase
financing. We are looking at the opportunity for a master limited partnership involving initially some of our oil and gas
assets. All of those are alternatives that we're working diligently on to see how to advance our debt reduction target.
We're in a position where we are not – we don't have to do anything and anything we'll do will be in achieving that
target will be done in a way to enhance shareholder value. And so, that is something that we are working on.
End of the day, we have a strong focused organization on execution, focused on returning – on generating shareholder
returns, managing our base operations to achieve our production costs – manage our cost and do that in a way that is –
provides a safe working environment for our employees and positive results for all stakeholders and communities
where we operate.
We're looking over the long run to find ways to invest and grow our business because we have the resources to do it.
We'll do that in a disciplined way that recognizes these market realities, the best uses of cash, the ones that give us our
strong returns and where we can execute in a positive way. We'll protect our balance sheet and our dividends and very

pleased with this first quarter start to achieving all those goals. We are – Jim Bob, we're ready to take questions. If you
have comments, you'd like to make now or shall we move straight to the question-and-answer session?
James R. Moffett
Let's just go right to the questions.
Richard C. Adkerson
Okay. Well operator, we have a queue here. So, let's start with questions.
Q&A
Operator
Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator
Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sal Tharani with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: First question, Kathleen, quickly on interest expense. It appears to be a little lower than 4.4%,
average cost you mentioned. Should we consider that as going forward or was there any something special this quarter?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: I don't think there is anything special in there, Sal. There is some interest that gets
capitalized. But I think the quarter is reflective of where we are with our current debt position.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: So, if we assume that debt remains the same, we can use the same ratio going forward?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Right.
<Q - Sal Tharani>: Interest expense – okay. Thank you. On the Grasberg, Richard, you had given some number in the
past, what was the cost of labor was in that total production, and I know you have a new contract where obviously you
probably offered some incentives. I'm just wondering if – how should we look at the cost for next year on the Grasberg
side?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, our base rates that we agreed to was to increase base salary rates by 10% this year
and 10% next year. There were other features that were built into our package that aren't included in this package this
year. Our labor costs are roughly 25% of our total cost and so they will be somewhat higher, that deals with our union
workers. There's a ripple effect that it goes into our non-union workers, our staff workers and some of our contractors.
But we reached a level that – there's a press release out talking about how the union's pleased with it, we're pleased
with it and considering, Sal, where we came from with all of the very tough issues that we had in 2011, it really carried
on all through 2012 in terms of getting people to work together in a positive way, this is really a big thing for us, for all
of the workers, the communities, the central government, everybody there. So, we're very pleased with it. And so, our
labor costs are going to go up, some, but within a reasonable level.
And what is the opportunity here is that now with a more harmonious working relationship with our workforce and
with the union, I was out there and directly engaged in discussions this year, we're all committed to finding productivity
measures, which are certainly there, that have the potential for far offsetting any increase in wage cost, and we all

Your next question comes from the line of David Gagliano with Barclays.
<Q - David Gagliano>: ...for taking my question. I just have a quick one. The production profile beyond 2013, can you
just talk a little bit about the slight decline in the copper and the gold sales volume expectations for 2014?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Strictly rounding, Dave.
<Q - David Gagliano>: Okay.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: I mean...
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Yeah, Dave. This is...
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: ...from my previous guidance.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Yeah. This is Kathleen. We rounded to 4.5 last time, and I think the volumes are like 30
million pounds lower through a combination of Grasberg and North American volumes, but it just rounded down to 4
rather than 4.5.
<Q - David Gagliano>: Okay. Perfect. Thanks. And then just as a quick follow-up, could you give us a little more
information about the thoughts around the MLP? Obviously, there's been quite a bit of chatter. I am wondering, given
the work you've done so far on it, if you could you give us a sense in terms of types of assets, size, et cetera. Thanks.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: David, it's a work-in-progress. So we're looking at this among other alternatives, and it's
really too early to give specifics on it. There's a range of opportunities of what we could do with it. MLPs have
performed so well in the marketplace and, of course, there are different types of MLPs going from midstream
infrastructure type assets to upstream assets. We have a large asset base. It gives us lots of opportunities. Jim and I are
talking about it. We're getting input from people experienced in that business. And so we'll report on it as this thing
evolves. It's an opportunity and we're going to look at it to see if it makes sense for us.
<Q - David Gagliano>: Okay. Thanks very much.

Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Michael Gambardella with JPMorgan.
<Q - Michael F. Gambardella>: Hey, good morning and congratulations on the excellent operating performance in
the third quarter. I have a couple of questions. One just a follow-up on Sal's question on the new labor agreement at
Grasberg. I understand Richard that you expect to get productivity enhancements, but just assuming you had the new
Grasberg contract for the entire third quarter that you just put up, how would that have affected the $1.46 per pound
cash cost that you had companywide for your copper operations?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Mike, this is Kathleen. We spend currently about, between $550 million and $600 million a
year on our total labor in Indonesia. So if you take 10%, you can see what the impact would be in the first year and then
another 10% in the second year. We've also got some exchange rate movements as well which offset some of that, but
that will give you a feel for the annual impacts.

<Q - Michael F. Gambardella>: Okay. And last question, I think back in 2001, you had acquired about a 9%
additional interest in the Grasberg mine from local Indonesians that ran into some financial distress. Can you talk about
the potential, I know you've said it's for sale for the past several years, but could you give us any idea in terms of the
real potential of selling that in terms of really accelerating your debt repayment program?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Okay, Mike. The – actually it was half of that 9.6% (sic) [9.36%] (38:16) that we
acquired. It was originally that level, but back in the 1990s, we had acquired half of it in an earlier transaction. So it
was half of 9.36% or roughly 4.7%, that we acquired back in that 2001 timeframe. Probably seven years ago, or more,
the government asked us, if we would make that interest available to Indonesians on a business-to-business fair market
type basis and we have, over time we worked to find a structure that would provide the opportunity for the people of
Papua, the province and some appropriate structure to acquire that. Those transactions haven't been done.
Now in connection with our current contract of work discussions, the government of Indonesia undertook a review of
all contracts of work following the 1999 Mining Law, and we are in the process of obtaining an extension which we
have the rights to for our contract of work beyond its primary term which ends in 2021. We have been engaged for over
two years now in discussions of various aspects of our contract with the Government of Indonesia, and included as part
of that package of discussions, is discussions about the potential of our entering into a divestiture of additional interest
in the PTFI shares.
We're looking and think it would be attractive to have a listing of those shares on the Indonesian Stock Exchange and
the Government feels very positive about that. And potentially, a transaction involving a sale to the province. And
obviously, the listing on the stock exchange would provide cash for us and that would assist us in our debt
management. A sale to the province would probably be some sort of structure where we would assist with financing
and wouldn't generate near-term cash to us. But those are all part of that.
I want to emphasize, those aren't independent steps, but part of our overall discussions with the Government about
reaching a mutually satisfactory resolution of the Government's review of contracts and our getting an extension to give
us surety of our contract through 2041, and we're confident we're going to get there on both scores.
<Q - Michael F. Gambardella>: And would this be a sale of the entire 9.63% (sic) [9.36%] (41:05) or a -
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, no, we're looking at – that independent of the 9.36%. This is an overall package
that could involve – a sale of that, of the roughly a 5%, would be one of the largest IPOs in the history of the stock
exchange. So, it's an overall package that involves something independent of this 9.36% interest.
<Q - Michael F. Gambardella>: Okay.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: And as I said, we already owned half of it. I mean we already owned half of that before
the 2001 transaction.
<Q - Michael F. Gambardella>: Okay. Great. Thanks, Richard.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Okay, Mike. Thanks for your question.

<Q - Brian Hsien Yu>: And congrats on a solid quarter to you guys. First is – Rich, FCX, you guys are typically
measuring your language. And on the oil and gas side with the Shelf assets, you changed your wording from initiated
process to divest to evaluating alternatives including possible divestment. Does this signal a change in plan? And then
as a follow-up to that, you did up your second half oil and gas volume guidance, what's the thought or how should we
think about you guys maintaining the 2014 volume at 57 MMBOE. Thanks.

<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Okay, I'm going to let Jim comment on it, but, we have been in the process of looking at
a sale of the Shelf properties. Given the marketplace out there, it's a set of assets that doesn't have a huge number of
buyers and we're looking at what make sense for us going forward. The volumes going forward do not include the Shelf
volumes, just as a point of information, but Jim – and so, we're looking at a number of different possibilities there. Jim,
do you want to comment on it?
<A - James C. Flores>: Sure, Richard. Thanks. On the Shelf sale, one of the interesting aspects of it is, basically, the
companies that we're talking about selling it to who are smaller and the financing constraints are there. There's a lot of
behind pipe reserves and upside that we're trying to [ph] drill out (43:29) some type of value structure to get what we
think is representative – what we know is representative value. Basic recompletions that are not flowing right now.
And so we're debating internally whether we just might be better to continue to operate those fields a little while, get
those big wells on and then, and then look at selling at some other later date. I mean, that's a later date within months or
maybe next year type thing. So, nobody is in a distress situation but we're trying to make sure we representedly look at
the value from a standpoint of what's best for the FCX shareholders. So, that debate's going on. At the same point in
time, we did have a robust process. We've got several people that are flipping documents to try to push towards getting
something done this year. So that's going to be an Office of the Chairman discussion and Board discussion later this fall
of what we exactly do.
Now, as far as the guidance for 2014 going forward, there's a lot of operations that we're going to be doing in 2014 that
provide volatility to our production numbers. We're going to shut in a couple of platforms for a period of time to do
platform modifications to prepare for a long-term production growth, for offset fields coming into those fields in the
Gulf of Mexico.
The actual start date of our Lucius production. Obviously, we have our storm shut-ins put in our planning. So we think
while it's a pretty conservative number as far as growth and so forth, we think with the volatility in operations, it's a
number that we feel comfortable with putting out but with operations going smoothly and a quiet storm season, our
numbers could obviously be significantly higher next year, if – in actual, but as far as the planning process, this
business is one quarter old as far as being part of Freeport. So I would say we're conservatively modeling and going
forward and just going to have to enjoy the upside on a quarter-to-quarter basis going forward.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Thanks, Jim. Brian, as I indicated with all these things, we're in the fortunate position of
not having to do anything. So as we look at these alternatives, we wanted to generate cash to reduce debt, we're
challenged to do it, and we're going to work to meet that challenge. But at the same time, we look at the fundamental
economics and make decision on what creates best values for shareholders.
<Q - Brian Hsien Yu>: No. Okay. That makes sense. Great. Thank you.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Curt Woodworth with Nomura.
<Q - Curt Woodworth>: Richard, you commented that your sense of the market surplus next year in the copper
market would be relatively small in relation to the overall market size. I'm just curious, what do you view the level of
surplus to be next year or what's kind of the over, under if you will, what will be manageable for the market in terms of
surplus?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, Curt as I think most of these people on here know, one of the things that all my
experience in this natural resource business has been is to not make predictions like that. And literally as a company,
we don't run our business on any sort of particular predictions on short-term movements. I read the same analyst reports
that are out there. I was at LME and I was sort of struck by the two different views at LME. There's a lot of people with
investors – and who follow the investor community were really pessimistic about metals, in general, and about copper,

because of this expectations of supply coming on stream. Then as I talk to end users and customers and traders and
other company CEOs, the theme that came back was, hey, demand is stronger in 2013 than we expected, premiums are
strong, when you get and look at a number of these projects, while Escondida and Grasberg are performing well. The
timing of when other projects come on is uncertain that's been a feature of the industry forever. So when I look at the
most recent book, the current CRU outlooks, I see relatively small surpluses that could swing one way or another
depending on what happens. So I think that the story is as even as the situation of where there's as much concerns about
the global economic market, about new supplies. And we see a copper market, at fundamentals, that's relatively tight.
We're prepared for whatever comes down the pike.
I mean we have a flexible set of assets that allows us to make a lot of money if prices were strong. And as we've shown
in the past, we can adjust to deal with prices that are weak; if that is something we have to deal with. My point is that
the longer range story about the copper business is intact. Demand from global development and global economic
growth over time will be strong and supplies will continue to be challenged.
<Q - Curt Woodworth>: Okay, that's helpful. And then just a follow-up for Jim, regarding Davy Jones and
Blackbeard, in terms of going to completion in 2014. Could you just give us kind of an update on where you are
currently and maybe more specifics around the exact timing in 2014 you expect for those two?
<A - James C. Flores>: It's pretty much front-end loaded. I think all three: Davy Jones, Blackbeard West and Lineham
are all going – are scheduled in the first half of the year. The only thing is if we have extensive testing in one area, it
may delay West Blackbeard because it's a subsequent rig operation between Davy Jones West. It should start right at
the beginning of the year and if we do extensive tests, Davy Jones 2 would make West Blackbeard towards the second
half of the year. But Lineham's scheduled for the first half of the year as well.
<Q - Curt Woodworth>: Okay. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Tumazos. Hey, John.
<Q - John C. Tumazos>: Thank you for taking my call. Today's results seem to suggest that, the performance of the
four geographic regions of FCX copper operations are improving. And also most of the regions of the oil and gas
group. Looking forward to the December and March quarters, should we expect each of the four regions of the copper
business and the energy business to improve more? That's my first question. And second, can we infer that you're
spending about $100 million a month at Cerro Verde based on the third quarter spending rates or will that accelerate a
little more?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Okay. You know, with the copper business, we've given you the guidance for the fourth
quarter, so you can see that. We'll still have some issues in South America that we're recovering for in terms of some
higher – some ore at Candelaria that's harder than expected. We've had some issues in managing our leaching
operations at El Abra that we're working our way through, that will take some time. So, you'll see that going into 2014,
which we'll give more specific guidance on at our next call, we have some mine sequencing issue earlier in the year at
Grasberg, so that that will affect first quarter operations there with significant improvements as we go throughout the
year there.
So, you know, John, the overall situation is very good. My top of the head thing says your number at Cerro Verde is
pretty good. We are 80% complete with engineering. We've ordered a lot of the equipment. We've spent about – we
spent over $1 billion and we've got commitments for another $750 million or so on a $4.5 billion project. So, that will –
some of that spending is not smooth but chunky, but now we're going to be incurring labor costs for construction, so, in
general terms there. And then we've got our new mill coming on stream in 2014 in Morenci that will be a very positive
for us. And Jim, do you want to respond to the oil and gas side of...

<A - James C. Flores>: The oil and gas side, John, is again, I talked about the volatility in operations next year. We're
in the process of starting our drilling rig in our Holstein field but we're waiting on three drillships to show up and so we
can really get into the meat of our development in our offshore business and that will be – both ships will be showing
up over the next 18 to 20 months. And then at the same point in time, we will be correlative with our platform
modification.
So I think what you'll look for is a year that's hopefully got a quiet year operationally other than some exploratory wells
and beating some production guidance because operational execution has gone real well. But starting May 2014 up to
2015, a tremendous production ramp-up at the end of the decade to our Gulf of Mexico business is basically what I saw
at the analyst meeting back in June – will become realized very quickly. So a lot of work being done in 2013 and 2014
to prepare for 2015 through 2020 to realize the value.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Our business across the board is a long-term business. We operate on long-term plans.
We execute on a long-term basis. Quarter-to-quarter fluctuations occur for any number of reasons. It's great we have a
very good quarter across the board this time and we feel very good about our outlook and about our progress we're
making for achieving our long-term plans.

Your next question comes from the line of Oscar Cabrera with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Thank you, operator. Richard, it's great to see strong execution across the board in all the
businesses. Just wanted to get back into the Grasberg contractor work. Believe, last conference call, your mentioned
that your expectations of resolving or reaching agreement with the Indonesian government by the end of this year. I
was wondering if that's still the case?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, what I said, and I still say, is that a number of people of the Indonesian
government are targeting, getting this completed by the end of this year. I'll also say a number of people were targeting
for getting it complete by the end of 2012. So, we are anxious to get this resolved, we're going to work very
cooperatively with the government, to get it resolved. We hope that it'll get resolved by the end of this year.
Indonesia is facing a presidential election next year, and the closer you get to that election, the political situation
becomes more prominent, and in many ways, more complicated. We're going to represent our shareholders, and we're
going to work cooperatively with the government to find a common ground, so that both parties feel, that they are
satisfied with the results of this. I would say, the government's targeting this year, we hope that it gets done and we'll
work to achieve it. But we'll just have see, how it – what actually happens.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Okay. Thank you. And then...
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: I will say, we are very – our contract has firm legal standing, nobody denies that. And
so, at the end of the day, that provides the basis for our rights to operate there, and our rights to go forward.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Yeah. No, I just – we still believe that, that's one of the large positive catalysts for the stock.
And secondly, interested in your comments on the front page of your release, where you talk about the opportunities to
accelerate the deleveraging of the balance sheet which I think is good. Joint venture transactions. Can you just provide
more color around this, talking about any type of asset. Are you focusing more on the oil and gas side? Any help there
would be great.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, joint venture structures allow you to have a lot of flexibility and creativity as to
how you can get together with someone who has some objectives and look at your own objectives and come up with
something that would make sense for both parties. That would be opportunities across the board with our business. And

when you look back at Freeport's history, you can find cases, for example, our partnership at Grasberg with Rio Tinto
was a case study. We've had joint ventures with Sumitomo at a number of our operations. We have a partnership at
Tenke Fungurume.
And the same way with oil and gas business which joint ventures are a feature across the board in that industry. There's
a interesting financing structure that Jim and his team put together for Lucius. The operator there, Anadarko's done
things.
So, that's – it's such a broad range of ideas is that we mentioned that as a way of having the flexibility of bringing in
someone with financial wherewithal and objectives that you can be very creative about how you can match them up.
And there's no particular formula, or no particular thing that you can say would be a specific outcome, but in the range
of things, sometimes joint ventures are a way of bridging differences of views of values and gives you a way to deal
with a potential interested and willing partner and bridge value considerations. So it's a feature of the natural resource
business and an opportunity for us.
<Q - Oscar Cabrera>: Yeah. That was – just was interested in like there's more Chinese companies and SOEs
[state-owned enterprises] getting into joint ventures in different parts of the world like the UK in uranium and now the
potential purchase of Las Bambas. So would you consider Chinese partners in all of these?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yeah. We consider partners that would give us the opportunity to meet our objectives
and if a Chinese partner would do that then we'd certainly consider it.

<Q - Mitesh B. Thakkar>: Congratulations, guys.
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Thank you.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Thank you.
<Q - Mitesh B. Thakkar>: Just a quick question on your hedging strategy. It looks like you haven't done any hedging
lately on the oil and gas side. Are you maintaining the original hedging strategy or is there any change to that? Should
we see any potential hedging going forward?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: There's been no change since the acquisition – it's something that we monitor. The oil and
gas markets are much more liquid than the copper markets and we are, in terms of positions we have, we think they're
good positions as we're working on delevering, but as we go forward, we'll look to see what makes sense for the
combined company. We do buy – we do have a lot of oil and gas consumption in our mining business, so we'll take that
into consideration as well. But in terms of the structure, we've got a position through 2015. And like I said, we'll
continue to monitor the markets, but for right now, that's what's in place.
<Q - Mitesh B. Thakkar>: Okay, great. And just a question on the moly side, there are some comments in the press
release that you're looking at maybe lowering your primary moly production. Can you just kind of give us an update,
because I think you still make a little bit of margin on that business? Any thoughts on that?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yeah, lots of thoughts, we're the world's largest moly producer and the lowest cost. We
have significant moly coming as byproducts out of our mines. And as we look forward to Cerro Verde, there's
incremental moly volumes there, some at our other potential expansion projects. And there's other byproduct moly
coming into the marketplace. We're in a position with our Henderson and our Climax mines, which are sole moly
producers, to monitor our production levels there to be responsive to the marketplace.

And so that's what we do, and what we are doing. Moly markets have been weak. And we're heavily involved in the
downstream side of that business. So we're right on top of what our customers want, we have a greater percentage of
the higher volume chemical moly business in the industry as a whole. So we're just going to be responsive to what the

Your next question comes from the line of Adam Duarte with Omega.
<Q - Adam A. Duarte>: Good morning, guys. Given the completion schedule you have for the ultra-deep wells, when
do you actually expect first production and first cash distributions for the royalty trust.
<A - James C. Flores>: Adam, I think we can give you a better schedule once we have the wells tested, that's the
thing. So I mean we are in a infrastructure prone area in the shallow part of the Gulf of Mexico. So I would hope by, if
we get, if we have some completions in the first half of the year, we'd have production on by year-end 2014, but that's
just a guess at this point. There's a lot of engineering between me and that guess.
<Q - Adam A. Duarte>: Understood. So basically no change relative to what we've been talking about for the last
three months, call it, around these wells and their scheduling?
<A - James C. Flores>: I think that Richard said it best, these projects are long-term. We're got them scheduled and it's
very hard for us to change those schedules because they're such – the size of the projects that they're going to [ph]
bubble up (1:03:45) real fast. So that's [indiscernible] (1:03:46).

and I guess some of the outperformance just came from no real hurricane activity?
<A - James C. Flores>: Well, Joe, a lot of us like our Eagle Ford continues to outperform. The premium 60,000 acres
we got there right in the heart of the watermelon is – that's continued to be spectacular. We are reducing our rig count
out there just from a standpoint of trying to drive more free cash flow out of it and reap the benefits of the production
climb to 50,000 barrels a day. So, but that was, that was a spectacular quarter in the Eagle Ford.
And then on the, going to the well stimulation at our Holstein platform, we had a belief that the initial reservoirs at
Holstein were impeded from their ultimate production because of basically migration of finds and skin damage on the
well bores and we pressed this one well, it was producing about 1,200 barrels a day, we hit it with some xylene,
basically an acid wash and it started producing over 7,000 barrels a day and the tubing pressure increased about 50% as
well. So, that's pretty spectacular. We're going to continue to maintain and go through the reservoirs that we have, but
anytime you can take the production at Holstein from 9,000 barrels a day to 18,000 barrels a day without drilling or
recompleting a well, you've done some really good things. So, hats off to the guys and gals who are involved in that

project. And we have a lot more to do out there so, excitement is running and confidence is running high.
<Q - Joe D. Allman>: Okay. That's helpful. And then back to the MLP option, I know it's very early stages in thinking
about it, but what are you looking to achieve, if in fact you do pursue an MLP option, and what would be some of the
negatives, especially in terms of would it be difficult to get a tax basis step up if you just drop it down and have your
own MLP?
<A - James C. Flores>: You're deep into the details, Joe. The aspect, there's no impediments. The benefit we're
looking for – you got a company here with a 100 year copper reserve, 50 year gold reserve, 50 year moly reserve and
we're trading at five times or something like that. That's so it's – if we can capture value by driving, we think a
representative value for the assets, maintain, we don't need more assets, we've got plenty of assets. We need the
representative valuation. So, that's what's driving all of our discussions and MLP is part of that discussion on all sizes,
the extraction business does cover not only oil and gas, it covers copper and we've got excellent MLP-able type assets
across the board. So, it's a – Richard gave you all a little insight into what our discussions have been like when we
talked about joint ventures, they're far ranging and we're going to find the answer here that – and I think we'll be visible
in the marketplace as well.
<Q - Joe D. Allman>: Great. And then just lastly, on the Deep Shelf, so Lineham Creek, I think Chevron was looking
at a primary target below 25,000 feet. It sounds as if maybe things didn't work out there, and you're really focused on
completing above 24,000 feet. Could you just talk about that? And then, also, Davy Jones 1, have you basically
abandoned that well and just moving on to Davy Jones 2 at this point?
<A - James C. Flores>: I think what you're misreading in the press release about above 24,000 – more of an
engineering, trying to focus on that we're going to be able to get the well at Lineham Creek closer. We were very
articulate that we'd found [ph] Yaywa (1:07:38) sands in the 23,000 foot, there's a new sand horizon for the ultra-deep
play and the log indications look to our favor for establishing production. The aspect of [indiscernible] (1:07:53) we ran
into some drilling problems and we elected not to go deeper into the lower tertiary, we decided to take what we had
right here, and let's see if we can develop a large [ph] Yaywa (1:08:03) structure and maybe that will up a new trend for
us. So, it's a geologic and engineering coordination discussion, it wasn't based on any kind of disappointment into the
ultra-deep.
Now, on Davy Jones 1, at this point we're not – don't have any operations planned. We're studying the operation of
fracking the zone or whatever. We want to get the results from Davy Jones 2, and not only the lower tertiary but the
cretaceous before we decide whatever plans we're going to have for Davy Jones 1 going forward.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Thanks, Joe. We're really pleased to see all these interesting questions. Time's going on,
so if we don't get to your questions or if we answer them too shortly, we'll get with David and we'll follow-up with you.
But, let's see if we can take a few more very quickly.

Your next question comes from the line of Paretosh Misra with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Paretosh Misra>: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. A question for Jim, at Gulf of Mexico your
production rate went up sequentially and you highlighted a couple of reasons. Is there – should we expect that to be
sustainable in the fourth quarter also, the current run rate?
<A - James C. Flores>: We've got guidance out on the fourth quarter. We're supportive of that guidance. It's an
orchestra where a lot of ins and outs. And we continue to have positive execution by our people. So, at this point in
time, we're all confident of them being able to continue to show the good stuff. The assets are certainly performing, the
people are performing, so the outlook would be positive there but there's nothing more tangible than that.
<Q - Paretosh Misra>: Got it. And at Eagle Ford, you still expect production to start declining because of some of the
CapEx that you made, right?

<A - James C. Flores>: Yeah, that's correct. We're going to start harvesting free cash flow out of that field, and as our
rig count drops, we'll be maintaining somewhere, I think, around 30,000 barrels a day next year is what our rate is. And
we can [ph] actually (1:10:10) add rigs, if we want to add production volumes or cut depending on what our cash flow
and our CapEx requirements are.
<Q - Paretosh Misra>: Great. Thanks so much. Bye.
<A - James C. Flores>: Okay.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian MacArthur with UBS.
<Q - Brian T. MacArthur>: ...for taking my question. I just want to follow up on Grasberg. We've talked a lot about
you got – you had a labor contract, productivity, you'll hopefully improve. With that is there any possibility of
accelerating the development going forward of the underground because obviously post 2016, there's a big transfer and
you give us some long-term guidance about where production is going to go, but I imagine just with all the uncertainty
there, I just kind of want to get an update there on where the development is going forward for that?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, Mark Johnson's here but the development is going very well. We were able to –
we had some delays resulting following the Big Gossan training room incident. But we've really – actually to-date
made up for some of the downtime we had there. And so we've got aggressive schedules to bring in the Grasberg
blockade to be prepared to begin production, as we complete mining from the pit. We're still looking at roughly the end
of 2016 for that. And then the Deep MLZ extension to the DLZ complex is scheduled to come on stream in advance of
that. So we're putting an optimal amount of resources, there's just practical limits to doing that, but it's all going well
and our long-term plan's intact.
<Q - Brian T. MacArthur>: And could I just ask, should I still – I think historically you used to talk about $550
million to $600 million a year to do that going forward. Is that still a reasonably good number?
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Yes.
<Q - Brian T. MacArthur>: Great. Thank you very much, Richard.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Okay, Brian.

Your next question comes from the line of Ralph Profiti with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Ralph Profiti>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick one. Richard, you mentioned power
deliveries running into problems in Africa, towards the end of the quarter. Are these the normal availability and
volatility that we've seen in the past? And if you can touch on whether or not industrial users have been asked to ration
power in the DRC? And what are those sort of September and October production numbers looking like? Thanks very
much.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Well, actually we have had some experience with power problems in the past, but
they've been much more pronounced here at the end of September. We had invested in hydroelectric power supplies,
have a contract, but there's been issues on the grid of power availability from Zambia. There's increasing requirements
for mining activities in Katanga, and the government has not kept up with maintenance activities and that resulted in
curtailments. And so, we have experienced those. I spoke with the Mines Minister and he committed that everybody in
government's working to resolve these. There are some longer term solutions that we and other miners are working for.
But fundamentally, there's lots of opportunities for hydroelectric power development in that country and there are other
alternatives being considered and we're working diligently on it, but it is a challenging issue for the mining industry in

general. We think we are relatively placed in a relatively favorable position, but we're working hard to see what we do
it. It's improved somewhat this month in October, but it's an issue.
<Q - Ralph Profiti>: Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Carly Mattson with Goldman.
<Q - Carly L. Mattson>: My question is regarding the former PXP bonds and the equity claws. Given Freeport's
current cash balances and the cash flow outlook for this year, does it make sense to think that the likelihood of Freeport
considering either issuing debt or drawing down the revolver to fund the equity claws on the PXP debt has increased or
how should we think about that?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Carly, this is Kathleen. We're very focused on those equity claws and the opportunities
there, and we're going to look at a variety of options to take those out, whether it be from – for monetizations or
refinancing. So we are focused on taking advantage of the economics of those secured.
<Q - Carly L. Mattson>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
<A - Richard C. Adkerson>: Refinancing is a good option, not so much just drawing down on our credit facility
because that's a cushion that we want to have available for whenever we need it.
Operator
Your final question comes from the line of Harry Mateer with Barclays.
<Q - Harry Mateer>: Hi. Thanks. I guess first just a follow-up on Carly's question. So there seems to be a lot of
confusion and different views out there about when you have to exercise that equity claw, if you choose to do so. Can
you just clarify for us, is there a six month window you have to do that in from timing of the merger completion day,
which I think would be end of next month or is that not the case? Then secondly, on the potential MLP, do you
consider an MLP to be a deleveraging event, given that often times that can just be moving debt from sort of one box to
another. How do you think about that in relation to actually taking your debt balance down versus other options you
have on the table such as asset sales?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Regarding the first question, the claw expires three years after when the bonds were issued.
And so, there are varying expirations, most of them are in 2015. We've got one in, a smaller piece in 2014, but it's three
years from the date of the – of when PXP actually issued those notes.
In terms of the MLP situation, as we look at that, we'll look at it as a way to enhance the overall credit profile of the
company and so we'll look at how to do that in terms of bringing in proceeds in a value accretive way and looking to
use those proceeds to retire debt at the parent. So, we're looking at it both from a credit standpoint as well as a overall
value standpoint.
<Q - Harry Mateer>: Okay. And so the equity issuance that would count for purposes of the equity claw, you can just
do that any time in the next couple of years?
<A - Kathleen L. Quirk>: Yes. It's really the equity being put down from the parent to the FMO O&G subsidiary.
That's the equity event.
<Q - Harry Mateer>: Okay. Thank you.
