Marillyn A. Hewson
Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call today. We're pleased to have you with us to
review our first quarter results. As today's release details, we had an exceptionally strong quarter financially and
operationally. The corporation continued to operate at a very high level in returning value to stockholders while
delivering critical solutions to our customers. Our Lockheed Martin team delivered broad-based results across the
corporation and I am extraordinarily proud of their focus and efforts.
I have to highlight a few key achievements in the quarter, and then Bruce will follow my remarks and cover the balance
of the financial metrics in more detail. Financial results for the first quarter of 2014 were higher in almost every metric
than the first quarter last year other than a slight decline in sales. While sales decreased in the quarter, they were better
than our plan, and we remain on track to achieve our full year sales guidance.
Noteworthy financial accomplishments were securing new order bookings, significantly above last year's level and a
direct reflection of our portfolio alignment with customer requirements. This strong program alignment is essential as
customers allocate resources in today's constrained budget environment. Beyond our solid order bookings, net earnings
and earnings per share each increased over 20%, while segment operating margin matched the high point in our
corporate history at 13.4%.
Through our continuous focus on cash generation, we delivered over $2 billion in cash from operations in the quarter.
Strong and growing cash generation is the hallmark of our corporation, and a key differentiator in returning value to
stockholders while enabling continued investments in the future of our business. I am very pleased that strong
year-to-date financial performance enabled us to increase full year 2014 guidance for segment operating profit,
earnings per share and cash from operations.
In addition to the increased guidance, we were also able to reaffirm our full year orders and sales guidance based on
bookings to date and existing backlog composition. This level of financial performance is a direct reflection of our
world-class team as they deliver results on a daily basis to our customers and stockholders, and I thank everyone for
their effort.
In addition to the strong financial results, we continue to deploy our robust cash flow in the areas of share repurchases
and dividend payments, returning value to our stockholders. In the quarter, we repurchased over $1 billion of our
shares, more than double the amount we expended in the same period last year. These repurchases, combined with our
industry-leading per share dividend payment, returned approximately $1.6 billion in cash to stockholders.
Turning briefly to DoD budgets, in early March, the President released his formal fiscal year 2015 base defense budget
at just below $500 billion. This budget is flat with FY 2014, and is consistent with the two-year Bipartisan Budget Act
cap established last December. The President also proposed adding an additional $26 billion to the 2015 DoD base
budget for opportunity, growth and security initiatives. If approved, these additional funds will be used primarily to
increase budgets for procurement and operations and maintenance activities.
The initial outline of base budget allocation signaled solid support for our portfolio of programs and we look forward to
the finalization of congressional budget deliberations, which are expected to be completed later this year.
Moving outside the DoD budgets, momentum continues to build in efforts supporting our newly launched Lockheed
Martin International Organization, an international expansion strategy. This past quarter, I had the opportunity to travel
to multiple countries in both Europe and the Middle East to participate in wide-ranging discussions on our spectrum of
products and services and the increasingly complex geopolitical environment, which requires agile and adaptive
solutions for potential overseas customers.
While in the Middle East, I was able to tour our future Center for Innovation and security solutions in the UAE. This
center will expand our collaboration with the UAE government, academia and local business partners in helping bring
forward new technologies. Future technology applications are expected to be in areas such as cyber security, integrated
air and missile defense and other security related areas. This center will be another link in our long-standing partnership
with the people and government of the UAE.

My time in Israel enabled me to meet with the Prime Minister; participate in the opening of the new Lockheed Martin
office in Be'er Sheva, expanding our information systems and global solutions presence; and lastly, celebrate the arrival
of the first Super Hercules C-130J to the Israeli fleet with its unmatched airlift capabilities.
We continue to see strong and expanding international interest in our air and missile defense products, air mobility,
tactical aircraft and cyber security. These areas are already showing growth in our financials, as we were able to expand
the international content of total corporate revenues this past quarter. We remained solidly on track towards our goal of
achieving at least 20% of international sales in the next year or so.
I'd like to move to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and provide some color on the favorable progress that the program is
achieving in securing domestic and international customer support and reaching key technical milestones. New
business support of the program continues to grow both domestically and internationally, with increased levels of
annual aircraft order quantities. While the current DoD budget cap agreements for FY 2014 and FY 2015 resulted in
some near-term reductions and deferral to planned F-35 aircraft quantities, the revised order profile still shows
significant annual growth.
Fiscal year 2014 order quantities for new aircraft are projected to increase by over 20% above prior fiscal year's levels,
and fiscal year 2015 budget projections reflect an additional expansion of over 30% in new aircraft orders. These
increases in projected annual aircraft order quantities are indicative of increasing aircraft maturity and growing
customer demand for this revolutionary fifth-generation fighter. International support of the program is also expanding
and helping mitigate domestic pressures from constrained budgets.
Another key new business milestone achieved this past quarter was the formal announcement by the Republic of Korea
to procure the F-35 for its F-X fighter acquisition program. Their decision followed a comprehensive evaluation
process of competitor aircraft and makes Korea the third for military sales country and 12th country overall to select
the F-35. We look forward to supporting the discussions between this valued ally and the U.S. Government to
formalize an agreement and add a multibillion dollar order to our backlog of future F-35 work.
Turning to the development program, while new technical accomplishments were achieved on a daily basis, this quarter
included the key completion of all flight test objectives of the carrier variant aircraft using the redesigned tailhook
system. Success of the newly certified arresting hook clears the way for the aircraft to conduct sea trials for the U.S.
Navy in October and moves the carrier variant another step closer to joining the fleet.
In the area of software, we are making good progress on the version 2B software that will enable initial operating
capability of the STOVL aircraft in 2015. And we are progressing on version 3I software that will enable the planned
IOC for the Air Force variant aircraft in 2016.
Finally, we look forward to showcasing the F-35, when it heads overseas in July to fly at the Royal International Air
Tattoo, and the Farnborough Air Show in the United Kingdom. This will mark the aircraft's first appearance outside the
U.S. and enable a world audience to see some of the revolutionary capabilities of this next-generation fighter. Overall,
the F-35 program is retiring development risk and increasing production tempo while reducing program cost.
Shifting the focus of my remarks to portfolio shaping, we recently completed our acquisition of Industrial Defender, a
leading provider of cyber security solutions for industrial control systems to monitor, manage and protect critical
infrastructures in such areas as electric power grids, chemical facilities and oil and gas pipelines.
Industrial Defender's offerings provide cyber security for automation systems in operational environments, and are a
national extension and strengthening of our existing IT cyber security business suite of solutions for domestic and
international customers. This addition will enable us to offer an even more comprehensive spectrum of technology and
services designed to face modern day threats to both operational and information security.
Before turning the call over to Bruce, I want to say that we are enormously proud to receive the 2014 Catalyst Award
this past quarter as recognition of our initiatives to expand opportunities for women in business. We are pleased to be
the first aerospace and defense company to receive this award as recognition of the progress we have made in ensuring
women's voices are contributing to the diverse perspective so essential in today's competitive landscape. Embracing

diversity is a business imperative of our corporation. It drives innovation and performance and it helps create and
utilize the full potential of our team's human capital.
I'll now ask Bruce to go through the details of the first quarter financial performance and our increased 2014 guidance,
and then we'll open up the line for questions.
Bruce L. Tanner
Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along
with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. So let's start with Chart 3 and an overview of the
quarter. Sales in the quarter were $10.7 billion, down slightly from last year, but in line with our expectations for the
start of this year. Segment operating margin was very strong at 13.4% and this performance, along with the
improvement in our FAS/CAS pension adjustment, increased earnings per share by 23% to $2.87.
We generated $2.1 billion in cash from operations, the same amount as in the first quarter of last year and returned $1.6
billion to shareholders, and we increased our outlook for operating profit, EPS and cash from operations. So we're off
to a good start in 2014, extending upon our strong performance from 2013.
Turning to Chart 4 and comparing our sales and segment operating margin results for the first quarter of this year
versus last year. Overall, sales were down 4% compared with last year, but as I just noted, this was in line with our
expectations, and we expect to have sequential top-line growth for the remainder of 2014. Segment operating margin
matched our highest level ever at 13.4% and was broad based across our business areas as we'll outline on the next
chart.
Chart 5 shows that segment operating margins improved significantly over our results from a year ago. Four business
areas had higher margins this quarter compared with last year, with the increases from Missiles and Fire Control and
Mission Systems and Training leading to our increased segment operating profit outlook for the year. As expected,
Aeronautics margin was slightly lower than last year due to a change in the program mix.
On Chart 6, we'll reconcile our earnings per share compared with the first quarter of last year. EPS in the quarter was
23% higher than a year ago, driven primarily by the FAS/CAS adjustment improvement from an expense last year to
income this year, along with improved segment operating margin results we just discussed. Partially offsetting this
increase was the lower volume this quarter and a substantial R&D tax credit in 2013 that was not repeated this year.
If you'll turn to Chart 7, we'll discuss our cash generation and deployment in the quarter. Cash generated in the quarter
was very strong at $2.1 billion. This was similar to our cash generated in the first quarter of last year, but last year had
nearly $350 million more in tax refunds associated with pension contributions than we had this year. And with free
cash flow of $2 billion and cash returned to shareholders of just under $1.6 billion, we returned 78% of free cash flow
in the quarter. Also, similar to last year, we expect the cash generated in the first quarter will be the highest for the year
as we have both pension contributions and tax payments planned in future quarters that did not occur in the first
quarter.
On Chart 8, we'll look at our share repurchases in more detail. We repurchased 7 million shares in the quarter,
significantly more than what we did in the first quarter of 2013. This more than offset shares added from option
exercises, the stock match on our 401(k) plans and shares issued for divesting of restricted stock, as our net share count
was reduced by about 4 million shares. Since we began our repurchase program at the end of 2002, we have reduced
our share count by a net of approximately 31% to our current level of just over 315 million shares.
Moving on to Chart 9, we'll discuss our updated view of the guidance for the year. We are reaffirming our guidance for
both orders and sales as our first quarter results were in line with our expectations. As I mentioned earlier, sales are
expected to grow sequentially throughout the year, while orders are heavily weighted towards the second half of the
year and especially in the fourth quarter, similar to what we experienced last year.

We increased our segment operating profit guidance by $75 million, driven by the strong performance of Missiles and
Fire Control and Mission Systems and Training in the first quarter. We increased our outlook for earnings per share by
$0.25 and we'll describe that in more detail on the next chart. And we increased our cash from operations outlook by
$100 million to greater than or equal to $4.7 billion, recognizing our strong start to the year.
Chart 10 provides a reconciliation of our prior outlook for EPS compared with our new outlook. Our $75 million
increase in segment operating profit results in a $0.15 increase in earnings per share, while our significant repurchase
activity results in a lower average share count for the year that improves earnings per share by another $0.10. As a
result, our EPS guidance is now $10.50 to $10.80 per share.
Moving to Chart 11, our first quarter sales performance and nearly $80 billion in backlog enabled us to reaffirm our
sales outlook for each of the business areas and in total.
On Chart 12, we show our new segment operating profit outlook by business area and in total. We increased our
outlook for Mission Systems and Training by $45 million and Missiles and Fire Control by $30 million, resulting in the
overall increase of $75 million for the corporation.
And finally Chart 13, summarizes – or provides our summary for the quarter. The first quarter represents another strong
performance by the company with broad-based results operationally and financially. We had very good program
execution and continue to take proactive measures that benefit our customers, our employees and our stockholders.
With that we're ready for questions, Stephanie?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robert Stallard with Bank of America (sic) [RBC
Capital Markets] (18:38). Your line is open.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Thanks very much. Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hi, Rob.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Morning.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Bruce, I hate to kick off with pension, but I will. I was wondering if you could give us an
update on what you expect to see from the CAS side over the next, say, two to three years and also, what's your
expectation for pension contributions? Thanks very much.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So, Rob, there's a couple of moving pieces going on with the pension discussion I'll try
to capture in my response to your question there. So CAS is going to increase fairly significantly over the next couple
of years, and I would expect that our cash contributions to our pension trusts will probably be at a level close to what
we're experiencing this year and maybe drop off a little bit in the year, what's that, 2016, the year after next. But
importantly, within the discussion of pension in the near term is we do expect to see – we just had released the new
mortality table that we kind of teed up, I think, a few quarters back. And we would expect to incorporate that at the next
remeasurement of our pension plans.
And at least as I think about the effects of that mortality table change, sort of, with current assumptions for the discount
rate and asset returns, if those were held constant, sort of, current course and speed as we usually do, we'd expect to see
both FAS expense and CAS to be higher in 2015 than it would have been without the mortality change; and FAS will
actually increase by a greater amount than will CAS, so that alone would result in a slight reduction of FAS/CAS
income than what it otherwise would have been.
But you should think of this as still being significantly greater at the end of the day in 2015 than what we experience in
2015 about an order of magnitude of maybe 2X what we're seeing in 2014.

Cash, on the other hand, is likely to see some near-term benefit because we have been accelerating our pension
contributions as required under ERISA and so we're actually sitting pretty nicely, even with the effects of the mortality
table required cash contributions. Those will come in sort of later years for us, but the CAS impact, the Cost
Accounting Standards impact, will be updated prior to those required ERISA contributions, so we'll actually get, as I
said, a bit of a near-term net cash benefit. I said a lot there; hopefully, that all makes sense to you there.

Our next question comes from Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Morning, Joe.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: My question is on the share purchase plan that you guys have been offsetting for two-plus
years the option to issuance, et cetera in this quarter. For the first time in over two years, you broke below that 319
level. I'm just wondering if you could comment on, I guess, the strategy with share purchase now. Has it – are you
looking at reducing the share count going forward or is this just a quarterly timing issue? Thanks.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. I'll try that one as well, Joe. So a good question, and so look, as I think about share
repurchase, I'll give you a kind of a winding answer here. We've always said we're committed to offsetting share count
creep by offsetting the dilutive effects in particular of option exercises, but I'll remind you that, especially in the first
part of the year, we also increased share count for divesting of our restricted stock units and all throughout the year, we
make additional contributions to our 401(k) match in the form of stock as well. So those numbers tend to creep up
throughout the year and what we've said historically as well as this year is that we intend to offset that dilutive effect as
I said.
We also try to be opportunistic. We'll do the same this year, and at least as I think of the next three quarters or so, Joe,
we've offset most of the effect of both – well, clearly, of the option exercise that took place in the first quarter as well
as the RSU vesting. We'll continue to offset those option exercises and the 401(k) matches as they occur over the next
three quarters.
There is some variability that might play into how much we buy back associated with any potential acquisitions, if any,
that we would make in the rest of the year. So sort of depending on all the things I just described, the level of option
exercises, potential acquisitions, if any, we could see repos at a level that would bring cash on the balance sheet about
back to the level we started the year with, and we started the year at about $2.6 billion. Now, recognize that's not what
we have reflected in our current guidance, but that's kind of the way I'm thinking about it right now.
And maybe just one final point, I think we started the year a little under 10 million options available to be exercised.
We had about 2.3 million exercised in the first quarter. So, if you sort of annualize that, and that's an assumption on my
part that that'll be spread equally over the next few quarters, we'll be at about the same level of option exercises as we
were last year, $9-million-plus, and that would leave us literally, at the end of this year, with less than 1 million options
left to be vested. So, clearly, our rate of dilution, if you will, will start to diminish pretty significantly at the end of this
year.

Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Thanks. Good morning. Actually, two questions, well Slide 1, as a clarification. MST, the
implied margins for the remaining nine months, can you give us some color on why the step-down? Obviously,
outsized performance here in the first quarter, but even that looks like a step-down the last nine months, if you could
you help with?

And the other is the C-130 margins. I think they're pretty impressive in terms of the margin expansion in the C-130. In
2013, it looks like you had more margin expansion here in the first quarter. When you transition to that next multiyear,
is that something we have to think about a step-down with? Thanks.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Well, I'll give a shot at that, Myles, and see if Marillyn has any color she wants to add to it.
So MST might look a little unusual for a couple of reasons. We did have a very strong first quarter of the year from an
EBIT perspective and that kind of came in two flavors. One was we had some accelerated risk retirements that were
actually planned for later in the year that, simply because of good performance, were accelerated into the first quarter.
That obviously won't be a change to the year. But on the other hand, we actually had some just outright stronger
performance than we had expected in the plan. And that's the amount, if you will, that we increased the full year
outlook by for MST.
The piece that might be missing a little bit in your thinking is recall on the January call, we talked about the restructure
cost and the phasing of some of the expenses. These are expenses for a number of things: accelerated depreciation;
some of the facilities movement; personnel movements and so forth; personnel relocation I should say. And we talked
about that being about $80 million for the year.
MST was about $25 million of that and Space Systems had about $55 million of that, that we expected to hit EBIT. I
think I described that as about a $0.16 hit to EPS overall had it not been for that restructure charge. And nearly all of
that $25 million is going to fall in the last three quarters of the year for MST. So the same thing was Space by the way,
although you didn't ask about Space, the vast majority. So think of probably of the $80 million, $75 million or so of
that remaining restructure expense that we expect to incur in 2014 will hit the next three quarters, and just about
equally spread about $25 million a quarter. So that's contributing to not just the MST scenario, but the lower
going-forward scenario for Space Systems as well.
Now, having said all that, as I look at the business areas and where we sit today versus where we expect to be at the end
of the year, I do think we have some potential upside pressure, especially at MST and maybe a couple of the other
business areas as well. But it's just a little too early in the quarter – or, excuse me, a little too early in the year to
recognize that goodness at this time.
I'm sorry, C-130, yeah, I forgot that you'd asked about the C-130. So they were stronger, to your point, in the first
quarter, miles than they were last year. We had some step-ups associated with a couple of either completions or
near-completions of some contracts that, to your point, also are in advance of the multiyear.
As usual, whenever we kind of get to the end of a contract is when you'll see the majority of those risk retirements take
place. I think the multiyear, as with all sort of DoD contracts, we sort of start with a new sheet of paper in terms of
starting with the cost at the lower level than maybe where we have on a previous contract. So risk retirements
theoretically should be tougher from that lower number to begin with. So I think your question is the right one and we'll
just have to continue to see this kind of performance that we've had in the past. I'd like to think that we have with the
international mix going forward and the international interest and not all those are FMS sale variety, that we have some
potential to keep the C-130 program close to where we are today, but you're absolutely right that there is some pressure
going into the multiyear side of things.

<Q - David E. Strauss>: On F-35, it looks like most of the growth that you're anticipating over the next couple of
years is on the international side. And, Marillyn, you did address Korea coming into the fold, but how do you feel about
overall the stability on the international side? It sounds like Italy is a little wobbly, Canada is obviously reevaluating
things. Just how confident are you that this backlog is pretty secure? Thanks.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Thanks for the question, David. I would say we're pretty confident. I mean, when you
look at the next five years, close to half of our orders in the next five years will come from international customers on
the F-35 program. Each one of these customers, our partners, they go through their process, they periodically look at
their security and their defense needs and they have to go through a decision process. But we're confident when you
look at the South Koreans making their formal announcement; Israel, we could potentially see additional from Israel;
Australia, as they move through their procurement plan; at some time in the future, we think Singapore will revisit the
F-35 to determine when they want to buy. Canada's in their procurement process and working through that. So we feel
confident that the unique capabilities of the F-35 is going to make it remain the best choice for these customers and
expect to see that go forward.

Our next question comes from Richard Safran with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, Rich.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Morning.
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: I just wanted to ask a relatively simple question here about your outlook and your bookings
guidance. So I noted that you didn't change it, I understand, but I thought maybe you could give us a bit of an update
here on your booking guidance overall that you reported when you reported 4Q? Can you tell us maybe, for example,
what has to happen to achieve or exceed the high-end of the range and just how you're looking at it now?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So I'll fill it out, Rich. There's a lot of moving pieces. It's a simple question, but it may
not be a simple answer. There's a lot of moving pieces as you would expect at this point in the year, from sort of an
orders or a booking outlook as you described it. So I think we were actually pleased. I know the book-to-bill might
have seemed a little light to some, but we were actually pleased. We actually exceeded our estimate of what we were
expecting to receive from an orders perspective in the first quarter and a lot of that, frankly, was international content.
So we're pleased with that as well.
As I look forward in the next few quarters, I would think we should probably see a similar pattern to last year. I think if
I was a betting person, I'd say the next two quarters we'll probably receive about $10 billion plus or minus each in the
next few quarters. The biggest single order in the second quarter that we're expecting is closing on the Lockheed F-35
proposal, which by itself is probably worth about $3.5 billion.
There's also the FY 2014 buy for the C-5 program – think of that as $600 million or so – and international PAC-3 for
probably $0.5 billion to $600 million; the FY 2014 buy of the Fleet Ballistic Missile, about a $0.5 billion; and then
several satellites, including satellite aircraft – or Spacecraft 7 and 8 from the GPS III program and a commercial
satellite that collectively is about $0.5 billion a piece there – or $0.5 billion in total – excuse me.
So all that collectively, again, as we say, I think it's about $10 billion a quarter, both in the second and third. And then
similar to last year, we'd expect to see a pretty good size spike in the fourth quarter. If you just sort of back into the
numbers from where we are today, that's probably about – and the numbers I just gave you, that's probably about $16
billion or so in the fourth quarter. The biggest single item there is the C-130J multiyear, that close to $5 billion, but
that's really when we get all of our sort of new government fiscal year orders. So that's not an unusual pattern that we
would expect to see there.

Our next question comes from Jason Gursky from Citi. Your line is open.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Morning, Jason.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Bruce, I've got a quick follow-up question for you, and then just one quick one. On the
follow-up, you talked about the impacts of the mortality tables and there being higher FAS relative to CAS, as a result
of the change in the mortality tables. Is there room for you to quantify into sort of a range from how much higher the
FAS might be than the CAS as a result of the change of the mortality tables?
And then my question is on CapEx. You came in at a run rate of only $400 million for the year, which would be down
significantly year-on-year. So I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the trajectory of CapEx for the rest of
this year and do you think that we'll exit the year and what that perhaps implies CapEx as you move out into 2015 and
2016?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. Jason, I'll try that one. So I should have said on the answer to the first question, we
probably shouldn't refer to it as a mortality table; we actually like the term longevity table. It just sounds more
appealing to us than we talk about mortality. So we'll start from now on calling it a longevity table. So I did try to key
up that we see an increase in both FAS and CAS as soon as that is included in our remeasurement. I did not mean to
imply that FAS will be higher than CAS; simply the change in FAS will be higher than the change in CAS, if that
makes sense.
But, even with that – and that was the point I was trying to get to, Jason – even with that, saying that our pension
income, if you will, will be lower than it otherwise will – or excuse me – otherwise would have been without the
mortality table, we would still expect to see our FAS/CAS adjustment more than double from where we are today. So
where are we? About $435 million or so today. That number is – and this again is, as my usual caveat, current course
and speed on the discount rate and asset return, but as we see the longevity – excuse me – table impact in 2015, that
number is north of $800 million. So – and then, beyond that, Jason, that number sort of continues to increase in the out
years, at least for the next couple years beyond 2015. So as I look at CapEx in the first quarter, we're always
historically low, and I wish that were not the case frankly, but this takes a while sometimes for us to sort of break the
gears loose on the CapEx.
Last year, in the first quarter, I think we did just north of $100 million, like $103 million or something. This year,
believe it or not, we're actually a little higher at $106 million. So we do expect to see, just as we did last year, to kind of
close on the number that we included when we give our free cash flow for the year.
We do have some pretty good size items, including some restructure capital for the facilities movements that we talked
last year or January of this year, including the Space Systems consolidation that are yet to play out. But those are bigger
than maybe some of the ones we would typically have at an annual year and that is expected to happen in the next three
quarters.

<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: On the F-35, we saw a reduction of quantities for the C model in the President's budget
and there's a potential for further reductions in quantities if we see sequestration in 2016. Now, I know that your pricing
for the program is volume dependent. But can you describe the impact, if there's any, on program margins related to the
2015 cuts? And what could happen to margins if sequestration goes into effect and we see further cuts, given the way
you structure these contracts?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So I'll take a shot at that, Doug. So it's not inconsequential, but it's maybe not as large
as you might otherwise think. So, clearly, we will price the current fiscal year offering Lot 8 in this case with sort of the
known quantities and run those known quantities through our overhead rates, which is where some of the variability
would come in from the quantity changes. So that we would capture that in sort of the instant contract that we're
pricing. Where we may have a bit of pressure is prior contracts. So Lot 6 and Lot 7, for instance, would have been
priced with an assumed higher quantity of F-35s going forward in Lot 8 and beyond. So sort of the overhead absorption
impact of losing those quantities of aircraft will play out and hit, if you will, some of the performance of Lot 6 and Lot
7. Obviously, we'll try to mitigate as much of that as possible, but unfortunately, not all our overhead is 100% variable.
So some portion of the fixed cost will get spread in any event.
So and the other side of that is not so much on the Lot 6 and Lot 7, but some of the prior aircraft and some of the other
businesses with our contracts within Aeronautics are flexibly priced, cost-plus in nature or fixed-price incentive in
nature. So there will be some sharing of those cost increase as a result of that base deterioration.
I should remind you that all this has yet to play out completely because, for instance, the program of record, which is
what we tie to on the F-35 program, so while it would have had higher domestic quantities of aircraft in what we were
pricing the previous few lots on, that program of record, for instance, did not include the South Korean aircraft
quantities in it. So there is, at least hopefully, somewhat of a mitigating aspect for that in the not-too-distant future.

Our next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Hi. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Morning, Noah.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good morning.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Bruce, going back to the margin conversation, I guess the company has realigned businesses, is
doing/making changes with facilities, making changes with other costs that, where the numbers are pretty large, but I
guess we don't know what the starting point was. So I'm sort of curious if there's a way to categorize how much more
can still change from a cost perspective to boost margins?
And then, forgetting about this year, forgetting about next year, just bigger picture, longer-term, is this low 13%
segment operating margin in the realistic scenario analysis of what the long-term Lockheed Martin segment operating
margin can be?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Okay. Just let me think about that for a second. Noah, you asked a lot of detail there and I've
to get my head around it. But sort of my summation, how much more cost take-out potential is left. I always believe
and I know Marillyn has ingrained this in my thinking and probably the corporation's thinking, but we try to get to, as
I've said this in the past, as much of the variable cost mentality as possible, and so lot of that is sort of environmentally
dependent and not all of our business areas are sort of created equal in that regard. So one of the more flexible
businesses we have, for instance, is our short-cycle IS&GS business where we have a lot of facilities that are leased in
nature and not owned, not all of them by the way, but a lot of them there. So we've been able to flex pretty
dramatically. If you just look back the last few years at IS&GS and look at the unfortunate head count reductions we've
had to take, we've been able to maintain margins throughout that period with a pretty sizable reduction in our overall
workforce. So that's, for instance, one business area that has the ability to flex to match its environment.

Some of our longer-cycle businesses, as you would expect, like Space Systems or Aeronautics, they have a higher
capital cost content and, therefore, that's harder to remove, but one of the things we've been trying to do is take a look
at our total square footage and optimizing our square footage around the corporation. So the moves that we just
announced in November were to take out another 2.5 million square feet on top of about 2 million square feet we've
done in the past few years, so well over 4 million in total. That's just sort of sizing the operations to the environment in
which we operate, and I think we're good at that. I think we're good at that across the corporation.
So you never know what you have to do until you're sort of hit with the predicament that the environment throws at
you, but we work it very hard. I'll also remind you that probably two-thirds of our costs is in the supply base. So we try
to get that as well under control and that's a big part of it as well.
And while we're reducing space in some areas, we're actually growing concurrently in other areas. So, for instance, our
Troy, Alabama facility or Camden, Arkansas where we're doing some of the fan production and some of the missile
production, Missiles and Fire Control's actually growing, so we've got this constant increasing and decreasing. I think
we've become very good at that over the years we do that, so I don't think that we've reached a limit as far as what we
can or cannot do in the future.
Then, as far as the 13% long term, I mean given that we've hit that twice and that's the highest, I would say that's a hard
hurdle for us to maintain. And especially in the near term, as we've talked about in the past, now with the significant
growth coming on the F-35 program at lower than the overall margin rate, that's clearly going to put pressure on our
ability to achieve that.
The flipside of that argument, though, is our international content is expected to grow over the near term. I think we'll
hit close to 20% this year and we could do more than that in the next couple of years even. So that typically would have
a mitigating function, but overall, I'd say it's going to be hard to maintain the 13%; that's just a level we have achieved
infrequently and it'll be hard to maintain that going forward.

Our next question comes from John Godyn with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - John D. Godyn>: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. First, there's a lot of debate among investors on how to
really think about these pension tailwinds and what they mean for the stock. I was hoping to focus in a little bit on the
cash part of it; the cash tailwind from prepayments for CAS harmonization and better understand how the management
team thinks about it for capital allocation in the future.
I guess at the extreme, some would argue that a temporary tailwind should be returned to investors in, I guess,
above-normal buybacks or something of that nature. That might be too simple. But it also seems like it's too simple that
a tailwind that's not going to last forever has no impact on how you think about capital allocation going forward. So I'm
just curious if you could kind of focus in on that, and maybe help investors understand how they should treat it for the
purposes of analyzing the stock. Thanks.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. Well, John, I appreciate the question. I think it's a very well thought-out question, so
let me try to address everything you describe there. So, in years past, and not this year, we've intended to – whenever
we give the EPS performance, we've given adjusted EPS, try to take into account the fact that we thought our GAAP
reported earnings were probably understated relative to the valuation of the company, and that that wasn't necessarily a
good measure for our investors to be basing their valuation of the stock upon.
And so now we've got the flip situation of that; where our reported earnings are actually getting a tailwind, as you said,
because of the FAS/CAS adjustment. So what I've been trying to preach for a number of years is that the real valuation,
upon which the stock should be valued, is the cash flow, and sort of a cash flow per share to be specific with that. So, at
least as we look at even with the substantial conversion from expense to income this year, as I said, I think $430-ish
million or so of income added to our segment operating profit, that takes us to the current outlook again of about

$10.55 to $10.80. I think our free cash flow per share this year is somewhere north of $11.30. And so, when I think of
cash deployment in particular and I look at the payout ratios from a dividend perspective or the cash available for share
repurchases, I am very much focused on our sort of free cash flow per share and I think that number grows over the
next couple of years, potentially pretty significantly as we start to finally recover some of this $9 billion or so that
we've had pre-funded into our pension trust that we're yet to recover via our billings to the government.
Now, the mortality table that I just described has some longer-term implications that I'd described. I mean, obviously,
as people live longer, that will require additional contributions over the longer term; that should get reimbursed on our
CAS contracts. But, as I said earlier, and I forgot who asked the question, in the near term, that actually is an upper to
cash flow because we don't expect to have, near term, much of an incremental increase in our required contributions,
but our CAS to our government customers will reflect that mortality table change earlier. So that's the way I think of it,
very much looking at it from sort of a free cash per share basis. And on that basis, I think we've still got some upside
from both the dividend potential as well as share repurchase potential going forward.

Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Hey. Good morning, Bruce and Marillyn.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, Ron.
<A - Jerry F. Kircher>: Morning, Ron.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: I just want to ask maybe a broad question on capital allocation. So, when you think about
Lockheed stock at current levels and buying it here, do you think there's other places that the corporation can invest for
growth, right? Arguably buying back the shares helps the earnings per share, but it's not really a strategy to fuel growth
for the future, right? I mean are there other things to do and are you contemplating it and can you talk about that?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. I'll give a shot, and I think Marillyn may add some color here as well, but – so we're
not – this is not an idle conversation that we have. We don't automatically drop to the fact that we need to be buying
back shares and that's the best use of capital. We actually do look at growth opportunities for the corporation. We did
two small acquisitions in the first quarter, as we described. We did those because we do believe that there's growth
potential in both of those acquisitions.
And so the other thing we try and do is invest internally. So, as you think of some of our independent research and
development, if you take a look over the last two years, we're up some $100 million or so in just the level of IRAD. So
we're trying to do what's right from supporting our shareholders, as well as supporting internal growth.
I'll mention we just invested in a terrific facility in Palo Alto in California to create a new lab for one of our
organizations out of Space Systems. That's sort of the forward-looking piece of that business.
So I think we're making those right decisions, but honestly, as we look at the environment right now, there's not enough
of those to justify the ample cash that we are throwing off right now as a very mature business and in an environment
that we're in from an overall budget perspective. And probably the last thing you would want us to do is to go chasing
growth and overpaying for growth. So, given those prospects, I think what we're doing is what most investors would
hope for us to do and we're doing that in a very thoughtful and hopefully prudent manner.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: I'd just add to that as well, Ron, that if you look at the things that we are investing in, as
Bruce said, we were up on our R&D expenditures last year. Over the past five years, we've invested more than $3
billion into research and development, things like advanced material, advanced manufacturing. We're doing things in
autonomy and robotics. Some of the acquisitions we've made in the unmanned space, quantum computing, cyber,
energy. There's a lot of areas that we're continuing to invest in. And importantly, we're also continuing to invest in our
current portfolio to keep it relevant. So making sure we're listening to our customer, extending the range for example
on the PAC-3 and FAD and JASSM and some of the key capabilities...

<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Or RASM are opportunities that we look at it offering different variants of the LCS to the
international marketplace. We are definitely continuing to maintain that portfolio and look for opportunities, advance
concepts and things that we can do to stay ahead of what our customers' needs are.
You saw probably the SR-72 that we rolled out, which was a capability we've been working on for a number of years
and we've got a ways to go yet in order to demonstrate it, but having an intelligence surveillance reconnaissance
capability with the potential for a Strike platform, which is very interesting. That's just one example, but one that, I
think, makes the point that we're going to continue to do what we do as a corporation; to be focused on being a
technology leader because that is the value that we create for our customers.

Our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hey, good morning, almost afternoon, all.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Morning.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, Carter.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Bruce, just one clarification and then a question, if I will, on the longevity table, as you stated
it; the dynamic for 2016 and 2017, if you look out beyond 2015, presumably that's the same sort of impact in terms of
FAS being revised up more than CAS on a relative basis in those years, similar to what you're seeing in 2015; is that
correct?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, it is Carter, but I'll make, hopefully, the same point that I tried to make on the 2015.
Even after that adjustment, we would still expect to see increasing pension income, even after the longevity table is
implemented from 2015 to 2016 to 2017.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Okay. And you're still expecting a pretty sizable step-up to the contribution out there in, I
guess, it's 2016 or 2017?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: So we've got a fairly large contribution required in 2017, but we've also got a fairly large
CAS recovery as we kind of get to the end of the CAS harmonization timeline there. So I would expect, I'll say net-net
cash from our pension to actually increase over those same years that you just described.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Okay. And then with respect to the DoD or the domestic versus the non-DoD or international
growth, with respect to the 4% decline this quarter, how would that have looked on a domestic versus international
basis? And if you could do the same for bookings, that would be helpful as well?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, so I think and I'm doing this a little off the top of my head, Carter, but at the discussion
we had with the media earlier today, I made the point that if you just take a look at our DoD sales on a stand-alone
basis, they dropped 4% from the year 2012 to the year 2013. And then, we expect peer DoD sales to drop another 6%
from the end of 2013 to the end of 2014. So a 10% drop year-over-year from 2012 to 2014. What's lost in some of the
discussion, though, is we'd actually expected 2014 before sequestration to actually have an increase in sales amount.
So, arguably, from a planned perspective, we're actually down more than the 6% that I talked about just now, because
that's sort of going actuals to the end of the year, expected actuals and not recognizing what it otherwise could have
been without sequestration. Hopefully, that makes some sense to you.
In the quarter itself, so in the non-DoD or the international content specifically, we're looking at something like a 13%
increase year-over-year in our total international sales. And that's – and again, from a total perspective, we're going
from roughly 17% to right at or just a little bit below 20%. So – but for the international growth, we would have seen a
much larger impact, because the DoD is again decreasing about 4% clip. So the reason we're sort of down only the 1%
