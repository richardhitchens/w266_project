In today's call, Jim and Lynn will review our first quarter highlights and briefly update you on our near-term priorities
including our recent regulatory activities. Additionally, we will discuss trends in our customer usage patterns as well as
the economic conditions in our each of our service territories. Finally, we will review our quarterly earnings
considerations for 2013 as well as our overall financial objectives. After their prepared comments, Jim and Lynn will
take your questions.
Now, let me turn it over to Jim.
James E. Rogers
Thanks, Bill. It is good to have you all on the call today. We are now 10 months into the merger with Progress Energy,
and I am very pleased with how we are executing our plans. Our first quarter performance built on our momentum in
2012. For the first quarter, we announced adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.02 compared with $1.13 for the
same quarter a year ago.
Even though below last year our quarterly earnings are on plan, as a result, we're on track to achieve and today are
affirming our 2013 earnings guidance range of $4.20 to $4.45. Lynn will provide more details on the first quarter
earnings drivers for each of our segments. Also, she will provide our perspective on the quarterly variability in earnings
this year.
During the quarter, our operational performance was strong as highlighted by our nuclear fleet. Slide five should be
familiar to you. We've used it since last summer to show our near term priorities and progress in resolving them. As
you can see, we have checked off several important items. Now, we are focused on placing Edwardsport into
commercial service and obtaining constructive rate case outcomes. We have requested more than $1 billion of annual
retail rate release in the Carolinas and Ohio. I'll discuss both Edwardsport and the rate cases in a moment. We also
remain focused on our longer term priorities – one fully integrating the merge companies, while achieving the targeted
savings for customers and investors, and two, optimizing nuclear fleet performance.
Our integration efforts are producing results and we're clearly on track to achieve the merger synergies we expected.
During the first quarter, we achieved $37 million in fuel and joint dispatch savings from our Carolinas fleet. That was
in addition to the $52 million in the first six months of the merger. We're also making good progress on other
integration efforts and are achieving labor reductions in other nonfuel O&M savings.
In fact, about 30% of our merger integration initiatives have been completed. The other initiatives are either on
schedule or ahead of schedule. As for our nuclear plants, Seya and his team continue deploying the nuclear operating
model across the entire fleet, which includes 11 units in the Carolinas. We're seeing very positive results as measured
by our seven key nuclear performance metrics. Most importantly, our nuclear fleet capacity factor for the quarter
exceeded 97%.
Now turning to slide six; I want to update you on the regulatory proceedings regarding our Crystal River nuclear unit in
Florida. This plant has been safely shut down since late 2009. We decided earlier this year to retire the plant rather than
attempt a complex, first-of-a-kind repair.
We are finalizing a comprehensive decommissioning plan and will file it with the NRC. As you all know, we selected
the safe-store method. The transition organization is fully staffed. Over the next few months, full-time staffing will be
significantly reduced from the previous – from the 600 previously on site.
Late last year, we entered into a non-binding mediation with NEIL, our insurance provider, to resolve all outstanding
claims related to the Crystal River 3 unit. In February, both the company and NEIL accepted the mediator's proposal
whereby NEIL would pay the company an additional $530 million to resolve all outstanding insurance claims related to
the plant. We received the $530 million last month, and these proceeds benefit our Florida customers.
We believe that both decisions were in the best overall interest of our customers, joint owners and investors. The
settlement agreement approved by the Florida Commission last year gave us the sole discretion and flexibility to retire

this plant. The Commission is working with the parties and are proceeding to finalize the issues that the Commission
will review. We expect the Commission to complete this shortly. Oral arguments before the pre-hearing officer were
held earlier this week and a scheduling order has been issued which sets hearings for October.
Before moving to the rate cases, let me give you a brief update on our new nuclear development activities. Yesterday,
we announced our decision to suspend our plan for two proposed new nuclear units at our Harris plant site in North
Carolina. We continue to pursue combined operating and construction licenses for our proposed Lee Nuclear Station in
South Carolina and the Lee Nuclear Station in Florida. Related to the Harris license applications, we have spent about
$70 million to date. We plan to seek recovery of the retail allocation of these costs from the North Carolina and South
Carolina utility commissions.
Next, starting with slide seven. I'll update you on our rate activities in the Carolinas. Duke Energy Progress filed a
general rate case in North Carolina last fall. We've reached a settlement agreement with the North Carolina public staff
in February. Under the terms of the settlement, the return on equity will be 10.2% with a 53% equity component of the
cap structure. The terms are subject to North Carolina Commission approval.
Parties to the agreement have agreed to delay cash collection, a financing cost on quit for the Sutton natural gas plant
for one year. Upon Commission approval, the immediate increase to customers will be $151 million. There would be
another $31 million in year two upon inclusion of Sutton in customer rates. This settlement provides a fair and balanced
outcome for the Commission to consider. We have completed our hearings before the Commission and expect a
decision in time for the new rates to be effective in June.
In addition, Duke Energy Carolinas has filed rate cases in both North Carolina and South Carolina, as outlined on slide
eight. We are requesting an annual retail revenue increase of $446 million in North Carolina and $220 million in South
Carolina. In each case, we are seeking a return on equity of 11.25%. These rate cases are needed to recover the
investments we have made to modernize our system. For example, Cliffside Unit 6 and the Dan River natural gas plant,
both put into service in late 2012 and both pre-approved by the commissions.
The evidentiary hearings on the North Carolina case begins July 8 while the South Carolina hearing begins July 31. We
expect rates to be effective for South Carolina in September. We have also requested a September effected date for
revised rates in North Carolina. Before moving to the Ohio rate cases, I want to mention a recent decision by the North
Carolina Supreme Court. The court remanded the Duke Energy Carolina's 2012 rate case decision to the North Carolina
Utilities Commission. As you all will recall, in early 2012, the commission approved revised customer rates based on
the settlement agreement with the public staff at a 10.5% return on equity.
The North Carolina attorney general appealed the decision to the state Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has required
the Commission to make an independent determination regarding the proper ROE. This past Monday, the attorney
general filed a motion with the Commission requesting that the rate increase approved in 2012 be reversed until the
Commission issues its ROE decision. We oppose this motion. We continue to believe the settlement agreement
approved by the commission is fair and balanced.
Next, let's turn to Ohio regulatory activity starting on slide nine with our two distribution rate cases. One, for electric
service and the other for natural gas. Early last month, we reached agreements with all intervening parties in both cases.
Under the settlement terms, the net annualized revenue increase for electric distribution would be $49 million. There
will be no adjustment for natural gas distribution. Parties to the settlement in the gas case agreed to litigate the recovery
of costs associated with the remediation of the old manufactured gas plant sites.
We are seeking annual recovery of $22 million over three years. The Ohio Commission approved the electric case
stipulation earlier this week and we expect revise rates will be in effect later this month. It will most likely be later in
the summer before we receive the gas order.
Next, I will update you on our cost based capacity filing in Ohio as outlined on slide 10. We filed the $728 million
request last August. We're seeking appropriate compensation for our capacity service. This filing does not seek to alter
the electric security plan under which Duke Energy Ohio now operates. Hearings began in April. We presented a strong
case and interveners made arguments consistent with their previous filings, rebuttal hearings will resume later in May.

The legal basis under which this request was filed remains strong. The filing is consistent with a new call space
compensation mechanism adopted for fixed resource requirement entities in Ohio. Once hearings are completed, we
will await a Commission decision. The decision will inform our long term strategic plans for our Midwest generation
fleet.
Turing to slide 11, we continued to advance our fleet modernization program. $9 billion of investments adding 6,600
megawatts of natural gas and coal-fired generating capacity. This program gives us the ability to retire up to 6,800
megawatts of our older less-efficient, high-emitting coal plants in our oil-fired units. This will give us a high level of
fuel diversity, which will benefit customers by giving a flexibility to adapt to future changes in commodity prices.
In 2012, we brought three new plants online, a combination of natural gas and coal-fired units and we're on track to
bring our remaining two construction projects, Edwardsport and Sutton into service in 2013. Let me provide to you an
update on the Edwardsport IGCC coal plant in Indiana. As you all remember, we completed the construction in 2012.
We're now in the final process of completing the testing needed before we begin to bring 618-megawatt plant into
service and deem it operational.
Both gasifiers have successfully produced syngas from coal and we produced electricity from both turbines using
syngas, natural gas, and a blend of both. We're on track to put Edwardsport into commercial service later this month.
This will be a major milestone. As with any new large plant, additional testing, completion of punchless items and
project closeout activities will continue for several months past the commercial operating day.
Edwardsport will be a very important addition to our generation fleet in Indiana. The other major construction project is
Sutton, a combined cycle natural gas plant we're building in Eastern North Carolina. We expect to place the 625
megawatt Sutton Plant into commercial service during the fourth quarter. It represents the latest step in modernizing
and adding more natural gas diversification in the Carolinas.
In summary, we are very pleased with our performance in the first quarter. And our focus on resolving near-term
priorities. The organization has quickly pulled together as one team. We continue to drive efficiencies that benefit
customers and investors. We're making the most of the unique strength this merger has created. Our performance in the
quarter leaves us well positioned to meet our 2013 earnings and operational objectives.
Now Lynn will provide a more detailed look at our financial performance in the quarter, including a customer load and
economic update.
Lynn J. Good
Thank you, Jim. I'd like to begin by saying how pleased I am with our first quarter results. Slide 12 provides our
earnings summary. As you know, first quarter 2013 adjusted diluted earnings were $1.02 per share. These results were
on track with our expectations for the quarter, although lower than our first quarter 2012 results of $1.13 per share. On
a reported basis, our earnings for the quarter were $0.89 per share compared to $0.66 per share last year. A
reconciliation of our reported results to our adjusted results is included in the supplemental materials.
Today, I will focus my remarks on the significant adjusted earnings drivers for each of our business segments for the
first quarter. I'll spend a few minutes on our volume trends and the economic conditions within our service territories. I
will then discuss the timing of several key earnings drivers that you should consider as you assess our quarterly
earnings through the remainder of the year. And I will close with our financial objectives going forward.
First, let's briefly discuss the primary adjusted earnings per share drivers for each of our business segments. Adjusted
earnings at our regulated business, U.S. Franchised Electric and Gas increased by $0.44 per share. U.S. FE&G's
increased results were primarily driven by the addition of Progress Energy's regulated utility operations in the Carolinas
and Florida which contributed $0.35 per share in the quarter. More favorable weather of $0.10 per share was also a
significant driver for the quarter.

As you might recall, first quarter 2012 was extremely mild with the Carolinas heating degree days at their lowest level
on record for our first quarter. Weather during the first quarter of 2013 was favorable to normal by $0.02 per share.
Colder than normal weather in March more than offset the mild weather in January. During the quarter, pricing in
riders were favorable by $0.03 per share. This increase was primarily due to the timing of revised rates associated with
our prior rate cases in the Carolinas. As a result of these rate cases going into effect in February 2012, we recognized an
additional month of revised rates during this year's quarter.
Finally, additional wholesale revenues increased earnings by about $0.02 per share for the quarter. As we discussed at
our Analyst Day in late February, the wholesale business involves the short term and long term contracts to provide
power to municipalities and co-ops within our service territories. We expect the wholesale business will contribute
pre-tax net margins of $1 billion in 2013. This power is sold under various pricing mechanisms such as formula rates
and fixed capacity contracts with price escalators. We have several new wholesale contracts that began in 2013. These
contracts will grow over time as the volume sold increased over the contract term.
The terms of these new contracts are long term between 15 to 20 years. As we look forward, we expect our wholesale
business to add an incremental $0.07 to $0.08 annually to earnings in 2014 and 2015 resulting in an average growth
rate of 8% for this business. Partially offsetting these favorable drivers for FE&G was a decline in allowance for funds
used during construction equity of $0.02 per share.
Resulting from the completion of several major construction projects in 2012 such as Cliffside and Dan River. As
expected, this decline in AFUDC also contributed to a higher effective tax rate. This higher tax rate decreased earnings
by $0.02 per share.
Next, I will address international energy's results which as expected were $0.06 lower than the prior year quarter.
International results were impacted by lower volumes and higher purchase power cost due to delay and rainfall in
Brazil, as well as FX and lower commodity prices at National Methanol.
Let me provide you an update on the rainfall conditions in Brazil. As we entered 2013, reservoir levels in Brazil were
unusually low due to a delay in the rainy season. Since our Analyst Day in February, rainfall has been stronger. This
has resulted in reservoir levels increasing from around 30% at the beginning of the year to around 60% currently. Even
though this is a significant improvement, these levels are still below historic averages for this time of year.
Due to the lower reservoir levels, higher cost thermal power is being allocated to cover the demand, resulting in a
higher exposure to cost for hydro generators, including our Brazilian operation. We will continue to monitor the
reservoir levels and keep you updated as the year progresses.
Next moving to our Commercial Power segment, results were $0.03 per share lower in the first quarter as compared to
the prior year. This decline was primarily due to lower PJM capacity revenues for our Midwest generation fleet. Prices
declined from $110 per megawatt day in the prior year quarter to $16 per megawatt day in the first quarter of 2013.
And finally, let me discuss Other. This category primarily includes corporate interest expense not allocated to the
business units, results from Duke Energy's Captive Insurance company, other investments and quarterly income tax
levelization adjustments.
We recorded higher interest expense of $0.04 per share associated with the Progress Energy Holding company debt and
$0.02 per share associated with higher debt level at Duke Energy Holding company. We also recognized dilution of
$0.41 per share for the quarter, resulting from the issuance of additional shares in connection with the Progress merger.
As you know, we issued around 258 million shares after the completion of the merger. We now have around 705
million shares outstanding.
Turning to slide 13, I'll spend a few minutes on our volume trends for the quarter and the economic conditions within
our service territories. As a reminder, it's important to note that 2012 was a leap year. Our 2013 guidance assumes
weather-normalized retail-load growth of around 0.5%.
For the first quarter, our retail volumes excluding the impacts of weather were down 0.5% to the prior year period
across all customer classes. However, if the prior year leap year effect is excluded, our first quarter volumes would've

been favorable by approximately 0.5%, which is consistent with our annual expectations.
Let me briefly discuss some of the trends we're seeing in each of our customer classes. First, our residential customers.
Usage per customer for this class continues to trend slightly lower. We continue to experience growth in the average
number of customers, primarily in the Carolinas, Indiana, and Florida. Since last year, we've added approximately
50,000 new electric customers, an average increase of 0.7%. Trends in this customer class will continue to track the
recovery in the housing market as well as the general economy.
Excluding the leap year effect, our commercial class remains on a slow and steady growth path. Usage per customer in
this sector is relatively flat, while growth in consumer spending and retail sales remain modest. Office vacancy rates
remain consistent and above historical norms.
In the industrial sector in the Carolinas, we continue to experience strength in the automotive sector which has helped
to offset the continued decline in the textile industry. In the Midwest, the automotive sector is also strong, but has been
offset by recent weakness in the steel industry due to volatile steel prices and global economic uncertainties. As you
will recall, industrial activity comprises a very small percentage of our customer load in Florida. Overall, the economy
continues to perform in line with our expectations and is recovering at a slow and steady pace. We expect economic
activity to pick up in the second half of the year. Our service territories remain attractive for economic development
activities. As an example, MetLife, the global life insurance and employee benefits provider announced in March that it
intends to create 2600 jobs in Charlotte and Cary, North Carolina by the end of 2013. And just a few weeks ago,
Google announced it is expanding its data center site in Western North Carolina, making an additional $600 million
investment to the area. These announcements have resulted in new investments and jobs in our service territory.
Now, I'd like to discuss several earnings considerations for this year. As you are aware, the midpoint of our 2013
earnings guidance range of $4.20 to $4.45 is reasonably consistent with our adjusted EPS of $4.32 in 2012. Even
though the annual earnings per share are expected to be reasonably consistent, the quarterly contributions in 2013 will
differ from 2012. We expect a relatively weaker first half in 2013 compared to 2012 and a relatively stronger second
half. This variability is being driven by a few key drivers which are outlined on slide 14. First, the timing of rate case
resolution. We expect to begin recognizing the benefits from our pending rate cases in the third and fourth quarters
upon approval from our commission. Our second key driver is the timing of recognizing O&M expenses and merger
savings. We expect to experience more significant merger synergies in the back half of the year as these savings ramp
up over time. Third, the impact of the issuance of incremental shares in connection with the Progress Energy merger.
As I mentioned a moment ago, we will have significantly higher share counts in the first half of 2013 compared to
2012. Even though the additional share counts are evenly distributed throughout the year, the offsetting earnings
contributions from the Progress utilities are not. The first half of the year normally contributes lower earnings than the
second half due to seasonality.
The forth key driver is significantly lower PJM capacity revenues for our non-regulated Midwest generation fleet. As I
previously mentioned in the June 2012 to May 2013 PJM option, the capacity price declined sharply to $16 per
megawatt day from the previous price of $110 per megawatt day. Overall, our first quarter results are on track with our
plan and give us confidence in our ability to deliver on our full year 2013 EPS guidance range.
In closing, we're affirming the guidance range of $4.20 to $4.45 for 2013 based upon adjusted diluted earnings per
share. Results for the full year will be largely dependent on the successful resolution of our pending major rate
requests, effective cost control and our results in the third quarter, historically our most significant. We continue to
focus on growing the dividend, which is central to our investor value proposition. We are committed to a payout ratio
of 65% to 70%, based upon adjusted diluted earnings per share. Our current dividend yield of 4.1% remains attractive
in the ongoing low interest rate environment. And we remain confident we are on track to achieve our short term and
long term financial objective.
Now, I'll turn it back over to Jim.

James E. Rogers
Thanks, Lynn. With that, let's open up the phone lines for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Good morning, Greg.
<A - James E. Rogers>: Good morning.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Can you give us an update of where you stand in terms of your CEO search and whether you can
give us any view on whether we get visibility on that sort of at the frontend of the period that is stipulated in the
settlement or towards the end of the year?
<A - James E. Rogers>: Greg, I'll address that. The CEO selection process is being led by a special committee of the
board. The committee is working with an outside adviser to support this process in applying a great deal of rigor and
due diligence. Of all the decisions a board can make, the most important decision is the selection of the CEO. They are
looking at both internal candidates as well as external candidates. The process is ongoing. They are being very
thoughtful, deliberative, and are working their way through this and it's difficult at this time to predict when the
decision will actually be made, but in every event, it will be made before the end of this year.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks very much. One other question on a different subject, it's been fairly often the case that
you've been able to settle cases in North Carolina. I can't remember a situation where the ROE has been challenged in
court and remanded in this fashion. Is there any precedent for this type of scenario and can we look at that precedent, if
there is any, into how the Commission might respond?
<A - James E. Rogers>: As a general rule the Supreme Court defers to the judgment of the state commission. I think
what's important to appreciate about the remand to the state commission is this, they didn't strike down the 10.5% ROE.
What they simply did was ask the Commission to explain in detail the basis of their approval, the merger and specific –
I mean, the settlement and specifically the underlying basis for the 10.5%. There is ample evidence in the record and
what is expected from the Commission and at least what we expect from the Commission is that they will review the
evidence that was presented and they will write an order that underpins the 10.5%
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thank you very much.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Thank you.
Operator
And next, we'll go to Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - James E. Rogers>: Good morning, Dan.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Just following upon Greg's question on the North Carolina situation. Does that, potentially have
any bearing on how the progress settlement is put together when it gets presented ultimately to the Commission or does
it prospectively slow down the Duke case in the sense of maybe you need to build a bigger or more broad docket in
order to avoid a debate in the future?

<A - James E. Rogers>: Good question, Dan. I would address it this way. When we file for a rate case we file with a
lot of testimony that really supports the ROE requests that we are making. The – and as a consequence of that when we
enter into a settlement, as we have in the Progress Energy case, basically that 10.2% is underpinned with testimony and
we will file additional testimony when there is a hearing on the settlement.
So I think the most important point here is that one doesn't change the historic practice in the Carolinas of reaching
settlements and presenting settlements to the Commission, what the court has really done is asked the Commission to
explain in much greater detail why they approved the settlement and specifically why they approved the ROE. So I
think it's really a message to the Commission to address, based on record evidence, why they made their decision in
more detail
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. All right. Thank you.
<A - James E. Rogers>: Thanks.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Thanks.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Can I ask one more? I'm sorry.
<A - James E. Rogers>: Sure.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: On the Ohio capacity case situation, obviously the other parties have pretty staunchly
maintained their position and you guys have maintained yours. Is there an opportunity for you guys to look at a
settlement or find a common ground on this issue or is this one that's going to have to go to a Commission decision and
prospectively litigation to get to a fair outcome from your perspective?
<A - James E. Rogers>: Dan, my judgment is I mean we've always reached settlements in Ohio, but this one is in
difficult, if not impossible to reach a settlement. I don't rule out the possibility of settlement later in the process, but I
think where everybody is kind of strapped on their position and going full speed before the Commission to make the
argument.
And the argument is a strong argument and if I had put my – I haven't practiced law in a long time, but if I put my hat
on as a lawyer, this case is a very strong case for us because this capacity charge has been approved for AEP and the
consequence of it, the Commission can't discriminate against one company versus another company in the application
of their rulings and so we clearly are going to land in the Supreme Court. I believe we can win and there seems to be
evidence or an indication that we could win at the Commission.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. And then I guess, Lynn, just one question on Commercial Power after the first quarter
kind of fairly far off the full year rate and capacity is going to work into this in the second half. What should we be
thinking about that's going to help fill in against guidance where you guys have it today?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Yeah, Dan, we do have an assumption of some success in Ohio in our guidance. And I think as
we shared with you in February, if you look at the broad guidance range of $4.20 to $4.45, we've assumed a range of
outcomes, and so as we move through this process and get some more clarity on Ohio, I think we'll be able to give you
more sense of how Commercial will contribute as well as how the other parts of the business will contribute.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. Thank you, guys.

<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Good morning.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Good morning.
<A - James E. Rogers>: Good morning, Stephen.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: I wanted to touch on your disclosure on wholesale revenues and Lynn, you provided some
discussion of that business. Could you talk a little bit to the degree to which that the – talk a bit to the sort of the
execution risk relating to that and the certainty of being able to achieve that; it looks like good EPS contribution, 8%
growth. Could you just talk a little bit more sort of about where you stand? You mentioned a few contracts, but just I
couldn't kind of relate that back to the overall number.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Yeah. So Stephen, we have a high degree of confidence in our ability to achieve those numbers
and that growth rate because the contracts have been signed and are in place. So the two that we pointed to was a wrap
contract or an extended contract with NCEMC in the Eastern part of our Carolina territory. And then a contract that we
announced really back in 2010 involving co-ops in the northern part of south Carolina, a contract that we'll ramp up
over a period of time over the next several years. So the contracts are in place and we believe that we have a high
degree of confidence in achieving those numbers.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Okay. Thank you very much. And then just on the financial side of things. Your interest
expense year-to-date and your overall assumption, just curious if as you are looking at your financing plan relative to
where you initially set your assumptions, are things generally tracking on line or are rates coming in lower? How you
are sort of tracking the terms of your financing cost?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Generally tracking online, Stephen and we have in the appendix our expectation for additional
financing over the course of the year. We do have a number of issuances that we'll plan in the back half of the year.

<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Good morning.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Hi, Jonathan.
<A - James E. Rogers>: Good morning.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Just a quick one on Brazil. What would be a good assumption for a run rate headwind if
the current curtailments continue through the year? We've had some talk that they might want to really kind of build a
buffer ahead of the World Cup next year, et cetera. So I mean if things don't improve, is Q1 a guide to future quarters?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Jonathan, that's a good question. As we looked at planning for Brazil and for International, what
was delivered this first quarter is actually consistent with our plan. So we were expecting this level of contribution. We
do see some expectation of higher than average dispatch on thermal generation for the balance of 2013, but we would
not expect it to have the impact that it had in the first quarter, but what I would also say is this is a situation that we're
continuing to monitor and we'll give you an update as the year progresses.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay. Thank you. And on another front, could you give us a little more insight into what's
still showing up in the cost to achieve line on – what kind of timeframe should we expect that to fade?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Cost to achieve will be with us for a few years, Jonathan, primarily related to integration of
systems and also costs as we continue to move through the exiting of employees who are leaving under the voluntary
severance plan. So a couple of examples would be HR and Finance Systems will not be in effect until early 2014.

We'll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Hi, guys. Can you talk a little bit about -.
<A - James E. Rogers>: Good morning.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Good morning. Can you talk a little but about Crystal River and specifically
decommissioning costs and the decommissioning fund meaning what are the variables that could significantly change
the expected decommissioning cost of the plant? Where does the fund stand in terms of meeting the decommissioning
cost of the plant? And how do you manage the risk around the cost variability of decommissioning, meaning, are there
ways you can shelter Duke from cost escalation in the decommissioning of Crystal River over time?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Michael, I'll start and see if we can resolve. Dhiaa is also here for further discussion on the
specifics of the decommissioning plan. But we have $600 million in the decommissioning trust fund, which is a fully
funded level assuming that the plant retires in the 2030 timeframe. Under the safe-store method that we've adopted, we
have 40 to 50 years to move through decommissioning of this plant. And so we believe our funding level is adequate.
We'll be monitoring it as we go and you ought to think about it is almost equivalent to the way we manage liabilities
and a pension fund where we have investments with equity and fixed income that we match to an expectation of
liabilities. And we run scenarios and assumptions on cost as well as scenarios and assumptions on investment of assets
to ensure that we're adequately funded.
<A - Dhiaa M. Jamil>: So Michael, if I add to that from a plant point of view, there is a process that we will follow to
produce a cost estimate for decommissioning. We have to file with the NRC a report that is called the post-shutdown
decommissioning activity report and have to outline in that report, our estimates, a site specific cost estimate. We are
due to submit that in November of this year and 90 days after that, that is considered approval of that report, we'll be
able to give you significantly more details about the scope of that work. Primarily, systems have already been drained
down because the plant has been shut down for quite a while. So we're a good bit ahead on those activities. Basically,
we'll just allow most systems to – we stopped maintenance on those systems other than those that are associated with
the spent fuel pool and related support systems that will dictate the vast majority of the plan going forward.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. And is there a way like, what are the biggest cost buckets or cost areas in terms of
decommissioning a nuclear facility like CR3. I am just trying to think about just some of the variable – very big picture
broad brush that could change your forecast decommissioning costs higher or lower when you put out that report in
November?
<A - Dhiaa M. Jamil>: It is entirely based on dismantling all equipment of the plant. And then, dealing with the spent
fuel pool contents. Currently CR3 does not have a dry storage. So that's a pretty significant consideration of how do we
move forward with the fuel that's in the pool. Other than that, it's really just dismantling the equipment and the manner
we go about doing that. Those are two main variables.

<A - Lynn J. Good>: Hi, Steve.
<A - James E. Rogers>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: I guess in the context of past success, I think you guys have beaten consensus quarters for
three or four years in a row every quarter and didn't do it this time. Is that more – did you hit your internal numbers and
just consensus was too high or did you not hit your internal numbers?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: We're on plan on internal numbers Steve, so we did hit plan.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: And what we were trying to demonstrate with slide 14 is sort of the quarterly variability that you
can expect as you look at comparables between 2012 and 2013. So we have a high degree of confidence that we're
going to finish the year consistent with our expectations, so that's where we are.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay. And then a follow-up on the wholesale sales in the slide, so the $0.07 to $0.08 is
both in 2014 and then incrementally in 2015?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: It is.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay. And the – is that matching up with rate-based growth in wholesale as well, so when
you have wholesale on the slide, is it matching there or is it more just tied to contracted price increases?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: It's load. You can think of it as additional load, Steve, where we're bringing on additional
megawatts upload in those years.
<Q - Steve I. Fleishman>: Okay. And is there any offset in retail, i.e., less retail sales or less wholesale for retail
benefit?

<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: Hi. 2013 earnings guidance assumptions. I'm looking at commercial power and the
assumption of $95 million of earnings in 2013 relative to the $6 million earned in the first quarter. I think that reflects
the expectation of an award of capacity revenues by the PUCO if I'm not incorrect. What should we expect regarding
the underlying earnings power of that fleet in the absence of an award of capacity revenues this year? Will it resemble
what we saw in the first quarter or do you expect a material improvement in the subsequent three quarters?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: So Hugh, the other major driver in that segment is capacity prices. So $16 through May of this
year, it will go up to $28 in the back half and then you have energy for the coal and gas fleet and we've seen trends
comparable to others in the Midwest, where we're seeing a little bit more coal generation, a little bit more, little less gas
generation as prices have risen. So those are the other drivers to think about.
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: Okay. And on slide 23, you provide an analysis of your weather normalized
generation or power sales over the last 12 months. On the right-hand column, you can see that it's been broadly flat. Is
this a trend you expect to continue or are there reasons to believe that the last 12 months were somehow different from
what we'll see in the year or two years ahead?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Yeah. And so, Hugh, if you look back at rolling 12 months to the end of 2012, we were at 0.6%.
If we were to do leap year adjustment on this rolling 12 months, it would be 0.3% overall growth and we're projecting
0.5%. So we feel like we're reasonably consistent or in the range with our expectations. We think they are cautious.
And as we have done every quarter, we'll just continue to update you on developments that we see. We're seeing
strength in customer growth, we're seeing some strength in automotive and our industrial segment. And then, some
weaknesses in primary metals that I referenced a moment ago.

We'll take our next question Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Hi, Julien.
<A - James E. Rogers>: Good morning.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Hey. So following a little bit about up on the North Carolina situation, I wanted to get
it a little bit more clarity here, because there are just so many different pending filings, including the Supreme Court
remand regarding ROE. I'd be curious, is there any potential for all of these ROEs to kind of be resolved at once, shall
we say?
Obviously, there is a certain timeline here with which the NCUC needs to address the remand, but they have other rate
cases in front of them. Is there any ability to kind of deal with it at once, or would your expectation be we'll get an
updated ROE for a certain period of time and then we'll have a new ROE effective, whenever the subsequent case
comes into effect? Just trying to get a sense of the ability to interject, call it new testimony into the ROE, and secondly,
the timeline.
<A - James E. Rogers>: My judgment is is the adequate testimony underpinning the 10.5% ROE in the Duke Energy
case that was remanded back. I think, what the Commission will do, particularly in light of the motion by the Attorney
General, they will probably, they're probably already going to work to write an order that really underpins the 10.5%.
So I think, they'll do it seriatim and that will be first. I think the second segment, they will focus on is the settlement of
PEC with the 10.2%, and that order will probably come on the heels of that. And then subsequently, with the new Duke

Energy case that will probably we'll be working on resolving that through settlement over the coming weeks and
months and that will be third in line. That would be my view of how that unfolds.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. And each continue to have a discretely separate process for setting that ROE?
<A - James E. Rogers>: I believe that, I'm confident that's the way it'll work because that makes sense and it's
consistent with their traditional practice and procedure of the Commission.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. Going back to the international business for a second here, obviously there
have been some acquisitions, Chile, there's been some commentary around Peru. What is the thought process as we sit
here today around expanding the business given the cash balance? Is this a year for more expansive deployment of that
balance?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Julien, we continue to look for opportunities to grow the business that are consistent with our
return expectations, the countries we like. Generation is kind of the part of the system that we're interested in. And I
would say our aspirations this year are no different than they are any year. If we find an asset that fits with us and meets
return expectations, we would pursue it. And we have been systematically over the last five years adding, in a moderate
way, assets that are complementary to our portfolio.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Any particular markets as it stands today that you're focused on?

We'll take our next question from Andy Bischof with Morningstar.
<Q - Andrew Bischof>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Good morning.
<A - James E. Rogers>: Good morning.
<Q - Andrew Bischof>: I was wondering if you could just comment on the level of switching from gas back to coal in
your generation portfolio. Couple of your peers have posted pre-dramatic shifts in their generation mix compared to
2012?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Andy, what I would say is, in our Midwestern fleet we've seen an increase in coal generation and
a decrease in gas generation, really consistent with the fact that those assets, coal assets, are positioned very favorably
for transport. In the Carolinas, we haven't seen what I would call switching but we have seen higher capacity factors of
our coal plants and in our Duke Carolinas territory. The transportation, as you know, in the Carolinas is a bit more
expensive and the price at which gas and coal, gas is advantaged to coal is a bit higher.
<Q - Andrew Bischof>: And what is that price in the Carolinas?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: I'd say probably $4.50-ish.
<A - James E. Rogers>: I think that's the price when that – once gas gets to $4.50, then we turn on the Cliffside plant,
because it's our most efficient coal plant.
<Q - Andrew Bischof>: Perfect. Thanks for the clarity.

And we'll take our last question from Ali Agha with SunTrust.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Good morning.
<A - James E. Rogers>: Good morning.
<Q - Ali Agha>: I wanted to get a little more insight. On one of your slides, you talk about an EPS growth of 4% to
6%; that's the aspiration from 2013 through 2015. And you look at your Commercial Power, you're at a cyclically low
point here because of the capacity payments. International, you've talked about the fact that the hydro situation is
hurting you right now. You have that wholesale growth coming up next couple of years, cost reductions ongoing. I'm
just curious – I would have thought the growth rate would be somewhat higher, given the cyclically low 2013 that we're
looking at. Can you give me a little more insight into how we keep it in that 4% to 6% range?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Ali, we're smiling at the question because I think our questions have primarily been how could
you possibly get to the high end of the range and you are arguing why aren't we higher, which we're delighted to hear.
The 4% to 6%, we think is a reasonable expectation. You've talked about Commercial certainly contributing to that and
then we look at Franchised Electric and Gas with the key drivers being rate base, our merger synergies, the continued
focus on driving cost out of the business. So we have a high degree of confidence of hitting the 4% to 6% range. And as
we see these fundamental pieces coming into place in 2013 with rate cases and other things, I think we'll be able to give
you a better sense of what 2014 and 2015 could look like as the year progresses.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. I understand, but the largest chunk obviously is the regulated business and that dominates the
percentage growth....
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Absolutely.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Second question on Ohio, just to be clear, Jim, on the strategic plan there. You had gone down the
path of looking to potentially exit the merchant generation business. Then the capacity case obviously came up and you
want to play that out. Once that decision comes out, whether you get it or not regardless, but once that decision is out,
strategically does that merchant portfolio still fit with Duke or would it still make sense to focus more on the regulated
and get out of the volatile business?
<A - James E. Rogers>: That's a good question. I think we're going to wait and see what the decision is from the Ohio
Commission. And then we're going to make a decision with respect to those assets. I think it would be premature for
me to comment on what we would do, but we believe we're entitled to this capacity payment. And if we don't get it, I
think we'll have to make a tough decision about those assets going forward. But more to come on that, our focus is on
creating value and reducing the risk of our portfolio, and so we'll make a decision consistent with that.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. So I should not assume, just to be clear on your thinking, if you do get the capacity payment
that does not necessarily mean that you're going to still own those, you could still go down the divestiture path?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: You know, Ali, I think we'll have to wait and see the conditions of the order from the
commission. So at this point, we are under order to move the assets out of the utility to an affiliate by the end of 2014.
And I think we'll just await any clarity the commission would provide on that as part of the cost based capacity order.
<A - James E. Rogers>: I think the other dynamic that plays into this is also the movement in gas prices. I mean this
time last year, gas was about a $1.87 in MMBTU, it averaged $3.48 in MMBTU last year and now we're in the $4.40
range. And some people are predicting it'll be to $5 to $5.5 before year end in gas prices. So that will have a significant
impact on the value of the coal plants in the Midwest as well as the gas plants as we look forward.
