Gerald L. Hassell
Thanks, Andy, and welcome, everyone, and thanks for joining us. As you saw from the release, for the fourth quarter,
we reported earnings of $0.44 per share. Now, this includes an after-tax loss of $115 million or $0.10 per share related
to the write-down of an equity investment. After netting out this loss, we had adjusted earnings of $0.54 per share.
We had strong year-over-year growth in core Investment Management and Investment Services fees. The growth
reflects improved market conditions and importantly, our success in providing solutions sets across our businesses that
our clients are seeking. As we have said in the past, we are making strategic investments in several areas to expand our
capabilities and we are seeing early evidence of returns on those investments.
For the quarter, we had total revenues of $3.8 billion, which is up 4% over the fourth quarter of 2012. The Investment
Management business performance remains terrific. Our success in attracting new assets helped drive a 14% increase in
assets under management year-over-year to a record $1.58 trillion.
In 2013, net long-term flows were $95 billion as we continue to have particular strength in the liability-driven
investments category. And this organic growth along with higher equity values and performance fees helped mitigate
the pressure from higher money market fee waivers year-over-year.
Similar to Investment Management, we had strong year-over-year growth in Investment Services. We saw growth in
asset servicing, issuer services and clearing fees driven by higher volumes, improved equity values and net new
business. Clearing services in particular continues to show strong growth as our technology platform serving
investment advisors is more broadly adopted.
And some of our investments also contributed to this growth. Our Global Collateral Services business continue to
gather collateral management assets. We enjoyed better foreign exchange results year-over-year as our investments in
the electronic channel have made us more competitive and we are attracting greater volumes.
Now in terms of our expenses, seasonality played a large part of the sequential growth. Our expenses have been
impacted by our strategic investments for future growth as well as increasing regulatory and compliance requirements.
Notably, our Operational Excellence Initiative savings helped mitigate some of this expense pressure and you will see
that we achieved our Operational Excellence target of over $650 million a full one year ahead of schedule.
And importantly, we're not done. We're now transitioning to a broader, continuous improvement process designed to
improve efficiencies. This process is not a program or an initiative or a one-time project; it will be an ongoing area of
emphasis that is becoming part of the fabric of our culture. And we already have line of sight into several hundreds of
millions of dollars of financial benefit over the next few years.
Turning to the capital front, our business model generates a significant level of capital and allows us to perform well in
stress scenarios, giving us increased financial flexibility. In 2013, we returned approximately $1.7 billion to
shareholders in the form of dividends or share repurchases.
Now in terms of share repurchases, during the first quarter, we are in a position to potentially increase the total share
buyback relative to the fourth quarter, and Todd will cover that in more detail in a minute; but for the quarter,
continued growth in core Investment Services and Investment Management fees, successful completion of our
Operational Excellence Initiatives, and continued strong capital position.
Now looking ahead to 2014, we expect to see more of the benefits of some of the investments we've been making. In
global markets, we're continuing to roll out new electronic foreign exchange and capital markets trading capabilities
that position us to capture additional activity. The growth of our Global Collateral Services business should benefit as
the markets deal with new collateral regulations.
In Investment Management, we're in the midst of greatly expanding our Wealth Management sales force. Additionally,
we are making significant progress reaching individual investors by expanding our retail distribution capabilities and
product offerings. We've also made progress in expanding our Investment Management and Investment Services
capabilities in the Asia-Pacific region where there's separately managed accounts platform scheduled to go live shortly.

We successfully piloted an intermediate – intermediary private banking program between Wealth Management and
Pershing, and we look to build on that momentum. And we continue to be positioned to benefit even more as fund
managers look to leverage our technology and advisers and brokers move away from self-clearing. We like how we're
positioned and we're upbeat about our prospects for 2014.
With that, let me turn it over to Todd.
Thomas P. Gibbons
Thanks, Gerald, and good morning, everyone. As in the past, my comments will follow the quarterly review and let's
begin on Page 2.
As Gerald noted, EPS was $0.44. That includes the after-tax loss of $115 million or $0.10 per share. That was related to
the equity investment. We have minority interest in ConvergEx. So we see it as a $0.54 quarter but that does includes a
benefit of approximately $0.01 on tax.
Looking at the numbers on a year-over-year basis, total revenue was $3.8 billion. That's on a non-GAAP and that's up
4%. In our Investment Services business, we had growth in asset servicing, issuer and clearing services. Investment
management and performance fees continued their strong trend. FX revenue was up and NIR also grew. Expenses were
up 2% on a GAAP basis. Adjusted, they were up about 4%, largely reflecting higher staff, legal, consulting and
business development expenses.
Turning to Page 4 where we call up some business metrics that will help you understand our underlying performance.
You can see the AUM of $1.58 trillion was up 14% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. Now, this was driven by net
new business wins and higher equity market values. During the quarter, we had net long-term inflows of $2 billion and
short-term inflows of $6 billion.
Assets under custody and administration at quarter-end were $27.6 trillion, that's up $1.3 trillion or 5% year-over-year.
It primarily reflects the impact of higher market values and net new business. Linked quarter AUC/AUA was up about
1% and that's due to improved market values.
Most of our key metrics showed solid growth on a year-over-year basis. Average loans and deposits in Wealth
Management and Investment Services were up very strongly. Most clearing metrics were up quite nicely as well.
DARTS volume and average long-term mutual fund assets continued that recent strong growth trend. DR programs
were down in the quarter and that's really reflecting market events, including M&A and corporate restructurings. So
when you do see an M&A transaction, it can result in the termination of a given program. And we have that discipline,
I might say, around the pricing in that business.
Average tri-party repo balances were down year-over-year but up sequentially as we continue to see opportunities for
growth for Global Collateral Services. Asset servicing fees were up – this is on Page 6 – were up 4% year-over-year
and 2% sequentially. Both those increases largely reflect higher market values, organic growth and higher collateral
management and segregation fees in Global Collateral Services. The year-over-year increase was partially offset by
lower securities lending revenue and that was primarily driven too by lower spreads.
We had an estimated $123 billion in new AUC/A wins in asset servicing, and for the year in total, we had new AUC/A
wins totaling $639 billion. Clearing fees were up 10% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. The year-over-year increase
was driven by higher mutual fund fees, asset-based fees and volumes, and that was partially offset by higher money
market fee waivers. The sequential increase was primarily driven by higher clearing revenue and mutual fund fees.
Issuer service fees were up 10% year-over-year and they were down 26% sequentially. The year-over-year increase
primarily reflects DR revenue that was really driven by corporate actions, and that was partially offset by the runoff
that we've seen in securitizations in Corporate Trust. The sequential decrease, as we've mentioned before, has primarily
resulted from seasonally lower DR revenue in the fourth quarter versus the third.

Investment management and performance fees were up 6% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. And if you adjust
them for the sale of our Newton private client business last quarter, they were up 7% and 11%. The year-over-year
increase was primarily driven by higher equity market values, net new business wins and higher performance fees, and
that was partially offset by higher money market fee waivers and the average impact that we saw in the strength of the
dollar. The sequential increase primarily reflects seasonally higher performance fees and higher equity market values.
Now in terms of money market fees, the aggregate impact to our EPS this quarter was approximately $0.06 to $0.07.
That's pretty much in the range that we saw in the third quarter. From a revenue perspective on a year-over-year basis,
that drag was $47 million and it's split fairly evenly between our investment Management and our Investment Services
businesses.
Moving on to FX and other trading, revenue was up 5% year-over-year. It was down 9% sequentially. The underlying
components to FX revenue was $126 million. That's up 19% from last year. That's down 18% sequentially. The
year-over-year increase primarily reflects higher volumes and we did see a little bit higher volatility. The sequential
decrease was driven by a significant decline in volatility sequentially but that was partially offset by volume increases.
So as Gerald noted earlier, the enhancements we've made to our electronic trading platforms have contributed to the
results and we have definitely seen a significant increase in volume.
Other trading revenue was down $13 million from the year ago quarter and up $14 million from the third quarter. The
year-over-year decrease primarily reflects lower derivatives trading revenue. The sequential increase was driven by
higher fixed income trading and that was partially offset by lower equity derivatives trading.
Investment and other income was a loss of $60 million compared with income of $116 million in the year ago quarter
and income of $135 million prior quarter. Both decreases primarily reflect a write-down of the goodwill and our equity
investment in ConvergEx.
Turning to Page 8 of the earnings review, you will see net interest revenue on a fully tax equivalent basis was up $41
million versus the year ago quarter. It was down $6 million sequentially. The year-over-year increase in net interest
revenue was primarily driven by higher average interest earning assets. The sequential decrease primarily reflects the
change in the mix, as we saw a full quarter impact of the move to a defensive rate position that we took pretty much in
the third quarter and that was partially offset by an increase in revenue generated by the higher deposits.
The net interest margin for the quarter was 1.09%, it was flat with where we were last year at this time and down a bit
from 1.16% in the third quarter.
Turning to Page 9, total non-interest expenses and this excludes the amortization of intangibles, M&I as well as
litigation restructuring charges, were up 4% year-over-year and about the same sequentially. The year-over-year
increase primarily resulted from increased staff expense and that was driven by higher incentives due to the higher
pre-tax income that we had as well as increased employee benefit costs and that really came down to higher pension
expense for the year 2013.
Higher legal expense was related to litigation defense. We did see some increased consulting expense, as has Gerald
mentioned, largely driven by regulatory and compliance requirements, but also to support some of our key business
initiatives. And we did have higher business development expense and that has a lot to do with our corporate branding
campaign and the marketing initiatives that we've had as we continued to invest in building our brand. The sequential
increase primarily resulted from higher legal consulting and business development expenses, reflecting the factors that I
noted above, as well as seasonality and the timing of client conferences and corporate sponsorships.
Page 10 details our success in achieving our Operational Excellence Initiative goal of more than $650 million expenses.
We've done that a year ahead of schedule. In fact, we've now achieved savings at a rate of $760 million.
One noteworthy accomplishment is our recent move of our New York treasury and trading operations from a leased
building in downtown Manhattan to one of our owned properties. It's a state-of-the-art facility and it's another example
of how we're taking action to reduce the cost of our real estate footprint around the globe. Now that we have met our
Operational Excellence goals, this will be the last quarter that we report them to you.

Now as Gerald mentioned, we are now shifting to a broader transformation process, one that we've internally branded
Transforming for Success. And that moves us from a project or a program orientation to one of a culture of continuous
improvement. This work should provide significant beneficial impact as we've identified a number of things that we'll
be doing over the next few years, but it's not simply about cost. Of course, that's very important to me and an important
component. It's also about raising the bar on service quality, driving productivity gains and importantly reducing risk.
Turning to our capital story, as you can see on Page 11, our key ratios strengthened substantially over the quarter. As
December 31, our estimated Basel III Tier 1 common ratio under the standardized approach was 10.6% and that
compared to 10.1% at the end of September. Now, this ratio is calculated on a fully phased-in basis. The 50 basis points
sequential increase primarily reflects lower risk weighted assets that are related to both securitizations as well as to
margin loans.
Our estimated supplementary leverage ratio actually declined by about 10 basis points during the quarter. That was
largely due to a spike that we saw in year-end balance sheet. Our year-end balance sheet was actually $18 billion larger
than the average for the quarter.
On Page 12, you can see that at quarter-ended, we had a net unrealized gain on the investments securities portfolio of
$309 million, that was down from $723 million at the end of the prior quarter and that was driven by the rise in interest
rates that we saw in the fourth quarter.
Looking at our loan book on Page 13, you can see that the provision for credit losses with $6 million. This was driven
by an increase in the allowance related to a municipal related entity and that compares on a year-over-year basis to a
credit of $61 million and provision of $2 million in the prior quarter. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 21.8%
and that was positively impacted both by the tax benefit associated with the loss to an equity investment, in fact that
was the major driver, as well as some benefit from lower state taxes.
Now a few points to factor into your thinking about the current quarter. Incentive expenses impacted by divesting of
long-term stock awards as we've mentioned in the past for retirement eligible employees, so typically we do see a
seasonal increase in the first quarter. We would expect a decrease in our pension expense given the very strong
performance that we've seen on the assets in 2013 as well as an increase in the discount rate. We would expect net
interest income to be down in the quarter due to a lower day count, so there's two fewer days, as well as a smaller
balance sheet as we have seen a lot of the spike in deposits run-off.
The quarterly provision should be in the range of 0 to $15 million as we've seen in previous number of quarters. We
expect the tax rate to be around 26%. Also, in the fourth quarter, our gross share repurchases, including open market
employee benefit plan related repurchases, totaled about $321 million. In the first quarter, our gross share repurchases
could increase by as much as $60 million but that is, of course, subject to market conditions and other factors.
During the quarter and all of 2014, we'll be focused, as I think you've heard from both Gerald and I, on three main
activities. One is investing in our organic growth opportunities. Number two is transforming our businesses to this
continuous improvement that drives productivity gains, saves us some money, and generates premium service quality.
And number three is we will continue to deploy our capital and manage our risks wisely.
With that, let me turn it back to Gerald.
Gerald L. Hassell
Thanks, Todd. And I think we can open it up for questions. Wendy?

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Good morning.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Good morning, Betsy.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: One question just on the outlook for the SLR? There was over the past weekend some
discussion coming out of Basel that a lot of investors kind of focused on that did not have a carve-out for deposits at the
Fed or central banks. And just wanted to get your updated sense on how you're thinking about that. I realize that the
[ph] U.S. really hasn't opined (20:54) yet but there's a little bit of a concern that since Basel did this, it will follow?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Sure, Betsy. It's Todd. I think the good news on the final Basel rule is that they are going
to treat unfunded commitments a little more reasonably so the impact of that is probably a reduction of about 50% on
the balance sheet. There still is an open issue not so much with Basel and the treatment of central bank cash but
ultimately how the U.S. is going to treat that, and I think it's too early to call. So there's plenty of room within the U.S.
interpretation to do something and we hear things both positively and negatively along that, but I'd just say at this point,
we really don't know.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. Can you give us a sense on the unfunded commitments, what the benefit is to you
from that?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, we have anywhere from around $45 billion, $40 billion to $45 billion in unfunded
commitments and it moves it from about 100% to about 50%. It's our rough estimate. We really haven't – this news just
came out so we really haven't gotten completely underneath that yet.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Sure. Okay. That's great. And then separately on the investments you've been making in
retail, Gerald, you highlighted I think at the beginning of the call some of the opportunity set there and expectation.
Can you just give us a sense as to the kind of the timeframe for which you're thinking the retail investments spend will
drive some improve – some increases in top line? And over what timeframe magnitude?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah, I'll start and then perhaps turn it over to Curtis. As you know, we are relatively
underexposed to the retail investor, and this has been something of great focus by the firm. We're starting with
improving some of our distribution capabilities, investing in wholesalers to get our products on various retail platforms
around the world, not just in the U.S. We are investing in some of the product capabilities, we're investing in some of
the areas around the Dreyfus brand capabilities to enhance some of those product offerings. And so, this is not a
short-term fix because this takes a fair amount of investment in both people and strategies to broaden our exposure to
the retail investor. So this is a long-term investment and this is something we plan to continue to push. Curtis.
<A - Curtis Y. Arledge>: I think that's well said. We've obviously got a great start. The Dreyfus platform here in the
U.S. has obviously got all the infrastructure, and very importantly, the relationships with the advisor community.
Through Pershing, we're able to connect with some of their clients as well. So I think that we've a lot of foundation to
build upon. To your specific question, we've started adding staff, adding product development capabilities, investing in
our brand and I actually think we're going to see some – beginning to see the beginning edges of our improvement
toward the end of this year. There are some products specifically that we have very strong investment performance in
that I think the market has great demand for. So we're very optimistic about our future here.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: So what percentage into the investment spend would you say you are?
<A - Curtis Y. Arledge>: I'd say we're about 20% of the way into the investment spend, and at the end of 2014, I
expect to be closer to 50%.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. Got it. And then the revenue piece is starting at the end of 2014?
<A - Curtis Y. Arledge>: Yeah, I mean we're – obviously we're already in the business, so we have revenues in the
retail space. But seeing real momentum, I think that – I hope we'll be able to see it in the third and fourth quarter this

<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Got it. Okay. Thanks.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Hi, guys. Good morning. Hey, Gerald, you guys have made some comments in a recent
conference just about operating leverage going forward and what kind of environment you'd need to deliver positive
operating leverage and it seemed like even with these hundreds of millions of expenses and sort of per the last answers
about where you are on the build, that the operating environment needs to be still get meaningfully better to really
generate bigger operating leverage. So can you kind of give us your thoughts as far as the next year or two on your [ph]
beliefs, (25:11) what revenues you think could look like on the top line? And then if you can, in fact, deliver operating
leverage as you look ahead?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Well, first, Ken, I don't want to get into forward guidance business, but I think in this
environment, we are challenged but we're challenging the team to produce positive operating leverage. I think we've
said in the 4% to 5% zone or north of that and we should be able to produce it. We are obviously bearing the cost of
regulatory compliance and investments in our businesses, so we're partially re-investing some of those gains from
Operational Excellence right back into the business and covering those other costs. But I sure would like to produce
positive operating leverage. It's our goal. I know it's top of the mind on our investors and by you all, and that is part of
our goal.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, Ken, I'd add to that. I think that what we had indicated a couple of years ago at our
investors' conference is we felt our revenue growth rate should be in the 3% to 5% range. It's been approximately there
at about 4% this year. At the lower end of that, it's pretty difficult to generate a lot of positive operating leverage; as we
get to the higher end of it, we do start to – we do start to generate it. This year we made – this year being 2013, we
made a conscious decision and I think Curtis just pointed out a couple of the types of investments that we're making.
We made a conscious decision to put a percent or two, if you will, of our expenses growth into re-investing in
opportunities for the future. So I think that otherwise you would've seen a meaningful operating – the core business did
generate a meaningful operative leverage.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Yeah, and related to that, just on this, you pointed out that this quarter there seemed to be a good
amount of partially seasonal expense pickup, but can you help us try to identify how much of that increase might have
been one time or above trend relative to the expense result this quarter?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Sure. I mean some of it is episodic. We have seen a sharp rise in our litigation defenses.
That's likely to run for some time but certainly not permanently. We have seen a pickup around certain compliance and
regulatory issues and some of that is episodic but the run rate is certainly higher. I would say the growth rate of that has
probably curtailed a bit. And then, we saw marketing costs which tend to be somewhat seasonal as we picked up our
advertising campaign and we have a number of conferences and corporate events that typically take place in the fourth
quarter. So that is seasonal. I think we did make a push with our brand campaign in 2013 that would abate a little bit.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Okay, great.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Ken, the other point I would like to make is one of the reasons why we do this continuous
improvement process, it's something that's going to be part of the core fabric of the company. And we do see, as I said
in my opening comments, a line of sight for continuing to get expenses and efficiencies and higher level of productivity
out of our core operations. There's no question in my mind that there's hundreds of millions of dollars there and we
have an ability and certainly in attitude to get at it.
<Q - Ken M. Usdin>: Understood. Thanks, guys.

Thank you. The next question is from Glenn Schorr with ISI.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hello.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Hi, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hello. A quick one on RWA inflation or lack thereof, which is good thing. So I see RWAs,
whether it be standardized or advanced, came down some in the quarter. So my quick question is a couple of banks
have been reporting inflation on higher operational risk. I think that's been accounted for in your models a while ago. I
just want to know if we should be looking for any other RWA inflation as all these final rules have come out?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Sure, Glenn. It's getting complicated because there's a lot going on right now. But if you
look at – we give a fairly detailed disclosure around the changes to our risk weighted assets both in the standardized
and in the advanced approach. And when we reflect that, that's on a fully phased in basis. Actually now there are
phase-ins that start to take place this year. So our actual reported numbers this year as we move into Basel III are going
to be quite higher than the fully phased-in numbers. All of that being said, if you look through the numbers, there's a
couple of drivers there. OCI had a modest impact to us because we did see a little bit of downturn in the securities
portfolio. We got a little bit of a pickup in the pension portfolios, it's gone up in value. And then, the meaningful driver
is the RWA calculation in the standardized approach.
Now just to add complexity, the standardized approach does not take into consideration operational risk. It just uses
Basel I and add severity to it, if you will. So the large driver there is around our securities lending mix, as well as
margin lending and the quality of the collateral that you have [ph] as margins loans (30:55). So we did see some
improvement there. And we saw less of that reflected in the advanced approach. So, it's not to say that there couldn't be
changes, but from our best estimates right now, we're not really – we don't really require a whole lot of RWA's to build
our business. And I think the kind of the other thing to point out is we do have these non-agency securities in the
securitizations and they do tend to draw a little bit higher capital charges and they are slowly paying themselves down,
so that should continue to be a positive for us.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. I get that. And then LDI flows for the year were awesome. I don't know if I saw what
they were for the quarter and I'm just curious if higher long end rates are in a weird way bad in the short-term but really
good in the long term for that business. I'm just curious if it had an impact in the quarter and what your outlook for the
LDI flows are?
<A - Curtis Y. Arledge>: Yeah. Hey, Glenn, it's Curtis. I definitely think that looking at the funded status ratio of
pension plans is an important indicator here of kind of what's going on. If you look at where we are today, sort of the
average plan is funded at about a 95%, 96% ratio which it dipped actually below 75% back in 2011. We're at the
highest levels we been at since before the financial crisis in 2008. And so pension plans have been on a pretty wild ride
around their funded status ratio. In the quarter, we definitely saw more interest in talking about whether they should
move toward locking in some of this recent improvement. There was definitely some de-risking. We even saw it in the
index businesses where there were actually outflows in equity index products and movement toward fixed income and
toward more balanced risk. So I definitely think that the LDI business is still a very promising business as pension
plans are in many ways better positioned to be able to move to that strategy.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. Thank you very much.

<Q - Alex Blostein>: Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So I wanted to touch base on the collateral
management opportunity and kind of what the learning is this year. So migration to clearing happened this year fairly
seamlessly, which I guess is a good thing. But looking out, I guess when you think about the opportunity for yourself
and it sounded like there's already a little bit of revenues coming through the model today, so I was hoping maybe you
could help us quantify that and maybe give an update on how big do you guys think collateral management could be for
you, and I guess what are catalysts we need to look forward to, to see more of a material impact?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah, sure, Alex. I think as we said in the past, we're still I think frankly in the early stages
of the impact on the marketplace. The dealer side has been impacted early on. Now the long investors or risk accounts,
other market participants, the buy side is now having to deal with this particular issue. We've cited insurance
companies as a good example in the past where historically they have not had to post collateral and now they have to
start doing so. So I think we're still in the early innings of the impact on the marketplace broadly.
So most of the revenues that we have seen as we've been seeing some success here in collateral services has been
around the segregation or the optimization of the collateral as opposed to moving into the next phase of transforming it
and making it more available and more easily movable around the world. And so I still think we have many innings to
go in terms of the opportunity here. And so as I said in my opening comments, we're seeing increased revenues. It's
showing up in our asset servicing fee line. That's where it shows up and we're quite positive about the prospects here.
<Q - Alex Blostein>: Gotcha. And then, Todd, just a question on expenses, follow-up to Ken's question I guess as well,
but as you pointed out a couple of years ago, you said I think around 3% expense growth rate is reasonable. There's
new investments you guys are making relative to what you outlined a few years ago, but also it sounds like there's new
savings that you will try to achieve. So kind of blending it altogether is a 3% normal expense growth rate for the next
couple years still a reasonable way to think about it?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah. But Alex, it's going to obviously be tied to the revenues and it's going to be tied to
the types of revenues that we see. So the mix can have a meaningful impact. Certain of our revenues are very – have
fixed costs, so massive amounts of operating leverage to them, whereas others come with meaningful cost. So the
revenue mix has a big impact. I mean the good news is we've had a headwind of increasing pension expenses
year-after-year and that should ease a bit this year. But I think generally it's going to come with – depending on the mix
of revenues and the amount of investments as opportunities that we see for organic growth.
<Q - Alex Blostein>: Gotcha. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Ashley Serrao with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Ashley N. Serrao>: Good morning. So on expenses, I hear you loud and clear on your $100 million program. But
maybe you can give us some examples of what you're working on today and how we should be thinking about the
incremental investment spend there versus the savings?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Sure. I'll take a stab at it and then, Todd, maybe you want to weigh in. In many ways it's
fairly basic and we've said in the past we said we have multiple operating platforms. We're going through the
conversions of that now and being able to shut down different things. It makes it a much more efficient operating
environment when you have fewer platforms and fewer engines to work across, so improvement going from a more
manual process or to a more automated process, really applying some metrics and engineering around our capabilities.
We have multiple centers around the world that do things like reconciliations and tax claims and corporate actions and
stuff like that. There's ways to consolidate those, just a whole variety of different things. Brian Shea is really leading
the charge with Suresh Kumar, our Chief Technology Information Officer. Brian, maybe you want to weigh in here?
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: Yeah. Thanks, Gerald. I think what we're doing in terms of this Transforming for Success
program is expanding the focus beyond just pure expense reductions, although that's an important part of it for sure. A

couple of things that are new and different. One is we're working across the Investment Services businesses which have
been run more like individual businesses in the past and effectively, but we're trying to drive best practices across those
businesses and create more leverage.
So an example would be cross line of business solutions for clients which actually generate new revenue streams. One
example which – and that's happening within Investment Services and across Investment Services and Investment
Management.
A good, recent example would be that we just piloted an intermediary private banking service for the Pershing
registered investment advisor customers and in a pilot program of only less than six months, we've had over $300
million in loan demand generated from the independent RIAs who were actually leveraging BNY Mellon's Wealth
Management capabilities in a different way.
Similarly, by working across the businesses we're looking at – we're evaluating the portfolio of services and solutions
we deliver, trying to figure out if there are subscale solutions or services that we don't actually need to provide that can
reduce expenses. And we're instituting essentially consistent expense management disciplines in process and reporting
and doing other things like that, that actually can drive a higher return on what we already do. And it's not rocket
science, but it's just working differently across the businesses. So that's one of the big things. And we believe that
there's tremendous opportunity in these cross business solutions so that we can generate revenues. So that's why this is
different. It's going to include revenue generation as well as expense reduction.
<Q - Ashley N. Serrao>: Great. Thanks for all the color there. And maybe on capital, you've got a welcome
downgrade in the G-SIFI rankings. I believe the substitutability criteria helped you there. But how does this impact how
you think about running a capital cushion on top of your leverage requirements? And how does this impact how you
think about CCAR in general?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Go ahead, Todd.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: In terms of running the cushion, we're already as you can see, actually running a pretty
substantial cushion so that we obviously think that puts us in a better position. But what we do is we sensitize what
those capital issues can be. We do our own internal stress test of many different types to estimate what we ultimately
think the cushion ought to be.
We don't really know what our additional G-SIFI requirement is going to be. That was the – under the Basel
framework, the global requirement. But we have not been designated within the U.S. what that might be. But we
certainly feel quite comfortable about the level that we're operating today. We think it's prudent and we think it's got
plenty of cushion for potential downside.
I think the good news in our business model is we have, as you know, very low risk-weighted assets so there's not – it
doesn't tend to be a lot of volatility around those assets. They're very high quality. Most of them are secured and
short-term. And then our securities portfolio is also extremely high quality, mostly agencies and treasuries. So it
survives any stress tests typically quite well.
I think the other thing in our business model is we do have a lot of annuity-like businesses and we've got a less risky
mix of assets. Now that doesn't always help us when the equity market shoots up like it did in the fourth quarter, but
when it goes the other direction we don't feel the pain quite as much as most. And that makes us a little more resilient
in terms of stress testing as well. So hopefully that helps you to get a little better understanding of our perspective.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah. I think in general that we have a low risk-weighted asset model, we have good capital
cushions, we're getting a better line of sight on some of these new rules and regulations as they're unfolding. And as we
said earlier, we think we have some pretty good financial flexibility as we go into 2014 and we'll see the results of a
CCAR exam the end of March and stay tuned.

Thank you. The next question is from Josh Levin with Citigroup.
<Q - Josh D. Levin>: Good morning.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Hi, Josh.
<Q - Josh D. Levin>: You talked about meeting operational excellence goals a year ahead of schedule. For those of us
on the outside who don't work for the company and we only have access to publicly available information. Where can
we look to sort of see the fruits of operational excellence? Where's it flowing through?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah. Josh, I think what we had indicated in the – three years ago, almost three years ago
now – was if we initiate this program, those numbers amount to about a 2% reduction in our annual run rate. And we'd
indicated there was probably about a 2% inflation in our annual run rate. So by making these improvements, we won't
feel the impact of the inflation. That's merit increases, the increasing cost of pensions and the increased software
amortization was largely where it reflected in inflation component. So that would let our businesses and our business
mix reflect upon itself.
So we indicated that a 5% type of revenue growth rate, we thought we could see something like 100 basis points to 150
basis points positive operating leverage; 4%, a little bit less than that. So that's exactly where we are running right now.
Obviously, the revenue mix makes a little bit of a difference but what you saw this year on a GAAP basis was 4% over
2% and adjusting it for some of those one timers, you saw basically 4% over 4%. And the reason you didn't see more
operating leverage is because we made a decision to invest organically. If we were investing – if we were doing M&A
rather than organic growth, you would have seen it. We think the organic growth comes with a much higher IRR. It's a
much more interesting rather than paying somebody else for their labor, developing ourselves is much more interesting
in our long term run rate. And that's why you see what you see.
<Q - Josh D. Levin>: Okay. There's been a lot of talk that the M&A environment might pick up. If we do see a lot
more M&A activity, how does that impact your various businesses?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Well, usually when there's more M&A activity, it increases volumes and volatility in the
marketplace. And volumes and volatility help our business model. And anytime there's more action going on in the
markets, people are willing to take a little more risk, take a little more positioning. We see that flow through our
business model through transactions and it also improves some values. Areas like depository receipts, anytime there's
corporate actions, boy; it shows up there real fast.
<Q - Josh D. Levin>: Thank you very much.

Thank you. The next question is from Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: Good morning. Thanks, guys.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Hi.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: So coming back to the Asset Management business for a second, the margin there is in the
low 30% range and that's below, I think, what you see at some your peers. So I wondered if you might touch on what
you think the issue is there. Is there a good structural reason for it or do you see some opportunity to get it higher? I
think you talked earlier on the call about the retail opportunity. Is that part of a margin improvement story? And what
level of margin do you think the Asset Management business could support beyond the investments you're making in
retail?

<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: I think you're actually right on it, which is that some of the higher margin activities within
the investment management industry are in the areas that we've talked about investing in, which is retail, growing our
overall absolute return in alternatives effort, which we've seen actually some nice progress in. We actually do a whole
lot of work around our margins and benchmarking to the industry. And margins, obviously, vary across different asset
classes that investment managers are exposed to. So we're a pretty diversified asset manager that is more weighted
towards institutional at the moment. Equity managers might have higher margins but they're also substantially more
volatile. Our margin actually is pretty stable through time. So those are some of the factors that we look to.
Clearly, the last couple years have been very challenging in fee waivers. So the business has a large mix of assets that
are exposed to the money market business and that has been a major dampening. You're talking about a reasonably
higher margin business that has been under downward pressure now for a number of years. So that has definitely put a
damper on it. We're obviously waiting to see where the SEC goes with the rules around money markets, but hopeful
that someday that actually will bear fruit either in money market form or those assets will have to move somewhere and
potentially to – some of them will go to short duration fixed income products. So that's sort of the thought around
margin.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: And I also would add that that's why strategically in longer-term, we feel like we need to
make the investments to have greater exposure to the retail investor and retail products and also in the alternative space.
Those are two key areas of focus that are going to require a level of investment, but I think those are the areas for
growth and are also the areas for margin improvement.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: Okay. Helpful. Thank you. And then the issue of spinning off Asset Management, I'm
actually not sure the rationale for that's very good but it's something you've been asked more about lately and some
people question whether there are real synergies with the servicing business so I thought perhaps an opportunity to
comment on that?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Sure. We, obviously, like the Investment Management business. We think there are some
benefits and synergies across our Investment Services areas. We see clear evidence of it in terms of the clients we serve
when they trust us to manage their money, we have opportunities for servicing and vice versa. Having the intellectual
capital internally around our investment management boutiques to help us be a better service provider absolutely helps.
You heard Brian Shea talked about some of the initiatives that we are doing across Pershing and Investment
Management, utilizing that platform more robustly. We just see number of different opportunities connecting to our
wealth business, Investment Management. The whole strategy in Asia-Pacific is building a technology platform to put
our products on top of it and attract advisors and wealth managers globally to use that platform and put our products
front and center on it. We just see lots and lots of different opportunities to continue to grow both businesses together.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: Great. Thanks a lot.

Thank you. The next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Good morning.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Good morning.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: I have some real specific questions and then just a broader question. But my specific questions,
can you remind us what are your main financial targets, you mentioned 3% to 5% revenue growth but what are the
other main targets?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: What we had indicated, Mike, back on the investors day that we anticipated 3% to 5%
revenue growth and we expected anywhere from 0 to 200 basis points of operating leverage based upon where we
would be within that. Obviously, that would be largely driven by revenue mix and one of the issues Curtis just pointed
out in fee waivers is meaningful at $.06 to $.07 a quarter with very limited expenses associated with it. The other

indication is we thought we would over time generate 10% plus return on shareholders' equity. That leads to quite a bit
higher return on tangible common equity, so those were the basic underlying themes.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And the investment spending you're talking about, you said you are 20% done. What is the total
dollar amount of the investment spending?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: We haven't disclosed that, Mike. And what Curtis was speaking to specifically was
investment spending within Investment Management, where we've got a number of projects that he alluded to. So we
are about 20% of the way through that. We'll be, as he indicated, about halfway through by the end of the year at which
point we'll see some of the benefits of the earlier investments.
<A - Curtis Y. Arledge>: That was specifically in the retail space.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Right. And that was specific to the retail space.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: But last – sorry, last year you said – sorry.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Go ahead, Mike.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: No, I didn't' mean to interrupt.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Okay. And I said – and we also have mentioned on a number of occasion the type of
investments that we're making in our Investment Services businesses as well.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: So last year, that investment spending equaled 2% of expenses or maybe how much did equal
last year?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: I think we had indicated for 2013, it was roughly in line with a 2% increase in our expenses.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. And then as far as the continuous improvement project, you said that should save a few
hundred million, can you specify that a little bit more concretely?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: At this point, we're debating that internally whether we want to go public with that, Mike. So
I think it's too early to say. We are looking at the various expense savings that we're going to be able to generate. As
Brian pointed out, some of this is as we become much more process oriented, there's some also revenue benefits that
we think we will get out of this as well but we haven't determined whether we are going to go public with that or not
yet.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: The reason I asked a specific question, someone else asked about the Operational Excellence
and where do we see it, and so how do we on the outside know if you're achieving your targets with the continuous
improvement or the investment spending, or do you want us just to look at those general financial metrics that you're
shooting for?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah, that's what we're debating internally, Mike. We really haven't reached [ph] –
ultimately (52:25) and I think it was Josh at Citi that pointed this out, ultimately you've got to see it and we believe you
will see it. And I think we've been pretty consistent with the guidance that we gave a number of years ago. There's
obviously a lot of factors in markets that go on that can create noise there. But that's why we're debating is let's drive it
through and perhaps let it reflect itself.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then my general question, you mentioned that you are under exposed to the retail investor
and you want to get more involved in the retail investor. I'm just trying to reconcile my thought of Bank of New York
from several years back when Bank of New York was referred to as the banker to banks, more wholesale institutional
and now we're talking about Bank of New York getting involved with the retail investor. Going back you had branches,
and so I'm just trying to reconcile that prior perception with the direction where you're going now? And you also
mentioned Investment Management, Private Banking, how far to the retail investor would you like to go and when did
you make this mental change?

<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah, so, Mike, retail banking and exposure to the retail investor are two different things in
my mind. When I say exposure to the retail investor, when you think about pension funds, things like that are not
growing, that's not where the assets are being accumulated. They're being accumulated at the individual investor as they
plan for retirement on a global scale. And so, we manage a lot of money in the institutional space. We manage some
money in the retail space and we'd like to be able to have a better balance there. Dreyfus is our principal retail mutual
fund brand, but is not just Dreyfus, it's having our boutiques and their investment strategies on various platforms
around the world. So I don't think you're going to see us get into the retail banking space but utilize things like the
Pershing platform to make our products available on different platforms around the world where our investment
boutiques and investment strategies are quite strong.
<A - Curtis Y. Arledge>: Yeah. And Mike, maybe I would add, if you think about it, we're the eighth largest
investment management firm in the world and Dreyfus ranks about 23 or 24 in terms of mutual fund volume. So we
have all of the investment capability around the globe and certainly within the United States, specifically, to create
investment offerings, we think, that will be very attractive to really the advisor community. So we will reach retail
investors and mutual funds primarily through the advisor community. And again, Pershing helps with that, but certainly
Dreyfus has a very long, as long as anyone, relationship with much of this community. We just need to invest more in it
to make more of it.
And then we directly reach individual clients through our Wealth Management business. We're the eighth largest
wealth management firm in the United States, but have been heavily concentrated in a few key markets and so our
investment there actually has been expanding our geographic footprint in the Wealth Management business, where
again we are delivering investment capabilities to clients or Wealth Management clients but not in a large enough part
of the market.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And when would you say you made this change overall? I mean just you seems like you – it's a
continuum from you don't want to do consumer banking, I guess, but more wealth managers are talking about a little bit
more consumer banking, take a look at Morgan Stanley, all the way up to your Dreyfus. Where do you draw the line
and say we want to be here, we don't want to be on the other side of the line?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Well, as the investment companies of the world, we go to where the investment assets are
and the investment assets are with wealthy individuals and they're being managed through advisors and being managed
through different retail strategies and that's what we want to continue to build upon, Mike.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Cynthia Mayer with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Cynthia Mayer>: Hi. Thanks a lot. Just very briefly to follow-up on the investing in organic opportunities, so
you guys gave a sense of the timeframe for the Investment Management business but outside of that, what kind of
timeframe are you thinking of? Is this investing over this year, next year, or is it sort of a permanent shift?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Well, why don't we hit on a couple of the things in the Investment Services business, in
some ways those are even further along. For example, we've talked about Global Collateral Services quite a bit. We've
made investments in our capabilities there and we're delivering on those. Some of that is around financing, that's been a
bit disappointing. As Gerald had mentioned, it hasn't moved as quickly as we had hoped and it's also being impacted a
little bit just by market rates. So very low rate environment has made less need for transforming securities.
That's been offset with the segregation business and some of the legacy stuff, which has been terrific, as well as some
of the optimization capabilities that [ph] we've ported (57:34) to our clients. So we've seen good growth there. The
other area that we've talked a fair amount is the electronification of our FX business. So we're probably about, I would
say are what, 50% or 60% of the way through that investment. It is starting to pay some dividends or it's still early, but
I think it's starting to pay some modest dividends. I don't know, Tim, if you have anything to add to that?

<A - Timothy Francis Keaney>: Yeah, I might just add two points, Todd, and some of this gets back to the question
Mike Mayo was asking. We continue to make investments around Pershing's platform and making it global as a lot of
these private banks see lots of opportunities to serve their clients well. We feel really good about both the technology
play there and our domain knowledge. And these private banks have a huge opportunity, but they also have to deal with
an increasing regulatory environment that makes it actually much easier for them to outsource.
And then Eagle and outsourcing, it's been a theme now for probably the last couple years where asset managers and the
insurance subsidiaries – the asset management companies of insurance companies are outsourcing at an unprecedented
rate. And the investments we continue to make in Eagle around data warehouse and accounting are driving well over a
third of our new business pipeline now. So those would be the things, Todd, I would say we're investing in and I think
we see across-the-board real signs that they're starting to pay off and should have real traction in 2014.
<Q - Cynthia Mayer>: Okay. Thanks. And maybe just to follow up on FX, can you give a little color on how you're
thinking about your market share at this point and the mix of electronic and higher touch? Is the sort of rotation over to
more electronic trading done or do you feel like there's more to go? And how is your market share?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah, as I said in my opening comments, we are seeing the benefits of our electronic
platforms being adopted. We definitely feel we're capturing more volume than we were in the past. We're clearly
moving more to more negotiated type trades or commercial type trades on the platform itself. It's very fast. It's very
efficient. It's very transparent. And so we feel pretty good about the positioning of it. We're streaming prices to our
traders. We're getting in the position to stream prices to our clients on desktops, so they can automatically tap into us if
they like the price and we'll be able to execute it. So we feel good that the investments we're making are gaining
traction.
<Q - Cynthia Mayer>: And maybe just a last small one. You mentioned pension costs will fall. Can you size that?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: We're analyzing it right now. We will disclose that in the annual report, but it could be in
the range of $10 million to $20 million a quarter.
<Q - Cynthia Mayer>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Wendy, we have time for one more question.
Operator
Thank you. The final question today is from Andrew Marquardt with Evercore.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Good morning, guys. Just to pile in a little bit on the transformation of success or – sorry,
the initiative or non-initiative in terms of cultural shift. Can you help us maybe frame it a different way in terms of how
should we think about it in terms of operating margins, maybe piling into the former initiative laid out that you've now
met and exceeded, how should we think about getting operating margins up from kind of the mid-20%s to maybe the
upper 20%s or 30%s? Is that going to be the kind of next leg to do that or do you still need to have kind of a better
macro rate environment?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: I think there are a couple drivers there, Andrew. So one of the disclosures that we make
around our Investment Services business is our revenue, fee revenue, our core fee revenue to expenses. And that will be
the first place that you visibly see that. Ultimately, that will come into the operating margin as well. Now, two things
can happen there. We're either getting more efficient or less efficient, which you would see, and we're getting better
pricing or pricing is more challenging. So right now, we are starting to see some modest improvements. We didn't see a
big improvement over last year to this year and a lot of that can be driven by revenue – by mix. So as you see more and
more of loss of fee waivers, for example, that's all pretty much a fixed cost business. There's no additional expenses.
That can make noise in those numbers from period to period. But I think we've given adequate – actually we give very
good disclosures so you'll get a sense of where that's driving. And our goal is to get that on average, there's some
seasonality to it, on average to pick that up four or five points.

<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Thanks. And then – so does that translate into kind of an all in pre-tax operating margin in
the upper 20%s or can we kind of get back to [ph] or maybe past that (1:02:54)?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Most of that would come down – fall through the operating margin but if you think about
it, if we're saying $0.06 or $0.07 a quarter on fee waivers and you just...
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Right.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: That's a substantial growth rate right there. If it doesn't come with much expenses, that
would overwhelm what we do on a period to period as we grind out and make ourselves more efficient.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: I think the way to think about it is certainly in the traditional custody business, it's highly
commoditized and we want to be very aggressive around making sure we have a highly efficient operations around
commoditized products. And so, that's one issue. We can't wait for rising interest rates to improve our operating
margins and that's what this program is about, this process. And we're just taking control of what we can do and making
it much more efficient using technology, using productivity to drive the cost down in commoditized areas, and on the
investment side, introducing applications on those platforms that our clients want and are willing to pay for. So that's a
good way to think about it.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Got it. That's helpful. And then related to this transformation process, one of the things
you noted, obviously, cost of service and productivity but then also you had mentioned reducing of risk. Is that more of
an outcome of this initiative or this process or is that kind of a dedicated focus? And how should we think about that,
what is that related to?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah, in some ways, it's a dedicated focus but it's also an outcome. The more human labor
content you take out of the process, the more straight through, the more electronic it is, the more you use technology,
the less chance for error. And the less chance for error means less risk. And so we're really trying to constantly drive
down the operational risk associated with many things that we do. And using technology and using the capabilities that
we have, we think we can improve efficiencies and reduce the operational risk. [ph] The infamous (1:04:59) straight
through processing, a higher level of straight through processing, the less risk associated with business.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: That's helpful. And then just a couple ticky-tack...
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Oh.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Yeah, go ahead.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: No, go ahead.
<A>: [indiscernible] (1:05:15)
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Last one, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Sorry. Thanks. Just a couple ticky-tacks. On the balance sheet side, you previously talked
about excess deposits maybe in the range of $50 billion. Does that still hold? And what kind of rate environment [ph]
do you have to see to, (1:05:28) do you think, to maybe have that reverse?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah. we've – as we do a lot of analysis around our deposit base, it's – right now it is most
correlated – it's correlated to a couple things. It's correlated to our, obviously, to our underlying core business. So it's
very much tied into fee business so it tends to be [ph] frictional types of cash (1:05:51). So the more we grow our fee
business, the more we grow our deposit business. So there's probably an underlying 4% or 5% growth rate for our core
fee business.
But right now what's overwhelming is the unusual monetary policy that we're facing. So the Fed's got a $4 trillion
balance sheet, it's sitting on $3 trillion of excess reserves. As those excess reserves come down and there is draining,
we are going to see a substantial decline in the – in our balance sheet anywhere from $50 billion to $80 billion would
be our expectation as we get to more normalized rate environment. So all that cash that we're leaving at the Fed and not

earning that much, we would expect to, in a normal rate environment, to normalize. And the good news there is we
more than offset that with spread on the remaining cash and the fee waivers.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. And then if I may just last...
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: We do have a large balance sheet that's, at this point in time, is really reflecting this
current environment and I think it's important to understand.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Got it. That's helpful. And then just lastly on other or other in fees, investments and other
income obviously reflected the write-down or the loss but it also had some maybe higher than usual seed capital gains
and asset gains. Should we – I think you previously talked about that that line should be in kind of the $80 million kind
of quarterly range. Is that still holds as kind of...?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: No, we'd indicated that it would be more in the $80 million to $100 million range and
we've been a little bit – we've been on the high end of it. It's based on circumstances but, yeah, we still look to keep it
in that range.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: All right. Thanks, guys.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Okay. Thank you.
