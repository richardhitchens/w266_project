MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Hello, my name is Lorraine and I will be your conference facilitator. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to
the Baker Hughes Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any
background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]
I will now turn the conference over to Mr. Trey Clark, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may proceed.
Trey Clark
Thank you, Lorraine, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the Baker Hughes second quarter 2013 earnings
conference call. Here with me today is our Chairman and CEO Martin Craighead; and Peter Ragauss, Senior Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer. Today's presentation and the earnings release that was issued earlier today can
be found on our website at bakerhughes.com.
During the course of this conference call, we will provide predictions, forecasts and other forward-looking statements.
Although they reflect our current expectations, these statements are not guarantees of future performance but involve a
number of risks and assumptions. We urge you to review Baker Hughes's SEC filings for a discussion of some of the
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially. Lastly, reconciliation of operating profit and other
non-GAAP measures to GAAP results can be found on our earnings release and on our website at bakerhughes.com
under the Investor Relations section.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Martin Craighead. Martin?

Thanks, Trey, and good morning, everyone. Let me start off with a few comments about our results. First, Baker
Hughes performed well in North America and across the eastern hemisphere this quarter. In fact, the eastern
hemisphere posted record revenues on strong growth in both Europe/ Africa/Russia Caspian and Middle East/Asia
Pacific business segments, while North American revenue increased 3% sequentially despite Canadian activity
reaching its lowest level in four years. Unfortunately, that performance was more than offset by profit erosion in our
Latin American business segment. So I want to begin my remarks today by addressing these issues right out of the gate.
First, the most meaningful issue we faced in the quarter was timing associated with the ramp down of our drilling
contract in Brazil. As we transitioned to the new contract structure in the second quarter, we made a conscious decision
to work with our customer and ensure there were no operational disruptions. This customer-centric approach in Brazil
has served us well over the years and that, coupled with stellar drilling performance, secured us a contract extension
last year which resulted in very high activity levels being reached in the first quarter of this year.
As we progressed through the second quarter, we were anticipating a further extension. Unfortunately, that did not
occur and as a result, we forfeited an opportunity for a more orderly demobilization. This left us with stranded costs
associated with elevated staffing and under-utilized assets.
Also during the quarter, we faced the well-publicized shutdown across northern Mexico. Accordingly, late in the
quarter, we began the process of reducing our cost structure. We've made adjustments to head count, began redeploying
assets and wrote off some obsolete inventory. And we have more to do. Based on the actions we're taking, we expect an
immediate improvement in margin performance and recovery to high-single digits by year-end.
Unfortunately, these issues overshadowed growth and improved performance in other regions during the quarter. In
Norway, for example, we have ramped up for one of the largest integrated drilling service contracts in the history of our
industry. This, coupled with strong activity in Russia, Nigeria, and the UK, grew our Europe/Africa/Russia Caspian
segment by more than 13% over the previous quarter with incremental margins in excess of 50%.
Our Gulf of Mexico business recorded its historical best revenue with strong incremental margins while our U.S.
pressure pumping business posted its second consecutive quarter of improved revenue, share and margins as it executed
more stages with more 24-hour fleets than at any point in our history.
Later in the call, I'll provide more details on the balance of our business segments but first, let me turn it over to Peter
for details on the quarter and our guidance. Peter?
Peter A. Ragauss
Thank you, Martin, and good morning. This morning we reported net income for the second quarter of $240 million or
$0.54 per share. This includes a $20 million or $0.05 per share after-tax reserve for bad debt in Latin America as well
as a $7 million or $0.02 per share after-tax inventory charge related to certain proppants in North America. Revenue for
the second quarter was $5.5 billion, a record for Baker Hughes which was up $257 million or 5% compared to the
previous quarter. EBITDA for the second quarter was $860 million, down 1% sequentially.
To help in your understanding of this quarter's results, I'll bridge last quarter's earnings per share to this quarter. In the
first quarter, we posted net income of $0.60 per share. First, add back $0.05 for the currency devaluation in Venezuela
during the quarter. This brings us to the first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.65. Next, subtract $0.02 for
North America operations as significant proppant improvements in the United States, both on land and offshore, were
more than offset by seasonal activity reductions in Canada, including severe flooding at the end of the quarter which in
and of itself reduced earnings by $0.02.
Add $0.10 for eastern hemisphere, primarily due to a strong rebound in our Europe/Africa/Russia Caspian segment.
Subtract $0.12 for Latin America due to reduced revenues and stranded cost in Brazil as well as the Chicontepec
shutdown in Mexico. Add $0.02 for industrial services and subtract $0.02 for higher interest expense, taxes and
non-controlling interest. At this point, our earnings per share would have been $0.61.

To get the GAAP earnings per share of $0.54, subtract another $0.05 for the bad debt reserve in Latin America, add
$0.02 for the inventory charge in North America. In table five of our earnings release, we provide adjusted financial
information excluding the impact of the Venezuela currency devaluation on our segment results in the first quarter.
From this point on in the conference call, any comments on revenue, operating profit and operating profit margin refer
explicitly to table five in our earnings release unless otherwise stated.
Revenue in North America was $2.7 billion, up $74 million or 3% sequentially. This book was achieved despite
seasonality in Canada and strong revenue growth was realized in the U.S., particularly in our onshore
pressure-pumping product line and in our Gulf of Mexico business. Excluding the inventory charge, North America
operating profit would have been $222 million, down $13 million sequentially. Operating profit margin would have
been 8.3%.
Operating profits were sequentially lower primarily due to sales mix, as high margin Canadian revenue was replaced
with lower margin pressure-pumping revenue. In the U.S., despite a flat onshore rig count, our pressure-pumping
product line delivered improved revenue, operating profit and operating profit margin for the second consecutive
quarter. Improved fleet utilization and record stages per day resulting from increased 24-hour operations, market share
gains, and growing well count contributed favorably. These gains were partially offset by continued pricing declines.
Our other product lines in U.S. land also benefited from increased activity and improved drilling efficiencies realizing
higher revenues and profits including record performance in drill bits, completion systems and upstream chemicals.
In the Gulf of Mexico, we experienced a strong sequential rebound in revenues and profits due to higher activity, the
successful introduction of new technologies and a favorable mix of deepwater development work resulting in higher
utilization of our stimulation vessels.
And finally in Canada, our revenues and profits declined significantly as rig counts dropped more than 70%
sequentially to their lowest levels in four years. Compared to last year, Canadian profits were down about $0.03 per
share.
Moving to international results, we posted record revenue of $2.5 billion, up $156 million or 7% versus the prior
quarter and up $161 million or 7% compared to a year ago. Excluding the $20 million reserve in Latin America,
international operating profit would have been $268 million or 10.8%, down $13 million sequentially.
Despite record revenue, our international profits were negatively impacted by our Latin America segment where
revenues and operating profits declined significantly during the quarter. The revenue decline is primarily related to
Brazil where our activity and share both declined during the quarter as we transitioned to a new drilling services
contract at lower prices. Operating margins in Brazil were further reduced by stranded costs such as severance and
obsolete inventory charges. In Mexico, performance dropped due to the well-publicized shutdown of activity in
Chicontepec.
In our eastern hemisphere segments we delivered revenue growth of $189 million or 11% sequentially with 30%
incremental operating profit. Our eastern hemisphere operating profit margin was 13.7%, up 170 basis points
sequentially. Among our eastern hemisphere segments, Europe/Africa/Russia Caspian experienced the most significant
improvement in revenue, operating profit and operating profit margin. Segment revenues grew $112 million or 13%
sequentially to a record $966 million with 52% incremental operating profit. Operating profit margins were 15.6% in
the second quarter, representing a sequential increase of 470 basis points.
The revenue and profit increase is primarily due to increased activity in the North Sea, Nigeria, Mozambique, Angola
and Russia. In Norway, revenues and margins were further enhanced by performance-based bonuses associated with
our new integrated drilling services contract even while we were finalizing our mobilization during the quarter.
Our Middle East/Asia Pacific segment delivered continued revenue growth, posting record revenues of $971 million.
This represents an increase of 9% sequentially and 21% year-over-year. The sequential improvement was primarily due
to increased integrated operations activity in Iraq, where we now have 12 operational rigs, as well as higher activity in
Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Vietnam and Australia.

Operating profit was down 110 basis points sequentially, however, primarily due to higher third-party pass-through
revenue in Iraq and mobilization costs associated with our second pressure pumping fleet in Saudi Arabia.
For our Industrial Services segment, revenue was $316 million, up $27 million sequentially. Operating profit was $39
million, up $15 million and operating profit margin was 12.3%. Increased revenues and profits were primarily due to
seasonal improvements in our Process and Pipeline Services business.
Looking at the balance sheet during the quarter, we generated $230 million of free cash flow ending the quarter with a
cash balance of $1.1 billion or a $22 million increase sequentially. Total debt decreased $183 million during the quarter
to $4.9 billion, currently our total debt to capital ratio of 22%. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $551 million.
Now let me provide you with our guidance for the remainder of the year. In the U.S., we are reducing our onshore rig
projections from our last guidance. However, activity is still projected to improve. In the second quarter, we exited with
1,692 rigs. We anticipate that the rig count will rise modestly to an average of 1,720 rigs by the fourth quarter or an
increase of about 30 rigs between now and the end of the year. The forecast for U.S. offshore rigs remains unchanged
with an average of 52 rigs in 2013, which is an increase of four deepwater rigs or 8% compared to 2012.
The total average annual U.S. rig count for 2013 is now projected to be 1,765 rigs composed of approximately 1,385 oil
rigs and 380 gas rigs. This represents an 8% reduction compared to 2012. However, we expect that drilling efficiencies
will continue to improve during the remainder of 2013. We currently forecast the U.S. onshore well count for 2013 to
be approximately 35,000 wells, which is a reduction of about 4% year-on-year.
In Canada, the average rig count in the second half of 2013 is projected to increase to 335 average rigs in Q3 and 375
rigs in Q4, which is slightly better than last year and up from our previous guidance. As a result, Canada's average
annual rig count is now expected to be 350 rigs.
Sequentially, we expect Q3 North America profit margins will improve. The seasonal return of activity in Canada,
increased utilization of our U.S. pressure pumping fleet and continued strong demand for our other product and
services in the United States are all expected to improve revenues and operating margins. Gulf of Mexico results should
remain strong presuming there are no weather-related disruptions.
Looking internationally, the rig count is anticipated to continue reaching growth trends in the second half of the year
yielding an average 2013 rig count of 1,360 rigs with increases in every region. Excluding Iraq, this represents a 7%
increase in the annual international rig count.
Looking at our international margins, we expect that our Europe/Africa/Russia Caspian segment margins should
continue to increase in the second half driven by activity improvements and newly-won share in the UK, Nigeria,
Sub-Sahara and Russia.
Our Middle East/Asia Pacific segment margins should rise during the second half of the year also as unconventional
gas activity in Saudi Arabia increases and as profitability increases in Iraq. And in Latin America, we expect operating
profit margins to improve in the third quarter due to new projects starting in the region and ongoing efforts to reduce
costs. We expect that profit margin should be in the high-single digits by the end of the year.
Industrial services activity in Q3 is expected to be similar to Q2. Q4 margins, however, are expected to be lower due to
seasonality in our Process and Pipeline Services business. Also for the third quarter, interest expense is expected to be
around $60 million. Corporate costs are expected to be about $70 million. Depreciation, amortization expense is
expected to be around $430 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter are expected to be about $550 million. And
finally, our full year 2013 effective tax rate is expected to be between 33% and 34%.
At this point, I'll now turn the call back over to Martin. Martin?

Thanks, Peter. As I mentioned earlier, we are reducing our Latin America cost base to improve its profitability. Actions
underway include the adjustments to head count, as well as the redeployment of critical assets and skilled personnel to
support the strong growth we are capturing in other markets, specifically in Norway and the Middle East.
At the same time, we remain committed to long-term profitable growth in this region and continue to target projects
aligned to our core strengths, particularly in deepwater, unconventionals and integrated operations. During the second
quarter, we have secured additional contracts across the region that will help backfill the revenue drop in Brazil and
Mexico.
As an example, in Argentina, we have been awarded a major contract to provide integrated completion services for
unconventional development. The scope of work includes a frac fleet, coil tubing, wireline services, and completion
systems. We will also be playing a key role in the development of unconventionals in Colombia where we have been
awarded a nine-well project for drilling services.
And looking beyond 2013, last week, we were awarded the Soledad block in Chicontepec. This long-term integrated
operations project will provide a sound re-entry point for us into Northern Mexico beginning early next year.
Now turning to our eastern hemisphere operations, I'm very excited with the outlook. Our operations are benefiting
from new technology deployment in a number of key markets, steadily growing activity and improving operational
efficiency. In Russia, we completed the industry's first frac-pack operation in Sakhalin. This is the first of a multi-well
completion campaign and represents the largest sand control project for Baker Hughes in the region to date. In the
neighboring Caspian geo-market, we received a letter or award for a three-year campaign to provide drilling services in
Turkmenistan beginning this quarter.
In Africa, we're excited about our growing position in the emerging deepwater market off the east coast. During the
second quarter, we secured a series of contracts that further enhance our position to now include a sizeable onshore
presence in this important and growing market. Baker Hughes will provide wireline services, drill bits and cementing
on a multi-well exploration campaign spreading over the next five years across Kenya and Ethiopia.
Also in Africa, we've been awarded a four-year contract to provide wireline services on an ultra-deepwater campaign in
Angola and Namibia. And in offshore Malaysia, we've completed our first well under our new integrated operations
contract for a multi-well campaign. The work scope includes CoilTrak services representing the first time we've
provided coil tubing drilling services offshore in Asia Pacific.
Across the Middle East, development of the unconventionals is becoming a growing market driver. Saudi Arabia and
Oman are both actively targeting shale gas and tight gas production. Additionally, there are potential projects in the
United Arab Emirates and Kuwait. With pressure pumping assets now mobilized in the region, we're well positioned to
capture strong growth in this market. These are just a few of the operational highlights in the eastern hemisphere that
will continue growing international revenue and margins in the second half of the year.
Turning to North America, as new technologies and methodologies continue to be introduced into the unconventional
market, drilling efficiencies improve. However, they don't improve consistently; not between basins and not even
between operators within a basin.
For the last 70 years, we have provided the industry with the Baker Hughes rig count. Last night, we announced the
launch of the Baker Hughes well count. This new index captures the number of wells which were spud in each major
U.S. basin and, when combined with the Baker Hughes rig count, drilling efficiencies become more obvious.
As industry trends evolve, you can expect new features and information sources to be added to the Baker Hughes well
count index periodically. We can see from the data, for example, that drilling efficiencies vary by basin. In the
Williston, the Marcellus, and the Eagle Ford, we're seeing about 20% more wells per rig compared to this time last
year. Whereas, in the Permian, wells per rig have hardly changed.
Additionally, the Baker Hughes well count shows seasonality that wasn't evident in the rig count alone. During the
winter months, the wells per rig slows due to poor weather conditions. For example, the wells per rig dropped by 15%
in the Granite Wash this past winter before rebounding later in the spring. So, it's this seasonal rebound and the

underlying trend of drilling efficiencies that explains why we saw a 3% increase in the Baker Hughes well count during
the second quarter despite the rig count remaining absolutely flat.
The ongoing trend to continue increasing wells per rig is a fantastic opportunity for a technology-driven service
company such as Baker Hughes. We're playing a meaningful role in improving the economies of [ph] shale (21:08) in
North America through new technology introductions and deployments. For example, last quarter, we achieved a
significant milestone by successfully introducing the cemented frac point system. This service provides all of the
isolation and entry benefits of plug and perf completions while providing the efficiency gain achieved using sliding
sleeves. In basins where openhole completions are prohibited, such as the Eagle Ford for example, operators now have
a cemented sliding sleeve option built on the industry-leading FracPoint system.
We are driving efficiencies in our pressure-pumping business through technology introduction. Last year, Baker
Hughes was the first to announce the introduction of hydraulic fracturing pumps able to operate on diesel and natural
gas. And today, we remain at the industry forefront of bifuel deployment. Demand for our Rhino Bifuel has been
outstanding. In this quarter we completed several stimulation treatments in the U.S. and Canada using full fleets of
bifuel-capable frac units.
Today in collaboration with a growing client base, we offer this technology using either LNG, CNG or the customers'
own line gas. We're accelerating the deployment of Rhino Bifuel throughout North America by retrofitting several
existing fleets in order to have the largest number of bifuel fleets available to the market. And we believe
bifuel-powered pumping technology will rapidly become this industry's norm.
Pressure-pumping pricing remains low but we believe it has stabilized. However, even in a poor pricing environment,
we continue to increase profitability of this product line through the actions we're taking to improve operating
efficiency and fleet utilization, including the introduction of new technologies.
Now turning to one of the most exciting areas of our North America business, the offshore market. The ongoing shift
within the Gulf of Mexico to include more development work is playing to our strength in completions and production.
In the second quarter, we achieved an industry-first. Using our Blue Dolphin stimulation vessel, we performed six
individual multi-zone frac-packs on a single well in a single trip. The project required high pump rates and high
volumes including the largest volume of proppant ever pumped into a single well in the Gulf of Mexico. For any other
lower volume vessel, this project would have taken multiple trips to shore to resupply or multiple vessels on location.
Recently, we announced the addition of a third vessel to this growing market. And this afternoon, we will take part in
her christening. She is deepwater capable and is planned to be operational later in the third quarter.
We're also introducing new capabilities on the drilling and evaluation side. And during the second quarter, we
successfully completed a high profile evaluation operation on an ultra-deepwater high temperature appraisal well. The
project included the deployment of several recently introduced wireline technology services including RCX Sentinel
focused sampling, GeoExplorer imaging, MaxCOR rotary coring, and Nautilus high pressure/high temperature logging.
Our strength in North American offshore markets is also growing north of the border. During the second quarter, we
gained drilling services share in the offshore market in Eastern Canada, advancing our foothold in this small but yet
very critical market.
In the past, I've talked about three technology-based themes underpinning long-term profitable growth for Baker
Hughes. They are: Increasing well complexity, improving drilling efficiency and improving ultimate recovery. Now,
the majority of our technology investment is aligned accordingly, and today I'd like to highlight a new breakthrough
product that takes a substantial step towards addressing the third theme, ultimate recovery.
Our artificial lift product line has been testing a promising new technology to boost production rates and ultimate
recovery for unconventional shale wells. As you know, these wells have a very steep decline in production in the first
few years. So, the challenge was to develop an electrical submersible pump that could operate at lower flow rates
typically associated with rod lift products, while providing the reliability and overall efficiencies of an ESP.

The new FLEX pump series ESP does just that. It is engineered to handle a broader range of production rates and can
operate in low flow wells down to 50 barrels per day. This is the right product at the right time and it expands our
North American ESP market by over $1 billion. And it provides our customers with a more sophisticated solution, one
that provides superior reliability and variable drawdown capability.
We've successfully field tested FLEX pump in the Eagle Ford, the Bakken, the Permian and the Central Basins. And in
some cases, these early tests are showing production increases up to 35% along with more reliable gas handling at
lower pump pressures when compared to traditional rod lift systems and offset wells. And like all ESPs without the
normal tubing wear caused by rod lift and deviated wells.
This has the potential to be the next great breakthrough in artificial lift technology. And it's innovations like the ones
I've just mentioned that will drive long-term profitable growth here at Baker Hughes. At the same time and equally
important, we remain 100% focused on the near term, improving the quality of our earnings, remaining capital
disciplined, and generating free cash flow.
And with that, Trey, let's turn it over for some questions.
Trey Clark
Thank you, Martin. At this point, I'll ask the operator to open the lines for your questions. To give everyone a fair
chance to ask questions, we ask that you limit yourself to a single question and one related follow-up question.
Lorraine, could we have the first question, please?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes
from James West from Barclays, please go ahead.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Hey, good morning, guys.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Morning.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Morning, James.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Martin, as you think about North America in the second half of the year, you obviously
highlighted a lot of traction, or good traction in your pumping business in terms of utilization. We got the new ESP that
you just mentioned and went through the technology there. You've obviously got some strengths in production
chemicals, things like that. Yet it looks like kind of, you know, estimates at least, our estimates, other estimates out
there have a pretty wide margin gap between yourself and some of your peers.
And admittedly, we haven't seen one of your peer's numbers just yet; we'll see those on Monday. But how quickly do
you think – or I guess two things. I guess, one, do you think that there is a structural gap between your margin potential
and theirs? And two, if not, how quickly do you think you can close that margin gap?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: That's a great question, James. Thanks for asking it. First of all, there's not a structural
impairment. As we've highlighted before, our – one of our – our largest product line in North America is operating at
differentially low performance economically. That all said, it's making – it is the product line with the most momentum
in terms of improvement across the globe for us right now. So it's a locomotive that's – it's starting to churn out and it's
– it made some very nice improvement and as I highlighted, two quarters in a row. In this particular quarter, the slope
of the curve is picking up even more. So it's really starting to come together.

And that is the only issue that I believe we have in North America. We like our portfolio both in terms of product line
and in geographies. Highlighted the diversifications going on in Canada. The strengths in the Gulf of Mexico are mixed
with our ships versus our peer group. And the non-pressure pumping businesses are performing extremely, extremely
well.
And in that particular business, if you remember about year ago, a little over a year ago, we highlighted the issues that
we were facing. And one of the most critical at the time was the people utilization and action was taken and
realignment made. The customer mix is pretty much where we want it to be and the big issue there was having the right
customers in the right locations.

lies around – some issues around transportation and logistics. And those are things we're still working through. So, no
structural and in terms of timing, I don't want to put my finger on that because it's a volatile business as you know.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Sure.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: But for us, we don't expect any more price erosion going forward. We did experience a
little from one to two but think that's behind us. So it's upward and onward from here.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Okay. And the transportation issues that you highlighted, those don't seem like a – I'm not
trying to pin you down too much on timing, but they don't seem like that's an issue that's going to take years to
progress. I mean, it seems like a couple quarters or something where you can fix those issues.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: [indiscernible] (31:12)
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Is that a fair assessment?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: That's a fair assessment. It's not [indiscernible] (31:16), that's for sure.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Okay. Right. Okay, good. And then just one last follow-up for me. You're over 50%
utilization, I believe, or 50% 24-hour operations on pumping today. That originally was the goal, I believe, for
year-end. So what's the new goal now?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Well, I'll tell you this, this time next year I'm hoping that it starts with a seven. But we're
not at 50%. We hit 50% a couple of times in the quarter, the high mid-week times, but it's really averaged around 45%.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Okay.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: But I just want to calibrate it a little differently there.
<Q - James Carlyle West>: Okay, okay. Got it. Thanks, Martin.

<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: Thanks. Good morning, Martin.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Morning, Bill.
<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: Sort of tackling the North American margin question a little bit differently. In a world in which
we have relatively range-bound commodity prices and a continued positive delta between well count and rig count and
E&P capital spending moving methodically higher, what do you think is a reasonable expectation for targeted
normalized North American margins? What do you think in that kind of world in which we're growing but not melting

up and we continue to prosecute the North American growth story, yet the rate of change remains relatively methodical,
what should be the normalized margin after you make all these adjustments which have plagued you from a sort of
operational standpoint, logistical standpoint, supply chain standpoint, et cetera?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Well, if you also factor in what you didn't mention, the – hopefully, capital discipline that
begins to permeate the service sector as much as it's permeated our customers, I'd say if that's sustainable and pretty
much around the pressure-pumping business once the cost of capital – we all start earning our cost of capital again, I'd
say mid to high teens is probably a fair expectation, assuming no sharp swings in the market.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: And, Bill, this is Peter.
<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: Got it.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Don't forget, you've still got an overhang on that pressure pumping capacity somewhere circa
20%. And that's kind of an unnatural position for the industry to be in. So if that overhang melts away through attrition,
which we expect it will with, like you said, well count increasing, then that's, I think, what Martin said is easily
achievable. But that's going to – again, that's going to take quite some time to get that overhang out of here, so.
<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: Right, Peter. Don't worry. I'm not going to go to high teens margins right away. But I hear you.
And that is a valid point.
Martin, with regard to year-end, is it unrealistic or unreasonable to expect – I mean, you're going to get a seasonal
recovery in the third quarter with regard to Canada. We've got the new frac vessel being deployed in the Gulf of
Mexico. We got ongoing utilization gains domestically. Is it unreasonable to assume that North American margins by
year-end kind of get to somewhere approaching the low teens?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I don't know if that's unreasonable, but I think that's maybe on the optimistic side of
where we think. Again, the big part is the recovery in the pressure-pumping business. And remember, to follow up on
your first point, correct in two to three in Canada. Three to four in Canada is obviously nowhere near as dramatic. So,
that's a big factor as well.
<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: Understood. And that's what I've got modeled. But essentially, low teens, ambitious but doable
is what I'm hearing for year-end, is that correct?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yeah. Ambitious is definitely correct.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Yeah, I'd probably box it in a little bit more. I'd say it's ambitious to be in the low teens. It's
plausible certainly to be double digits.
<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: Okay. And then secondly, with regard to Latin America, I'm not sure if my math is all that
crisp given all the adjustments that we made, but I mean, I get to kind of a – after you back out the bad debt provision,
something around a 1.2% or 1.3% margin for the second quarter or something like that. And then you guys mentioned a
high-single digit margin hopefully by year-end. What should we assume for the third quarter just as a guess? And
moreover, revenues for second half of the year in Latin America, is it reasonable just to assume that we're going to be
flat – flattish with the second quarter? So help me on top line as well as for second half year in Latin America and
margins for the third quarter.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Revenues for the second half, we've got new projects starting up. I would say – we tend to
view Q2 as pretty much an anomaly...
<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: Okay.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: ...in terms of revenue and certainly in terms of costs. So revenues ought to be up a little bit
second half with new projects.
<Q - Bill A. Herbert>: Okay.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Jim Wicklund of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Good morning.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Morning, Jim.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Morning.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: From a technical point of view, I know that you guys internationally – and you talked about
eastern hemisphere which was great. From a technical point of view, there's been a lot of talk about who is and isn't
making up ground on industry leaders. And I know you guys have lost a little bit of market share over the last year or
two to some of your competitors. Is this a recapture of market share based on technology, just a reversion to the main of
activity, is it being led by technology? Can you talk a little bit about – the slow grind up internationally that we've seen
for years and you guys are setting records, so I'm – just a little bit more of a deep dive into what the Baker Hughes
internal effort is in that regard. What are you trying to lead with?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Jim, it's – as you know, it's – there's always a heavy, heavy theme of technology
deployment in that part of the world. I can't say that that's changed over the last, let's say, five years. The differentiating
component for us has been the absorption and maturing of the geo market organization which has led, I think, to some
better product developments based on the fact that we've been getting closer to our customer.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Okay.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Also, you remember that it was quite a bit of infrastructure build in a lot of places, and
just being closer, having a better operation that you can work from, having still the leading products in many
categories. But having that better conversation, being closer to the customer, having a single point of contact, getting
out of the organizational barriers that can hinder a divisionally-oriented company like we were, I think that's probably –
and that's from a – that's a thing that just kind of just keeps growing in terms of getting better. Okay?
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Okay. And my follow-up, if I could, is along the same lines. I know that several – I know
you guys have increased the infrastructure internationally over the last couple of years and now you have bases in
places that you might not have had a couple years ago. And I would assume that that levels the playing field on
competition. Can you give us an idea of about how much, or a percent of capital, however you want to do it, we should
look at over the last couple years as kind of sunk costs that now should start to deliver results if you would from – on
an international basis?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Yeah, Jim, we've been spending $200 million, $300 million a year on infrastructure for the
past – well, almost four years now. So, call it $1 billion, a little bit more than that on infrastructure overall; much of
that was international. More recently, we built out our bases domestically in some of the oily basins for pressure
pumping. But the only thing we're spending money now is the tail end of finishing up some of those projects. Some of
those are two to three-year projects. We haven't really sanctioned much new in the past 12 month to 18 months. And so
most of that spend is behind us now.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Excellent. Okay, thanks guys.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Morning, Kurt.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hey, Martin, I was wondering if you could provide us with an update on the growth prospects in
Saudi and then in the other countries that surround Saudi. I think there's been some varying data points around rig
activity progression for Saudi market in particular. I was wondering if you might be able to give us a quick update on
that.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I can tell you what our perspective is. But let's go back a little bit so everybody can get
recalibrated. Six months ago there was a lot of excitement out there about what kind of rigs were going to be added.
They didn't. But it's our understanding that they will reach their final objective. It's been pushed out though to probably
the end of 2014, so another 18 months. But from here on out, I believe that – we believe the rigs will begin coming into
the Kingdom. So the final number that Saudi Aramco was aiming towards, we believe will become a reality. It's just
probably six months behind.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay. And then with respect to Iraq, what's the expectation in terms of the margin dilution as the
year goes on? I think you've discussed in the past that the margin dilution would continue to, say, diminish. I know you
had some third party pass-through costs here, so how do we think about that evolution throughout the course of the
year?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Kurt, the – as Peter said, we're on 12 rigs now. We'll be mobilizing for three more
work-over rigs in the next couple of quarters. This quarter we were breakeven and I expect that Iraq will be
contributing EPS by the end of the year. Now, I think the nature of the beast that we all have to understand with that
market, at least the way the market is now, given the significant amount of pass-through revenue, it's going to be a
dilutive – dilutive to margins, but EPS accretive.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay, great. That's it for me. Thank you.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: You're welcome.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Scott Gruber from Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Yes, good morning.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Morning, Scott.
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Morning.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Can you provide some details on the Soledad project down in Mexico? What's the capital
commitment down there? What's the expected revenue stream? A little bit on potential pass-through revenues that
would dilute the margins.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Okay. I don't want to peg the revenue stream yet, Scott, or margin projections. I will tell
you that we're really, really happy and excited about this. It's not a big scale project. It's one drilling rig, one work-over
rig. It's – the total capital commitment over couple of years. It's public information, at least down there. So, I don't mind
sharing that. It's around between $60 million and $65 million over two years.
But it's a nice infill drilling work-over play. We've been very successful with the [ph] Correo (44:08) lab down there
which is in the same general vicinity where we've taken production up over threefold from when we inherited the field

less than two years ago. So, the reservoir engineering folks, our production engineers, we've been able to really define
some targets. We're drilling some horizontal wells in the [ph] Correo (44:30) and we'll be doing that in this block. So
it's a nice – it'll turn into a nice service incentive contract for us starting in Q1, Q2 next year.
<Q - Scott A. Gruber>: Got it. And then an unrelated follow-up, earlier in the year Halliburton and now, here today,
Schlumberger have dedicated themselves to returning more cash to shareholders. You were free cash flow positive in
2Q and your margin outlook is improving here over the second half of the year. What are your thoughts regarding
increasing the dividend or buying back shares?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Yeah, this is Peter. We review this every quarter with the board. The good news is we now
have something to talk about. Before, we haven't been free cash flow positive on a regular basis. We weren't free cash
flow positive in the first quarter. So this is a pretty strong quarter for us. We're expecting future quarters to continue to
deliver free cash flow and when that starts to be delivered on a reliable basis, we'll be in a position to be able to
consider shareholder distributions.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Bill Sanchez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Morning, Bill.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Martin, I wanted to circle back on Latin America and I can appreciate the comments in Brazil
that you made to start the call. I guess just a point of clarification, those assets that are in Brazil that, I guess, now need
to find a new home, we're targeting those in Norway, in Middle East, I believe you said, I guess is point one.
And then number two, just to follow up on Mexico specifically. I guess my understanding prior to this call was is that
the company has made it a top priority to increase your share there. I know Mexico as a percentage of your overall
Latin America revenue is relatively low. Now, you talk about cost cutting in Mexico. I guess I'm just trying to discuss –
or if you could, just spend a little time discussing the outlook and how do you see Mexico for Baker Hughes longer
term?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: That's a great question. Thanks for asking it. Well, Pemex even before the emergence of
Petrobras, at least from our calculations, the product lines that we participate in, Pemex has consistently been the
largest spender in Latin America. And you're right, we've been kind of obvious by our smaller position there and it's a
variety of reasons. But we set out a while back to change that.
And the cost cutting is transitory because it is still a place we're going to invest and grow and increase both share and
margins. And we have a plan to do that and we have a line of sight to some of it. The cost cutting that Peter mentioned
was really around – and fully necessary was given the abrupt nature in the budgetary issues that Pemex encountered
and cut off spending in the north.
Whatever share we have in Mexico, the preponderance of our activity is in the north. So, we didn't have much in the
way of – to fall back on, offshore or in the south. And so the cost cutting was necessary. And – but like I say, that's –
and it kind of helps go to explaining the – I believe Peter mentioned this, the sharp decrementals because there were
some rig cancellation costs and things like that that we had to take care of in Mexico. But as I said, as Peter said, that's
kind of behind us.
<Q - William Sanchez>: Okay. As a follow-up, unrelated follow-up, Peter, typically in Canada in 3Q, you recover
about one half of the loss profitability you see first to second quarter. Is that a fair assumption for 3Q this year?

<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: Yeah. As I – there are a couple of data points we already sprinkled in which is Canada this
year was about $0.03 lower than last year so you can sort of add that back. And then you've got – we're expecting
Canada in Q3 to be just as spritely as it was last year, if not a little bit better. So our biggest single swing factor from
Q2 to Q3 is Canada and it's a sizable amount as is typical, and maybe a little bit more this time around.
<Q - William Sanchez>: So very high decrementals you had on that loss revenue in 2Q. Is getting to a 10% margin in
3Q in North America in third quarter, is that a reasonable target, Peter?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: I think that's a possible possibility.

Thank you. And our next question comes from Mike Urban from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Urban>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Morning, Mike.
<Q - Michael Urban>: So, you talked a little bit about the push back of – in terms of the Saudi's plans by six months
or so which we'd heard as well. Is that just kind of stretching things out, being more operationally efficient or are they
struggling in some cases to get equipment or rigs? And I guess, just the obvious difference being the tightness of the
market, not only in Saudi, but in the region. So if you could give us a little bit of color on that, it'd be helpful.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: I don't want to speculate on the reasons necessarily for the delay. I think it had to do with
getting the right rigs, getting the projects lined out. But as I confirmed on the earlier question, it's our understanding
now that most of those rigs are secured and identified to be shipped to Saudi. So, yeah, we pushed out six months. And
the tightness in the market is real. I don't want to speculate because I think we all fell victim to speculating of what it
may do to price six months ago. So, I'm just going to reserve judgment. But it certainly should have an upward bias and
I'll just leave it at that.
<Q - Michael Urban>: Okay. And so – and then maybe to ask it a little more broadly, I mean, what are you seeing
pricingwise in the broader international markets? Are there pockets of strength in certain regions? Are you seeing it
across the board? Is it product or service line specific? Just a little more color on that would be great.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Sure, okay. I can tell you that I was surprised by some of the reports that came in; parts
of Asia Pacific, as well as parts of the Middle East where a couple of product lines have actually increased prices, albeit
small. But it's been a while since that's been visible at this level of the company. There've been some public tender
openings in a couple, again, Asian countries where the estimates came in higher than what they call the operator
estimates, meaning that between the NOC and the IOC all the bids from the big three service companies exceeded their
desire, and that's a good signal. So there's some discipline coming in.
But on the other hand, Asia Pacific, I think, has been a place where – needed the most improvement. And moving north
of there – outside of North Africa, there's really no place that I wouldn't be expecting that we're seeing greater
buoyancy in pricing going forward. All the big, big, big contracts are kind of behind us, as been previously stated and
you well know. So here it's, to use that overused term, which is to grind higher I think.
<Q - Michael Urban>: Okay. That's great. That's all for me. Thank you.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: You're welcome.

Thank you. And our next question comes from David Anderson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - David Anderson>: Great, thanks. Just a question on pricing on the North America side, how do you see that
progressing right now? Peter, I think you had said you started to see attrition in some of the overhang of pressure
pumping out there. It sounds like things have been pretty rational from a competitive standpoint. Do you think you can
get pricing towards the end of the year? And I guess I'm just curious what are you guys modeling internally as you
think out, say, the next three or four quarters? Are you expecting to see pricing in some of those numbers?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: In North America specifically, we're not modeling any pricing increases. We have been
getting some – well, we have been getting some price in the Gulf now for a while just because that's ramped up so
quickly. And everybody was short on equipment there. But in terms of land, we're not modeling any pricing increases.
Pricing is held up in our other product lines, but pressure pumping, we're not modeling any pricing increases.
<Q - David Anderson>: What about on the completion side? I guess I'm kind of wondering about, say, in the Bakken,
and different areas like that. Are you getting any kind of better pricing in that side of the business?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: It's holding up there pretty well.
<Q - David Anderson>: Okay.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: The – David, it's – for now, it's new products, new technology where you can get a
premium price, whether it's on the artificial lift side or on the drilling side. But as Peter mentioned, it's pretty much a
balanced market at this point.
<Q - David Anderson>: I was just curious overall, one of the things we continue to hear about is pad drilling starting
to expand in different markets. Can you give me a sense of roughly how much of your business do you think is on the
pad drilling side and where you think that can go, say, over the next 12 months?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Well, I don't want to tell you the percentage, but it's – the amount of revenue that we
earned this quarter is twice what we earned this time last year. And I don't want to tell you the magnitude of that. I'll let
you judge that. But it's surprising how much is being converted to these pad locations so quickly. Now, that may be in
part because of our product mix, particularly the AutoTrak Curve and so forth. So, I don't know if it's inordinately high
for us. Certainly as well, relative to last year, the way we've re-architected, redesigned our frac fleets and changed our
customer mix may have also accelerated us in that space. But it's 100% year-on-year on the pads.
<Q - David Anderson>: How does the pads impact your profitability? Let's say when you've had two wells side by
side, one...
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Right.
<Q - David Anderson>: ... one set on pad, one set not on pad. Can you give me a sense of order of magnitude on what
that does to your numbers?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: On the pressure pumping, it's between a 30% and 50% increase in margin. Okay?
<Q - David Anderson>: Okay.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Yeah. It's huge.
<A - Trey Clark>: Thanks, Dave.
<Q - David Anderson>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Trey Clark>: Lorraine, we have time for one final question.

Thank you. And our last question comes from Jud Bailey from ISI Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jud E. Bailey>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Morning, Jud.
<Q - Jud E. Bailey>: I had one more follow-up on Latin America just to understand getting us back to the high – I'm
sorry, the high-single digit number in terms of margin by the fourth quarter. Obviously, you have some cost cuts you're
undergoing in Brazil and Mexico. To get to that type of margin, are you relying on any projects you see coming up in
either country that would help margins get up or is that just simply rightsizing the business for the new level of activity
you have in those markets?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: It's a little of both. We don't stand still. We've got – we've picked up some share in various
places. We're expecting activity to pick up a couple of places in some new projects. So, revenue will contribute to that.
But the bulk of it will be rightsizing Brazil and that – it'll take us through the third quarter to get there. So it's a little bit
of revenue help but it's a lot of just rightsizing the business in Brazil.
<Q - Jud E. Bailey>: Got it, great. And then my follow-up is on the Gulf of Mexico. Obviously, the narrative there
remains pretty positive. And I apologize if I missed it, but did you say – how much did – can you say how much Gulf
of Mexico revenue grew during the quarter sequentially?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: We don't break that out.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: We didn't say.
<Q - Jud E. Bailey>: Okay, all right. And then just going forward, you're adding another frac boat in the third quarter.
Are we still not expecting to see material revenue increases though until 2014? Or do we see some margin
improvement before that since you seem to be getting better utilization on your frac boats in the Gulf?
<A - Peter A. Ragauss>: I think you can model in some contribution in the – towards this end of Q4 and a full
utilization into 2014.
<Q - Jud E. Bailey>: Okay. And then the FLEX pump you guys talked about on the artificial lift side, can you – you
outlined kind of the revenue opportunity there. Could you talk a little more about perhaps how quickly you think you
can roll that product out commercially and how to think about how quickly that could really start to contribute to North
America results?
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: Well, I can tell you it's going to start contributing to our results immediately. In terms of
changing North America margins, one product, that ain't going to happen for a while, since we have about 1,300
different products in North America. But I will tell you that we're excited by this. It's a real, I think, substantial
technical innovation. We estimate – I don't want to tell you how many billions we estimate the artificial lift market for
unconventionals to be, but we have well over half of it for ESPs. But we can only play in about 15% of that spend. This
takes us to about 75% of that spend.
And I tell you, this is not driven out of just wanting to put a better mousetrap out there. This is being driven over the
last couple years by our customers asking for a more elegant solution because in many cases, Jud, as you know, these
wells have come on at 1,500 barrels a day, but they know in 24 months, it will be 300 barrels a day, 200 barrels a day,
100 barrels a day given the hyperbolic decline.
And they'd love to start with an ESP but if they know in 24 months they're going to have to put a rod lift on it, they've
avoided that, some of them, 85% of them. Now, we can take them down to 50 barrels a day. It's a – it gives them a
whole different – changes the discussion substantially. So we're pretty excited. But please don't be changing your
numbers based on one product at this stage. Okay?
<Q - Jud E. Bailey>: No. We're not going to do that. I appreciate the color. Thank you.
<A - Martin S. Craighead>: You're welcome.
