MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Raytheon Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call.
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn
the call over to Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.
Todd Ernst
Thank you, Frances. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for joining us today on our third quarter conference call.
The results that we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call and the slides that we'll reference are available
on our website at raytheon.com. Following this morning's call, an archive of both the audio replay and a printable
version of the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website.
With me today are Bill Swanson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Dave Wajsgras, our Chief Financial
Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks by Bill and Dave and then move on to questions.
Before I turn the call over to Bill, I would like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters
discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives and
expected performance, constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of
assumptions that the company believes are reasonable, but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are
summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings. With that, I'll turn the call
over to Bill. Bill?

Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Let me start off first by congratulating the Red Sox and their organization
on their win last night. Some of us were up a little bit late, but I'm pleased to report that Raytheon delivered solid
operating performance in the third quarter. Our sales, margins, EPS, and cash flow were all ahead of expectation. As
the business continues to execute well in the quarter and going forward, further our productivity initiatives continue to
gain traction and deliver results driving improved affordability for our customers.
Bookings were $5.7 billion and we ended the quarter with a book-to-bill just under one. As we look to the end of the
year, we have a number of large domestic and international opportunities that we're targeting and we continue to see
solid demand from the global market for our broad portfolio of advanced solutions. Before we get into more details
regarding the quarter, I'd like to talk about the realities of the budget environment. As you know, the U.S. government
was shut down for 16 days this month and we're operating under sequestration and yet another CR.
To call this a very challenging environment would be an understatement. Clearly, this is not the way we'd prefer the
budget process to operate. No one wants to have to manage their strategic business plans under such circumstances. But
by working closely with our customers and focusing on performance, we continue to deliver the solutions our
customers need.
That said, we weren't completely unaffected by the shutdown. A number of our employees were impacted. This was
largely related to our non-DoD or civil business, which provides direct support to our customers. In particular, the area
of the company most affected was our Federal Aviation Administration training programs. Financially, the shutdown
impact was minimal and has been captured in our updated financial guidance. But personally, the situation was hard on
the individuals and the government and industry who devoted their entire careers to supporting our nation. And while
larger companies such as Raytheon have the ability to mitigate the impact to our workforces, our industry supply base
does not – these companies are often small and minority owned and don't have the same resources or flexibility to
weather these ongoing budget storms. So while we're pleased that Congress and the administration have resolved the
most recent budget stalemate, we continue to call on them to put an end to the budget paralysis in Washington.
We need to reach a lasting bipartisan solution to ensure our nation's long-term fiscal stability without requiring
shutdowns, CRs and sequestration; without a long-term solution, we face continued workforce uncertainty.
In the meantime, it's incumbent upon us at Raytheon to effectively manage our company in this environment. This
means continuing to focus on the fundamentals and executing our differentiated strategy, it's what we do. And once
again this focus is yielding results that are evident in our operating performance.
As noted in our earnings release this morning, we're raising our guidance for sales, EPS and cash flow for the year.
This kind of performance doesn't just happen, rather it's a function of a dedicated team working everyday to find new
ways to improve, to lower our cost and to respond more quickly to our customers' needs.
As most of you know, when we are faced with competition, we embrace it and strive to deliver world class technology
at an affordable price. A good example of this is our gallium nitride or GaN technology, a long-term investment we
made years ago that is now helping us win key programs like the Next Generation Jammer. And earlier this month, we
were notified by the Navy that we turned in an outstanding proposal and were selected for the new Air and Missile
Defense radar or AMDR. AMDR is the radar system for the next generation of destroyers for the U.S. Navy, which will
provide greatly improved missile defense capability compared to today's systems.
Our competitive wins on AMDR and Next Generation Jammer are credit to Raytheon team and to our strategic vision,
which is driving the investment, technology, and operational decisions today that will support our competitiveness in
the future. I probably should mention that both of these competitive awards are currently under protest, but that seems
to be the new normal.
Moving on, we're also successful executing our international strategy that is providing significant long-term growth
potential. Our international sales this quarter grew by 6% compared to the third quarter of 2012. International
represents 27% of our total revenue in the quarter and for the year we expect International to be in the 27% to 29% of
total sales. The growth we are experiencing in our International business partially offsets the decline we're seeing in our
domestic business as a result of sequestration and CRs.

We expect strong international bookings for the year and we have several large awards remaining that have
well-defined milestone past the completion. With my more than 40 years of experience in the international market, I've
learned that the timing of these binary awards is more often an art than it is a science. It's just the nature of doing
business with international customers: while a shift in the milestone of a few weeks can impact the timing award, it
doesn't change our confidence in the award occurring.
One encouraging sign that could have a positive impact on international business is the recent change in how the
government views export regulation. Transitioning oversight from certain defense-related products from the
Department of State to the Department of Commerce should shorten the timeframe in which we're able to provide
solutions to international partners. As a result over time, this should allow the U.S. industry to compete more
effectively and do business more efficiently in the highly competitive and expansive global marketplace. We also see
our DOD customers leaning forward to help more on international sales.
For many of you who have followed Raytheon over the years, you know us as a company that has historically adapted
our strategy and leveraged our technology in order to maximize value for our customers and shareholders.
Looking ahead, we continue to evolve our strategy and are building upon these successes. We're managing through the
challenges of today's environment and we remain focused on the opportunities of tomorrow. We have a proven
strategy, best-in-class capabilities, and an outstanding team to meet our customer's needs.
I'd like to thank the entire Raytheon team for helping drive these solid results and for maintaining its focus on our
customer during the time of continued challenge and change. With that, let me turn it over to Dave.
David C. Wajsgras
Okay. Thanks, Bill. And good morning, everyone. I have a few opening remarks starting with the third quarter
highlights and then we'll move on to questions. During my remarks, I will be referring to the web slides that we issued
earlier this morning.
So if everyone would please move to page three. We are pleased with the solid performance the team delivered in the
third quarter. For the quarter, our sales, EPS and operating cash flow from continuing operations, all came in higher
than the guidance we provided you back in July. EPS and adjusted EPS for the third quarter were consistent with last
year's third quarter and on a year-to-date basis are running ahead of last year's comparable period.
Adjusted operating margin was 13.7%, reflecting continued strong performance for the company and year-to-date, up
10 basis points to 13.6%.
We slightly exceeded the high end of our prior guidance on sales of $5.8 billion, down 3% compared with last year's
third quarter. On a year-to-date basis, sales were down less than 1%.
Operating cash flow from continuing operations was approximately $895 million, which also exceeded our prior
guidance due to strong collections, a portion of which was timing from Q4. And on a year-to-date basis, operating cash
flow from continuing operations is over $300 million higher than the comparable period last year. We're increasing our
full-year sales, EPS and operating cash flow guidance, which I'll address further in a few minutes along with other
updates to our 2013 outlook.
During the quarter, the company repurchased 2.9 million shares of common stock for $225 million, bringing our
year-to-date share repurchases to 10.5 million shares for $675 million. And we ended the quarter with net debt of just
over $800 million.
Turning now to page four, let me start by providing some detail on our third quarter results. Our total company
bookings for the quarter were $5.7 billion and on a year-to-date basis, were $14.6 billion. As we've mentioned on prior
calls, bookings are weighted to the latter part of the year. We continue to expect strong fourth quarter awards, driven in
large part by international opportunities. For the quarter, international was 15% of our total company bookings and on a

year-to-date basis was 23%. For the year, we expect international to be in the range of 30% to 32% of total bookings.
Notable awards in the quarter included $312 million at Missile Systems for SM-3 for the Missile Defense Agency,
$232 million for AIM-9X Sidewinder short-range air-to-air missiles for the U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force and International
customers, $222 million for Standard Missile 6 for the U.S. Navy and $177 million for Phalanx weapons systems for
the U.S. Navy and international customers.
Integrated Defense Systems booked $353 million on the Aegis weapons system for the U.S. Navy and $84 million on
an International radar contract. IIS booked $253 million to design, develop, and deliver technical training for a
commercial customer and $162 million on a contract to provide intelligent surveillance and reconnaissance support to
the U.S. Air Force. IIS also booked $145 million on domestic training programs and $85 million on foreign training
programs in support of Warfighter FOCUS activities and $87 million for a Ground Control System Program for the
U.S. Air Force.
And Space and Airborne Systems booked $271 million to develop the Next Generation Jammer for the U.S. Navy and
$170 million on the joint polar satellite system program for NASA. In addition, IIS and SAS booked $417 million and
$164 million respectively on a number of classified programs.
Okay, if you now move to page five, our sales performance in the quarter was ahead of guidance driven by strong
international performance. International sales increased approximately 6% in the quarter and were approximately 27%
of total sales. Our domestic business declined by about 6% and total company sales were down 3% in the quarter.
Looking at the businesses, each of the four either met or exceeded our expectations.
IDS had third quarter 2013 net sales of $1.6 billion in line with the same period last year. IIS net sales $1.5 billion were
down slightly from the same period last year primarily due to lower volume on classified and training programs.
Missile Systems had third quarter 2013 net sales of $1.6 billion, also down slightly on a year-over-year basis. The
change was primarily due to lower sales on U.S. Army sensor programs. And SAS had net sales of $1.6 billion, lower
than the comparable period last year primarily due to reduced volume on some of our ISR and classified programs.
Moving ahead to page six. We're pleased by the strength of our overall company margins. Our adjusted margin was
13.7%. And on a year-to-date basis, our adjusted margin was 13.6%, up 10 basis points over the comparable period in
2012. The strength in our underlying margin in the quarter was due to a combination of our broad business base,
particularly international, the timing of performance improvements, and our overall execution. Over the past several
quarters, we've provided you with updates on our cost efficiency and productivity initiatives including supply chain
optimization and the business unit consolidation. These initiatives are ongoing. The business unit consolidation efforts
remain ahead of plan and in the third quarter, we took the next step by consolidating a number of our product lines
within the new organizational structure.
The cost savings that result from these efforts help drive our competitiveness, an important factor in our recent wins.
So, looking at business margins, all were in line or better than our expectations. IDS, IIS and SAS margins were all up
in the quarter compared with the same period last year. Solid operational performance and favorable mix drove the
improvements.
At Missile, the margin was essentially in line with our expectations but lower than the same period last year, primarily
due to a change in contract mix. Overall, the company continues to perform well.
If you move to page seven, third quarter 2013 adjusted EPS was $1.60, and on a year-to-date basis, adjusted EPS was
$4.80, up 3% from the same period last year. The year-to-date increase was driven by capital deployment actions, more
specifically share repurchases.
On page eight, I'd like to briefly comment on our updated outlook for 2013. Based on our performance through the
third quarter, we are increasing our sales guidance by $100 million. We now expect full year 2013 net sales to be in the
range of between $23.6 billion and $23.8 billion. Our guidance includes impacts from sequestration, a continuing
resolution, and the recent government shutdown.

And as we've done in prior years, during the third quarter, we updated our actuarial estimates related to our pension
plans. As a result of the update, FAS/CAS pension expense for the year decreased by $31 million from $286 million to
$255 million. We increased our adjusted EPS guidance for the year by $0.10 to reflect a strong performance through
the end of the third quarter with the adjusted EPS of between $6.10 and $6.20.
You should note that we also increased our 2013 guidance for GAAP EPS to between $5.67 and $5.77, which includes
both the expected margin improvement for the year as well as the impact of the updated full year FAS/CAS pension
expense. As I mentioned earlier, we generated strong operating cash flow in the quarter. As a result, we've increased
our 2013 guidance for operating cash flow from continuing operations by $100 million and is now between $2.2 billion
and $2.4 billion.
And although not on the page, it's worth nothing that we continue to see our bookings outlook for the year at about
$23.5 billion plus or minus $500 million. This outlook remains unchanged from our prior estimates. However, given
sequestration and the shutdown, we are now biased toward the lower end of the estimate.
On page nine, we've included our guidance by business. We've increased the sales range by a $100 million for missiles,
reflecting stronger than expected performance through the first three quarters of this year. The increase in margin
guidance reflects our strong overall program execution and productivity initiatives to date again including the business
consolidation.
So if you could please move to page 10, we've provided a FAS/CAS pension adjustment matrix for 2014, the same as
we've done in prior years. Now, just to be clear, the discount rate and the actual asset returns won't be known until we
close out 2013. It is worth noting that given the current interest rate environment, we expect to see improvement to the
FAS/CAS expense in 2014 compared to 2013 and to our prior outlook for 2014.
Before we open it up for Q&A, let me summarize. The company continues to perform well in a tough and uncertain
environment. We saw solid operating performance in the quarter and exceeded the sales, EPS, and operating cash flow
guidance we provided back in July. We continue to have a strong balance sheet with net debt of just over $800 million,
which gives us considerable flexibility to operate effectively in the current environment. We are raising our sales, EPS,
and cash flow guidance for 2013. We remain well positioned with our domestic customers' priority areas and continue
to be aligned with the evolving priorities of our global customers. Our overall execution, productivity initiative, and our
focus on customer missions allow us to remain confident going forward.
With that, Bill and I will open up the call for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan. You may begin.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning, Joe.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: So, just on the bookings that you are expecting for Q4, Bill, if you wouldn't mind reminding
us of what you mentioned a few times there's some milestones that are pretty tentatized, it is an art, not a science but
what are you looking for to come through and obviously let's focus in particular on IDS.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Sounds good. As I said in my opening remarks, we do expect strong bookings for the
year, particularly international and there are several significant awards that we anticipate in the quarter. As I mentioned,
every one of them has got a milestone plan that's associated with them. They're reviewed daily or weekly depending on
the business or the program and I'm glad you mentioned more of an art than a science and so I'll take you through the
businesses because I think it's a better way to look at it and I'll start with IDS since you mentioned it. IDS makes up
about half of our expected Q4 bookings. I'll give you a range of about $4 billion or $5 billion worth of programs we're

tracking. Two-thirds of their bookings are international, really driven by a few large air and missile defense awards.
Kuwait, I would start as the first one, couple of fire units, it's currently moving through the Parliament, it's been
approved by the Ministry of Defense. And from our standpoint, everything's lined up for that to happen. They go
through a process of reviewing it once they're done with that, the paperwork would come back to the U.S. and it will be
signed and will be up and moving.
In Oman, we're currently in negotiations for a ground-based portion of the system. As you'll recall, Oman ordered
AMRAAM missiles for this system in the second quarter, and we're working through the final details with them on
that. Qatar is procuring a comprehensive missile defense system in phases with Patriot and C2 being in the first phase.
The CN was approved through congress and the LOA was delivered in August of this year. So, we're working with
them and the U.S. government. And the details of the LOA are working towards an award by the end of this year. And
then domestically, the other balance, of course, I mentioned AMDR, but we're also expecting another, let me say, $400
million to $500 million worth of domestic Missile Defense awards. So, that kind of makes up the $4 billion to $5
billion in IDS.
If we look at IIS, the fourth quarter booking should be about a $1.5 billion plus or minus. These are really driven by
about $650 million in classified awards, included in there is an international award that will announce and the balance
is really driven by training and space and engineering service programs. Missiles expects about $1.5 billion in Q4 plus
or minus, though we see bookings there for RAM, Paveway, SM and a potential TOW award. And on the domestic
side, we expect orders for Standard Missile-3 in our core programs including Phalanx, RAM, and JSOW.
And finally SAS, about $2 billion plus or minus, 30% of those being internationally primarily driven by Tactical
Airborne Radars, about 20% in classified and CRAD areas and the remainder spread across our Air Force and Navy
awards attributable to Tactical Airborne Systems ISR and communications. That should give you a pretty good handle
of what we see in front of us finishing out the year. And hopefully, we won't get any more roadblocks thrown in front
of us. The shutdown really took about a half-a-month out of everything and delayed everything, but we're moving
forward and got a good pipeline.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay. Very helpful. Thanks, Bill. I just had one quick one for Dave. IIS margins looking a
little perky and maybe that's the fruit of, it's a good word right?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: it does look perky. I haven't got that one before.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Yeah. Well, you popped your head over the nine – up over the nine level there, so is this some
sustainable or is it recovery of some of your restructuring costs because of course that's where most of the restructuring
took place. How should we think about that?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yeah. So, Lynn Dugle continues to do an excellent job managing that business and the
consolidation. The third quarter margins were driven by improved program efficiencies across the business and that
supported the increase in the full year margin guidance. We do see the margins in Q4, not quite as perky, they moderate
somewhat and this is primarily due to the timing of the performance improvement that we had previously expected in
the fourth quarter, which shifted into the third essentially, and that was specifically in the area of the domestic training
programs. Also, we begin to ramp up and transition on a new commercial training program that I referred to at around
$160 million or so in the third quarter.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay. Very helpful. Thank you.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Okay. Sure, Joe.

<A - William H. Swanson>: Thank you.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Just a brief sort of high level question, it's that time of year that business planning processes
come together and I know you're not giving 2014 guidance until next quarter, but if you were to think in sort of broad
brush strokes about how you're looking at next year in whatever framework, whether it's existing versus new business,
domestic versus international, any color you could kind of provide us for how you're thinking about the world? I realize
it's tough to have a crystal ball in this environment, but any color you can provide us on how you're thinking about next
year would be helpful.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah. Let me fly around about 40,000 feet and Dave's given me the sign to say I should
be at 50,000 feet. So, I'll go to 50,000 feet. We're not on virtual, you can see him sitting next to me here, but anyway it's
really hard to look at it. I mean, I would tell you we're planning for sequestration to continue. I mean that's the
environment we're in. I'd like to think that this budget process is not working. I've grown up in an industry where we
had appropriations bill. There was a sequence to what we were doing, you could see it, you could plan on it.
Today, we operate under CRs. We have another one that goes to January 15. We have a House and Senate committee
that are reviewing. Hopefully they'll take a stab at revenue and entitlement and if successful could lead to maybe a
postponement, maybe a gap in sequestration till people figure it out.
But with all of that going on and the turmoil and planning for the BCA to continue, I would tell you that 2014 feels a
lot like 2013. I don't know how else to describe it. Revenue should be down just slightly, driven by domestic. I think
the margins should continue to be strong and the company is expected to have some strong cash generation. That's
about 50,000 feet, and I can put some, lot of qualifiers on that, that you all know, but that's kind of how it feels now,
and we'll see what comes out of Congress, and hopefully we can get ourselves back to some stability, and really
focusing on doing even more for our customers and our shareholders.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Bill, when do you think we actually get a 2015 budget request? Is that going to be delayed in
your view?
<A - William H. Swanson>: It's really hard to say, I would tell you from what I understand, our customers are
planning two budgets. Which one gets submitted, I can't tell you, that's a product of somebody else making that
decision. I just know that American industry really likes to have some finality in what we do, and if you give us a
number, we know how to put our strategies and plans in place to make that happen. So I'd say right now it's a jump ball
and we've got two budgets going in till we figure out what's going on and we're all trying to make sure that this
committee really does the hard, hard job of getting to a decision here.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: All right. Great. Thanks.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Okay.

Your next question is from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo. You may begin.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Can you talk a little bit more about the buyback? Just if I look at your updated guidance,
you're now towards the higher end of the share count, and would have expected to see, you have to increase the pace to
get the shares down for the year. So how are you just thinking about buyback and why you might be doing a little bit
less this year than we talked last quarter?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Okay. So, I appreciate the question. We were in line from a dollar standpoint in Q3 with
Q2 and also Q1. We made a conscious decision to maintain that level of repurchases as the prior two quarters. With

that said, we continue to see the repurchase plan consistent with what I said on the last earnings call. So, more
specifically, we expect our share repurchases in the back half of this year in dollar terms to be modestly higher than the
first half. So, let me be clear. The fourth quarter at this stage, the planning assumption is that we would be, in dollar
terms, well in excess of where we were in Q3. So I hope that helps.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: That does help. And Bill, if I can ask you a question. Just looking at the Turkey decision and
price sounds like that was a big issue, can you just talk about whether price is becoming a bigger driver in some of
these international discussions?
<A - William H. Swanson>: I think, clearly, Turkey as a country made a decision and they decided to do it based on
price. In my experience in price, when you buy that way, you don't get all the capabilities you want. And so, they're
going to have to deal with that. The second part of it is you have to integrate it into NATO which is going to be difficult
at best and will not happen as quick as people want it to happen.
From our standpoint, they've started the negotiation process, we'll see what happens. But if Turkey runs into problems,
we remain positioned and stand ready to help them with Patriot. To get to your overall question, clearly, I'm an
engineer by training and a technologist. I'd like to think of myself that way and people when they look at U.S. systems,
they are still state-of-the-art. What people don't realize is that lifecycle costs really run into these decisions and if you
don't take that into account, you're going to be really sorry with some stuff you bought and we know of systems around
the world produced by other countries that aren't working and can't be manned and you have to almost learn that lesson
the hard way. So, we'll see what happens there.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Thank you.

Your next question will comes from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein. You may begin.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: I'd like to follow on that because we've seen a few things going on in the Middle East.
There's been the Turkey decision. We've seen Prince Bandar make some rather provocative statements about looking
outside of the U.S. relationship to acquire defense systems. UAE is looking at Eurofighter. Are you seeing any shifts in
the Middle East in terms of how people are thinking of the relationship with the U.S.? I think certainly we provide the
highest quality systems, but it does seem that there is at least a lot of rhetoric today about looking elsewhere.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, I know it's a great question, Doug, and something I always think about, but I have
a term we use here that it's the area under the curve, so if you draw that over time that curve and the area under it,
Raytheon has a longstanding, strong enduring relationships, not just in the Mideast, but around the world and due to our
international experience, we continue to operate in regions, especially the Mideast since you brought that up, over
many decades and there's ebbs and flows in that relationship among governments, but I have always felt when I've
looked at it, our customers stay with us because they recognize that we consistently deliver value and equipment to
them to be able to handle the threat environment that they're in. So, you can take any slice of that curve over time and
probably find something that isn't going well, but the area under the curve is one that really matters and we still get a
phone call now and then or at least I do that says, would you go do something and we'll go off and start based on a
handshake and I think that's what it's all about, but clearly there's geopolitical things happening today that are getting
everybody's attention and we've got to work our way through that and I'm hopeful that'll happen.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Well, and then separately, walking around AUSA this week, it felt somewhat like a wake
frankly. The Army budget is under a great deal of pressure and when you think about Raytheon's exposure to the army.
How do you see your major programs in terms of the level of risk under potentially a bearish scenario as opposed to an

opportunity under a more bullish scenario should we happen to see that?
<A - William H. Swanson>: I think right now, you probably said it right. The Army is under the most pressure. They
have the largest head count of any of the services and the hard choices are strategically how do you handle the future?
Do you do it with a smaller service? Do you do it that's more mobile, more light, and how do you think through that?
And when you come from very high numbers to a smaller number, it really makes it hard for them to do that. Plus
planning, do they have sequester, don't they have sequester? That's really tough on them. We're trying to work with
them in any way we can, but Dave and I would both tell you that from our standpoint planning for sequester, we know
exactly in our minds what the army will be doing and that's in our forecast as we look at things and we were not centric
around any one service and from that standpoint we weather the storm and why our portfolio is probably in better shape
than others.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: But do you see, when you look at your army exposure today, and you look out the next
couple years, is this something where you see an area of continuing downward pressure, in other words, perhaps one of
the weaker areas across the portfolio as a company?
<A - William H. Swanson>: No, no, I don't, because we're not in the platform business or vehicle business or the areas
where the army is having to make those tough calls. If you look at Air and Missile Defense, clearly they've done the
Patriot upgrades. Just this month, we announced another Patriot order from the Army. They're going to protect their
core systems, they're going to fund them, they're going to make their upgrades and we'll do it that way. And then,
eventually what has to happen, which is our strength is you've got to refresh and I've always said this is a speed bump.
You slow down going into it. You go over the top, come down, and then you speed up as quick as you can. And from
our standpoint, we're making sure our technology and our capabilities are lined up for the army of the future, not the
army of the past.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Okay. Thank you.

The next question will come from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. You may begin.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Yeah. Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Hello, George.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Dave I want to push back a little bit on your comment that the book-to-bill would be close
to one. I mean, what it implies is that fourth quarter orders got to be up nearly 50% from the third quarter. For
perspective, Q4, 2012 bookings were 8% above Q3 and Q4 2011 was only 3% above Q3. So, what makes this year so
much different that you'd be up 50% relative to Q3 versus the prior two years?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: So, George, you're free to pushback. Okay, that's part one. Part two. George, I wouldn't
expect anything less. Let me start by stating the obvious that the bookings are always lumpy. They have been in the
past, they will be going forward. From a cadence standpoint for this year, the bookings profile hasn't changed
meaningfully from what we were seeing back in April. So, I think that's an important data point. There has been some
shifts. For example, Bill mentioned some of our opportunities in the Middle East. The Kuwait Patriot opportunity,
which we now see being awarded in Q4 did shift from what we had earlier anticipated.
With that said, I'm not going to repeat all the details that Bill just went through, I believe with a question earlier from
Joe Nadol. But, frankly if we weren't confident with our fourth quarter bookings outlook, we wouldn't suggest that as
the estimates. I also said during my formal remarks earlier George that we're – we are now bias toward the lower end of
the range that we've been suggesting for a while now and that's principally due to a couple of things shifting out as well
as the government shutdown. So, we see some of the process on a few smaller FMS potentials potentially moving in to
early next year.

<Q - George D. Shapiro>: But just Dave I would think and I don't remember exactly that each of the last couple of
years, there are always moving shifts, you're suggesting the shifts are greater this year than what we've seen in the past?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Well. Yeah, they have been. We are now in sequestration. So, there has been some
movement to the right, maybe more so than prior years. You'll also recall that last year's third quarter was nothing short
of a banner quarter for the company. We were awarded some very large programs particularly in our missiles business.
So, the comp to last year is also quite difficult. George, Bill went through a number of opportunities earlier, somewhere
in the neighborhood of, I don't know $8 billion to $10 billion of opportunity, we have thousands of programs. He just
went through the more significant ones from a dollar standpoint. Again we're quite confident in where we sit today and
as we look into 2014.

Your next question will come from the line of Robert Stallard from Royal Bank of Canada. You may begin.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning, Robert.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Bill, on the Next Generation Jammer and the AMDR, do you have any clarity on when these
things might come off protest and when the protest might be resolved?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, there is a pretty standard – let me say, if you go by the standard dates that's usually
about 100 days, which Next Generation Jammer would be at the end of this month and AMDR would be in January.
And so it's probably the best way for me to peg it for you. And they're pretty good at holding their timelines unless an
issue pops up that needs to be clarified.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Okay. And normally do these constant protests have an impact on the customer relationship?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, yeah, they do. I mean, you got to be very careful when you protest that if you
impugn your customer during the protest by inferring they don't know what they're doing, that's probably not something
I'd recommend in the process. If it's done on purely business reasons or on the process and you don't impugn
somebody, you're probably okay, but somehow sometimes protests get personal or emotional and you try and stay away
from that if that helps.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Okay. And, Dave, just a quick one to you. On the pension, I was wondering if you could give
us an update on what your returns are year-to-date and also what you're using as your interest rate calculation at this
point.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Sure. As of yesterday, because I was thinking ahead and I was quite certain I'd get this
question. The returns are in excess of 11% from the Pentium plan assets. So, the team is doing a good job there. From
an interest rate standpoint, today, we're at – from a discount rate standpoint, today we're at 4.15%. As we go forward,
that is reset on the last day of the year through a process we use with our outside actuaries essentially modeling a
hypothetical bond portfolio. Given everything that we're seeing, if we were to set it today, it would be roughly 50 to 75
basis points higher. But again, I can't suggest that's where it's going to be on 12/31, we just have to wait and close out
the year.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Thanks so much.

Your next question will come from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse. You may begin.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Hey, good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning, Rob.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Bill, I wanted to go out a little longer term on International Missile Defense and get a
sense of your visibility into your future opportunities once we get through these three Mideast contracts that you
mentioned earlier?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah. I think if you look at Missile Defense, it's one of the key areas going forward. The
other part of Missile Defense is it never stands still. From my standpoint, I've been doing this a long time. When you
realize you need Missile Defense, you put it in. Then you go through the training to get your troops up to speed, but the
threat keeps evolving and changing and with that, most of our systems are open architecture, or they're designed in a
way that they are software upgradable. But also the interceptors have to change in their ability to be able to
discriminate against targets that might have different spoofing mechanisms to try and overcome the systems that exist.
So it's a process that keeps on going and if you look at it, we've gone through iterations of Patriot to make it the most
advanced in the world and of course Standard Missile-3 is doing that, our "Tippy Two" radars are doing that. So you
have a nice customer base. But also other countries realize that they have to be able to prepare themselves for future
missile defense. So to me it's a nice market. It's a nice community of customers that realize that they've got to do this
and they make the long-term commitments to keep it ongoing, if that helps.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Would you say that there is a natural growth rate in the business that you use as a rule of
thumb or a sustainment level for the upgrades that we could think about?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, you probably could, it's – we, our term here that we use is P3I Pre Planned Product
Improvements and it's one of the things that our engineers and program leaders really always work on is that, okay,
we're here today, where do we have to be tomorrow and where do we have to be beyond that. And then our engineering
leaders look at our gaps to figure out what we have to do, I mean it's why we made a decision 10 years ago on GaN to
be able to get higher efficiency to have our systems consume less power, be able to manage the bandwidth and be able
to discriminate in a way that no one else can do and we're constantly pushing the envelope today and tomorrow and
well into the future.
So, we look at it as a way and it's an avenue that provides us a market entry point for our new technology once we've
got the reliability and everything worked out and – oh, by the way, these new technologies help reduce the cost or
provide better affordability, but in my world, what I really enjoy is the systems are more reliable. They take less
maintenance, less life cycle cost, fewer spares. And so, customers really want to upgrade. It's much like – if you think
about the server marketplace that people are constantly upgrading servers and they do that in a way they get more
capability, more memory at a less price. They consume less energy. So, you want to upgrade because you can reduce
your overall cost going forward while handling an advanced threat into the future, if that helps.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: It does. And I just have a quick one for Dave. Dave, you mentioned earlier when you
started your prepared remarks that you generally across the board outperformed your guidance for the quarter. But,
were there any specific areas of weakness that were maybe unexpected embedded in there? And are these – could you
speak to any and is there something that could carry into the fourth quarter?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Candidly, there is nothing that comes to mind that was a surprise from a downside or
challenge standpoint. The businesses across the board performed well. Missiles was down a little bit. That was
primarily driven by the run-out of a international production program. The follow-on contract that is ramping up in Q4.
Cash across the board was strong. Bookings were inside of our expectations on Q3. So, frankly, I didn't see any
surprises that give me pause as we move ahead in the fourth quarter.

<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Would that also apply to SAS just where the sales growth was, I guess, the most negative.
And I guess there is a lot of classified in there. But anything there?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: No. You'll recall back in April, when we sized up the impact of sequestration on some of
the quick turn business, some of our services and classified business for this year, we had anticipated essentially what
played out at SAS.

Your next question will come from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies. Please begin.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Oh, my goodness.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Howard.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: It sounds so funny when I tell you, Bill, there is still seven games in the series and not one.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Okay.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Howard, we're not playing the Yankees. Come on now.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Well, there is one other point I'd make you know. I was at NBAA, and I didn't' see a
Raytheon booth anymore. I want you first to talk for a moment about...
<A - William H. Swanson>: I thought it was a new analyst when I heard Rubel. But now I know the old one. So, go
ahead, Howard.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: So there really is two things. One on strategic for a moment, I mean, you've been very
deliberate in using R&D to go after market share that way, but are you – is there anything that's changed in this
environment? You talk about small contractors possibly struggling a bit. Do they need your help financially as well as
operationally?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, Howard, it's – as a company, you've heard me talk about the supply base and
especially minority or small owned business, they are the heartbeat of this country and for some of them, they're really
key to what we do, so we work with them and try and help them in any way. We send Six Sigma teams in to some of
our suppliers to help them be more competitive; that's good for us and it's good for them. We send people in to help on
technical issues and financially if they're in trouble, we'll sit down and work with them to figure out what we can do to
be able to get through this.
I mean, the shutdown was really hard, I mean, we spent time every day trying to figure out how to make sure that
people were getting paid, how did we move work around, I mean, one of the beauties in our company is with our
common systems and processes we were able to do things and it identifies areas for us real quick, but it is an area that
as a person that's been in this industry my whole career, I worry what we're doing to that end of the business as a
country.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: And then maybe just talk about the fourth quarter for a moment, it's very unusual for IDS to
be down versus the third quarter both in terms of profitability and – or profits and profitability and volumes and I'm
sure some of it is attributable to a push out of international business, but could you talk a little bit more, Dave, about
some of the comparisons there and why that's evolved that way?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Sure. Let me talk about sales first and then I'll follow-up with the margin profile. So, sales
for IDS was up 3.3% year-to-date, but it did moderate as you noted in Q3 and is down in Q4, primarily driven by shifts
to the right with some of our domestic awards including Space Fence, which is now anticipated early in 2014 as well as

a naval radar program awarded in the last week of Q3. And I noted earlier with one of your colleagues that the Kuwait
Patriot program is now expected in the fourth quarter.
So, from a margin standpoint that business IDS continued strong performance in the third quarter again driven by
favorable international air and missile defense contract mix as well as some performance improvement that we had
previously or earlier expected in the fourth quarter. You'll note here that we did raise the full year margin guidance by
about 20 basis points.
Now, looking more specifically at the fourth quarter, margins are impacted by the timing of EAC adjustments as well
as mix. Specifically, recall on the last call, Howard, on the last earnings call, we noted that the cadence of the
performance improvements in this business was weighted to] the first half of the year. So, we also saw a continued
strength from that in the third quarter. Now, that coupled with a change in contract mix does impact and lower the
margins that we now expect in the fourth quarter.
And just lastly and as you're aware, we typically see lower margins at the inception of some programs, which can and
do in a lot of cases improve over time as we retire risk and implement operating efficiencies.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Yeah, I get that. I mean, that's a fairly substantial – I mean they're either was fairly
substantial improvement or this is a more normal level until you see some of this other business come home.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: No, I would say that don't assume that the fourth quarter becomes the run rate for next
year. I think you probably should look at a trailing 12 month average and expect a ramp up on the bookings in the
fourth quarter to take place, I would say essentially in Q2, Q3 and Q4 of next year.

Operator
Thank you. That question will come from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi. Please begin.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Hey, good morning everyone. Bill, a quick question for you and then one for David as well.
Bill, you mentioned that there was some change in the regulatory environment that moves things from State over to
Commerce. Is this the case that it's opening up new markets for you and if so, what are the size of those markets? Or
does this just give you better competitive standing out there in the marketplace? And then, Dave, I think Bill mentioned
that cash flow would be "robust" next year. But if you could offer up some building blocks for us to get a sense of
relative to this year what are going to be the positives, what are going to be the negatives as we look at cash flow next
year?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Sure. Yeah, let me take the cash flow question. So, as we have done in the past, we
continue to be very effective with respect to our overall cash cycle from a business standpoint. It's not just the finance
group, it's the overall company. We continue to see healthy cash conversion from an earnings perspective and from a
process perspective. We are in the process of setting up milestones and performance payments to the – with respect to
the awards that we see in Q4, and in the first half of next year, that should be healthy.
We're looking at continued improvement from an overall collections standpoint. I would say those are really the drivers
as we move into next year. Internationally and more specifically, we do see the potential and the likelihood of some
advances with respect to our international business. It's traditionally the way international business is affected. So I
think taken together, Bill and I and Tom Kennedy are in full agreement that we're continuing to see healthy cash flow

as we move into 2014.
<A - William H. Swanson>: And, thanks, Dave, I'll finish up here with your question on international. On some items
when they move from State over to Commerce, there are items that allow the process to move a lot quicker. We sell in
82 countries around the world. We've sold to over 115 I think roughly over time, but we have 82 active. I don't really
see it opening up to more countries. I just see it being more efficient for us that we can be better at it, but I think what's
more important that I mentioned in the last part of that is that we see our DOG customer leaning forward for us. If you
look at the Dep. Sec. Def. Dr. Carter was over in India speaking to them about what we can do to be, to open it up,
make it easier for both countries to do business; that's one example.
The other one is on the 15th of this month. Two CMs went over on [ph] JSAO (1:01:04), notified the Congress, I didn't
mention those in my remarks because they'll be early 2014 items. That'll be about $1 billion to $2 billion worth of that
particular product line and that's one where our customers are helping us because if you think about it, by having those
in our factories, those help reduce the overheads, keep the lines hot and actually make the product more affordable for
our domestic customer, so if there is one thing I'm really encouraged about and I feel good about is how we both are
looking at why International is good for us domestically as well as internationally. So, I'm encouraged by the process.
I'm – with everything being thrown at us, it's – I put that on the real positive side.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.
