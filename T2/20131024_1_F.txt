Finally, today's presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford's future
performance. Actual results could differ materially from those suggested by our comments here. The most significant
factors that could affect future results are summarized at the end of this presentation. These risk factors and other key
financial information are detailed in our SEC filings, including our annual, quarterly and current reports to the SEC.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Ford Credit CFO, Michael Seneski. Michael?
Michael L. Seneski
Thanks, Steve. Consistent with prior quarters, today's presentation will cover Ford Credit's profit and credit loss
performance, Ford Credit funding and liquidity highlights, automotive cash, debt and liquidity, and then we'll wrap
things up with a summary of the quarter.
Let's turn to Ford Credit's operating highlights on Slide 1. Ford Credit remains key to Ford's global growth strategy,
providing world-class dealer and customer financial services, maintaining a strong balance sheet and producing solid
profits and distributions. Ford Credit had another strong quarter with pre-tax profit of $427 million and net income of
$272 million. Managed receivables were $99 billion at the end of the third quarter, up $8 billion from year-end 2012.
The growth was driven primarily by increases in leasing in the North America segment and finance receivables in all
segments. Third quarter charge-offs were $47 million, up $12 million from the prior year. The third quarter
loss-to-receivables ratio was 19 basis points, up 2 basis points from a year ago and well below our 10-year average of
67 basis points.
At September 30, the allowance for credit losses or reserve was $368 million or 37 basis points of receivables.
Managed leverage was 8.2 to 1 at September 30, 2013, compared with 8.3 to 1 at December 31. At the end of the third
quarter, our equity was $10 billion.
Slide 2 explains the $34 million increase in third quarter pre-tax results, compared with a year ago. The increase is
more than explained by higher volume in North America. The drivers of higher volume were an increase in leasing,
reflecting changes in Ford's marketing programs, as well as higher non-consumer finance receivables due to higher
dealer stocks.
As shown in the memo, our pre-tax results were $27 million lower than the second quarter. For the full year, Ford
Credit continues to expect pre-tax profits of about equal to 2012. But we now expect year-end managed receivables of
about $100 billion, which was within our prior range of $97 billion to $102 billion, and distributions of about $400
million, up from $200 million previously planned, reflecting a fourth quarter reduction in Ford Credit's tax liability.
Slide 3 shows our quarterly trends of charge-offs, loss-to-receivables ratio and credit loss reserve. Our third quarter
credit losses continued to be near historic lows. Year-over-year charge-offs were up $12 million primarily reflecting
higher severity and higher losses as the lease portfolio grows in North America, and higher losses in international.
Quarter-over-quarter charge-offs were up $15 million, reflecting higher default volumes and lower recoveries in the
North America.
The loss-to-receivables ratio is up 2 basis points compared with the same period a year ago. The credit loss reserve was
$368 million, down $48 million from a year ago, and down $8 million from the second quarter, reflecting the
continuation of historically low losses.
Slide 4 shows the primary drivers of credit losses in the U.S. retail and lease business, which comprises 72% of our
worldwide consumer portfolio. Over 60-day delinquencies were down 2 basis points from the same period a year ago,
and up 3 basis points from the prior quarter. Repossessions in the third quarter were 8,000 units or 1.24% of average
accounts outstanding, down 12 basis points from the same period a year ago.
Severity was $7,500 in the third quarter, up$600 from the same period a year ago, primarily reflecting lower auction
values and earlier time to repossession as we continue to grow our portfolio. Year-over-year increases in charge-offs
and LTR primarily reflect higher severity and higher losses as our lease portfolio grows while quarter-over-quarter

increases primarily reflect higher default volumes and lower recoveries.
Slide five shows the U.S. Ford and Lincoln lease residual performance. Lease return volumes in the third quarter were
13,000 units higher than the same period last year, primarily reflecting higher lease placements in 2011 compared with
prior years. The third quarter lease return rate was 69%, up 8 percentage points compared with the same period last
year, reflecting lower auction values.
In the third quarter, our 36-month average auction value decreased about $700 from the prior year, while our 24-month
auction – average auction value was about equal to the prior year. Both our 24-month and 36-month average auction
values increased about $450 from the second quarter. Our worldwide net investment in operating leases was $18.8
billion at the end of the third quarter, up $4.1 billion from year end 2012.
With that, I'll turn it over to Neil.
Neil M. Schloss
Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I will start first on slide six, as further evidence of our continued progress
on the One Ford plan, in September S&P upgraded the ratings of Ford and Ford Credit to investment grade. We are
now rated investment grade with a stable outlook by four major rating agencies. We are on track to achieve our 2013
funding plans. We issued about $5 billion of public term funding during the third quarter and an additional $2 billion so
far in October. We have completed about $20 billion of public term funding year-to-date and we ended the quarter with
$33 billion of committed capacity.
Earlier this month, we established a new two-year syndicated committed asset-backed liquidity facility together with
the growth in our private asset-backed capacity will replace the capacity supporting our FCAR asset-backed
commercial paper program in 2014.
Present capacity for this new facility is $2 billion with an expectation that it will grow to $4 billion by the second
quarter of 2014. Our funding strategy remains focused on diversification and we plan to continue accessing a variety of
markets, channels, and investors. We remain focused on maintaining a strong investment grade balance sheet.
Slide 7 shows the trends in our funding for our managed receivables. At the end of the third quarter, managed
receivables were about $99 billion. We ended the quarter with about $11 billion in cash and securitized funding was
43% of managed receivables, down from 48% at yearend 2012. We project yearend managed receivables of about $100
billion and securitized funding as a percent of managed receivables at 44% to 46%, both within our prior guidance. We
expect this percentage to continue to decline over time.
As discussed on the previous slide, we plan to transition away from our FCAR program early next year. Our plan is to
gradually reduce our outstanding FCAR commercial paper balance to approximately $3 billion at yearend and complete
wind down of FCAR by the second quarter of 2014. No new FCAR commercial paper will be issued after yearend
2013.
Slide 8 shows our 2013 global public term funding plan for Ford Credit, excluding our short-term programs. We have
completed $20 billion of public term funding in the U.S., Canada, and Europe and this does not include our U.S. lease
asset-backed transaction from earlier this week that settles the middle of next week. This will bring our year-to-date
total to $21 billion. We project full year global public term funding in the range of $21 billion to $25 billion, consisting
of $9 billion to $11 billion of unsecured debt and $12 billion to $14 billion of public securitizations.
Turning to slide nine, our liquidity remains strong at $22.6 billion, down slightly from last quarter. Ford Credit source
of liquidity includes cash, unsecured credit facilities, FCAR asset-backed commercial paper lines and other
asset-backed bank capacity. Going forward, the new syndicated asset-backed liquidity facility will be reflected in the
liquidity section.
As of September 30, we had $43.6 billion of cash and committed liquidity sources, up $1.3 billion from prior quarter.
Utilization of our liquidity totaled $19.9 billion and we ended the quarter with gross liquidity of $23.7 billion. Capacity

in excess of eligible receivables was $1.1 billion. We are focused on maintaining liquidity to meet our business and
funding requirements through economic cycles.
Slide 10 summarizes our automotive sector cash and debt position at the end of the third quarter. We ended the quarter
with automotive gross cash of $26.1 billion, an increase of $400 million from the end of the second quarter.
Automotive debt at the end of the quarter was $15.8 billion, equal to second quarter. We ended the quarter with net
cash of $10.3 billion and automotive liquidity of $37.5 billion; this is in addition to the Ford Credit liquidity I
mentioned on the prior slide.
Now, let's close with the summary of the third quarter. The company earned a record third quarter operating profit of
$2.6 billion, our 17th consecutive profitable quarter. Automotive operating-related cash flow was also a third quarter
record. The total company pre-tax was driven by best ever third quarter results for automotive sector. This reflects
continued strong results in North America and a combined profit for the regions outside of North America for the first
time since second quarter of 2011. Within the results, Asia Pacific earned a record third quarter profit. South America
was profitable and Europe substantially reduced its loss compared to last year and the second quarter. We ended the
quarter with automotive net cash of $10 billion and liquidity of over $37 billion.
Ford Credit had another solid quarter with pre-tax profit of $427 million. Managed receivables continue to grow
reaching $99 billion at the end of the third quarter, up $8 billion from yearend 2012.
The third quarter loss-to-receivable ratio was 19 basis points, up 2 basis points from a year ago, and continues at
historic lows. Year-to-date, Ford Credit has completed $20 billion of public term funding and we are on track to
complete our full-year funding plan and we also ended the quarter with $22 billion of liquidity.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Steve to begin the Q&A session.
Operator
Thank you, Neil. With that, we will start the Q&A session at this point. Denise, may we have the first call, please?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Jacoby with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: Hi, guys, good numbers. Couple of quick ones. Just around the government shutdown, I know
there was a little talk about that on the earnings call, but can you give us a framework for obviously it looks like it may
have impacted October sales. I'm just trying to get a flavor for when you talk about an impact on your sales from the
government shutdown, how much of that is kind of on the commercial side versus, say, retail?
And my second question is just related to Ford Motor Credit. There is just – you guys haven't been very, very
aggressive from everything I've seen in some of the trade rags about leasing, but it looks like some of your competitors
out there are becoming more aggressive on some of the lease terms that they're offering. Are you seeing that, where
some of your competitors are actually doing that; where they're being more aggressive in extending leases further out,
perhaps subsidizing some of those? Maybe you can just comment on bigger picture trends in leasing now that it's
becoming a bigger part of the market.
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Okay. Maybe – it's Stuart here – maybe I'll take the first part, and then ask Mike Seneski
to comment on the second part.
So, in terms of the U.S. industry, as you know September was a little weaker and that was probably due to the way that
the Labor Day holiday fell. So, if you looked at August and September combined, it wasn't so much of a difference. We
haven't released any October sales data yet and obviously we'll be doing that once we close the quarter; but, we have

seen some continuation in a weaker industry, although our products are continuing to perform well in the market and
we'll see how that changes.
I don't have any specifics to report in terms of the mix between retail and the commercial business, and of course we
can speculate that the situation in Washington may have played a part in that situation. And obviously, it's not resolved
and we'll be revisiting this subject in a few months' time and it would be clearly better for all if that were behind us.
Mike, can you comment on the leasing?
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Yeah. Overall, if we look at the overall industry for leasing, it's up about 3 points
year-over-year. We're up as well, but not quite that amount. We know that leasing is a great tool and we think it results
in greater customer loyalty and a quicker trade cycle. So, as we look about our growth, we want to make sure that that
growth is prudent. So, we actually go to market with Ford using what we call a One Ford lease strategy and that tries to
set some guidelines across a number of factors: geographies, vehicles, trends, terms, payment ratios, a whole bunch of
different things. So, we are absolutely focused on growth, but we're going to do it in the right way.
If you look on slide five, it actually shows our lease return volume. You can see that two-thirds of it is primarily in the
24-month bucket, versus maybe 36-month bucket or longer. We're going to decide, along with Ford, what the
appropriate mix is going forward and again we're going to try and stay within some guidelines to make sure that our
growth and leasing is prudent.
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: Are you guys offering just like six-year leases like some of your competitors are doing out
there?
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: No, almost all of our leases are in the 24-month, 36-month, 39-month bucket. In Canada,
we go up to about 48-months. And like I said, we'll evaluate with Ford the right way to go to market. And again, our
goal is focused on trade cycle and trying to drive customers back into new Ford cars and trucks and we've been very
successful with that.
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: Okay. If I could just sneak one last one in here for Neil. FCAR program has been around for a
long, long, long time and you may have covered this a little bit earlier, apologies, but can you just give us a little bit of
a framework for why the transition and how the cost of funding is impacted by that? I mean, obviously it sounds like
what you're doing is going to save some money over time, but can you just give us a little bit of a backdrop around
that?
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Yeah Brian, this is Neil and I think from the standpoint you're right, this was created in like the
mid-1990s, so it's been around an awfully long, long time. And, it has gotten to the point where there's been a lot more
efficiencies being created for a similar type of facilities and programs that as you said, are at a lower cost. And I think
what accelerates that is obviously the change in regulation that is actually impacting the bank providers of the back
stock. So, it continues to evolve. The new facility becomes, although it's not a direct replacement from a standpoint of
facility to facility, but it does provide a much more efficient way to fund the business.
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Hey, thanks everybody. First question is, the lending community still seems pretty excited about
subprime, given its larger size and in the improved performance since the downturn. We're hearing anecdotes that
there's a new era of subprime auto lending and then we could take this FICO category to way, way above previous
pre-crisis peaks as a percentage of the new car market. Curious if you share this view and do you have any concerns
whatsoever about auto credit getting a bit too easy here, that's more of a market question for you.

Page 6 of 11
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Well, Adam, as you know we're extraordinarily consistent in the way we go to market,
talking about overall subprime in total. Yeah, we have seen growth. Interestingly it's still not at the levels of where it
was pre-crisis. And interestingly when you look at it broken down between new and used, we've actually seen the
percent of subprime, and I'm calling that kind of less than 620 FICO, to be pretty stable as a percent of the new buyers
over, kind of call it, the last year where we have seen the dramatic increase is really on the used side of the coin.
That said, our goal is to make sure that we are actively serving our customers as best as possible. As we said before, we
try to finance about three out of every four subprime customers who buy a Ford vehicle. And we've been pretty
consistent in our approach of doing that. I can't comment on the rest of the market, but obviously we're going to be as
competitive as we can to help us press forward in Ford sales.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Okay. Can you put some data on what you just said there in terms of, you said interestingly you
haven't seen subprime back at pre-crisis levels, at sub-620 FICO. Can you say what percentage of your new car loans
are to that category today versus the previous peak?
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: I won't comment for us, but if you look at the overall industry, I would say it's close to
between 9% and 10% of the new car buyers are subprime.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: And versus, do you know where the same industry stat went because there's so many different
ways to define that theme, where that was pre-crisis?
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: No, if you talk to Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, our Chief Economist, what they try to do is say
how many subprime buyers were in the market pre-crisis...
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Yep.
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: ...and at the latest data when you look at August and September, she's saying that we're still
about 100,000 below on an annualized peak of the number of subprime buyers in the market.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Thank you for that. Next question, we understand that the CFPB has sent letters to the auto
captives. There have been several articles written about this in the press and including the automotive press. Can you
confirm has your captive received any communication from the CFPB, and if so, what's the message?
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Adam, we always talk to regulators as a usual part of our business and we don't comment
on those conversations.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Okay. So you...
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: I will say because I think it's important. We are committed to compliance; we've built that
in our corporate culture. Remember our whole focus is on our dealers and our customers and building that virtual circle
of loyalty; so our whole goal around this is customers that come back. I'm very confident in our procedures but we're
not going to comment on the CFPB.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: So to summarize your answer, you always have dialogue. You are not flagging any extra level of
communication from the CFPB?
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: I'm going say we're not commenting on that.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Got it. All right. That's clear. Last question, new competition. We're hearing about nonbank
lending becoming a more aggressive component and some of your dealers are complaining or perhaps mentioning that
they're losing some of the captive business to, say, credit unions or some of these other actors out there particularly in
subprime as they're trying to put more money to work because their deposits are growing faster than their loan
portfolios. I was just curious if that's something consistent with what you've seen or heard from your dealer
community? Thank you.
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: You know the great part about being about Ford Credit is, we've been competing against all
comers for the past 56 years or so, and I draw your attention to kind of appendix five that gives you a good view of our

penetration and how that has stayed unbelievably consistent; and in fact, has grown a little bit year-over-year and in
Europe we're seeing basically all-time highs. So, the competition will come and go, the key point for our dealers is that
we're going to be there and we're going to serve them and our customers.

Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Doug Karson with Bank of America. Please proceed.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Great, thanks. I guess I have a question or two on the Ford side and then on Ford Credit. Some
of this may have been covered on the earlier call. The European loss was only $228 million, which I think was better
than the market had and certainly better than I had expected. And it looks like some of the improvement was driven by
wholesale volume being up about 5% and revenue in general being up 12%. What was driving that increase? Was it
just economy in Europe, was it some of your products that were outperforming the peer group? Just kind of trying to
figure out, I know the trend has been getting better there, but how close we are to breakeven?
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Doug, it's Stuart here. So, you are right that we had positive contribution year-on-year
actually from both sets of markets factors, both volume mix and from net pricing. Now within that, if we look at the
volume and mix [ph] PC (25:10), for the quarter the industry SAAR was flat, the absolute industry was actually up a
little bit. But more importantly within that, our market share was up. We were up from 7.8% last year to 8% this year.
And further within that, our retail market share was up by about 1.2 percentage points during the quarter compared to a
year ago, so they were all positive factors.
Also in terms of stock changes, although our stocks were actually – well stock changes which are a variance on a
variance were favorable, the impact of stock changes was little bit negative given the market mix within that. So, what
we're really seeing is some level of stabilization in the industry and that's supported by the environment in Europe. But
more importantly, our products are being well accepted, they're resulting in better market share and our strategy to
focus on retail sales is having a positive effect on our level of profitability in the market.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Great, that was helpful. Maybe just turning to the balance sheet at Ford Credit, it looks like
the unsecured funding so far this year I think you said was $9 billion. I think the range is $9 billion to $11 billion or
kind of coming up close to the end of the year and given where the markets are, are you comfortable kind of where you
are? Do you think you're going to hit the upper end of that range, if you could kind of share any ideas with us about
where you want to take the unsecured funding for the balance of the year?
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Doug, this is Neil. I think the benefit of a $9 billion to $11 billion range when you've done $9
billion is that you have a lot of flexibility to stay where you're at and/or go to $11 billion. And I think we will continue
to evaluate our different alternatives as we head through the rest of this month and into November looking forward into
our continued desire to increase our mix of unsecured relative to secured. And given the rate environment and our
spreads, there may be opportunity yet this year to hit the upper end of the range.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Okay. I still have two quick remaining questions. On the pension, I think at year end the
reading was negative at $19 billion underfunded. I think on the earlier call, it looked, you put in about $1 billion or $1.1
billion into the pension. Is there any updated reading on that? I just want to make sure I'm not missing kind of where
we are in the pension now.
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: So I think if you go to what we said in June, but also what we repeated this morning, you're
correct. We were at $18.7 billion negative for all plans globally, funded and unfunded at the end of last year, and the
$1.1 billion that was mentioned earlier in the call was just contributions made during this third quarter. Year-to-date,
we've put in $3.9 billion of cash into the funds and you'll recall some of that was the proceeds from the $2 billion,
30-year bonds we did in January.

<Q - Douglas Karson>: Right.
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: So, in total, $3.9 billion of which $2.7 billion of that has been discretionary, and so we made
progress there. We've got increases in discount rate that have been meaningful and to a lesser extent, changes or returns
on the assets. And so I think what we said is it's been improved significantly, we said that in June, we repeated that this
morning and there really wasn't a whole lot of change between second quarter end and third quarter end from a
standpoint of where we think we are relative to overall funded status.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Okay. On the pension, you used to, and maybe in the K and I just haven't tracked it down, but
there used to be a matrix where 100 basis points increase or decrease in the discount rate would equal a certain amount
of liabilities or change in liabilities. Do you have anything out there that could help us kind of measure how much a
100 basis point move...?
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Yeah. I think in the K we talked specifically about what 100 basis points will do to both U.S.
plans and non-U.S. plan liabilities, which is only half the story because obviously you have an impact on your asset
side as well from a standpoint of rate changes on your fixed income assets. When we did Ford University in March, we
actually changed the way we showed it and we actually gave the impact of a 100 basis point change on funded status,
which is clearly how we look at it and a 100 basis point change of rates on funded status is between $2 billion and $2.5
billion.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Okay.
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: And so, if you look at what discounts rates have done sort of through the third quarter, we're
probably pretty close to that and so you get the cash we put in, you get the change in funded status. Now you got to
extrapolate U.S. to global, but you can probably get pretty close to where our present status is.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Yeah. That's very helpful. And then final one on the launch of the new F-150, I know it's a
2014 event, I think it's going to be spring of 2014. Has there been any early indication of how that launch is going and
how the capacity utilization's kind of set for the plants that are going to be putting that new product through? I know it's
kind of early on yet, but it's an important launch and just thought I'd ask.
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Yeah. Well, we certainly, we don't have anything to comment. We haven't communicated
anything around a new F series so we wouldn't comment on product launches today.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Okay. All right. Well, then that's it for me. I appreciate you taking my questions.
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Thanks, Doug.

Our next question comes from Eric Selle with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: Hey, good morning. Just going through some details real fast, looking at your North American
bridge, just wondering why mix and other were negative $400 million when your pickup truck sales at least in North
America outpaced sedans, just where is that coming from?
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: So, Eric, thanks for the question. Year-on-year we've seen very strong growth in the super
segment sales. Super segment we define as Fusion, Escape, C-MAX, Focus, including our electrified products. And
what we're seeing is that, consistent with our strategy to improve our participation in that segment, although we
continue to have very strong sales in trucks, the relative growth is in the super segment and those vehicles, those
segments, come with somewhat lower margins and that's the effect that we see coming through in mix. Although our
volume and mix in total is very favorable as we improve our performance in the super segment, we will see negative
variances in that mix category.

<Q - Eric J. Selle>: Okay. And going more globally and congratulations on your move last back half, I think a lot of
people fail to remember that you guys cutting inventory in both South America and Europe was a great investment
back then, it's obviously playing out now.
But I look at South America and I'm somewhat confused. If you look at your volume and share, it seems more in line
with Hyundai's results this week versus kind of what you've seen on Fiat's volumes during the quarter. And I'm
confused, you look at IHS, South American production up 4%, your wholesale volumes are up 22%.
So, I guess my question is I know you increased share, I know your inventory destocking benefited as well but how are
you benefiting so much on mix in price in such a tough market? Is it your global product versus legacy or is it cost
containment? I mean where are you guys seeing the biggest lift there, because it's very impressive?
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Yes so maybe if you're referring to the positive net pricing we were able to achieve in the
quarter compared to last year, a piece of that is certainly related to the introduction of our global One Ford product. So,
we have the Ranger product, which has been very successful, the EcoSport and the new Focus which we've also
launched this year in South America as well as Fusion. So those products are certainly performing well and are
supporting our pricing, they are well received in the market.
The other thing of course you got going on in South America is we have the effect of both inflation and weakening
currency. So, their inflation is around the 6% level in Brazil, it's double-digits in Argentina, and it's higher still in
Venezuela. That, combined with all three of the currencies have weakened, we are pricing to offset the effects of that
inflation and currency weakening. So really you need to look at some of the pricing in conjunction with the
contribution costs which are also influenced particularly by inflation and the exchange variance. So you need to look at
them somewhat together. Although having said that, we are very pleased with the performance of our new products in
the market and we'll be continuing to rollout our One Ford product portfolio.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: Thanks a lot for that color. And then switching over to Mike and maybe general overall and I'm
kind of parroting a lot of the questions that happened before, but we're seeing all time highs in leasing and subprime
penetration for the industry. How are you offsetting that thread and retaining share? Are you getting any pressure to
increase leasing? You've grown a little bit, and are you seeing any pressure to change your residual assumptions?
We've seen quite a rise from some of your Japanese competitors and some of their residual assumptions in pricing their
leases and obviously way up-contenting their cars at the same price point, but are you guys feeling any of that pressure
through that?
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Well Eric, as you know, we work very closely with marketing and sales on how we go to
market. And, as I said, the lease market is up about 3 percentage points year-over-year, maybe a little bit more than
that. We're up as well, not quite that amount, but, we are working very closely with Ford to go to the market the best
way that we think we know how, and we're very focused on trade cycle, we're very focused on making sure that we
serve the subprime customers but not change our underwriting standards, and we've been able to do that. Our percent of
high risk customers in our portfolio is still between 5% and 6%, and we think we're getting that done, and the evidence
is on the market share that you see in our appendix five. So, we'll continue to work with our colleagues in marketing
and sales to meet the customers' needs.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: I appreciate that, and that's good to hear especially when we potentially go down market. And,
Neil, this is probably a question for you, and we did some math in the last monthly and if you look at your excess
liquidity and your debt reduction remaining and your pension remaining, it looks like you're pretty much in line with
your target right now; obviously growing with back half 2013 and 2014 operating cash flow. Meaning that every dollar
you guys generate in the back half of 2013 and all of 2014 goes into that excess liquidity bucket, and we calculate it
somewhere around $8 billion at the end of 2014. And my question to you is, what triggers – that you obviously have a
high-cost volume of excess liquidity and continue to get worse every quarter as you generate so much cash, but what is
the trigger to return cash to shareholders? I mean is it getting through this yearend and seeing the pension
underfundedness, is it continuing to contribute another quarter, seeing the end of the cycle in Europe? I mean what do
you guys need to – do you start returning that excess cash to shareholders?

<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Well, I think there's a couple of things. One Eric is although we are in pretty good shape now
when we look at the improvement we've seen in the pension plan. We still have the ways to go from a standpoint of
getting it to – the funded plans fully funded and we've got another, a little over $1 billion to hit our $5 billion total
target for funded contributions in 2013. We've also got debt at $15.8 billion with a mid-decade target of getting to $10
billion. So, there's still a significant amount of the operating cash flow that will be used to continue to improve the
balance sheet.
We also stated at your conference in New York in August that the $20 billion target for cash and $30 billion for
liquidity is sort of an average and depending on our near-term cash needs, we will obviously run higher or lower than
that. And so, in the near-term we still have debt to pay down. We've got to deal with the convert in 2014 if we choose
to as a way to reduce debt, but also to take the chance potentially to use cash. Further investments in the pension fund,
but also as earnings grow what we've said is we'll continue to grow dividends to a point where they can be sustained
and then at that point we'll start looking at other ways to return or invest more in growth.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: That's great color. That's all for me. Great quarter. You're making our jobs a lot easier today. I
appreciate it.
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Thanks, Eric.

Our next question comes from Itay Michaeli with Citigroup. Please proceed.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: Good morning guys. Just, and Neil one quick follow-up question and I apologize if it was
addressed earlier, maybe to Doug's question. But as we think about rising discount rates, could that have a positive
impact on earnings in non-U.S. plans on next year or is there something some offset there as well with the asset
allocations? If I remember correctly, I think the asset allocation shift in the non-U.S. plans in the UK and Canada may
be a bit slower than your progression in the U.S. Just wanted to – the sensitivity there with discount rates for the
non-U.S. plans?
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Yeah. I think in the 10-K we gave you both U.S. and non-U.S. plans. The asset allocation
outside the U.S. has been slower from a standpoint of moving from growth assets to fixed income, although it's clearly
in 45% to 50% range there. So it is behind, but about half of the assets would be impacted by the same discount rate
change offshore as they would be onshore. So the magnitude of what's in the K would be obviously reduced for the
non-plans as well. But that being said, we will still benefit from rising rates globally; although they've risen more in the
U.S. than they've risen in the UK.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: Terrific. And then just on the Ford Credit dividend up to $400 million, I think that was raised to
$400 million. What was paid year-to-date thus far on that?
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Just a couple of minor things, Itay, probably near about $100 million was paid and we paid
a tax payment in the first quarter as well.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: Got it. Thanks so much guys.
