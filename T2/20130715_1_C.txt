MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Hello and welcome to Citi's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat, and
Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach. Today's call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, Head of Citi Investor Relations.
[Operator Instructions]
Ms. Kendall, you may begin.
Susan Kendall
Thank you, Regina.
Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first, then John
Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation which is available to download on our website,
citigroup.com. After which we'll be happy to take questions.
Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements
which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances.
Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of
factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those including our SEC filings
including without limitation the risk factors section of our 2012 Form 10-K.

With that said, let me turn it over to Mike.
Michael L. Corbat
Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone.
Earlier today, we reported $4.2 billion for the second quarter of 2013. Excluding CVA and DVA, net income was $3.9
billion or $1.25 per share. Overall, we had strong high-quality earnings which were well balanced across our products
and geographies. As you know, generating such results consistently is one of my top priorities.
Although volatility did increase in June, we had good performance across our Securities and Banking businesses during
the quarter. Our Transaction Service business continues to be impacted by spread compression, as does our Global
Consumer Bank. However, we did grow our loans and our core businesses in a disciplined manner, particularly in the
emerging markets, and we did so while maintaining a high quality portfolio.
Our capital position strengthened and our Tier 1 common ratio increased to an estimated 10% on a Basel III basis, and
we believe our firm is well positioned for the regulatory requirements regarding capital and leverages ratios, although
they have not yet been finalized. We continue to make progress in two critical areas: reducing the drag on earnings
caused by Citi Holdings and the utilization of our deferred tax asset.
We reduced our assets in Citi Holdings by $18 billion and holdings assets now total just under $131 billion and are less
than 7% of our GAAP balance sheet. This was the largest percentage reduction in assets since 2010, and it was driven
not only by Morgan Stanley's purchase of the remaining 35% stake of the MSSB joint venture, but also by continued
opportunistic sales, including over $3 billion of U.S. mortgages, bringing the total year-to-date to nearly $6 billion.
More significantly, the loss in Holdings was reduced to less than $600 million for the quarter. In fact, Holdings actually
made a small profit when you exclude the impact of legal, rep and warranty costs. Associated legal costs will likely
remain elevated in the near term, but we took another significant step to get past legacy issues with our rep and
warranty agreement with Fannie Mae.
Regarding DTA, we again consumed a modest amount during the second quarter. $600 million of DTA was utilized,
bringing the total to $1.3 billion for the first half of the year.
We also made good progress executing the repositioning plans we announced at the end of last year. Among other
actions, just after the end of the quarter, we closed the sale of our Consumer businesses in Turkey and Romania, and
reached an agreement to sell our Consumer business in Uruguay. We're on track to realize about $900 million of
expense savings this year and $1.2 billion next year, due to these and our other repositioning actions.
Looking to the second half of the year, it's unclear whether the market volatility that emerged in the second quarter will
continue, and if so, to what degree. Low short-term rates continue to be a headwind against our deposit taking and
accrual businesses, such as Consumer Banking and Transaction Services. And in the U.S., although the housing market
is gaining strength, lower volume of mortgage refinancing will impact our Consumer business. We're already taking
steps to make sure the mortgage business is sized correctly.
While still outpacing developed markets, emerging market growth slowed, but we remain very disciplined about to
whom we'll offer credit. In light of our targeted segments, as the Brazil credit card transaction indicates, we manage our
risk profile carefully in every country we do business, and our target clients are stable, whether they be multinational
corporates or high-credit-quality consumers.
John Gerspach will now go through the deck, and then we'd be happy to take your questions. So with that, over to you,
John.

Hey, thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone.
To start, I'd like to highlight some significant items affecting our results this quarter. First, CVA and DVA were
positive $477 million pre-tax and $293 million after-tax in the second quarter, for a positive impact on EPS of $0.09.
For comparison purposes, in the second quarter of 2012, CVA and DVA were positive $219 million pre-tax or $140
million after-tax, for a positive impact of $0.05 per share.
In addition, in the second quarter of 2012, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $424 million related to the sale of minority
investments, which had a negative impact on EPS of $0.09 per share in the quarter. Adjusting for these items, we
earned $3.9 billion in the second quarter of 2013 or $1.25 per share, as compared to $1 per share on an adjusted basis in
the second quarter of 2012.
Throughout today's earnings presentation, I will be discussing our results excluding CVA and DVA, and gains or losses
on the sale of minority investments, to provide comparability to prior periods.
In addition, as we show on slide four, there are a few other items which are included in our results. First, operating
expenses in the second quarter included legal and related costs of over $800 million, compared to roughly $700 million
last quarter and nearly $500 million in the prior year. Legal and related costs in Citicorp were roughly $130 million in
the second quarter, mostly in Corporate/Other, while Citi Holdings legal expenses remained elevated at roughly $700
million, primarily reflected in the Special Asset Pool. Legal and related costs will likely continue to be elevated and
somewhat volatile as we continue to put our legacy issues behind us.
Second, repositioning costs were $75 million in the second quarter compared to $148 million in the first quarter of
2013, and $186 million in the second quarter of last year. We expect to have some level of repositioning charges each
quarter, but we are working to incorporate these actions into the daily management of our business. So going forward,
we would not expect to take large episodic charges as we did in the fourth quarter of last year.
And finally, the loan loss reserve release in the second quarter was $784 million, including a release of roughly $525
million related to the North America mortgage portfolio in Citi Holdings. The net reserve release was $650 million in
the prior quarter and $1 billion in the second quarter of last year.
On slide five, we show total Citigroup results for the quarter. Revenues of $20 billion grew 8% from last year, driven
by Securities and Banking, while operating expenses of $12.1 billion increased 1%, reflecting the higher legal and
related costs in Citi Holdings.
Credit costs of $2 billion declined 25% year-over-year. Net credit losses of $2.6 billion were down 25%, and as I noted
earlier, the loan-loss-reserve release was also lower versus last year.
We earned $3.9 billion of net income the second quarter or $1.25 per share, up from $1 per share last year on a
comparable basis, driven by revenue growth and lower net credit losses, partially offset by higher legal and related
expenses, and a lower net loan loss reserve release.
Our effective tax rate was also higher in the second quarter at 33% versus 20% last year, reflecting higher earnings in
North America, a higher effective tax rate on international operations due to the previously disclosed change in our
assertion surrounding the permanent reinvestment of earnings in certain international entities, and the resolution of
certain tax issues in the second quarter. We expect our effective tax rate for the remainder of the year to be
approximately 30%.
Citigroup end-of-period loans declined 1% year-over-year to $644 billion in the second quarter, as growth in Citicorp
was more than offset by the wind-down of Citi Holdings, and deposits grew 3% to $938 billion.
Turning to Citigroup expenses on slide six, in addition to the legal and related and the repositioning costs I discussed
earlier, in the second quarter, we recorded a $60 million charge for the estimated impact of the Fed's proposed
supervisory assessment on large banks. This fee is expected to be retroactive to the beginning of 2012, so the $60
million charge represents the cumulative impact of six quarters of assessments. Excluding this fee, core operating
expenses declined roughly 1% in constant dollars, both year-over-year and sequentially.

Year-over-year, the expense decline reflects approximately $200 million in repositioning savings, partially offset by
higher performance-based compensation expense. And sequentially, the expense decline reflects approximately $100
million of incremental repositioning savings as well as lower performance-based compensation expense compared to
the first quarter, partially offset by higher marketing and transaction related costs. We remain on track to achieve
approximately $900 million of repositioning savings full year 2013, with a run rate of approximately $1.2 billion
beginning in 2014.
On slide seven, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp generated second quarter revenues of
$18.9 billion and net income of $4.5 billion. Year-over-year, revenues grew 7% and expenses declined by 2%, driven
by lower legal and related expenses. Credit costs in Citicorp increased modestly year-over-year as the decline in net
credit losses was more than offset by lower reserve releases. Citicorp loans increased by 4% year-over-year. Consumer
loans grew 1% as growth in international loans was mostly offset by a decline in North America. And corporate loans
were up 7%, including the impact of adding approximately $7 billion of previously unconsolidated assets. Excluding
this item, corporate loans would have increased 4% year-over-year.
Turning to Citi Holdings, revenues were $1.1 billion and the net loss was $579 million in the second quarter, an
improvement from prior periods driven by a continued decline in credit costs. Citi Holdings ended the quarter with
$131 billion of assets, down $60 billion or 31% year-over-year. At quarter end, Citi holdings accounted for just under
7% of total Citigroup assets.
Turning now to Citicorp, our growth in the second quarter was broad-based across the region, as shown here on slide
eight. In North America, revenues grew 7% year-over-year to $8.2 billion, driven mostly by improved Securities and
Banking performance, while expenses and net credit losses declined, offset by a lower reserve release as credit
continued to normalize. In Asia, revenues grew 7% to $4 billion, mostly reflecting Securities and Banking, although we
also grew consumer revenues while reducing expenses.
In Latin America, our business is weighted more to Consumer, which drove 8% percent growth in revenues to $3.5
billion. Expenses grew on higher volumes and credit costs were also year-over-year, primarily reflecting portfolio
growth and seasoning. However, we still grew earnings in the region.
And in EMEA, our business is weighted more to the institutional franchise, which continued to perform well, driving
8% revenue growth to $3.1 billion. We generated solid revenue growth across each geography with overall expense
discipline and stable to improving credit quality, resulting in pre-tax earnings of over $1 billion in each region.
Turning to slide nine, we show the composition of Citicorp revenues and pre-tax earnings by region before the impact
of loan loss reserves. These results also exclude Corp./Other. For the first half of 2013, 43% of Citicorp's revenues and
nearly half of pre-tax earnings were generated in the emerging markets. The higher relative profitability in the
emerging markets reflects a lower cost base as well as well as the predominantly flow-driven nature of our institutional
franchise in these markets.
Slide 10 shows the historical trend for Citicorp revenues on a trailing 12-month basis, with emerging markets
contributing over two-thirds of Citicorp's total revenue growth over the past two years. In the last 12 months, Citicorp
generated $32 billion of revenues in emerging markets. Over half of these revenues were generated in the Consumer
business where we target a high quality consumer segment largely based in the major cities. And the remainder was
institutional, predominantly serving our large multinational clients as they fund their local operations, manage currency
needs, and move payments around the world.
Turning to slide 11, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars, including the impact of
moving our Credicard business in Brazil to discontinued operations in each period. On this basis, revenues grew 5%
year-over-year while expenses grew 1%. In Latin America, revenues grew 8% and expenses were up 4% from last year.
In Asia, revenues returned to growth, up 2% year-over-year, while expenses were down 2%. And in EMEA, revenues
grew 2% with a 1% decline in expenses.

While International Consumer revenues continued to reflect spread compression in certain markets as well as the
impact of regulatory changes, particularly in Asia, most underlying drivers showed sustained momentum in the second
quarter. Total average loans grew 5% from last year. Card purchase sales were up 9%, and investment sales grew 36%
year-over-year. Both Latin America and Asia returned to positive operating leverage for the first half of 2013 and we
expect to maintain this performance for the rest of the year.
Credit costs of $751 million in the second quarter were up 19% from last year on higher net credit losses due mostly to
loan growth and portfolio seasoning. The loan loss reserve build was also higher this quarter at $123 million, driven by
portfolio growth as well as builds for specific credits in our commercial market businesses. Despite higher credit costs,
positive operating leverage drove a 7% increase in earnings before tax to $1.2 billion.
Slide 12 shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Total revenues of $5.1 billion in the second quarter
were down 1% year-over-year. Retail banking revenues of $1.6 billion declined by 4%, reflecting lower mortgage
origination and servicing revenues as well as continued spread compression, partially offset by a gain of roughly $180
million on the sale of an on-balance sheet mortgage portfolio. This sale of approximately $2.5 billion of conforming
loans was opportunistic, given the favorable market environment earlier in the quarter.
Cards revenues of $3.5 billion were flat versus last year as lower average loan balances were largely offset by an
improvement in net interest spreads. On a sequential basis, net interest spreads were up slightly in Citi branded cards,
while spreads were lower in retail services, driven by a higher percentage of deferred interest promotional balances.
Total operating expenses of $2.4 billion were down both year-over-year and sequentially, reflecting lower legal and
related costs versus the prior year and lower repositioning costs versus last quarter. Credit costs of roughly $850
million increased 19% year-over-year. Net credit losses declined by 21% to $1.2 billion driven by an improvement in
cards. However, the net loan loss reserve release was significantly lower at $351 million this quarter compared to $814
million last year. Overall, while we face mortgage and spread related headwinds in North America this quarter that are
likely to continue, we also saw some progress in our core franchise. Average deposits continue to grow, up 9%
year-over-year, including 16% growth in checking account balances. Commercial market loans were up 17%. Card
purchase sales grew year-over-year in both portfolios. And in branded cards, accounts also continued to grow, up 3%
from last year.
Slide 13 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit quality in North America continued to improve
in the second quarter with declining net credit losses and delinquencies. And in our international portfolios, we also
saw stable to improving credit trends on a sequential basis.
In Asia, the NCL improvement in the second quarter reflects higher recoveries, but even excluding this benefit, the rate
would have remained under 1%, with 90-plus day delinquencies stable at under 50 basis points. In EMEA, we saw net
credit recovery in the second quarter, while delinquencies continued to improve. And in Latin America, the NCL rate
improved to roughly 4%, while delinquencies were fairly stable.
We currently expect the NCL rate in Latin America to remain in the range of 4% for the remainder of 2013. However,
the rate could be higher if we incur any material losses on our exposures to homebuilders in Mexico, which are
included in commercial market loans. Our loans outstanding to the top three builders totaled roughly $300 million at
the end of the second quarter with nearly 100% collateralized. While we currently believe that we are adequately
reserved for any potential losses related to the home building industry in Mexico, we continue to monitor the
performance of our clients as well as the value of our collateral.
Slide 14 shows our consumer loans by major country. Roughly 80% of our loans are in six markets: North America,
which is roughly half of our portfolio; followed by Mexico, Korea, Australia, Singapore and Hong Kong. While in
certain markets, including North America, Korea and Australia, loan growth has been hampered by the economic or
regulatory environment, in other countries, we continue to expand, reflecting the quality of our franchise and the
growing population of high quality borrowers in these markets. Importantly, we are growing our loans with a
disciplined focus on credit quality.

In Mexico, while the NCL rate ticked up at the end of 2012, reflecting portfolio seasoning, the loss rate of under 4%
remains low on a historical basis, driven by more stringent underwriting criteria and the repositioning of our cards
portfolio over the past five years. And in Singapore and Hong Kong, we have consistently maintained our focus on
higher quality borrowers, resulting in low delinquency and loss rates.
Slide 15 shows our Securities and Banking business. Revenues of $6.4 billion grew 21% from last year and declined
12% from the prior quarter. Investment Banking revenues of $1 billion were up 21% from the prior year, with higher
revenues in all major products, and declined 2% sequentially, driven by lower debt underwriting activity. Overall,
investment banking wallet share continued to improve in the first half of the year. Equity Market revenues of $942
million were up 68% from last year, reflecting improved derivatives performance as well as higher cash equity
volumes. Sequentially, Equity Market revenues increased 14% driven by derivatives.
Fixed Income Market revenues of $3.4 billion increased 18% from last year, with strength across all major products,
and were down 27% sequentially from a strong first quarter. Private Bank revenues of $645 million grew 9% from last
year, with growth across all regions, primarily driven by investment products, and were up 3% sequentially driven by
North America and EMEA.
Lending revenues, excluding the impact of gains and losses on hedges related to accrual loans, were $401 million in the
second quarter, down 3% from last year on lower volumes, partially offset by slightly higher spreads. Lending revenues
were up 21% sequentially, due mostly to the absence of losses on loan sale activity in the first quarter and slightly
higher spreads. Total operating expenses of $3.5 billion were down 2% both year-over-year and sequentially, reflecting
the impact of repositioning versus the prior year and lower compensation versus last quarter. Earnings before tax of $3
billion grew 80% from last year and declined 19% sequentially.
Moving to Transaction Services on slide 16, revenues of $2.7 billion were down 1% from last year. Treasury and Trade
Solutions were down 3% as loan and deposit growth was more than offset by the impact of spread compression
globally. And Securities and Fund Services revenues grew 5% as higher settlement volumes and fees more than offset
lower spreads. Spread compression continue to dampen revenues this quarter. However, the volume drivers for
Transaction Services showed sustained momentum. Average trade loans grew 16% year-over-year.
Average deposits were up 7%. Assets under custody grew by 10%, and SFS settlement volumes grew 13%. Expenses
of $1.4 billion grew 2% year-over-year, driven mainly by higher volumes, partially offset by efficiency savings. While
spread compression is likely to impact revenues in the near term, we continue to believe we can achieve revenue
growth and a return to positive operating leverage in the second half of 2013.
Slide 17 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues were down versus the prior year, driven by hedging activities,
while expenses of $525 million declined as well on lower legal and related expenses. Assets of $290 billion included
approximately $95 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $141 billion of liquid available-for-sale securities.
Slide 18 shows Citi Holdings assets. We ended the quarter with assets of $131 billion in Citi Holdings or roughly 7% of
total Citigroup assets. The $18 billion reduction in the second quarter reflected $8 billion of assets related to the sale of
our remaining stake in the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney JV, $4 billion of other asset sales and $6 billion of net
paydowns.
On Slide 19, we show Citi Holdings' financial results for the quarter. Total revenues of $1.1 billion were up 17%
year-over-year as lower funding costs drove higher revenues in both the Special Asset Pool and Local Consumer
Lending despite the continued decline in loan balances. And we also saw improved asset marks in the Special Asset
Pool.
Citi Holdings' expenses increased 25% year-over-year to $1.5 billion, driven by higher legal and related costs in the
Special Asset Pool. Excluding these legal costs, core operating expenses declined 18% year-over-year to roughly $845
million. Credit costs declined 63% year-over-year to $451 million. Net credit losses declined significantly to $770
million, and the net loan loss reserve release was over $470 million, including a release of roughly $525 million related
to North America mortgages.

Looking at the past five quarters of Citi Holdings results on slide 20, rep and warranty reserve bills and legal and
related costs continue to weigh on Citi Holdings in the second quarter. Excluding these items, Citi Holdings was break
even on a pre-tax basis. The earnings improvement over the past two quarters has been driven by credit as net credit
losses continued to decline and we began utilizing our mortgage loan loss reserves.
North America mortgage NCLs declined to $553 million in the second quarter, roughly 95% of which were charged to
the reserve. We ended the quarter with $6.4 billion of loan loss reserves allocated to North America mortgage loans in
Citi Holdings, or 35 months of coverage. Going forward, assuming the U.S. economic environment remains favorable,
we currently expect to continue to utilize reserves to offset nearly all of our mortgage net credit losses.
Legal costs are expected to remain elevated in the near term. However, we put a significant piece of our rep and
warranty issues behind us with the recent Fannie Mae agreement, which covers substantially all potential future
repurchase claims from Fannie Mae on loan originations from 2000 through 2012. While we continue to work through
our remaining rep and warranty issues, we believe we are currently well reserved for potential whole loan claims.
On slide 21, we show mortgage loan and adjusted net credit loss trends over the past two years. Since the second
quarter of 2011, we have reduced the North America mortgage loans in Citi Holdings by 31%, driven by $17 billion of
paydowns, $11 billion of assets sales, and $9 billion of net losses. In the second quarter of 2013, we sold $3.1 billion of
loans, including $700 million of delinquent mortgages and $2.4 billion of current reperforming loans. We have also
significantly reduced the quarterly net credit losses on the portfolio, down 49% since the second quarter of 2011 to
$553 million.
On slide 22, we show delinquency legacy trends, including both residential first mortgages and home equity loans.
30-plus day delinquencies improved by 10% sequentially to $5.5 billion, with improvement in each bucket across both
portfolios.
On slide 23, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends, which, as a reminder, includes the impact of
moving our Credicard business to discontinued operations. Net interest revenue of $11.7 billion in the second quarter
grew 3% year-over-year and was up slightly from last quarter. As we discussed, at the end of the first quarter, our net
interest margin in the second quarter decreased by 3 basis points to 285 basis points. This decline was driven by lower
loan and investment yields, partially offset by an improvement in funding costs.
Looking to the second half of 2013, we expect our net interest margin to stay roughly flat to perhaps a few basis points
lower than the second quarter. So on a full-year basis, we expect to be slightly above the net interest margin of 282
basis points we achieved last year.
On slide 24, we show our key capital metrics through the second quarter. Under Basel III, our estimated Tier 1
common ratio increased to 10% versus 9.3% last quarter, driven by retained earnings, DTA utilization, and the sale of
our remaining stake in the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture, partially offset by losses on available-for-sale
securities in OCI.
Turning to the leverage ratio, Citigroup's supplementary leverage ratio, as calculated using the U.S. Basel III NPR, was
an estimated 4.9% for the second quarter. Unlike the Tier 1 common ratio, which is a period-end calculation, the
supplementary leverage ratio is the average of the three month-end ratios calculated in the quarter. While our average
for the three months was 4.9% for the second quarter, this leverage ratio improved sequentially during the period, with
an exit rate of just above 5% for the month of June. We are still reviewing the final U.S. Basel III rules, but do not
believe the final rules will have a significant impact on the estimated ratios.
Our supplementary leverage ratio estimate does not incorporate differences in the definition of leveraged assets as
recently proposed by the international Basel Committee. As you are all aware, there has been quite a bit of activity and
pronouncements relating to the capital requirements of large financial institutions over the past several weeks, and so
our estimates are necessarily subject to our continued review and understanding of these recent developments.
In summary, our results for the second quarter reflected a continued challenging operating environment with spread
compression, slowing global growth and elevated legal and related costs remaining as headwinds. However, even with

these challenges, we continued to grow our core business while significantly reducing the earnings drag from Citi
Holdings.
In Securities and Banking, we had a strong second quarter even as market conditions became more volatile late in the
quarter. In Transaction Services, we continued to grow loan and deposit volumes to mostly offset the impact of global
spread compression. And in Consumer Banking, we also grew our loans in many markets year-over-year, overcoming
spread compression to generate revenue growth and positive operating leverage in every region outside North America.
In North America Consumer, the environment remains challenging with a combination of spread compression,
consumer deleveraging, and a slowdown in mortgage refinancing activity expected to continue to put pressure on
revenues for the remainder of the year. In the mortgage business, we are beginning to take actions to reduce our
expense base with the decline in activity, but we would expect there to be some lag as we continue to fulfill our
backlog through the third quarter. We may face additional pressure if not only volumes but also margins decline further
as we look to the back half of the year.
Turning to Citi Holdings, assets are now roughly 7% of total Citigroup, and the net loss was less than $600 million this
quarter even as we continued to face elevated legacy costs. While legal and related costs are expected to remain
elevated in Citi Holdings in the near term, we put a significant piece of our rep and warranty issues behind us with the
recently announced Fannie Mae agreement.
And finally, our liquidity and capital positions remain strong, with estimated aggregate liquidity resources in excess of
$380 billion and an estimated Basel III Tier 1 common ratio of 10% at quarter end. Finally, we remain on track to
achieve the expense savings from our fourth quarter repositioning actions, even as some of our year-over-year savings
were offset by higher performance-related compensation, given our strong revenues in the first half of the year.
And with that, Mike and I will be happy to take any questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi. Good morning. John, a question on expenses. I recall in terms of the repositioning
saves, you're shooting for $900 million this year. In the first quarter, you said you didn't get much of that. How much of
that did you get in the second quarter? So where do we stand right now on realizing the $900 million you're shooting
for this year?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: You probably have seen about $200 million of the repositioning savings reflected in the
second quarter results.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And that $900 million, we should think of that as a year-over-year savings,
2013 versus 2012? Is that how should we should look at it?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes, I guess the way I would think of it, John, is if you go back to the fourth quarter, when
we first talked about the $900 million and the whole repositioning action, I think we had core operating expenses in
that quarter of about $11.5 billion.
Now since then, we've taken out Credicard. We've moved that to discontinued operations, and we certainly had some
impact of FX. And so if you adjust for those two items, that would probably adjust that $11.5 billion to just a little bit
north of $11.3 billion. So the fourth quarter repositioning actions, we've said would yield full-year saves of $1.2 billion,
which means that $300 million of that save should be visible in our fourth-quarter numbers.
So if you start with $11.3 billion in the fourth quarter of last year and you look at $300 million of saves that should be
embedded in our fourth quarter numbers, you should expect a fourth quarter core operating expense number

somewhere around $11 billion – again, depending on how performance-related IC could flow for the balance of the
year.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And that was around $11.2 billion to $11.173 billion this quarter. Is that the
right comparable number?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes. So this quarter we're at $11.173 billion. And I'd say – and that includes the higher
performance-related IC that we've had this quarter. And I'd say that we're on target to deliver the annual savings by the
end of the year.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And in terms of the legal expenses remaining high, $800 million this quarter, it
seems like you're on track to be similar to last quarter – last year, where you did about $2.8 billion for the total. It's hard
to predict that. Any color you can give us on the outlook there or just what's driving that to remain high? Is this kind of
private label litigation stuff or any color you could offer there?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, certainly private label litigation is one of the legacy issues that we're dealing with.
And you're quite right, we had $2.8 billion of legal and related expenses last year. We had $700 million or so in the
first quarter of this year. So I would expect legal and related costs to, as we said, remain high and somewhat volatile.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And in terms of the DTA utilization, $1.3 billion for the first half, are we on a
steady pace here? Can we think of $600 million to $700 million per quarter as a reasonably sustainable pace in this
kind of environment, John, or are there funny factors we need to think about that might drive this to be volatile over the
next couple quarters?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, John, it's actually going to depend upon the level and component pieces of our
earnings stream. In looking at this quarter, Citicorp earnings actually utilized $1.3 billion of DTA. That would've been
partially offset by the $300 million of DTA that was created by holdings. Then you had CVA that actually utilized –
because CVA was a revenue item this quarter, CVA utilized $200 million of DTA this quarter, and then OCI created
DTA. So there's a lot of moving pieces that go into that $600 million.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. That's helpful. But the gradual trend of a smaller drag at Holdings is the key
thing that will get this higher over time, I guess?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I'd say the two key things would be continued strong earnings out of Citicorp especially –
and then the gradual decline hopefully in Citi Holdings losses, yes.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then final thing for me, John, in terms of that new supplemental leverage
ratio, any thoughts on where you would look in terms of the bank level that will ultimately need to be into the 6%
standard?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, we did not have enough time to run the bank ratios for the second quarter. As we
mentioned, you got to run each month, and then the average of three months, and it's just a little bit more involved in
running the bank. We had run the bank for the month of March, and at least as we ran the bank for the month of March,
we were right around 6% for the month of March.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks very much.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No problem, John.

<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hey, Matt.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Just beginning with some questions in terms of why we didn't see maybe more negative
impact from the volatility in emerging markets, either within your capital or some of the Fixed Income businesses. I
realize it's two different things, but just the volatility we saw in FX and some of the spreads widening and a number of
the credit problems, it didn't really seem like it was all that material in the grand scheme of things.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, as a matter fact, I think that we managed our emerging markets business quite well in
the quarter. In the Fixed Income numbers, one of our real strong performers was our local markets FX business. That
business, if I recall, it generated revenue – we think revenue growth of 25% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. So we
actually performed quite well this quarter.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. And then just somewhat related on the fixed income trading, any meaningful impact
from the OTC clearing of the swaps? Or do you think we'll have one going forward?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, we still have to see how everything settles out. I still haven't seen the final guidance
and everything that's coming out of all the debates from last week, and I think that that's still something that is yet to be
developed.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. And then just lastly, you gave some net interest margin guidance. What about for net
interest income dollars overall, do you think we'll see them trend up from here?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: That's a little bit difficult. If you look over the last couple of quarters, we've been relatively
stable in our daily net interest revenue. I think our daily net interest revenue this quarter was $130 million a day, last
quarter it was $131 million a day. I wouldn't – it's going to be somewhat dependent on day count and a few other
things. I really wouldn't want to go out on a limb and start predicting big increases in net interest revenue at this point.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. All right. Thank you.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Okay.

Your next question comes from line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hi, Betsy.
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Good morning.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: A couple questions on the capital ratios you indicated earlier. So the bank sublevel first pass,
6% March, but the Holdco 4.9,%. Could you just give us a sense as to what the big deltas are there? I just want to make
sure the bank level 6% first pass is based on the estimated – the proposed, the NPR, not the final rule. Is that right?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: It's based on the – you've actually confused me with that question, Betsy. It's based upon the
rules that we've got outstanding right now.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Got it. And the difference between – what makes the bank in such better position relative to
the Holdco?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: It would be capital level and component of the balance sheet as far as how the leveraged
assets are calculated.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. I'm just thinking about it from perspective where your derivatives business is held, a
portion of it in the bank but a portion of in the Holdco. So I'm just wondering if that has a disproportionate impact on
the bank or not.

<A - John C. Gerspach>: Everything has an impact. It's just the way – all we do is just run the rules. Don't forget the
bank also has intercompany relationships and that's why the bank is a little bit more complicated to think through.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Got it. Yeah, now I know you downstream some equity to the bank as well, and that helps, I
would assume. Why just doing the ratios on the NPR as opposed to the final rule for the Basel ratio?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Which final rule are you – we're running them off of the U.S. final rule.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. I'm just thinking there's the slide two, you had the note that all references to Basel III
capital ratios are based on the proposed Basel III, the Basel III NPR.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, it's based upon the final rule as we best understand it right now. We have not finished
going through every detail of the 900-plus pages in the final rule. So as we have looked at the final rule, we don't
believe that for us, there is any significant difference between the final rule and the NPR because we haven't been able
to find anything as yet.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. Got it.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Okay?
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Yeah. I just wanted to understand why you put that footnote in there. Okay, so two other
quick things, one is on the $50 million, $60 million that you called out, which is obviously a pretty small number and
not really that material especially on a quarterly basis. I'm just wondering what it is exactly, the regulatory assessment
that you called out.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, the Fed last quarter actually, I believe that they're allowed to do this under
Dodd-Frank. Dodd-Frank permits the Fed to assess large banks with a special assessment for a higher cost of
regulation. And so the Fed put out last quarter an assessment proposal on all banks. I think that the total assessment was
$440 million. And when we ran through the calculations for us, it comes out to be roughly $10 million a quarter.
Now that was put out subject to a comment period, and all the comments are in and we expect that the Fed will do
something in the third quarter. And so we just thought it was prudent then to begin to accrue what we would estimate
the impact of the fee to be. And since it's retroactive all the way back to the beginning of 2012, for this quarter then, we
would've recorded six quarters of the estimated $10 million assessment.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Got it. Okay, that's clear. And then just lastly, on the litigation costs that you called out, you
had obviously, as you indicated several settlements this quarter as well. So I'm just wondering how much of the
settlements were already reserved for? And how much of the litigation costs this quarter were to true-up those
settlements, or how much is building reserve for future litigations?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah. I think that you'll see more detail when we publish the Q. And clearly, if any of those
settlements had involved significant charges in the quarter, we would have called that out.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. Thank you.

be in dollar terms for those things?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, Guy, we have – again, all of this stuff has just come out. And so we did a very, very
preliminary look at what the impact would be. And we would currently roughly estimate that the combination of all
those things could cost us now as much as 40 basis points in the supplementary leverage ratio. But again, it's early and
we still have to take a look as to exactly what the details are and what else we might be able to do to offset some of
that.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Fair enough. But that's really helpful that you gave that number. I appreciate that. On
emerging markets, obviously, what's happened over the last several months in some markets like China and Brazil
would make you think that maybe we're looking at some weakness in macro growth. Any revisiting of the plans that
you had talked about a few months ago to rationalize emerging markets investment in light of all that?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Guy, it's Mike. The simple answer to that is no. You saw us as we laid out, take some
actions in the first quarter in terms of continuing to refine in particular parts of our Consumer portfolio. But again, I
think as we looked at the world and I think described coming into the year what we saw was going to be a challenging,
uneven environment, we obviously saw the numbers come out of China early this morning in terms of the slight
slowdown, the 7.5% versus the 7.6%, a bit slower in Mexico. But I don't think those things have caused us to rethink
where we are.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. That's also helpful. Thanks. The AOCI hit was obviously reasonably meaningful in
light of a pretty bad increase in long rates and yet it seems like looking at your AFS portfolio, it could've been worse.
Did you take actions to reduce the impact by repositioning risk or something in sort of mid-quarter ahead of the
potential for rates to rise, or was there something else there?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, Guy, it's just the way we manage the business on an ongoing basis. Nothing special.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. And then I guess the final question I'll ask is I think you alluded to trade finance
growth, and looking at CTS, it looks like loans grew sequentially by about $13 billion, if I'm reading this right, and that
was about the same growth year-over-year as well as sequentially. So it basically all happened this quarter. Pretty
sizable. Anything in particular going on in terms of market share initiatives or something that would've taken those loan
balances up so fast?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Guy, one of the things that we tried to footnote for you, maybe we didn't get it on every
schedule, but I tried to mention it in some of my comments is that this quarter, we also consolidated a previously
off-balance sheet vehicle that added about $7 billion of loans – trade loans. So we decided that this was a conduit that
we had that housed really high quality government guaranteed export trade loans. And just looking at the vehicle and
the spread that we were getting, we felt that we could actually more efficiently fund these loans by bringing them back
onto our balance sheet. So that's $7 billion of loans that got added in this quarter, and that's certainly impacting the
numbers that you see.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: So all that $7 Billion went to CTS.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Correct.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. That wasn't clear. Great. Thanks very much.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Okay, Guy.

than that. Is this just a function of you being more conservative on home price assumptions? Or how should we think
about the pace of recovery and loss rates in mortgage?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, I don't want to say that we're more conservative in taking losses than anybody else. I
think that what you're starting to see now is that as the mortgage – that legacy mortgage portfolio shrinks, and it's now
down to, what, $80 billion, what you have now is a bit more of an influence on the loss rates from the mortgage loans
that we would have had as part of our Citi Finance business. And those mortgages carry a slightly – carry a
significantly higher loss rate...
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Right.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Than what the mortgages would. And so, yeah, I hate to use the word mix, but you're
getting something of a mix impact on the NCL rate.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Okay. And you're suggesting that those might be a little lagged in terms of the recovery
because of the quality of them?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, well, they actually – those mortgages, they have an inherent larger loss rate. They
didn't necessarily peak to the same extent, peak as high as some of the other aspects of the book, but they pretty much
consistently run a loss rate of, say, 5%. So you've got an element of our book that's running a 5% loss rate, and that's
also an element of our book that we're really not able to do much in the way of asset sales on. So those Citi Finance
mortgages have become an increasingly larger percentage of the overall $80 billion and, therefore, they're going to be a
somewhat mitigating factor as far as our ability to bring the overall loss rate for the portfolio down.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Okay. Now that's helpful. Thanks. And just maybe on the rate sensitivity, you guys in your Q
have talked about a steepening curve, I think a benefit of a little over $100 million, not very much. I'm just trying to
get, versus your peers that's on the low end, is it a function of you being shorter in duration in your AFS book? And if
you have that number, that would be great. Or is it just a factor of geographic mix on the balance sheet – that you're just
less exposed to the U.S. rate curve?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, I can't tell you how other people are positioned, but I think you're right as focusing on
that [ph] scenario 6 (56:55) that we've got in the 10-Q. And there's also a whole series of assumptions that go behind
that analysis, including the assumption that in that type of environment, we would just match our investments and our
funding book. In other words, the duration of the investment book would remain static.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Right.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: We wouldn't look to extend the duration of the book to capture higher yields. And I think
you're right in assuming that we are somewhat shorter duration right now at least than what we would normally be.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Okay. Do you have that number or you don't disclose it?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I'm not going to give you the overall duration, but it is fairly short.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

<Q - Brennan Hawken>: So thanks for the color on the emerging market book. Was just kind of curious if the trends
that you saw in the 30-day delinquency rates were any different than the 90-day rates that you gave us?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: In the mortgage book?
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: No, in the emerging market credit books?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I'm sorry, in the emerging market – in the consumer books that we've given you the details?
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Exactly.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah. We've actually got a lot of that back in the supplement. I don't think there's anything
terribly telling as far as the 30-day delinquency statistics. You get some noise in some of the statistics. I think we've
talked in past calls about how the 30 to 90-day bucket in Latin America tends to move from quarter to quarter because
we've got a mortgage portfolio in there that actually we collect payments on every 60 days. So you would have seen 30
to 90-day delinquencies in Latin America Consumer spike up in the first quarter and now you've seen them drop in the
second quarter. But outside of some individual portfolio quirks, there's nothing in the credit statistics in the early bucket
delinquencies that gives us any extraordinary cause for concern.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Cool. Okay. That helps. And you also said that you had seen the slowing growth in
emerging markets but the revenues have hung in there. So should we continue to expect that revenue and credit would
track roughly similar to what you've recently seen this quarter, if we continue to see the slowing growth play out in
emerging markets?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, that's somewhat easier to talk about in the Consumer businesses than it is in the
institutional businesses. But on the Consumer businesses, I think that, that's exactly the guidance that we were trying to
provide you with in some of the closing commentary where we feel that the Consumer businesses in both Latin
America and Asia should produce positive operating leverage in the second half of the year, as we are able to grow
revenues faster than growing expenses. On the institutional side, that's somewhat going to be dependent upon overall
market conditions.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Sure. Great. That helps. Thanks. And then in the equities business, another encouraging step
here this quarter. And I also noticed it seems as though, at least in the press, you guys recently hired someone out of
PB. Is that a side of the business that you guys are looking to grow? What are your thoughts on the equities business at
this point? Is it going to continue to be a focus to try and growth that further, or are you guys happy where it is now?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, I think, Brennan, what you saw is when we, over the past several years, we've been
growing at the expense side of that business, trying to get it really in line with what we saw as future revenue
opportunities.
I think that what you've seen us also do is while we've shrunk our overall head count and expense base, we've also
selectively made investments in terms of people and [ph] training (01:01:06) platforms in that business. And so early
times, the results are improving. We're focused on continuing to want to take market share. We've seen that. We've
seen good sequential growth quarter-over-quarter, but we've got more work to do.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Terrific. And then last one for me, you guys highlighted decline in funding costs in
Holdings. Should we assume that that decline is sustainable? And maybe can you give a little further color on what
drove that decline?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, as the assets roll off, we obviously have a slightly higher cost debt associated with
those Holdings assets. And so as those Holdings assets roll off, the debt levels will reduce and that should serve, then,
to provide a funding cost benefit to that business. But it really is more in line with the assets continuing to come down.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Terrific. Thanks a lot.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Okay, thank you, Brennan.

Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hi, Gerard.
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Good morning.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Can you guys give us a guide? You're doing quite well on your Basel Tier 1 common ratio,
it's 10% now. Where do you think you're going to manage to when we get to – when you know all the ins and outs of
what's required, which may take another 12 months, but where do you think you ultimately manage to on that ratio as
well as the new supplemental leverage ratio?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: I think, Gerard, you touched on the challenges but I don't think we yet know all the ins or
outs. And as we've spoke about in the past, we don't really know yet around the rules really what buffer in either metric
we need to run the institution to. So one of our objectives we stated was to, within reason, trying to get at or around
these leverage ratios within a reasonable time, and as these rules continue to clarify themselves, we'll continue to adjust
to that. But again, I think there's a lot more work we've got to do to see how these things finalize themselves and what
that buffer is.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Okay. And I may have missed it, did you give us the LCR ratio for this quarter?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, no, I didn't, but would you care to ask about it?
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Sure. Could you tell me what it is, please?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I mentioned the fact that we had over $380 billion worth of high quality liquid assets, and at
least the early estimate of the LCR ratio says that it's coming in exactly where we targeted at – which is about, as we
said last quarter, right around 110%.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Good. Could you also share with us – you mentioned Mexico, those three largest builders.
Are those still accruing loans or are any of them in default? And then just some color on what you're seeing down in
Mexico right now.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I don't know the answer to your first question, so I'm going to have to ask you to call Susan
or somebody in IR, and by the time that happens, they'll figure out the answer to your first question.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Sure.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: They are 100% collateralized, those loans – or nearly 100% collateralized.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: And just color in general. What are your guys telling you about what's going – because
Mexico's been so strong, and now this housing situation seems kind of odd, considering the economy down there is
pretty good.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, I think what you have there is just market forces at work. Supply and demand. And as
usual, with real estate, the most important considerations is location, location, location, and some of the homebuilders
got a little overextended in putting supply where people don't necessarily want to live anymore.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: I see. And then just finally in Citi Holdings, the decline in the SAP assets of $14.9 billion
from $18.5 billion, were there any bulk sales? Because you had some impressive declines in some of the categories.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I can't recall any large bulk sales, off the top of my head. So again, it's just continuing to
chip away at everything that is in Holdings.

<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: And has pricing for these assets I think – has it improved, or does it continue to improve
from what you've seen in the last six months?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I'd say in general the pricing has held up. Obviously, with mortgages now, given the change
in the 10-year rate, that certainly has had an impact on the pricing that we see for reperforming loans.
We mentioned the fact that we did about $3 billion of loan sales this quarter, and roughly $2.4 billion was reperforming
loans. Those types of loan sales are more sensitive to changes in interest rates because they're very yield-sensitive. And
so that clearly is a portion of the market that we've seen prices decline in.
In contrast, nonperforming loans – nonperforming mortgage loans seem to be more sensitive to changes in HPI, so
pricing there has held up pretty well.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Thank you.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Not a problem.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Good morning. What's the capital markets backlog at the end of the quarter, compared to the
end of last quarter?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I don't have that, Mike. Sorry.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. You made the comment that you expect to use reserves in Citi Holdings to offset nearly
all of the mortgage losses. If you could elaborate on what that means.
And does that mean – if I look at slide 20, the bottom right-hand corner where you have adjusted pre-tax earnings for
Citi Holdings – that's zero this quarter. Does that statement that you'll use those reserves to offset mortgage losses
imply that that adjusted pre-tax earning figure of zero in the second quarter of 2013 should stay at zero or go higher? Or
you aren't willing to make a statement that this is an inflection point?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, I think it's a little early to make a prediction as far as an inflection point.
And the statement as far as using the reserves, it's really nothing more, Mike, than basically continuing to do what
we've done here in the second quarter, where we use reserves to cover basically 95% of the mortgage NCLs.
Don't forget that the Holdings portfolio is pretty much a closed book, right? I mean it's not that we're adding new loans
into that portfolio. So that's a little different than you would think about in a normal mortgage business.
So we've established reserves for what we believe to be the losses that are inherent in that portfolio. Based upon the
way that the markets are moving and the way that we would look at our need for reserves right now, we felt this quarter
– and we think that certainly in the next two quarters – you can look out about six months – we don't see any reason
why we shouldn't be using the reserves that we've already established then to almost fully cover the losses that we set
them up to cover.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: What about blowing out some more of the problem mortgages from Citi Holdings? You said
that's more a function of home prices. So why not get more aggressive with sales?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, again, you've got two different components to the book, Mike.
From a nonperforming loan point of view, you're quite right. Those nonperforming loans are really priced – they're
very price-sensitive to HPI. And we were able to do about $700 million of nonperforming loan sales this quarter.

But we've been doing nonperforming loan sales – go back for the last 15 quarters. And so our nonperforming loan book
is fairly well picked-over at this point in time. And with delinquencies performing the way they are, we're not
necessarily creating a bunch of new inventory, which we think is good.
The other side of the book – as we continue to modify loans and those loans then perform, that gives us a different set
of inventory to deal with. And you've noticed that in the last two quarters, we've actually taken advantage of that. We
sold $2.4 billion of reperforming loans this quarter, and a similar number last quarter.
The trouble with reperforming loans is that the pricing on those loans is really yield-sensitive. And so now that the –
with interest rates spiking the way they are, the pricing is not quite as favorable in that market at this point in time.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then a completely separate question. I think this is for Mike. Going back to your March 5
presentation, slide 12, you had a couple categories. Optimize, then grow. And optimize/restructure. So I was
wondering, with the benefit of a few more months to evaluate the franchise, if there's any incremental information on
that?
And also, as you said on the call, you expect to have your $1.2 billion run rate expense savings going into 2014. What's
after that? So really, what's next for expenses and restructuring and what else have you learned in the past few months?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Well, I think as we laid out in March, Mike, what we said is that those slides are going to
continue to evolve – our four buckets. And so we have as part of the restructuring and as part of the things that we've
announced as normal course of business – in terms of refinements of our institutional clients and our consumer
strategies – continue to work against that.
I think importantly, as John spoke about from a repositioning charge perspective, we're not planning, signaling, talking
about some big repositioning, but want to continue to push our businesses to work and optimize over time.
And so I think what you've seen in the first half of the year – and it is just the first half of the year – from an efficiency
ratio perspective, we're making progress and we're pushing our leaders and managers around the concept of thinking
about and running their businesses that way. So there's nothing that we've got planned that's a big, monumental move in
terms of an overall restructuring or change of direction of the company, but just a focus on being in a challenging
operating environment and making sure we're managing ourselves in the appropriate way.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And I think before you said the optimize/restructure bucket might be about 10% of the firm. Is
that correct, and has that changed? And any more color on what that bucket might include?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: I don't have that slide in front of me. That number actually sounds a bit low to me as you
describe it, at that percentage.
No, again, I think this work continues to evolve, and I would say, at this point, nothing new to report. As we get to year
end or into the fourth quarter and go through budgets, we'll be continuing to assess how we're thinking about our
products in our countries, and we'll continue to align and realign those buckets accordingly.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right. Thank you.
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Thank you.

Your question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Co.

And then I'm thinking custody and transaction processing. Maybe government bond dealing. Anything that's heavy in
leverage asset ratio – but not RWAs. Are there any businesses that you're going to have to run differently?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: All good questions, Chris, and all way too early in the process to really address. I mean
certainly what we've seen so far are proposals. I don't think we've actually had a chance to read through every aspect of
it. And I would expect that, as usual, we'll engage in a robust and a healthy dialogue – constructive dialogue with the
various regulators on these topics.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Okay. And then secondly, just to follow up on the questions about emerging markets. I
mean a lot of the damage to the whole commodities complex – all that has happened very, very recently, in second half
of May and June. And just was wondering if Mike's comments earlier – should we read that if commodity prices
roughly stay at this level, that we should not expect any significant fallout, in terms of your businesses in the emerging
markets?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Well, I think – again, as John described, there's two components to our business. One is the
consumer piece, and we've signaled how we think about the second half of the year there.
I think it's difficult right now to be able to judge where we are in terms of a trading environment. June was certainly
choppier than the first four, five months of the year. And it's hard to predict what the trading environment's going to be
like in the second half.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Yeah, I didn't mean so much the trading environment. I meant gold and all other
commodities you can look at, basically, have come down fairly significantly in May and June, and does that impact –
does that significantly impact the economies you're working in?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, Chris, I think that's exactly what you have to see is how does it impact – it's not so
much the commodity price, in and of itself. It's what's the ongoing impact on the economies.
And as we've said before, we still anticipate that the emerging-market economies are going to grow at a much faster
rate than the developed economies. And so we would still expect to get more growth out of the emerging markets in
general than the developed markets. And we continue to run our business in each of those geographies with a very
disciplined focus on credit.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Great. All right. Thank you.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Okay.

Your next question comes from the line of Erika Penala with Bank of America.
<Q - Leanne Erika Penala>: Good morning. Just a quick follow-up question. I would appreciate the guidance on
NCLs for GCB Latin America. Should we expect the same stability in dollar provision? Or should we continue to
increase it. as we've seen over the past two quarters?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: That's a good, good question. I would say that – when we say that the rate should stabilize,
that would mean that you would likely see some small increments in the NCL nominal dollars themselves – again,
subject to currency fluctuation.
<Q - Leanne Erika Penala>: Okay. And so the dollar NCLs are going up, but the dollar provision will go up in tune
with growth and the dollar increase in NCLs.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: The NCLs will – the nominal – on a constant-dollar basis, with growing portfolios and a
stable NCL rate, you would expect the nominal-dollar NCL to increase slightly, and right along with the growth in the
portfolios.

As those portfolios grow, it's likely then that we would have to provide some level of additional loan loss reserve
against those portfolios.
<Q - Leanne Erika Penala>: Okay. That's clear. And just one more question, just to go – to explore a different topic.
Mike, could you update us on what your thoughts are, in terms of potentially doing large card transactions in the U.S.?
And what are the top parameters you're considering, whether thinking about even putting a bid in or formulating a bid
in, if a large card transaction were to become available?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Yeah, so a couple things we can point to or speak about. One is that you saw us in the first
quarter announce our Best Buy transaction. Roughly a $7 billion card portfolio that we thought fit in well against our
retail partners services business.
And so in that business, we would continue to look at portfolios that we think fit in and have adjacencies, either from a
sector or from a geography perspective. In there, obviously, we're going to be mindful of returns of capital, of
absolute-risk profiles that are there. So things that make sense from that perspective, we're happy to consider.
And I think in the branded space, there's probably less opportunities to acquire portfolios in that segment of the market,
in the areas where we are. But again, if those presented themselves and economically they made sense, and they were
the right client set that fit against our targeted set of clients, and they were the right risk profile, we'd certainly consider
them.
<Q - Leanne Erika Penala>: Okay. Thank you for answering my questions.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Not a problem, Erika.

Your next question comes from line of Fred Cannon with KBW.
<Q - Frederick L. Cannon>: Great, thanks. I just had a couple of follow-up questions on the DTA. I was wondering
about the reduction of the DTA in this quarter – if you're able to reduce the foreign-tax-credit carryforward portion of
the DTA as a result of that reduction.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Great question. And addressing the component pieces of the DTA, as far as how much of it
relates to foreign tax credits and everything else, that's something that you can really only answer as you close out the
year and you finalize your overall tax provision.
So trying to provide detailed guidance as far as how much of the $1.3 billion of DTA that we've utilized in the first half
of the year, how much of that comes off of FTCs – I just can't reliably do that just at this point in time.
<Q - Frederick L. Cannon>: Okay, that's why it's in the K and not the Qs, I imagine.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: [ph] That's it exactly. (01:20:24)
<Q - Frederick L. Cannon>: Also in terms of – kind of [ph] off (01:20:28) the last question, in terms of the Best Buy
card deal, I guess any update on the timing of the closing of that? And also is there any way we can estimate how much
positive impact that would have on the DTA, once it does close?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, it's a little hard to isolate a specific portfolio. But as far as I know, we're still on track
to close that deal in September. So that we won't get much benefit, if any, in the third quarter out of that portfolio. But
it's a $7 billion portfolio then that we should get a full-quarter benefit from in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Frederick L. Cannon>: Okay. And then a tax rate taken against that, at least – I know it's hard to isolate, but just
from our standpoint, a tax rate taken against that should help directly reduce the DTA?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: All things being equal, yes.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. They'll be a couple of quick follow-ups.
John, you mentioned Treasury Services, you expect operating leverage gains in the second half. Just specifically, is that
expected in fourth quarter, or are you suggesting that could be the case for the full second-half results within TS?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, I just want to make sure – that was for Transaction Services -
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Oh, sorry. Transaction Services. You're right. I'm sorry.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I wasn't being specific to any part of TTS. That was really expansive for all of TTS. And I
actually think that you might be able to see some positive operating leverage as early as the third quarter.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay. And then you mentioned that there were still some regulatory headwinds in Asia –
in the Asian business. I guess that you've mentioned in the past some of the regulatory challenges that you've faced in
Korea. I guess I'm curious maybe to get a sense as to how far along on that path specific to Korea you think you are,
since it sounds like you're expecting somewhat better operating leverage trends within the Asian business overall.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, I would say that Korea is still going through some issues. I don't think that we're
going to be completely out of the regulatory headwinds in Korea – in other words, have completely worked through the
repositioning of the book – until sometime next year, maybe even to the end of next year. And so that's going to
continue to be a drag on us.
That's why, when we look at Asia – Korea certainly is a weight on us, but Asia overall, we still have some good loan
growth. And if you look in the back of the presentation material that we gave you, on slide 33, if you take a look at
Asia, excluding Korea and Japan, year-on-year, we're getting 10% loan growth coming out of Asia. So Korea is an
anchor, but it's not the only thing that is propelling our business forward.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Okay. Fair enough. And then just finally back home, any thoughts as to potential
settlement with Freddie? I know that Fannie was a bigger buyer of your mortgages over time, but any thoughts about
potentially settling with the other side of the GSEs?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Yeah. What I would say is that we won't comment on Freddie specifically, other than to just
reaffirm that continuing to work through these things and get them behind us is a top priority.

<Q - David B. Hilder>: Good morning. Thanks very much. A couple of numbers questions, and then a policy
question. Can you update us on what the Basel III risk-weighted assets in Citi Holdings are?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I don't have that number off the top of my head, but if you get a hold of IR, they'll be able to
supply you with that. But I believe that it's now down to 21% of our total risk-weighted assets. But I don't have the
math for that [ph] in my head (01:24:50).

deductions from Basel III Tier 1 of $45 billion for DTAs and other items, is it fair to assume that most of that $45.3
billion is DTAs of one sort or another at this point?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yes, David.
<Q - David B. Hilder>: Okay. And then finally, you talked about being engaged with regulators on the leverage
proposal. Could you be more specific about that? Are you actually going to object to either the percentage or the way
the denominator is calculated, for example?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, I don't want to specify where we might object or anything like that. Because when you
look at – whether you're dealing with risk-weighted assets, leveraged assets, liquidity rules – each one of these broad
concepts is valid in its own right, and serves a purpose in ensuring the safety and soundness of the financial system. In
almost every case, it's really a matter of degree and how well the various elements work together. And I think that those
are areas worthy of discussion.

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Marquardt with Evercore.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Good morning, guys.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hi, Andrew.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: A couple questions. First, in terms of the runoff portfolio in North America mortgages,
can you help us think about the pace of the runoff going forward? What's the appetite been like recently? You've talked
about that in the past. Any change in terms of – given the macro kind of backdrop potentially shifting again?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Well, as you've seen, Andrew, over the course of the last two quarters, we've been able to
sell about $6 billion of those mortgage loans, roughly, I think a little bit shy of $3 billion in the first quarter and then
$3.1 billion or so in the second quarter as we took advantage of some favorable market conditions. With a large portion
of what we were able to sell in the first half of the year were these reperforming loans that I talked about earlier. And
the reperforming loans are – the pricing on those loans is really sensitive to yield. And so with the recent rise in interest
rates, the market has changed for those reperforming loans. And so we'll have to reassess to see whether or not we can
continue the pace of sale that we've got for those types of assets.
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: And Andrew, I think as part of that, as we've said historically, the focuses are a couple
things. One is that we want to obviously continue to reduce the size and the drag of the portfolio, but that drag comes
from a couple perspectives. It not only comes from the cost of credit, it comes from the operating expenses associated
with the portfolio. And when we can go in particular at the delinquent part of the portfolio and continue to sell that part
of the mix down, it allows us to go back and get out a lot of high costs. And so we're focused in the aggregate,
derisking, getting smaller, reducing the drag. And so as the market affords opportunities, we're going to continue to try
and take advantage of them.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Got it. That's helpful. And in terms of accelerating the pace of that, you've previously
talked about that the buyer liquidity has been a hurdle just given the size of the portfolio that you need to reduce, but
then also you've brought up how there's been a difference in lifetime loss estimates more recently. Can you expand on
that point a little bit more in terms of what you mean in terms of maybe just the buyer-seller perspective?
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: Sure. So historically, when we've looked at or thought about some different, larger, in
particular, bulk sales, there's at least three components that go into the pricing that comes in. One is what's the buyer's

cost of money. Second is what are their expectations around loss rates. And the third is what's the capital they need to
hold against it and what's the cost of capital.
I would say in most every instance when we see that from a bulk perspective, the numbers or the math associated with
each of those three things, from our perspective, makes it a sale that's not worthwhile. So again, we pretty simply look
at our own view towards those three things, and if somebody's willing to pay us what we think the value of those assets
or of those securities are, we're happy to sell them. Today, in bulk form, we haven't seen that. If and when that
opportunity presents itself, we'd love to act on it. But we haven't seen that today and we're not running the portfolio
with the belief that in the near term that's going to be out there.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Okay. That's helpful. And then separately, you'd mentioned the LCR currently at about
110% currently. Is that comparable to last quarter, if I have it correctly, 116%?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Yeah, it's perfectly comparable.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Okay. And did I understand also that that 110% is about the right level that you feel
comfortable running at in terms of kind of a buffer on top of the current minimums?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: That is the target that we established last quarter.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Okay. Great. And then just lastly, kind of just stepping back, can you help just frame out
in terms of your near-term, long-term, maybe medium-term goals of 10% ROE, and 90 bps-110 bps ROA, how the
recent kind of global slowdown that you've mentioned as well as the U.S. mortgage market may be shifting here, how
much does that affect, if at all, those growth – those goals? Thanks.
<A - Michael L. Corbat>: We're not changing those goals. We said that those goals were constructed in what we
believe to be a slower growth challenging environment. We said that we would hope to be able to achieve those goals
and we hadn't built in interest rate rises into those pieces. And I think that as global growth presents a headwind or the
market presents a headwind, we've got to take those in stride within the numbers that we've put out there.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Great. Thank you.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Okay. Thank you.
