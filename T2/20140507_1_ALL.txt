MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the Allstate First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. At this
time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being
recorded.
I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference to Mr. [ph] Pat Osilero (00:26). Sir, you may begin.
Unverified Participant
Thanks, Matt. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today for Allstate's First Quarter 2014 Earnings
Conference Call. After prepared remarks by Tom Wilson and Steve Shebik, we'll have a question-and-answer session.
Yesterday, following the close of the market, we issued our news release and investor supplement, file our 10-Q for the
first quarter, and posted the slide presentation to be viewed in conjunction with our prepared remarks. We also posted a
document describing our current reinsurance program. These are all available on our website at allstateinvestors.com.
As noted on the first slide, our discussion today may contain forward-looking statements regarding Allstate's
operations. Allstate's results may differ materially from these statements, so please refer to our 10-K for 2013, slides,
and our most recent news release for information on potential risks. Also, this discussion will contain some non-GAAP
measures for which there are reconciliations in our news release and on our website. We're recording this call and a
replay will be available following its conclusion. I, along with Steve Shebik, and our Treasurer Maria Olivo, will be

available to answer any follow-up questions you may have after the call.
Now let's begin with Tom Wilson.
Thomas Joseph Wilson
Well, good morning. Thank you for investing your time with us to keep updated on Allstate's progress. Before we
begin, I'd like to say a few words about Bob Block, who most of you know passed away a couple of weeks ago after a
battle with cancer. Bob led our Investor Relations efforts for 17 years and was a member of the Allstate family for 39
years. In everything he did, he was just a consummate professional, and he was balanced, direct, thoughtful, respectful.
We will miss his expertise and friendship. Bob's family greatly appreciates all of your messages and prayers, as well as
the donations many of you made to the pancreatic cancer action network on his behalf.
In the room today with me, in addition to [ph] Pat (02:18) and Steve, are Matt Winter, who leads Allstate Personal
Lines; Don Civgin, who is responsible for Allstate Financial and Esurance; Kathy Mabe, who leads Allstate
Business-To-Business; Judy Greffin, our Chief Investment Officer; and Sam Pilch, our Corporate Controller.
Let's begin with slide two. Allstate's first quarter results show the resiliency and strength of our strategic and operating
platform. The strategic decision to create unique customer value propositions for each customer segment in Personal
Lines is providing profitable growth opportunity. Operationally, we are making good progress on all of our 2014
annual operating priorities. Financial results for the quarter were good despite the severe weather in January and
February. We also completed two strategic initiatives; the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life was closed on April 1. We also
completed the capital restructuring program that we initiated early last year. So let's go through each of these, and then
Steve will cover the operating results.
So a visual depiction of our strategy is on slide three. On an overall basis, we achieved policy in force growth of 2%
when compared to the previous year quarter, which resulted in a 5.2% increase in net-written premiums. Overall
profitability was good with recorded combined ratio of 94.7% despite severe winter weather and the launch of a new
advertising program for Esurance. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 88.4%, which is in the range
we've provided for the full year.
Growth was achieved in all segments, as you can see from the data in each of the brand-specific boxes. If you start in
the lower left, which is the largest segment in the market and the largest segment for us, which is served by Allstate
agencies, we had continued broad-based unit growth of 2.1% in Auto, which was offset by a 1.2% decline in
Homeowners policies. Given the success of our repositioning of the Homeowners line, we expect that decline for
Homeowners to become less of a drag on growth in the future. The reported and underlying combined ratios were in
line with expectations.
Esurance in the lower right had another quarter of strong growth. The combined ratio is about where we expected it.
There was a number of offsetting pieces. First, there was a large increase in advertising expense. There were the
benefits of profit improvement actions we put in place in 2013, and then the impact of severe winter weather.
Advertising expenses were 28% of premiums in the quarter as we launched new advertising to reinforce the insurance
for the modern world positioning.
Encompass, in the upper left, also continued to grow but at a slower rate than last year. That reflects the profitability
improvement actions we put in place last year and are still working on this year. Answer Financial sells non-proprietary
policies through the web and call centers in the upper right. Non-proprietary premium increased 10% over the prior
year. So we like the strategic and operating flexibility that the utilization of these different offerings gives us in the
marketplace.
If you go to slide four, our five operating priorities are shown on this page. We just discussed the insurance policies in
force for us, so let's move to maintaining the combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter is within
our full-year outlook, so it's a good start to the year. This includes of course the impact of severe winter weather. We've
been within or better than our expected annual range every year since we started this practice in 2007.

Investment returns were good in the quarter. The expected decline in interest income was partially offset by another
strong quarter for limited partnership investments. If you will remember, we shortened the duration of the Property
Liability portfolio because we did not like the risk and return trade-off of investing in long bonds. As a result, the
portfolio yield has decreased versus the last year first quarter. The priority to modernize the operating platform reflects
programs to simplify our technology infrastructure and continuous improvement actions, both of which provide greater
operating flexibility and improved customer satisfaction levels.
Building growth platforms is another important priority given the operating and financial strength of the current
business. Improving Allstate agency effectiveness and expanding capacity to support growth in that largest customer
segment, expanding Esurance's product offering will allow us to compete more effectively against the large direct
carriers that primarily sell Auto insurance. Leveraging the Allstate Benefits platform, which grew at 10% over last year
is another source of profitable growth.
If you move to slide five, the financial results generated in the quarter reflect our growth initiatives and proactive
approach to managing margins and risk. Revenues were $8.7 billion or 2.6% higher than 2013. This reflects 5.2%
growth in the Allstate Protection net written premium, partially offset by lower capital gains and investment income.
Net income of $587 million declined from the prior year quarter, primarily due to a decline in operating income and
realized capital gains.
Operating income of $588 million was 9.1% lower than in the first quarter of 2013, primarily due to higher catastrophe
and non-catastrophe weather-related losses. Operating income per diluted share decreased only 3.7% to $1.30,
reflecting the accretive impact of share repurchases on EPS. Operating income return on equity was 14.4% for the
trailing 12 months. We continue to provide strong cash returns to shareholders this quarter as has been our history, with
$113 million of common stock dividends and $987 million in share repurchases for a total of $1.1 billion.
Steve will now cover the operating results in greater detail.
Steven E. Shebik
Thanks, Tom. I'll start by reviewing our first quarter financial highlights on slide six. Starting in the upper left, Property
Liability had earned premium of $7.1 billion in the first quarter, 4.2% higher than the first quarter of 2013 and a
recorded combined ratio of 94.7%. The underlying combined ratio was 88.4% for the quarter, which is within our
full-year outlook range of 87% to 89%. Catastrophe losses were $445 million, 24% higher than the first quarter of
2013, net investment income for the Property Liability segment was down 8.5% from the prior year quarter, reflecting
interest rate risk reduction actions taken during 2012 and 2013. As a result, Property Liability operating income in the
first quarter was $468 million, 15.8% lower than the first quarter of 2013.
The Property Liability combined ratio on a recorded and underlying basis is shown in the chart on the upper right-hand
side of the slide. You can see that both the recorded and underlying combined ratios rose in the first quarter. Severe
winter weather, as Tom had mentioned, impacted the combined ratios of all three brands in the first quarter. The table
below this chart provides a view of the underlying combined ratio by brand for the past five quarters. We've also
broken out the Esurance underlying loss ratio to provide greater visibility by excluding investments in advertising and
expansion, which are immediately expensed.
The Esurance loss ratio remains higher than we would like it to be on a long-term basis, so we continue to adjust price
– pricing underwriting to ensure long-term profitable growth. These actions had negative impact on growth, which was
offset by higher spending on a new advertising campaign to further strengthen the Esurance brand. The Encompass
brand combined ratio for the first quarter was 102.6%. The underlying combined ratio of 91.8% in the first quarter was
6.1 points lower than the first quarter of 2013 and reflects the benefit of ongoing profit improvement actions. We
expect to continue our profit improvement initiatives for both Esurance and Encompass brands.
Allstate Financial on the bottom half of the slide had a 4.8% increase in premiums and contract charges in the first
quarter, including a 7.8% increase for Allstate Benefits. Operating income of $189 million was a 31% improvement

over the first quarter of 2013, driven by increased investment margin and lower expenses. Net income of $162 million
for the first quarter includes an additional $18 million after-tax loss from the sale of Lincoln Benefit Life.
On slide seven, we show net-written premiums and policies in force by brand. For Protection, in the upper left chart,
the red line shows the continued trend of policy growth that began in the second quarter of 2013. Overall, policies grew
2% from last year and 0.5% from the fourth quarter of 2013. Each brand achieved growth in the first quarter in both
net-written premium and policies compared with the prior year quarter.
Moving into the upper right chart, Allstate brand policies ended the quarter 1.1% higher than the first quarter of 2013.
Allstate brand grew net-written premium 4.3% in the first quarter versus the prior year quarter, driven by continued
favorable trends in both retention and new business as well as higher average premium. Allstate brand Auto net-written
premium increased 3.3% from the prior year while policies rose 2.1% from the first quarter of 2013. Allstate brand
homeowners net-written premium grew 5.8% while policies in force declined by 1.2% compared with the prior year.
On the bottom two charts, you can see growth trends for Encompass and Esurance. Both brands continued to grow the
premium and policies in force compared with the first quarter of 2013. Esurance's rate of growth is slowing due to an
increasing size and the pricing and underwriting actions being taken to ensure long-term profitable growth, partially
offset by the impact of the higher advertising investment. Keep in mind that the scales on the charts for these two
businesses are much smaller than the two charts at the top of the page.
Moving on to slide eight, the charts on the left-hand side show the earned premium and the underlying loss trends for
Allstate brand Auto & Home, while the charts on the right show the combined ratio trends. For Allstate brand Auto,
you can see the impact of non-catastrophe weather in the underlying loss ratio compared with a very favorable first
quarter of 2013. Physical damage frequencies increased during the quarter due to challenging winter driving conditions.
This increase was concentrated in mid-Western and Eastern states and accounts for almost all of the increase of
physical damage frequency in the quarter.
Finally, injury frequency declined slightly, while severity showed only modest growth over prior year. We continue to
take rate increases as needed in the first quarter as shown in the graph on the upper right, with average state-specific
rate increases of 2.5% in 19 states. Despite higher underlying losses in the first quarter, the underlying combined ratio
for Auto was still within our expected range.
For Allstate brand Homeowners, shown on the bottom half of the slide, the first quarter story is similar to Auto,
underlying loss cost per policy, plus an increase in non-capacity weather-related losses such as frozen pipes, ice
damage and higher levels of fire losses. The first quarter increase in Homeowners losses was driven by states that
experienced lower-than-average temperatures. The combined ratio trends for Allstate brand Homeowners are shown in
the lower right-hand chart. You can see an underlying 12-month average that essentially flattened out as we approached
price adequacy.
The composition of our investment portfolio is presented at the top of slide nine. Over time, we are shifting toward an
asset mix we believe will have higher returns. We expect to rely less on interest-bearing assets and more on equity and
other assets, which in turn is derived from idiosyncratic operating performance. Interest income will remain the largest
and more stable component to investment results, while equity investment will have attractive, but more variable
returns over time.
The lower left graph shows first quarter investment income before expenses of $999 million and a portfolio yield of
4.5%. The expected decline in the interest-bearing yield of 4.1% from 4.3% in the first quarter of 2013 reflects the
interest rate reduction in the Property Liability portfolio and a smaller portfolio due to Allstate Financial liability
balances. Strong limited partnership income partially offset lower income from the interest-bearing portfolio.
The last column in the table shows investment results for the quarter exclusive of LDL. The yields are unchanged, but
investment income is $126 million lower. Our total portfolio return is there at the bottom right with a strong 2.1% for
the first quarter, reflecting improved fixed income valuations and positive equity market performance. You can see,
however, that the valuation impact had been highly variable while the income yield has been relatively stable over the
last five quarters.

Finally, on slide 10, we provide a view of our capital position at the end of the first quarter. During the quarter, we
completed the capital restructuring plan commenced last year, which included tendering for and replacing higher
coupon senior debt with a mix of lower cost senior debt, hybrids and preferred stock. The result is a capital structure
that is stronger and more efficient, along with enhanced financial and strategic flexibility.
On the top left chart, we show our capital structure, both pre-and post-restructuring, where you can see the substantial
reduction in senior debt levels and the increase in hybrid debt and preferred stock. A pro forma review of our capital
mix adjusted for the expected pay-down of approximately $1 billion of debt during 2014 is also shown on the far left
bar.
We finished the first quarter with $22.1 billion in total shareholders' equity. Book value per share of $46.70 increased
3.1% since year-end and 7.5% since March 31 of last year. The statutory surplus of our operating companies continues
to reflect the financial strength of our insurance operations, while deployable assets at the holding company level
increased to $3.4 billion at quarter's end. During the quarter, our Board authorized a new $2.5 billion common stock
repurchase program, increased our common share dividend by 12%, which enabled us to return $1.1 billion in cash to
common shareholders during the quarter.
After completing our previous $2 billion authorization, we began repurchasing common shares under the new program,
both through open market purchases and the execution of an accelerated share repurchase agreement. Overall, during
the first quarter, we repurchased 17.8 million common shares for $987 million. The final number of shares we
repurchase under the ASR will be determined when the contract is completed. In addition, we paid $113 million in
common stock dividends during the quarter.
Overall, in the first quarter, we made good progress in the execution of our customer-focused strategy and achieved
each of our operating priorities. We are well positioned to continue to effectively execute our differentiated strategy,
while delivering strong returns to shareholders.
Now let's open up the call for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Bob Glasspiegel of Janney Capital. Your question,
please?
<Q - Bob Glasspiegel>: Good morning. And let me echo your kind memories of Bob, Tom. He will be definitely be
missed by all. A question on Esurance, what exactly is the strategy right now? It seems like the increase in advertising
would suggest that you think you've got the underwriting fixed within plan. Is that a fair read of the scenario?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Bob, thanks for the comments about Bob. Let me make a macro comment about
Esurance as to how it fits into our overall portfolio, and then Don can talk about the new advertising program.
So first, we like having four approaches to the marketplace. It gives us the ability to get very clean customer value
propositions for each of those target segments. For example, in Esurance segment, one of the components of the
customer value proposition is giving me tools to make me smart, whereas in the Allstate Agency channel, it would be
my agency and my agent knows me. So you can see the difference that does – you can think of that difference as it
relates to our operating. So we like the ability it gives us to really hone in and give a customer exactly what they want.
It also gives us the ability to compete more effectively against those people who are trying to serve multiple brands,
and so we used those brands in conjunction to compete on two fronts as opposed to just competing on one front.
Obviously in all brands, they're supposed to make the adequate return on capital, and we've talked about Esurance's
progress to improve their loss ratio. We're happy with where – the progress they're making, but they're not where they
need to be yet. That said, that doesn't stop us from wanting to continue to invest and compete aggressively, because the

returns are still above our cost of capital in that business. So Don, perhaps you want to talk about the new advertising
program and what we have going on.
<A - Don Civgin>: Yeah, hey, Bob. Let – first of all, let me reiterate. I mean, our strategy with Esurance is to grow the
business as fast as possible while maintaining positive economics over the lifetime of the business we're running. And
we've talked about this many times before, but that's by definition going to be reflected in a higher GAAP combined
ratio, which you saw again this quarter. It was a pretty tightened quarter for Esurance. They've built on a number of
things that they've been doing with the customer value proposition by continuing to build their advantage, so they
continue to be the only direct multi-line carrier with the addition of Motorcycle, Homeowners. They've continued to
build out their features, which are making their product differentiated from the competitors, and they continue to
improve ease of doing business.
The ad campaign, I think we've transitioned over this, this past quarter. In the past, we talked about Esurance and what
quadrant and what customers they were serving. This past quarter, we spent more effort to make sure people
understood just how good we were getting within that quartile and against the competitors, so you see us – it went very
aggressively against the fact that we can do quotes on the insurance website in 7.5 minutes and obviously put – we put
a lot of advertising right behind that, and you can see in the supplement where there's 12.8 points of expense.
I'd say by all measures, the campaign has worked quite well. The Super Bowl campaign, we've had 3.4 million entrants.
We had 2.7 billion social impressions. Unaided awareness and consideration of the brand is up to all-time highs, the
trust level is up, the quotes are obviously up dramatically in the quarter. And I think those are good results in particular
because we've been taking a lot of pricing action and a lot of underwriting action to get the loss ratio back to where we
wanted it to be. And while we're not entirely there, as Tom said, absent the January-February weather, we've actually
seen a nice improvement in the loss ratio here in the first quarter. I would also say that the results for Esurance in the
first quarter are particularly good because we know at least through February that the main competitors have
substantially increased their spend as well.
So I think we feel good about where the campaign's working. It's all predicated on Esurance building a customer value
proposition that is differentiated than the competition. And so, I think we'll continue to build that out. But we still have
work to do on the loss ratio, and Gary and the team are all over that, and we continue to expect – I would continue to
expect us to improve the loss ratio throughout this year, but it's going to come with some pressure on the top line.
<Q - Bob Glasspiegel>: Okay. And final question is, what free cash was generated from your Life company? Is it
consistent with what your earlier guidance was going to be?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Bob, you mean free cash on the sale of Lincoln Benefit.
<Q - Bob Glasspiegel>: Yes.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Or free cash in total? It's consistent with what we thought it would be, which was $1
billion of freed-up capital, but we got a – as you know, we got to move it through the system to get it up to the holding
company.
<Q - Bob Glasspiegel>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question is from Josh Stirling of Bernstein. Sir, your question, please?
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the call. So I wanted to ask you a question to follow up
on Bob's question on Esurance. So just to be clear, you guys have doubled your ad spend at least in the sort of recent
run rate. I'm wondering if that's sort of a sense of how you expect to continue to spend money in Esurance? And as we
think about looking at the profitability of the business going forward, should we expect you to continue to spend that
kind of money? And as we think about sort of total earnings, is this the sort of thing that pays off over the next year or
two? Or are we going to be lagging sort of the additional ad spend in terms of Esurance-driven profitability and

Esurance-driven underlying growth for some time? Thank you.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Good morning, Josh. Thanks for the question. Let me split into a couple of pieces.
When we launch a new advertising program that's trying to get new features across, we invest heavier upfront in that
than we would on a continuing basis. So you saw that, whether that's you buy a Super Bowl ad, which is expensive, or
you just buy a lot more media in February, March. We don't disclose what our future advertising program will be,
because that tends to be competitive. But the normal pattern would be you invest heavier upfront, and then you come
back to something that's more sustainable over time. So I wouldn't expect to see it at the same – you shouldn't expect to
see it at the same level for the rest of the year as you would here. But that said we do believe that to the extent we are
writing economic business, we have the earnings capacity as a total company to continue to grow that brand, and we'll
continue to invest to the extent it is economic.
So our commitment is to grow the business in total, to balance between the brands that deliver the right strategy and to
serve each customer. How we move the money around between them, as long as we're meeting our overall underlying
combined ratio commitment to the Street, we feel like we should use the strategic and operating flexibility to drive
what are the ultimate economics for the shareholders, which is discounted cash flow. Is that helpful?
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: Yeah. That's helpful, Tom. Thank you. If I could ask you just sort of bigger question then, sort
of looking beyond the numbers to try to link some of your strategies together. You guys have a very broad product set:
auto, home, accident, health, some traditional life. And a couple of years ago, you were talking about sort of
cross-selling. I think we're seeing you start to do that, obviously at Esurance and Encompass has been successful with
the package for a long time. And you've got sort of voluntary benefits thing working in your Allstate brand. I'm
wondering if you can sort of give us a sense of how big a lever this is, especially in your more mature channels? Will
you actually be able to get any meaningful sort of cross-selling opportunities from selling say voluntary benefits to
P&C or term life and things like that to P&C customers?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: I'll make a general comment, then Matt can talk about the efforts he has undertaken on
what we would call the Trusted Advisor. So, you're right. We do have a broad range of products and portfolios. We're
thrilled actually. You saw that Allstate Benefits has now over 3 million policyholders. That sometimes gets lost by
people. Our Good Hands Roadside is well over 1.5 million customers. So we garner these – and that's a product we
launched like three years ago or something, so we garner these people like with millions, and it tends to get lost
because they are so large. But we do think it is an advantage for us.
We obviously, Don, mentioned the work that Esurance is doing to leverage the skills and capabilities we have as a
company. We have also traded our business-to-business unit under Kathy Mabe. We are just trying to leverage that
broad set of skills and capabilities as it relates to business customers because we've always been highly focused on
consumers. We think we have plenty to offer businesses, particularly small businesses. And so we have a lot of work
going on there. And then, as you point out, in our main channel with the Allstate agencies, we've been working on
having multi-line relationships for as long as I've been here, which is 19 years, and made some progress, but it's always
been one of those areas where we feel like we have much greater potential. And Matt is hard at work on that on Trusted
Advisor piece. Matt, do you want to talk a little about that?
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Sure. Thanks, Tom. So the company as Tom has described it several times before, is really
in an evolutionary status. So we went through a period early on where there was an attempt to create a bundled offering
for our customers, but that was disrupted somewhat by what happened with homeowners for a four-year to five-year
period as we had to do some risk mitigation there. When you take homeowners out of the mix, it really is problematic
to try to create a diverse set of offerings and present a whole bundled offering to your customers.
Now that as you can see, our homeowners business is back in a fully-fledged mode. We're then able to shift out of what
I'd call the subcontractor auto specialist mode to more of a general contractor Trusted Advisor mode for our agency
owners who are able to position themselves as the personal risk advisors for their customers, offering a variety of risk
mitigation and protection products, including not only auto, not only home, but life products, but retirement products,
[indiscernible] (29:59) motorcycle, renters, LPP, the full line of personalized products in life and retirement product
that an individual customer might need and might come to an Allstate agency owner for.

The Trusted Advisor model is based upon some work done by David Maister, the Maister model, that many of you in
consulting and others probably are familiar with that model. And we've begun shifting towards a trust-based advisory
model here and are building the entire system around it, including the technology information capabilities for the
agency owners. The processes, we are doing a fair amount of continuous improvement, re-engineering work to change
some of the workflows. We're doing some work, that we call unbundling the value chain to make sure that our agency
owners are spending their time and energy and their staff is spending the time and energy on things that truly add value
to the customers. When you take all of that and combine it, the impact should be, and we're seeing very encouraging
early signs of it, that they are shifting to more bundled offerings. They are approaching their clients, their customers in
a more holistic manner.
When we look at our new homeowners business, our homeowners new business right now about 80% of it is bundled
with auto. 40% already have an existing auto policy and are purchasing homeowners on top of that, and 40% added a
new auto policy at the same time as they purchased the homeowners policy. That combined with our exceptionally
strong growth trends in our consumer household lines now shows us that our agency owners are now living into that
new model. Life and retirement is going to be more difficult, voluntary benefits I'd put along with that. Just because it's
a different type of business for many of them for the longer-term agents, it's something they are not that familiar with.
For many years, they were used to passing on those leads to others and involving our financial specialists from a
distance in that opportunity, and now we're asking them to work with their financial specialists in a more integrated
manner.
So I think it holds, and Tom thinks this holds great promise for us as a company. I think, it's core to our differentiated
value proposition for the Allstate agency owners, and I think, you should expect to see it receive increasing degree of
emphasis and importance over the next several years.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: Thanks, Matt, Tom, appreciate the thorough answer. Good luck.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Yeah. Thank you. I'm very excited about what Matt's got going there. Besides, as Matt
pointed out, the alignment with customers, we are building stronger local businesses. Those agencies, which are worth
billions of dollars. One of Matt's jobs is also to make those agencies worth more, and to the extent they have a strong
relationship with customers, it makes them more valuable. I'm very excited about what it does for them and for us.

Our next question is from Jay Gelb of Barclays. Your question, please?
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Thank you. First, for the impact of non-Cat weather on the underlying combined ratios in the
quarter, what was that versus a year ago?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Jay Gelb. Matt, do you want, I think, maybe just talk about winter weather frequency.
You're talking about frequency, is that right, Jay?
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Yeah. I mean, the – I'm sure there was a good portion of winter weather that's not included in the
Cat impact. So, I'm just trying to get a better sense of the baseline on the underlying, excluding the impact of non-Cat
weather.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: And that's a really good question, and as you know, we manage our business with
great precision. Matt, can fill you in on that.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Yeah, so, Jay, it's interesting. It was intuitive to all of us that winter weather was going to
have an impact on first quarter, but we wanted to really spend some time looking at it in a granular – at a granular level
to ensure that we weren't just kind of discounting the rise in frequency as the result of winter weather when we weren't
absolutely 100% sure that was the causal factor. So we did some fairly intense work on a state-by-state basis, so let me
give you some facts, because I think rather than just conclusions, the facts should be helpful. And I'll do it on Auto and
I'll do it then on Home for you.

So when you look at physical damage frequency for total Auto, it was – the increase was driven entirely by states that
experienced increased snowfall or dramatically lower temperatures that caused icing. So, let me give you a breakdown
there. We had 25 states, and we did this comparison by month by state comparing this year's snowfall and temperature
with last year's snowfall and temperature, looking for statistically significant deviations and what the impact was on
frequency. We had 25 states that had increased snowfall and elevated frequency, and those 25 states represented about
55% of our premium in If. The first quarter of PD frequency in those states was 7% above the three-year average. If
you look at the 10 states with the largest increase in snowfall, that account for 25% of the total lift. They contributed
over 50% of the unfavorable variance and frequency.
So that's just on the snowfall side. Now look at the temperature side, which as I said caused unexpected icing. There we
had 32 states with colder temperatures. That includes 24 of the 25 snowfall states. For some reason, Wyoming was an
outlier there. That represented 60% of premium in If and there too we had a 7% rise in three-year – above our
three-year average for PD frequency. And if you look at those 10 states with the largest decrease in temperature, they
contributed over 75% of the unfavorable variance in frequency. So clearly, the frequency actually improved in the rest
of the country that wasn't impacted by statistically significant increased snowfall or dramatically lower temperatures.
We did the same thing on the Homeowner side. And remember, Homeowners, we basically experienced three major
winter impacts, frozen pipes in the Eastern half of the company – country, fire losses from heating sources in the South,
especially in Georgia and Texas; and ice damming from temperature fluctuations in the Midwest. And now the non-Cat
examples of those, the space heaters, the fire, the ice damming, many of the frozen pipe claims, would not come as
Cats, they would show up in underlying due to reporting delays. It's hard to attach them to one particular storm or
event, and as you know house fires aren't Cats either.
So you look at the impact there, 30 states with colder temperatures and higher loss ratios, representing 70% of the
premium in If. That was a 16% loss ratio increase including Cat, so fairly significant. One other little factoid for you,
we had more freeze claims in January alone than the previous 24 months combined, which is a fairly significant
occurrence, and the biggest one was the January 2 freeze event in the Midwest to Northeast down to Georgia. So again,
if you take out those areas impacted by the lower temperatures that caused the house fires, the frozen pipes, and the ice
damming, the loss ratio actually improved in the rest of the country. Did I answer your question, Jay?
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Yes. And just back on the original point, what was the – can you quantify the impact of non-Cat
weather in that underlying combined ratio of 88.4?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Matt, gave you the impact on frequency, we haven't taken it so close to say it's x points
to the combined ratio. I would say when you go above all that, if you look at the auto combined ratio, it's 93 to 94
depending on which one you want to use, whether it's underlying or reported. And so we covered it that way, or if you
look at homeowners, what we've done with homeowners is it's combined ratio was 87 on a recorded basis. So, while it
clearly some effect, and you would expect it in the bar chart, so we don't want to – weather happens every quarter.
Sometimes it happens in January and February and it's cold, sometimes it's fog, sometimes it's other things. So we don't
want to act like you should ignore the impact of weather. We still are responsible for an overall combined ratio, what
Matt gave you was the information to help you see that we don't think the bump in the underlying combined ratio up is
a sustainable bump due to general trends around the country, which are not weather related. But I don't want you also to
just take it out and say that next quarter we're not going to have weather, because we'll have weather every quarter.
Does that make sense?
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Absolutely. And then just a quick follow-up on Esurance. I mean, it looks like the company is
looking to raise rates to address the loss ratio issue, but at the same time ad spend is also going up, so how do you sort
of clarify those two countervailing issues?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: How about we want it all. We want to grow and we want to make money.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Fair enough. Thank you.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: I'm looking at Don as I say that.

Your next question is from John Hall of Wells Fargo. Your question, please?
<Q - John A. Hall>: Good morning, everyone. My first question has to do with Allstate Financial. During the quarter,
there was a quite significant drop in the expenses over there. I was just wondering if you could comment on sort of the
profit profile of Allstate Financial going forward ex LDL, and whether that drop in expenses is a permanent stair step
down?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Okay. Don will take that.
<A - Don Civgin>: Yeah, let me first address the LDL question. It's – we had about $34 million of operating income in
the quarter that was related to LDL. And so obviously going forward that business is no longer part of Allstate. As it
relates to expenses, given that we reduced the size of our business pretty substantially, you should expect – you should
expect that expenses will come down. We've been hard at work during the last six or nine months on expenses. A lot of
it is driven by the head count. The fact is we're running a smaller business, we're running a simpler business. Matt and
Tom talked earlier about advancing the Allstate customer value proposition with the Trusted Advisor, and Allstate
Financial over the last 10 years or so has been in a lot of distribution channels.
That takes a lot of resources, a lot of effort. With the conclusion of the LDL transaction, we are now committed 100%
to the Allstate customer. There's only one channel. We are all in on the Trusted Advisor model. So we are changing our
expense structure and our organization around to simplify it. Quite honestly, we make the adjustments we need to,
because we simply can't spend the way we did two or three years ago. And we've been successful at. We've also had
benefits from lower pension expense from what we did last year and some shared service expenses and so forth as well.
It isn't all just what we've done, but, yeah, we are committed to getting the expenses down so we can maintain our
profitability.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: John, there's a paragraph in the Q that does a good job of breaking out the three
components of that, which when you get a chance, you – we can direct you to it.
<Q - John A. Hall>: Great. Thank you. And then just following up on the homeowners, if I look at the ads that you
guys have been running, fire, kitchen – kitchen fire, and return of mayhem as a cleaning person, it seems that you're
actually targeting homeowners rather directly. Should we be expecting homeowners to go from the negative PIF to a
positive PIF over the near-term?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: I would agree with everything you've said other than perhaps near-term. We're
obviously working and masking this hard work as we talked about in Trusted Advisor and driving that. We've not yet
called when we think that negative will become positive, but obviously with what we've done with the Homeowners
business, we'd like to turn it into a growth initiative as well.
<Q - John A. Hall>: Great. Thank you.

Our next question is from Vinay Misquith of Evercore. Your question, please?
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Hi. Good morning. The first question is really on the loss trends versus the earned premiums.
The last four quarters, the loss trends seem to be up around 1.9% to 2.4% on the Allstate brand Auto, and the earned
premiums I believe are up around 0.7%. So now you guys are taking pricing up 2.4% now, so that should be a positive
for the future. Just curious as to whether we should expect pressure on margins, at least in the near term, while the
earned premiums catch up with the loss trends.

<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Vinay, this is Tom. I'll ask Matt to deal with both, where he feels they are in pricing
and loss cost trends in auto in general. We do read all of your – everybody's stuff, and earlier this morning, we were
trying to figure out your 1.9%. So, we couldn't, so we'll get back to you on the specific on the 1.9% after the call, but
Matt can talk in general about both where he feels the businesses is and what he's doing to make sure we keep in line
with our second priority, which is to maintain underlying combined ratios.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Good morning, Vinay. We're overall feeling very good about where we stand in auto in the
underlying and our margin, and our capabilities for continued growth and maintenance of good profitability. As I've
talked about on previous calls, we really run the auto business by geography, not solely as one large system. And it's
managed on a real-time basis by quite competent teams at the market operating committee level, who are aware of
what's going on in each geography, watching trends emerge, looking at regulatory issues, watching demographics and
other factors, and making calls on a day-to-day basis to ensure we are staying ahead of those trends to the extent we
can, and that we are maintaining the margins.
And as I said before, we break down our combined ratio and our loss ratio in what I would call almost agonizing detail.
We know what's happening there, we're not surprised by any, and we feel confident that we're approaching it in a
rational way. But we are, as I've said, also previously, trying to optimize the point between growth and profitability to
ensure we're able to continue the kind of growth that we've been experiencing recently. We just had, in terms of new
business production, one of the best total auto quarters since 2001. We like that. Retention is up significantly, and it has
been up for a steady period of time now. We like that and we're balancing our desire to grow, capture market share, and
retain profitability and ensure we meet all of the commitments we've made regarding our underlying combined ratio.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Okay, that's helpful. The second question was on the net investment income on the P&C
portfolio, and I'm looking at it ex-prepays and litigation and we actually saw a stabilization in the interest bearing
securities there and a stabilization in the yield. Are you doing something now more positive in the sense that changing
the asset mix there, where you'll see a stable yield and is your move away from longer-duration to shorter duration
securities or instead we'll see more stable net investment income from here on out?
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Vinay, Judy will answer that question. Let me make sure I get the math right. So the
stabilization, are you talking about the earned yield fourth quarter of 2013 to first quarter of 2014, or.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Yes.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Stabilization – okay, yeah, because it is down about 20 basis points versus a year ago.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Yes, yes.
<A - Judith P. Greffin>: So there is stabilization. And as Tom mentioned, over the past year, we have moved to
shorten the duration in the portfolio. And that work is largely done. So when you look at the portfolio at this point,
we've got a duration a little bit under three years. And we plan to stay there for the time being. So, it isn't necessarily a
change in the mix. It's more that we've done the work that we wanted to do. We're going to continue to see the impact
of the work that we did last year in terms of year-over-year, but quarter-over-quarter it has largely stabilized where we
are today. And the portfolio yield is down, so the differential between where we are investing today and the portfolio
yield isn't as great as it would have been a few years ago.
<Q - Vinay Misquith>: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.

Our next question is from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Your question, please?
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: Thanks. Tom, I wanted to ask a little bit about the other personal lines business. I mean,
it's come up a little bit more recently in some of the calls. A couple of billion dollar book, I mean, it looks like now
three-quarters of double-digit growth, margins are in mid- to high-80%s on an underlying basis. I wanted just to get a
little bit better understanding of what's in there. I mean I guess specifically, it looks like the growth is coming from

Dealer Services and Roadside. What are the margins in those businesses specifically? And are those higher, if you can
tell us higher margin business than the rest of the stuff that's in there? Thanks.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Okay. I'll make just some general comments, and then Kathy can talk specifically
about what we're doing in Roadside and Dealer Services. But, first, when you go all the way up, in other personal lines,
there's lots of other stuff in there. So there's a number of consumer household products where the personal umbrella
policies, mainly the policies Matt talked about, that fit inside that organization and are fully integrated with the way we
deal with our agencies, just like auto, home, and everything else. And those businesses, Matt mentioned, are also
growing well, so renters and some other things are having a good year there.
In addition to that, as you point out, we have a number of other really strong and significant businesses that oftentimes
don't get the attention that auto and home do. So, one of those would be Roadside. The other would be Dealer Services.
Roadside, we have really three parts to that business. There's our standard – our motor club policies we sell for a fee.
Then we have our Good Hands Roadside, where it's pay when you use it. That's why I mentioned we have over 1.5
million customers in it. And then there's our wholesale business. Kathy can talk about, that business has grown quite
rapidly in that third piece and she can talk about what she's doing there and what we need to do in terms of profitability
there. Then Dealer Services sells extended warranties and things through dealers. That's also a pretty large business.
That's a longer tail business, so the profitability as you have to – it burns in over time and she can talk about what we
have going there as well.
<A - Katherine A. Mabe>: Thank you. And thank you, Michael. With regard to Roadside, Tom talked about the
different components. Inside that in terms of its profitability, the business is growing rapidly. The wholesale business is
less profitable than what we call the retail business, or the Allstate segment of the business. So in the short term, we are
focused on slowing the growth a little bit in the wholesale side, while we focus on increasing the profitability of that
segment. At the same time, we are taking steps to aggressively grow the Allstate branded part of Roadside, which is
highly attractive. And we're doing that. Matt talked about the Trusted Advisor. That's a component, a piece that we
want to sell through the Allstate agency distribution force.
With regard to Dealer Services, there are a number of things going on there. It is a rapidly growing business. Most of
the growth is coming from the vehicle service contract portion of the business. We feel that it's adequately priced,
although we are taking steps to make sure that we're getting the profit margin that we need on that business and
working aggressively to pursue that. We love some of the synergies that we see in Dealer Services with regard to the
property casualty business as well and some the other businesses within B2B.
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: I guess the question is I mean, you've seen them really – I mean just looking at your
supplement, those two have seen the lion's share of growth in other personal lines over the last – at least quarter or over
the last year. And over the past couple of years, the underlyings have come down and really kind of settled into that
80%s, low 90%s sort of range. I'm just wondering like are the areas that are growing, are those just more profitable
than the others? Or is there something else that's happening at the same time that these two areas are growing that's
caused that profitability to kind of settle in? Thanks.
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: I think where Kathy was the wholesale business it grew quite rapidly. We picked up
GM, which is a giant account and actually that business is not as profitable as the other businesses. That's actually
reduced our overall profitability. In the Dealer Services business, we like the profitability. We think it's decent, we
think it's got good pricing, and its growth is profitable. I think, Michael, there may be some other pieces in there in
terms of what we're doing in renters, and personal umbrella policies, so I would say let us help you – we'll dissect that
for you. Because I think you're looking at a broader combined ratio measure than just the business which we're talking
about.
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: Got it. Okay, great. Thank you.

Our next question is from Meyer Shields of KBW. Your question please?
<Q - Meyer Shields>: Thanks. One nit-picky question. The corporate expenses went down slightly year-over-year, but
were down significantly from the fourth quarter. Is the first quarter number a good run rate going forward?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: You're talking about the corporate expense line we've broken out. So there's – yeah,
interest expense is down some, and then there are some shared service costs that rattle through there in pension and
other things that are down in terms of – remember last year, we took a big shot because we restructured the pension
plans, added to the balance sheet and as a result of, we took the liability down and it reduced our expenses by well over
$100 million a year. So part of that rattles through, but a large part of that also, as Don mentioned, is allocated back out
to him, which is a good thing, because it gets reflected in the profitability of our businesses. But there's no big trends
going on in corporate I guess would be the answer. Once you get through the capital restructuring plan, you've got to
look at the preferred dividends relative to interest expense because that shows up in a different line item, so.
<Q - Meyer Shields>: Okay. That's helpful. Bigger picture I guess. Is there a timeframe for expanding the target focus
of the Encompass to maybe attack a more broad segment of the independent agency customer base?
<A - Thomas Joseph Wilson>: Our current strategy with Encompass is to continue to roll out and expand the package
policy, because we think we have room geographically to do that and room within some of the agencies to do it, that we
exist to do business with. And while we're doing that, we're still working to improve profitability in some of the states.
So we've actually shrunk, Meyer, what we would call the segment business, which is the standalone auto policy over
the last four years or five years. Over time, I believe you're right, that we know how to price auto, we ought to be
backing expanding that business. But right now, it's not on our list of priorities.
<Q - Meyer Shields>: Okay. Great. Thanks very much.

Our final question is from Adam Klauber of William Blair. Your question, please?
<Q - Adam Klauber>: Thanks. Good morning. The BI severity was pretty low, it's been trending down. Is that more
Allstate-specific actions? Or is that some market phenomena?
<A - Steven E. Shebik>: It's hard answer what the market phenomenon is, but Matt might want to talk some about the
actual results we have.
<A - Matthew E. Winter>: Yes. I think, boy, that's an interesting question to try to break it down from the entire
market. We have, as I said before, we've taken a fair amount of effort to look at this on a state-by-state basis and
manage it as well as we could. There's always geographic mix issues and policy limit checks and other things that
impact that. And I guess, I would say, I don't believe that we've done anything dramatic recently to indicate a trend line
that you should read into this.

<A - Steven E. Shebik>: So remember, part of the trend is Florida. We had some profit issues in Florida and New
York, they tend to be higher BI states. And so, at that point, you've really got to look at it by states. And I would say if
you go all the way up, Adam, to the extent our BI cost severities go up, frequency goes up in BI or the same with PD
frequency or severity, we reflect that in our pricing, and all of it is manageable. If you look at our average pricing,
we're feeling pretty good about it.
