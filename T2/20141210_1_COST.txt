MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Erika and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome
everyone to the Q1 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise.
After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.
And I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Richard Galanti, CFO. Mr. Galanti, you may begin your conference.
Richard A. Galanti
Thank you, Erika. Good morning to everyone. This morning's press release reviews our first quarter of fiscal 2015
operating results for the 12 weeks ended November 23. I'll start by stating that the discussions we're having will include
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and that these
statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual events, results, and/or performance to differ materially
from those indicated by such statements. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those outlined in
today's call as well as other risks identified from time to time in the company's public statements and reports filed with
the SEC.
To begin with, our first quarter operating results for the quarter, as you saw, we – our reported earnings came in at
$1.12 a share, up 17% or $0.16 per share over last year's first quarter earnings of $0.96 a share. A few items of note in

terms of looking at the comparison, within gross margin, which was higher year-over-year in the first quarter by 22
basis points, we benefited from strong margins in our gasoline business, which I'll speak to more when I discuss our
gross margin results. And we also had a $17 million pre-tax non-recurring lawsuit recovery. This latter $17 million
amount represented about six basis points of margin improvement or about $0.03 to our per share earnings.
Interest income and other, you'll note, was higher year-over-year in the first quarter by $17 million pre-tax or about
$0.03 a share. This increase primarily related to several of our foreign operations using FX contracts to lock in U.S.
dollar denominated merchandise payables. Under GAAP, the mark-to-market gains or losses, in this case, of course,
gains, are recorded on the interest income and other income statement line. I really look at this as part of merchandising
gross margin in the sense that our foreign operations buyers lock in exchange rates at prices – at amounts which they're
comfortable they'll be able to price their merchandise at.
Third, FX. In the first quarter, as you probably are aware, the foreign currencies, where we operate, overall, weakened
versus the U.S. dollar, primarily in Canada and Japan, resulting in our foreign earnings in the first quarter when
converted into U.S. dollars being lower by about $22 million pre-tax or $0.03 a share than those earnings would have
been had FX exchange rates been flat year-over-year.
Fourth item, stock expense. That was higher year-over-year in the first quarter by $38 million or $0.06 a share. As I've
mentioned before, we have over 4,000 of our assistant managers and above who receive restricted stock units as a
significant part of their annual compensation. These grants are made annually each October or in the first fiscal quarter.
These RSU grants then typically vest over a five-year period with accelerated vesting when the recipient reaches 25
years, 30 years, or 35 years of employment with the company. Factors driving this increase included, of course, the
appreciation in our stock price, additional levels of accelerated vesting, giving some employees' long tenure with the
company and large number of employees in the plan. I should note that, last October, RSU grants were reduced by an
average of 15%. That is the number of RSUs granted to each recipient.
Fifth, IT modernization costs. As discussed in each of the past eight or so fiscal quarters' earnings calls, our major IT
modernization efforts continue to negatively impact our SG&A expense percentages through 2015 and into, probably,
the first half of 2016, especially as these new systems are placed into service and depreciation begins. In the first
quarter, on an incremental year-over-year basis, these incremental costs impacted SG&A by $12 million or an
estimated three basis points or $0.02 a share.
Turning to our first quarter sales. In terms of sales for the quarter, our 12-week reported comp sales figures for Q1
showed a 5% increase. On a reported basis, 6% in the U.S. and 1% internationally. As indicated in our release,
excluding gas price deflation and the impact of FX, the 6% U.S. would have been a 7%, the 1% international would
also have been a 7%, and therefore, the 5% for the total company reported on a normalized basis would have been a
7%. And as reported last Thursday, our November sales results for the four-week month ended November 30, our comp
sales increase, excluding again the impact of FX and gas, were even a bit stronger than these 12-weeks figures with
total company comps on that normalized basis a increase of 8%, which included a 9% in the U.S. and a 7%
international, ex gas and FX.
Other topics of interest, our opening activities and plans. We opened eight new locations during the first quarter, which
ended November 23, six locations in the U.S., our seventh location in Australia, and our second location in León,
Mexico. During the first quarter, we also relocated one location in Wayne, New Jersey to an expanded location. Also,
during the quarter, about six weeks prior, we had experienced a severe hurricane around our Cabo San Lucas, Mexico
location, that has since been reopened. We have no openings planned for Q2. For all of fiscal 2015, however, we have a
current plan of 31 new locations, 18 locations of which will be in the U.S., three locations each in Japan and Mexico,
two locations each in Australia and Korea, and one location each in Canada, U.K., and Taiwan.
Also this morning, I'll review with you our e-commerce activities, our membership trends, additional discussion about
gross margin, SG&A in the quarter and just a few other topics of interest. Now, on to the discussion of our quarterly
results. Again, sales – total sales were up 7.4% to $26.3 billion. Again, on a comp basis, reported a 5%. Ex gas and FX,
it would have been a 7%. For the quarter, our reported 5% comp was a combination of an average transaction size of
just over flat for the quarter. Ex gas and FX, it would have been up about 2.5%; and average frequency increase of

about 4.5% in the quarter.
In terms of comparisons by geographic region. Geographically, for the quarter, the Midwest and Southeast were the
strongest with Northeast close behind. Internationally, in local currencies, the better performing countries were Canada,
Taiwan, and Mexico. In terms of merchandise categories for the quarter – for the first quarter within foods and
sundries, which was up in the mid-single digits, candy, deli, and spirits were up with relative standouts. Within
hardlines, they were also up in the mid-single-digits for the quarter. Majors are electronics came in positive for the
quarter, actually in the high-single-digits range and, in addition, better-performing departments within hardlines was
hardware, sporting goods, and tires. Within mid-single-digit softline, domestics, apparel, and home furnishings were
the standouts, and fresh foods where our comps were in the high-singles, with meat department being the standout
there.
Moving to the line items in the income statement. The first quarter membership fees were up 6% or $33 million to $582
million. Given the sales strength, that was about a three basis points decline. Again, ex FX, that 6% dollar increase,
assuming flat year-over-year FX, would have been up 8%. In terms of membership, we continue to benefit from strong
signups at existing and new warehouses, continued increasing penetration of the Executive Member, and strong
renewal rates both in the U.S. and Canada as well as worldwide in newer markets.
Our new membership signups in Q1 year-over-year company-wide were up 4% year-over-year in the quarter. Even
though there were fewer locations opened, we opened nine locations in Q1 this year versus 13 locations last year. That,
of course, includes all member signups – new member signups throughout the company. In terms of new number of
members at Q1 end, we began the fiscal year or ended last fiscal year with 31.6 million Gold Star Members. We now
had, at this quarter end, 32.1 million, so up about 0.5 million. Primary business remained at 6.9 million, add-on
business remained at 3.5 million. So all told, we went from 42 million member households to 42.5 million. And
including additional cardholders went from 76.4 million at fiscal year end to 77.5 million at the end of the first quarter.
Also at Q1 end, paid Executive Memberships totaled 15.2 million, which was an increase during the 12 weeks of about
420,000 or about 35,000 a week increase in the quarter. Executive Members, as you know, represent more than a third
of our membership base and over two-thirds of our sales and operation.
In terms of renewal rates, they continue strong. At the end of the fourth quarter, Business Memberships renewed at
94.4%. At Q1 2015, so 12 weeks later, at 94.5%, so up a tick. Gold Star remained at 89.8%. Total, 90.6% at fiscal year
end and 90.7% at Q1 end. And when I say total, that's U.S. and Canada, recognizing newer markets start out at lower
rates and build over the first several years. Worldwide, we remained at 87.3% in the fourth quarter and at Q1 end, still a
nice increase from a year earlier at the end of the first quarter last year. That 87.3% that we ended the quarter with now
was at 86.5% worldwide.
As I touched on last quarter's conference call, we continue to try new things to drive sales and membership signups. I
did mention in this fiscal quarter but on the last call in early September, for eight days we ran a nationwide promotion
for new members on LivingSocial. It was a good value, and we felt worked pretty well, but we'll continue to look and
see what we want to do going forward. No plans at this point.
Going onto the gross margin line. Gross margins, as you saw, were quite strong, up 22 basis points to 11.03%. Again,
I'll ask you to jot down a few numbers. We'll have four columns. The first two columns are for the entire fiscal year
2014, both reported and without gas deflation, and then first quarter 2015 would be columns three and four, reported
and without gas deflation. Moving across those columns, core merchandise for the year was up six basis points on a
reported basis and up three basis points ex gas deflation. For the quarter, it was down six basis points and down 13
basis points without gas deflation.
Ancillary, plus six basis points and plus six basis points in columns one and two for the all of last fiscal year, in Q1
2015 reported plus 22 basis points and without gas deflation plus 20 basis points. 2% reward, minus 1 basis points
across the four columns. LIFO year-over-year and for all of last fiscal year was a minus five basis points and a minus
five basis points. We actually had a very small LIFO credit this year versus a very small LIFO charge last year in the
quarter, so it's a plus one basis point and a plus one basis point. Lastly, other or adjustments are minus two basis points
and minus two basis points in all of fiscal 2014 and plus six basis points and plus seven basis points without gas

deflation for Q1. That's that one time – that non-recurring lawsuit recovery that I mentioned earlier. So total reported
was up 22 basis points for the quarter and up 14 basis points without gas deflation.
Now the core merchandise I mentioned is, again, on a reported basis, was down six basis points and down 13 basis
points ex gas. A lot of that, again, is driven by particularly this success in the gas business, both in volume as well as
margin contribution – where the gas margins were up when gas prices would go down typically. Core gross margins as
a percent of their own sales were slightly negative, a couple of basis points down year-over-year, with food and
sundries and softlines showing year-over-year improvement, and hardlines and fresh foods gross margins being lower
year-over-year in the quarter, pretty much as what we planned – what we continue to see in the fresh foods area with
some of the raw material costs going up.
Ancillary and other business gross margins, as I mentioned, was up 22 basis points or up 20 basis points without gas
deflation. With the exception of slightly lower year-over-year pharmacy margins, most of the other ancillary
businesses, starting with gasoline, of course, but optical, hearing aid, travel, business centers all showed higher margins
year-over-year on the quarter. 2% reward, again, increasing penetration represented a basis point hit to margin. And as I
mentioned, LIFO was a one basis point swing. We had $1 million LIFO charge last year in the quarter and a small
LIFO credit of about $2 million this year.
Moving into SG&A. Our SG&A percentage year-over-year in the quarter was higher by four basis points, coming in at
10.26% this year compared to a 10.22% last year in the quarter. Again, we'll do the same four columns for all of fiscal
2014, both reported and without gas deflation. Columns three and four, the first quarter both reported and without gas
deflation. Going across these line items, operations were a minus two basis points and a plus one basis point for the
year and a plus eight basis points and a plus 16 basis points for the quarter. Remember, pluses means lower
year-over-year SG&A. Central, minus three basis points and minus three basis points in the year and minus one basis
point and minus one basis point in the quarter. Stock compensation, minus two basis points and minus two basis points
for the year and minus 11 basis points and minus 11 basis points for the quarter. And total would be, again, for reported
for all of fiscal 2014, SG&A was higher year-over-year by seven basis points; without gas deflation, higher by four
basis points. This year, in the first quarter, it was higher by four basis points reported and better or lower by four basis
points without gas deflation.
And a little elaboration on this, core operations, SG&A again was lower by eight basis points but lower by 16 basis
points ex gas impact. Within operations and without gas, our payroll SG&A percentage was nine basis points better
year-over-year, a particularly good showing and certainly a reflection of strong sales as well as strong gas sales which
have lower SG&A, while benefits and workers' comp related expenses were about four basis points worse
year-over-year.
Central expense was slightly higher year-over-year in the quarter by a basis point. Increased IT spending as we
continue to monetize, as I mentioned, within this number, that was about minus three basis points, and that'll continue
in those types of increments we think. The increase was partially offset, of course, by improved payroll in central as
well as by two basis points. Finally, SG&A expense related to stock compensation was higher year-over-year by 11
basis points. I should point out that the year-over-year basis points variance for this expense item will be quite a bit less
in Qs two and three and higher year-over-year in Q4, but not as big negative as variance as we've seen in Q1. Again, if
you think about it, with most of the RSUs vesting over five years, you take out the one that finally vested, so you take
out an expense back when the stock was in the $50s and you add one when the stock was in the $125, $130s when we
did the one in October this year.
All told – hold on – oh, here, last thing, on the income statement, pre-opening expense, $24 million last year. It was
lower or better improvement by $9 million, so $15 million this year. Again, we opened nine units this year compared to
13 units last year. So all told, reported operating income for the quarter totaled $668 million last year and $770 million
this year or an increase of 15% or up $102 million for the quarter.
Below the operating income line, reported interest expense was about the same year-over-year with Q1 2015 coming in
at $26 million versus $27 million last year in the quarter. Interest income and other, as I mentioned earlier, was quite a
bit higher year-over-year, $18 million last year versus $35 million this year or up $17 million. Actual interest income

component for the quarter was slightly up. I think it was a little less than $1 million. The other component of equity
earnings within this line item was higher by [ph] $16 million (16:35). This again relates to this marking to market gains
on FX contracts used to source U.S. merchandise – principally our U.S. merchandise in our international operations.
Overall, pre-tax income was up 18% versus last year's quarter, from $659 million last year to $779 million this year. In
terms of tax rates, our effective tax rate this quarter came in a little higher than last year. It came in at a 35.2%
compared to last year's first quarter rate of 34.6%. The increase was mostly due to a few net discrete items that
benefited last year by about $5 million and a couple of negative discrete items which totaled about an increase in taxes
of about $1 million this year. Overall, net income was up 17% versus last year's first quarter, from $425 million last
year to $496 million this year.
A quick rundown of a couple of other topics. Balance sheet, depreciation and amortization for the quarter came in at
$254 million. In terms of accounts payable as a percent of inventories, you have the balance sheet attached to the press
release. Now, on that, it showed a reported number this year of 101% payables to inventories, up about two percentage
points from 99% last year. That, of course, includes construction payables and other payables, not just merchandise. If
you took out everything and just had merchandise payables as a percent of inventory, last year Q1 end it was 89%, up
three percentage points to 92% this year. Again, I think a reflection of good inventory control but also strong sales.
Average inventory per warehouse. Last year, in the first quarter, ended at $14.453 million. This year, it came in slightly
lower at $14.372 million, about $81,000 lower. If you take out FX, FX was about a minus $250,000 – $250,000 to that
number. So if you take out FX, we were actually up average inventory per warehouse of about $169 million, still a very
small increase, 1.2% on that normalized basis, compared to the 7% plus sales increase. No real issues with inventory
levels going into the last few weeks before our calendar year end and Christmas and the holidays. They're in good
shape.
In the past couple of months, we have received questions about possible inventory issues due to the work slowdowns in
shipping along the West Coast. I'm sure, like many retailers, we did what we could do to bring in seasonal merchandise
a little early, if required and necessary. Overall, it was not a big issue for November and December, and is not currently
a big issue. Looking ahead into January and February, it's really not a big issue, perhaps even a small issue from
seasonal furniture and some other types of items like that. Been talking to the merchants – not big delays, but a little bit
of a backup.
In terms of CapEx, first quarter 2015, we spent $555 million. Our fiscal 2015 CapEx is estimated to be in the $2.5
billion-plus range. This compares to last year's $2 billion, so up pretty significantly year-over-year with our ramp-up
and expansion and all the complementary things that go along with that, with depot expansion and of course the IT
expenses that I just mentioned as well.
In terms of dividends, our quarterly dividend of $0.355 a share, or $1.42 annualized, based on shared outstanding, is
about $625 million annually. We did buy a little stock back in Q1, about $18 million, at an average price of $126.43. In
the first, I believe, five weeks of this quarter we were under blackout from the prior year with – until we were able to
report first quarter, and so we didn't buy heck of a lot during the quarter.
Costco Online, we're now in four countries: U.S., Canada, U.K., and Mexico. For the quarter, sales and profits were up
over the year. E-commerce sales were up 20%, up 19% on a comp basis, and up 21% excluding FX. It still represents
about 3% of our total sales – just under 3%. We continue to – from really going back a couple years ago when we
re-platformed the site, we've gone through a couple of iterations of improving our mobile applications. As I think I
mentioned earlier, we've combined some of our e-commerce merchandise efforts with our in-line efforts, we think
that's been a big help to us. We've added a few categories like apparel, health, and beauty aids and a few
extra-curricular signature items. We've certainly improved timing of shipment by shipping what we ship directly
instead of from the manufacturer from one depot to a few depots around the country.
Our international markets – stay tuned, maybe one additional country by the fiscal year end 2015, certainly, at least one
by the end of calendar 2015.

In terms of a few other things that we've talked about in the past, Google Shopping Express, it's now being offered in
six markets in the U.S.: Bay Area, which is now geographically expanded from its initial testing about 10 months ago;
the Los Angeles area; New York City, Manhattan; and more recently in October the test continued into three new
cities, Chicago, D.C., and Boston. Again, it's too early to completely tell, but we're seeing some increased overall spend
and it's been a good partner to work with, with Google. We continue to increase our offerings in categories in these
tests as well.
Instacart, it's now in 13 markets. This is where customers of Instacart order through Instacart, they come in and buy the
merchandise and deliver it to the customer. That's continuing to expand as well. And Boxed is now in three markets, I
think, up from two. Lastly, I think you saw a release, or maybe we talked about it. It was Alibaba Tmall in being
shipped out of our Taiwan operations, we're shipping – I think we're up to about 125, 130 items. Mostly various food or
sundries or HABA related items, about half of them are Kirkland Signature. It's great, but it's new and we'll see where it
goes from here. But, certainly, getting our name known a little bit over there as well.
In terms of expansion, as I mentioned, we've got a lot going – nothing going on in Q2. Just a few in Q3. We have five
openings, although two of them are relocations, so net of three. And we've got 20 planned for the 16-week fourth
quarter. Most of those look pretty good at this point, it's just how they – the timing of them. In fiscal 2014 – for all of
fiscal 2014, which ended, of course, at the end of August, we added 29 units, or about a 5% unit square footage growth.
In 2015, assuming we add the 30 units to 31 units, on a base of 663 units, we would – that would also be about a 5%
square footage growth. If we get to 31 units, it will be 18 units in the U.S., three units each in Japan and Mexico, two
units each in Australia and Korea, and one unit each in Canada, U.K., and Taiwan. So you asked for square footage
numbers, at Q1 end total square footage stood at 96.437 million square feet.
With that, I'm going to turn over to Erika for any questions. Thank you.
Q&A
Operator
[ph] Perfect. Certainly (23:50). [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with
Guggenheim Securities.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: So, Rich, I wanted to drill down a little bit on gross by category. So two were up, two
were down. The two that were down – so fresh food and hardline – was fresh food was solely pass-through of inflation
and was hardlines entirely mix?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Fresh foods was certainly inflation and us holding prices, like, you know we do.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Yeah.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Things I know – again, sound bite, anecdotal, butter and milk is way up, and so – which is
therefore cheese. And so you've got those types of items. On the other side, some of it's electronics, that's more
competitive. And we're part of that. And so a little of it is mix. But nothing really out of the ordinary.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: And then when you look at the two that were up – and I take it they were not up a lot – is
that solely mix? And where is Kirkland? I guess Kirkland would have a big impact in food and sundries, that's where it
would show up. Is that primarily driving the better mix?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Honestly, I don't have that level of detail in front of me. I'm looking – first of all, none of
the ups or downs were – they were in the 10 basis point to 25 basis point range, basically, up or down, so not a lot of
jumping either way. So my guess is a little of it's mix. KS helps, but clearly KS – the big penetration increase of KS
from 0% to 25% over the last high-teens or 20 years, those increments are smaller now. And so, yes, it helps, but it
doesn't help like the days when you were adding a percentage point or two in a year sometimes.

<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: All right. And then lastly on – you talked about FX and inventory. Even putting that aside,
obviously inventory's under awfully good control. Is that – is more of that in store, or is more of that sort of backstage
between your vendor and the stores?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Keep in mind, if we're turning our inventories 12-plus-times a year, everything's pretty
fast-paced. If you're in Canada or Japan or wherever, and you're buying – a buyer is using FX contracts because they've
got – in most cases, it's U.S. dollar denominated inventory payables. They're going to lock in based on what they've got
coming in, and what they know what they're going to have to pay out in dollars. At a time when they're comfortable
with, based on that conversion rate, they're comfortable with the price point they're going to sell it in their local
currency in that local country. So it's pretty straightforward. In fairness, as you know, some quarters, year-over-year,
it's – some quarters it's a $10 million gain, sometimes it's a $10 million loss. This time it was a little better, I think
partly a reflection of the weakness in the – the strength in the dollar and how quickly that's strengthened particularly in
a couple countries.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: So it's nothing you're doing structurally to take inventory working capital out of the
system?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: No. No, I mean, we do that all – I mean that's just kind of one of the mantras that we try to
do anyway. Mind you – I mean, this is an example from, gosh, 20 years ago in the tobacco business, which is a very
high volume, not as high volume as it used to be, but a very high volume business and a very fast turning business. I
remember years ago, the majors offered, let's say whatever the terms were, X percent discount if paid within seven
days. And then they came back and said, we'll give you an extra half a point if you pay one-day EFT or ACH or
whatever it was, so 0.5% for paying six days earlier. Well, it's a no-brainer, but you take a high volume item like that,
and it goes from probably 100% payable to zero almost. So, I mean, that's an extreme example. You've got gas working
the other way where accounts payable is probably 600% or 700%.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Joshua M. Siber>: Good morning. This is Joshua Siber on for Simeon Gutman. Just curious, looking back, how
are customers reacting to lower gasoline prices? And have you seen any trade-up from regular to premium?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I don't know. I think we sold more premium anyway, but I don't know that off the top of
my head. I think the reflection in our shopping frequency and our comps have continued strong is probably a reflection
of that. Our view, historically, has been on something big like this whether it was when gas was going crazy upward
towards $4 a gallon in early to mid-2008. Did it impact us? It probably impacted us a little bit, but not as much as some
of the dollar type stores or lower demographic stores. Similarly, are we getting a little benefit from it? Yes, but we don't
think it's big either way for us.
<Q - Joshua M. Siber>: Okay. So just looking forward...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It's got to help a little.
<Q - Joshua M. Siber>: Sorry. What was that?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It's got to help a little.
<Q - Joshua M. Siber>: Okay. And then looking forward, if gasoline stays where it's at right now, is there a change in
profitability? Or have we seen the most of it in Q1?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I'll tell you when I know. I mean it's a volatile business, as we know. Generally
speaking, when it's declining is the best in terms of profitability. It is more profitable at any level than it used to be a

little bit, and I think part of that – and again, so it's a profitable business. It's a lower percent of sales profitability than
the company as a whole. I think one thing that's encouraging for us, though, is, is more and more people coming to get
their gas. For those that come in – for every 100 people that pump gas during opening hours, a little over 50 of them
now come in and shop, and so even if one or two of those 50 are incremental, that's a positive. We've been helped two
years in a row now with these outside entities like GasBuddy.com where nationwide on average we are the lowest
price. That's helped. I know our gallon comps in the first quarter were low-single-digits, which is really off the charts in
terms of getting people into our parking lot, and that's good.
<Q - Joshua M. Siber>: Okay. Again, if you don't mind, if I can just add one more; if you could discuss, has there
been a mentality or a strategic shift on the e-commerce front, if you feel you've gotten more aggressive over the past six
months to 12 months?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think the things that I mentioned has probably been over the past six months to 18 months
or 24 months, but certainly we've added a few SKUs, expanded some categories trying to get people to think of it not
just as the place that I can buy patio furniture or a big TV, but also some regular higher velocity items. And so nothing
– I think it's been more – if you look – if I just looked at year-over-year sales increases on a comp basis, it wasn't about
a couple of years ago where it was kind of stuck in the mid-single-digits and last year it was in the high-teens and this
quarter it continues in that very high-teen, [ph] low-20% area (31:46). So I think that's a reflection of the things that
we've done, but nothing new and dramatic in the last six months. It's a continuation of that.
<Q - Joshua M. Siber>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Charles Grom with Sterne, Agee.
<Q - Charles Grom>: Good morning, Richard. Just to clarify on the gross margin grid. Did you say that, ex gas, the
core was down 13 basis points?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: The core's down, but again, it's almost like – under the phrase, no good deed goes
unpunished. Over the years, as I've tried to explain this in a little matrix, you almost need a three-dimensional matrix.
Given that gas was strong and gas gross margins were very strong relative to very low gross margin business, that
disproportionately weights those two lines in that little matrix such that – and that's why I pointed out that if you look at
just food and sundries, hardlines, softlines, and fresh foods, those four core areas which, gosh, I'd better, 80%-plus of
our business, those were – year-over-year, were down two basis points, two of those sub-departments up 10 basis
points to 25 basis points, two of them down 10 basis points to 25 basis points. So the core business is pretty much flat
year-over-year. But it shows on that chart that way because that high dollar penetration of gas.
<Q - Charles Grom>: Okay. So the up two basis points would more or less compared to, say, the up 6 basis points or 7
basis points that you posted in the third and fourth quarter?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah, but it was down two basis points, not up.
<Q - Charles Grom>: I'm sorry, down two basis points. Yeah, okay.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah.
<Q - Charles Grom>: Okay, I get it. On the CapEx guide, you have a big acceleration from this year versus last year,
yet store growth is pretty consistent. Just wondering if you could speak to the delta, is it IT spend? Is it land? Or just
what's driving the increase?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, it's also four more locations including relos. IT's probably at least [ph] $100 million
(33:46) of it. International is more expensive. We probably are spending more this year on depot type stuff. I'm
rounding here, but depot's I bet year-over-year's [ph] $100 million, $150 million (33:59) higher. So probably – but,
year-over-year and the prior year, there was probably [ph] $75 million to $100 million (34:07) in IT. I'm shooting from

the hip here, but the big things are – and certainly, for the year, that [ph] $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion (34:16) number, we
have an original budget probably a little higher than that. But we know that a couple of them will slip, and some of that
assumes land banking for the first part of next year. But, clearly, we are spending more on some of these international
locations in a confident way, frankly. I mean, some of the ones in Asia, as you know, are knock on wood, so far have
been relatively no-brainers.
<Q - Charles Grom>: Okay. Just last question on the balance sheet roughly $17 per share in cash. Any updated
thoughts on getting a little bit more systematic on the buyback from doing so much each quarter, or so much each year
as opposed to setting up the grid? And any thoughts on the current dividend 1% yields a lot lower than some of your
consumer staple peers.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Our board discusses it at every quarterly board meeting. Again, I guess, I've learned that
the matrix works when stocks move slowly either direction. We have had that high quality problem that you put a
matrix in place, and then in some cases we're locked in for five or six weeks due to blackout, and then it moves well
above the several dollars of cushion we gave it. I think we want to be more systematic but I can't say when it will be.
We'll talk to you next quarter. But, certainly, given that we grant to these [ph] 42 or 300 (35:37) employees annual
grants that are just in the high-3s, 3.6 million – 3.8 million shares or something, we want to at least cover that, I think,
on an ongoing basis. And we certainly did not do that on a quarterly basis this quarter. But the year's still young and
we'll see. We'll let you know next quarter.
<Q - Charles Grom>: All right. Thanks a lot. Good luck.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: As it relates to the dividend, again that's a conversation we continue to have and we look at
all of them. And we recognize that our – as first priority is CapEx and then tied for second, if you will, are a few of the
things that we'll continue to look at. I'm sure we'll do some things over time, but they'll be on a timetable that we feel
comfortable with.
<Q - Charles Grom>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Brian W. Nagel>: Hi. Good morning. Nice quarter. Couple of questions, I mean, first off, on gross margins. If
you look at that – you may have discussed in the prepared remarks, I apologize, but the ancillary gross margin benefit
we saw in – again here in Q1. Can you discuss the drivers of that? And how should we think about going to
sustainability of that over the next few quarters?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I mean, the big kahuna was gas. As I mentioned, I think five of six, or five of seven,
or six of seven of our ancillary businesses all had up year-over-year gross margins. Most particularly was gas. And so is
that sustainable? No. It's never sustainable. You see where gas prices are now, so it's continuing. But again, that could
be fleeting. And we've been asked the question, well, when you get these outsized profits, so you're more aggressive in
pricing? We don't sit down and say let's use this many dollars, but certainly we're going to be aggressive and that's what
we do for a living. So I think that buffers it a little bit as well.
<Q - Brian W. Nagel>: So it actually goes into my next question. I think, Richard, you already answered it, but in a
market [indiscernible] (37:41), if we look at Costco gas right now, [indiscernible] (37:43) more from a competitive
standpoint, Costco gas versus competitors, and you typically price below. You're saying that [indiscernible] (37:51)
doing what they've done, you've essentially kept the competitive relationship the same [ph] in the various (37:55)
markets?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: We've improved the competitive relationship in our minds.

Your next question comes from the line of Dan Binder with Jefferies.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Hi. It's Dan Binder. Congrats on a good quarter. Just on the follow up on that gas discussion.
With all the movement in the gallon comps and the pricing, where are we now as a percentage of sales for gas?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I'll have somebody calculate it right now for you. Hold on a second.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Okay. And my other question, if you want to focus on that first, is on consumer electronics.
You talked to a lot of strength there. Any color you can give us around sort of the breadth of that strength, where you're
seeing it, what you're seeing with 4K TV and competitive pricing?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, first of all, as you know, we introduced several Apple products over the last year.
That's a very competitive business for retailers and for us as well. We know that. But we want to have that product for
our members. We – 4K TVs are going well. I believe that, on those higher-end TVs, we tend to be the outlier in terms
of driving sales of those. But it's still small relative to the entire category, that component. Phone business is very
strong. You can see what we've done with our kiosks out there. And not only phone business has been strong, added to
that we've added the Apple brand there as well. And then the various tablets. So there's a lot of different things in that
area that are helping the sales strength. Again, I think, it tends to be a little more competitive, Apple's part of that.
That's pretty much it. Nothing out of the ordinary. I mean it's – these things fluctuate up and down a little bit. We're
pleased of the strength of the comps in that area.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: And then...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Oh, by the way, in terms of the question about gas penetration, for the quarter it was about
10.5%.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Okay. And just a quick question on the cannibalization rate. I know it hasn't really changed
much. I think it's like 50 basis points in any given month on the comp. I was just curious, can you give us an idea of
what you're seeing on the bounce back of those clubs once you cannibalize it? Does it come back to, sort of, historical
volumes within a year, two years? Has that been changing at all as you've been doing more fill-ins?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Generally, it's a year or maybe slightly over a year. I mean, generally, when we open –
when we cannibalize our own units, you might take anywhere as much as 10% or 15% from nearby unit or units. And a
year, year and a half later, you're pretty much back. Going forward, not looking back at the past year, of course. And
again, it varies, but overall it's been pretty predictable for us. Based on ZIP code analysis of where the members are
shopping from, we generally know – and what we find is – the benefit really is, is, do we pick up a few extra members,
yes. Not at lot. We pick up a lot in frequency. If you have a loyal member that's shopping, making these numbers up
but once a month because they're a 30-minute drive away from a Costco and all of a sudden they're a 10-minute drive
away, and it becomes a significantly more regular shopping frequency.
<Q - Daniel T. Binder>: Great. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: It's Meredith Adler. I was wondering – I'm still somewhat new to the Costco story. If you
could talk about where you see the most potential growth? Obviously, you don't have a lot of locations in Continental
Europe, and yet it's tough to get open warehouses there. When you look at Asia, do you feel like you've still got a lot
more growth in those markets? And what about the U.S.?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, if you'd asked me five years ago where we would expect to be now, I would say our
goal was to get up to about 30 locations a year by this time. And probably we'd be right to that middle point of trending

from the majority in the U.S. to less than half in the U.S. If you look at this year and next, it's 30 locations, roughly 30
locations a year, still a little over half in the U.S. I think 16 locations or so last year, and I think I mentioned 18
locations out of 31 locations this year. So that's by the way, a function that we've continued to be successful in, in lots
of, what I'll call newer markets, meaning the markets over the last 10 years to 15 years. And while we'll still get another
unit open in the Puget Sound or perhaps in the Portland area one day or hopefully every year to get another L.A. unit in
the Greater L.A. market of 45 units or 50 units.
But there are precision points now where – locations where we need to go. But we're finding in a lot of these cities,
again whether it's Chicago, Dallas, and Atlanta or smaller cities in Florida and the Carolinas, or new markets like Baton
Rouge and New Orleans last year. So that's probably up to our expectation a little bit about our opportunities here in the
U.S. Outside of the U.S., we've got 10 locations or 11 locations, I believe, in each of Korea and Taiwan, maybe 12
locations. We think that we can go into the mid- to high-20s there over time. But again they takes some time to get
done, and where.
Japan is certainly a bigger market for us. We've got 23 locations, I believe – 22 locations or 23 locations. We should
have a lot more than that. But we've – we went from 9 locations to 21 locations or something in a little over two years
so we're doing well there. And we just, as I mentioned, opened our seventh location in Australia. While Australia is,
what, two-thirds of the size population-wise as Canada, where we have 90 or so units. We have seven units in
Australia. I'm not suggesting we're going have 45 units in Australia any time soon, but certainly we'll get more than
seven units. Western Europe or all of Europe is certainly an opportunity for us.
It is tough to get in. Even in the worst of economies, we've been successful with about four years of effort getting one
unit open in Spain, with the second coming towards the middle to the end of next calendar year. And we're still fighting
to get our first unit open in France. So it takes some time. But we're persistent and we'll be around.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Miller with William Blair.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Hi. Good morning. Slightly different question on gas prices. And my historical recollection is
that when gas prices are high, more consumers might go out of their way to drive to Costco and that that was viewed as
a historical benefit to traffic. But the inverse does not appear to be happening. And so wondering what in your view has
changed, or, I mean, do you think there is a risk if gas prices stay lower that you may not get quite as much a lift in
terms of traffic to the stores as in the past?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think when gas prices were skyrocketing, back in 2008 going up towards $4 for the first
time, we were on the news every night somewhere, whether it was a small town in Montana or Los Angeles, and where
is the best place to buy gas. And so that certainly was a positive. Theoretically, the argument is, is that people – as
prices fall, that will be less of an incentive. I think it's a greater membership value proposition. I mean when
GasBuddy.com comes out and says 40-million-plus inputs from customer – from drivers out there, saying that we're the
best lowest priced nationally by $0.14 or $0.16, that resonates. The fresh foods second to none in our view or biased,
but that drives a lot of business.
The pharmacy, frankly, I think deserves credit we get for that in terms of pricing. So, the fact that – we're proud of the
fact that we take care of our employees. All those things are positives. And I think once you've come to Costco for gas,
and we got you into the warehouse, there's reasons why you want to come back. And I think we're starting to appreciate
the fact that it's all of the above. It's some of the crazy KS items that are KS items, and you've got to buy them at
Costco. Although there are a few other places now you can buy them, but we're selling them to those people.
<Q - Mark R. Miller>: Your traffic just continues to amaze. My other question is on China. And so I understand it's
very early with Alibaba. But I wanted to ask, is there any change in your long-term thinking on China? You did say that
there's a benefit of getting your name known there. I mean, historically, you've had some reservations, but are you –

should we be thinking that club growth is in the future there? And what might inform that? Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah, I think it's in the future, but if you had asked me that same question 10 years ago, I
would say I think it's in the future. And not being cute about it; every couple or three years, senior management, both
international senior management and corporate senior management, goes over there and looks around and we continue
to do that. And we recognize, look, it's a giant market. We're confident about what we do. We're also very hands-on.
And we've got a lot of things going on in a lot of directions, and we kind of know – we know that – everybody says,
well, somebody's getting there first. Well, people have gotten other places first and when we come in, we do just fine.
So it will be at some point, and I don't know when. If you had said, what's the likelihood in the next 5 years to 10

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher M. Horvers>: Thanks. Good morning. So I wanted to follow up on the acceleration in the core
comps over the past year. It seems like most of the acceleration is seen in the hardlines category. So would you agree
with that? Or has there been movements toward the high-end of the ranges that you provide in softlines and fresh foods
and so forth? And within CE, is that TV turning positive, plus the addition of Apple driving the hardlines rebound?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, that's one of the things. I think I mentioned tires have been good this year.
Automotive, lawn and garden have been good. We're out of season in that for now. Apparel has continued to be strong.
I mean we enjoyed a couple of years on a compounded basis, apparel comps probably increases in the mid- to
high-teens, so that, of course, at some point has got to come down a little bit. But the organics is helping. I think, in the
last two years, we've a little more than doubled organic sales from the low billions to closing in on $3 billion currently.
And so that's – all of those things help.
<Q - Christopher M. Horvers>: So – but within the hardlines category, is it – is that TV and Apple essentially that's
driven that acceleration within the major sort of...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I would say TV and Apple are probably the top two, without looking at the details. Phones
are probably in there, too. Phones could be first or second. I don't think that phones are first, but phones, TV, and the
reintroduction of some of the Apple items.
<Q - Christopher M. Horvers>: And when you didn't sell, let's say, iPads, were you selling iPhones in the wireless
kiosks?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yes.
<Q - Christopher M. Horvers>: Okay.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: We are. And by the way, as a comment was made here in my office, those are the big
volume categories, but white goods are up, not that we do a big white goods business. Audio is up. Again, a smaller
business, but we – and that's not just headphones, it's sound systems and all kinds of stuff. But the big volume areas are
those three that I mentioned.
<Q - Christopher M. Horvers>: And was Apple sort of a point-in-time add-back to the store base overall? Or did that
start in, let's say, June and then ramp-up over the past five months?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I think that's right, but it's not – it's a piece of it. It's not the driving piece.
<Q - Christopher M. Horvers>: Understood. Understood. And then on depreciation, can you give us some color how
to think about the depreciation? I know you don't – I don't believe historically you guide to it, but with the incremental
CapEx over the past couple of years, it would seem like dollars per week or dollars per quarter, that'll continue to rise

for, I think, the next couple years. So any color there...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: I hope it continues to rise forever. Probably the simplest way to do it is look at what it's
done for each of the last several years, year-over-year in dollars. My guess it's somewhere around 10%-ish...
<Q - Christopher M. Horvers>: Yeah.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: ...and that's probably as good a guess. Maybe if you want to add a little bit to it for IT
modernization. When we – as you know, over a four-year to five-year period, on an incremental basis, we're probably
spending close to $0.5 billion, that generally – once these different modules and components are put into operation,
they then get amortized over five years to seven years. So maybe that adds a little bit to that $1 billion-plus number.
<Q - Christopher M. Horvers>: And then where does that depreciation tend to show up in terms of the margin
bucket? I know you talked central, but that core as well...
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It's all SG&A – virtually all SG&A.
<Q - Christopher M. Horvers>: Okay. Understood. Thanks very much, Richard.

Your next question comes from the line of Bob Drbul with Nomura Securities.
<Q - Kevin Heenan>: Hi. This is Kevin Heenan on for Bob Drbul. You had called out apparel as being strong within
softlines. I was just wondering if there were any particular categories or brands within apparel that were particularly
strong in the quarter.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It's really all of the above. I mean we have made a conscious – over the last couple of
years, a conscious effort to both with brands and with Kirkland Signature go bigger and deeper. Massing out big
quantities of the stuff, and so it really is all over the board, names that you've come to know like Dockers and Levi's
and Cole Haan, and just a variety of ones. But also the KS, whether it's women's active wear or the men's wool pant,
certainly the five-million-plus KS shirts, men's dress shirts that we sell a year. So it's a lot of things.
<Q - Kevin Heenan>: Cool. Thanks. And then just my last question. We noticed you guys have handheld scanners
now in store as you're checking out, and we were wondering, kind of, how that test was going and just any information
around that?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah, well, I think the handheld scanner – well, there's two things that we use the handheld
scanner. And we give some level of autonomy to the operators on that. Some regions embrace it a little more than
others. Generally, what we find – and I say, there's two uses. One use is if the lines are backing up and an employee
with one of those handheld scanners can go and essentially scan – if it's a smaller basket, needless to say if it's top full
and you have things under other things you can't do it. But they can help speed up the front end by scanning those – in
the case of a limited number of items, those items give that member a printout with a barcode on it. When the member
gets up to the cash register, the cashier can simply scan that barcode. It prints out and tenders the full transaction with
all the details. So that's one way of speeding up.
The other thing it's used for is in terms of informing people when it would make sense for them to convert from a
regular member to an Executive Member based on their prior 12 months of purchases. So if lines are backed up a bit
and we can ask a member if we can scan their card, and we can let them know that based on their prior year's purchases
they would have paid as an example in the U.S. an extra $55, $110 versus $55 and they would have earned well more
than that. And so it's used for that. But we don't do that all the time, because as we've increased shopping frequency, the
member who said no, doesn't want to have to say no every week and a half. So we do that on a periodic basis.
<Q - Kevin Heenan>: Got you. All right, thanks a lot for the information.

Your next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with Cowen and Company.
<Q - Oliver Chen>: Thanks. Congrats on the performance, and thanks for the details. Regarding a bigger picture
question. On Online, where do you think the mix should go over time? Will it remain a little bit more modest as a
percentage of total? And as you look at your guests and the customers, like, which factors do people want to see you
guys implement over time? I just wanted to ask about food and protein and fresh food. What's your outlook for the
inflation there, and will your pricing under-price the inflation, and how do you see that dynamic evolving?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, let's start with the last question. I mean our fresh foods people view some
continuation on prices like cheese – milk and butter. A lot of that has to do with some shortages in China, and so
increased demand from China .That has pushed that out a little bit. There's still some inflation in meat. I believe – you
said that pork expectation was coming back a little bit. And cheese is finally coming down a little bit. So the
expectation is yes, but not probably as severe – like, meat have been up 8% to 10%, prices. They don't expect that level
of additional inflation going forward, but still some. In terms of pricing, generally, we're going to try to take price
increases as late as possible. And take price decreases as soon as possible. So, now, if using the famous rotisserie
chicken example, we maintained the price while costs were going up for two years. We didn't – when the input costs
started going down, we didn't change the price because we had never raised it. So – but, overall, we're going to lag a
little bit, because we want to be competitive.
And getting back to the first question was on Costco.com and mix changes. Yeah, it should continue to inch up or
towards – when we started, it was all big ticket, in many cases, hard to take home yourself or hard to install or hard to
put together items, whether it's big screen TVs or furniture, or swing sets – you name it. We certainly wanted to be
more than just that. And I think again, we've seen some success in there. So we keep trying things. What we don't see
ourselves as being the entity that's going to deliver two different boxes of kids' cereals to your doorstep at seven in the
morning. Now we hope and look forward to some of these other entities that are doing those types of quick home
deliveries for us to be their supplier, which we seem to be successful in doing as well. So – but, overall, we want our
site to be thought of on a more regular basis as well for our members. And some of those...
<Q - Oliver Chen>: Okay.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: ...health and beauty aid items, some of those sundries items will certainly help towards that
too.
<Q - Oliver Chen>: And I've used the mobile app. Do you feel like the mobile app is going to be a key part of traffic
online for you as this evolves?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: It will – it's continuing. When we look at our – when Ginnie Roeglin presents each month
at the budget meeting about Costco.com, we have higher and higher percentages of mobile app use, not nearly as much
as some of the e-commerce entities out there, but it's growing in that direction. So, yeah, I mean, we'll keep getting
better. Like everything at Costco, while our site is greatly improved from the original mobile apps that we did, there's
room for improvement there and we know that.
<Q - Oliver Chen>: Okay. Thank you. And our last question on the higher end strength, have you seen customer
response very positive to higher price points or your assortment as we see a healthier, high-end customer as well as
your product assortment being very appealing?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, that's what we've done – that's what we do. I mean, since the beginning of time,
we've constantly tried to trade customers up to better quality. We're still a merchant. We want to sell a lot of stuff and
higher-end stuff. And frankly, we can show great savings in that. If you go into our warehouses right now, it is partly
for the holiday time, and I've seen some $3,000 and $5,000 and $7,000 wine and spirits pricings on – which are great
values at those price points. Certainly, our jewelry are higher end. Certainly, the fact that we do a great penetration in
the bigger-sized televisions. So that's something.

Anecdotally, I remember also at the end of calendar 2008 and into calendar 2009 when the economy went south fast.
And I remember – and of course at the end of 2008 and into early 2009 when we took some extraordinary markdowns
on things like patio furniture in January and February because the economy just hit and people weren't buying that
much stuff, those big-ticket discretionary items. I remember as we entered June, July, as the buyers are getting ready to
commit for the upcoming end of 2009 into 2010 season, our CEO – Jim, at the time – and our Head of Merchandising
were reminding the buyers don't start bringing the price points down. If you want to cut back on a little volume,
quantity, fine. But let's – we've traded our members up and our members expect higher-end goods. Let's keep that
going, because that's what we're – that's what helps us – one of the things that helps us stand out in our view.
<Q - Oliver Chen>: Thanks for the comments on the luxury goods and that experience. Best regards for the holidays.

Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks a lot. Good morning. It's Matt Fassler, and thanks for keeping the call going here.
My one question at this stage relates to IT modernization, Richard. If you could just talk about qualitatively what
you've gotten done and what is still on the come, and then how you'd expect those additional investments to further
enable the online and e-commerce efforts? Thank you.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, first of all, for those of you who have known us for a long time, it's going to keep us
alive and growing. I mean our view is, is that we were at the top of our game in terms of keeping systems, old legacy
systems, as long and as cheaply as possible. And the recognition is, is that we did have to modernize, we knew that.
And we started that really in earnest about two, two and a half years ago, getting ready to start that process. So – and
our goal, of course, is, is to take us over the next 10 years to double our company. And I'm not trying to – we don't have
10 year budgets, but certainly, at a reasonable growth factor, that should be what we want to do, and we need systems
to do that, particularly as we go into other countries and expand in existing smaller countries right now that we're in,
smaller number of units, and as we global source more. So all of those things are imperative. And as you know, we've
done very little historically with member data. Don't expect big things from us, but expect any little thing is still
low-hanging fruit for us, so we'll be able to do a little more of that. First order business is to get it done.
What has been installed so far are we've redone the front-end membership system. Right now, if you want to change
your address or phone number, you have two ways to do it: you call an 800 number or you go by the membership desk.
Well, if a million or 2 million of you do something every year, it's one time each for 2 million people, it's 2 million
times for us. So some simple things like that will start early next year – early to mid-next year. But there's certainly a
lot more to do with that stuff, even some basics. We also redid the point-of-sales system, and that's in. That's making –
and when I say that's in, it's just in. For the two months, the last two months of the calendar year, we have an unwritten
– or a written rule, you can't – don't do anything to screw up the systems in the warehouse. And so while we've now
installed it in a number of locations and it's well beyond pilot and our operators want it and like it, and it will save
scheduling and a few other things, that won't be in to earnest until during half of calendar 2015.
There's one other thing, payroll. We just redid the payroll system, and that's for the U.S. only to start with, which is
70% of our company. And that's, again, something that's making life a little easier in the warehouses and there's some
small benefits to that there. The big benefits are when we complete the things that you've got to put these things,
including the accounting systems, in place first. Our accounting systems are planned to be installed as of this fiscal
year-end, so the end of this August, fingers crossed. That would be the best time to do it, at a fiscal year-end. And
currently, we're on task, but we'll tell you tomorrow how we're on task tomorrow. Beyond that, I mean, the big things
that the users are excited about, if we look at our depot and truck fleet operation, there's some real savings and
efficiencies in our depot operations that they're anxious to get in place. That's still going to be 6 months to 12 months –
I'll say 6 months to 18 months out because these are all overlapped – these modules overlap each other somewhat.

The challenge is going to be, as buyers who are used to doing things one way have to do things a little different. We
learned a lot of lessons when we went to Spain. We started with basically the new SAP-oriented system, and as you
might expect, there were a few Costco people that are over there. We've learned a lot, including pain-in-the-behind
things. So I think that we're – we know what the expenses are and we know incrementally we've still got another year,
year and a half of that. By its own size, it'll then level off. Again, I think looking two to five years now out is when
we're going – we've got to get over that hump and there'll be, I'm sure, some growing pains when we make those
conversions, but we've gotten a lot better of not just doing something and then letting everybody, all the users, figure it
out. We're using 10s and 20s and 30s of additions of people to certain departments focused entirely – taking existing
people that know our current systems and putting them on these SAP modernization projects. And so we've done a
much better job of bringing good people in and committing to two or three years in some cases, those people, in that
area.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thank you so much.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: So we'll continue.

Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research.
<Q - Chuck E. Cerankosky>: Good morning, everyone. Richard, you may have said it, but I'll double-check on this
regarding the gas. What was the year-over-year decrease in the gas price? And can you talk about how gas gallons on a
comp basis increased?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: The average price per gallon was down 7.3%, and the comps were – the gallon comps
were, I think, 11%. I know it was a low-double-digit, 10.5%.
<Q - Chuck E. Cerankosky>: Okay. 10.5%?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah.
<Q - Chuck E. Cerankosky>: Okay. Thank you. And I'm curious about the buying – or having merchandise shipped. I
had a little bit ahead of sales plan because of some of the slowdowns on the – in the ports. Where is the extra
merchandise being stored? Is it in the clubs? Is it in your depots?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well...
<Q - Chuck E. Cerankosky>: Or even offsite?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: No, it's not offsite. It's mostly in depots or the clubs. I mean, we were stacked tall, but we
turned it pretty fast, too. It wasn't a huge issue. It was an issue, but in terms of logistics of handling it. But basically the
depots had a little bit more for a few weeks.
<Q - Chuck E. Cerankosky>: Okay. So if it's selling, it's there. Just gets it...

<Q - Mike D. Otway>: Hey. Good morning, guys. This is Mike Otway in for Scott. Thanks for taking the questions. I
think first, Richard, you had said that outside of pharmacy that all the other ancillary businesses saw their gross margin
rates up in the quarter. So I guess outside of gas, which is obviously transitory, how should we think about your ability
to get some slight margin improvement on these other businesses over the course of the year?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: On the ancillary? Well, most of them were up year-over-year. I mean, a lot of it's –
particularly in some of the businesses like optometry and hearing aid, they – the actual markup on the goods is higher
than our range because we included our own cost of sales calculation, the impact of the [ph] Hearing Aid Tax (68:46)
or of the optometrist and things like that. So it's – but it's – when it – when volume is driven, its operating leverage is
certainly, in my view, better than the warehouse as a whole. So more than anything – and we keep looking to, as you've
heard it before, bring prices down. Over the last couple years, when we introduced – I forget what the – it's 5.0 or 6.0,
or whatever the next level of state-of-the-art hearing aids under our brand, we lowered the price point by close to
$2,000 on a high quality Kirkland Signature item made by well-known high-end people. And we really drove that
business. So we saved the customer. We have made fewer gross margin dollars, but a lot more units. Fewer dollars per
unit, but a lot more units.
<Q - Mike D. Otway>: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then I guess just switching gears on the international
side. You guys obviously continue to fare pretty well given the headwinds. But just kind of looking at profitability of
the other international business outside of Canada and stepping back, over the last few years, you saw EBIT margins
come down slightly in that portion of the business versus, I think, in the middle part of last decade, that they were
moving up. What's changed? And as you add more stores, kind of, in this segment internationally outside of Canada,
what are your expectations for getting profit to move up slightly every year? And I know some of that is new store
driven and everything like that, but any thoughts there would be great.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, I think, Craig has said – our CEO – has said is, look, the goal is to first get to [ph] $3
billion (70:42) pre-tax. And we'll see where we go from there. First and foremost, we're going to drive our business.
We want to see improved profitability every year. And there's lots of moving parts. And some of these ancillary
businesses help. Costco Travel is a little bit, it's growing nicely. We've got new people in over the last couple years at
our business centers. Went from, what I'll call, the 10-year-plus test to actually we have them moving in the right
direction. We've got eight of them and we'll open a few more. So there's lots of things out there.
The global sourcing initiatives does two things, it's generally limited resource commodity-type items in some cases and
then in our view what sets us apart in terms of quality and value, and that drives other business. So there's – I think
we're less looking at saying how can we – do we want to – we want to grow sales – do we want to grow – first and
foremost, we want to grow comps. And again, take out inflation and everything else. Can we get comps in that
mid-single-digits a little higher? If we can do that, then how do we get top line sales a little higher? And then how do
we leverage that? We'll keep doing what we're doing, and we're not as concerned about one quarter or one year being a
little less. I know we've gone up and down, but certainly we feel comfortable that we've got the things in place to keep
driving bottom line hopefully a little better than top line. But there will be fluctuations in that.
<Q - Mike D. Otway>: Okay. Great. I appreciate it. Thanks again.

Your next question comes from the line of Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Robert F. Ohmes>: Hey, Richard. Another gas question; I know you love these. From history, or maybe the
question would be, when historically you've moved into a lower gas price environment, big declines year-over-year at
the pump like we're seeing and could see more of, what do you guys tell the buyers to do then? What categories tend to
do better when you're having a pretty dramatically falling gas pump prices? Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah, I don't think we're smart enough to sit around and say, with this extra profit, what
are we going to do? I talked to Doug Schutt, the Head of U.S. Merchandising, the other day, and his view was is that,

Your next question comes from the line of Greg Melich with Evercore.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Hi. Thanks, Richard. I can't believe we've got a couple questions left here. But could you
update us on inflation across the store, both in COGS and at the retail level?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah, if you look – here we go. Basically, again, very slight deflation for the first 12
weeks. Food and sundries is very slight inflation. Sundries is very slight inflation, like less than 10 basis points.
Apparel is very slight inflation, also less than 10 basis points. Right. So that's through the end of our fiscal year. And
food, of course, for all of fiscal 2013 it was up about 3.5 percentage points on a cost of goods basis. But again, for the
first 12 weeks of this month, it's ever so slightly up. Computers and appliances and things like that are down about a
point. Gas, of course, is down, as you know, a little bit. And those are pretty much the pools, and it all adds up to being
down less than a half a percentage point since the beginning of our fiscal year, that's versus being up a half percentage
point all of last year from the beginning of the prior fiscal year.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: That's helpful. And that's at the COGS level and the same with retail or...?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Okay.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Yeah, I would say it's at the same at retail. If it's inflation, maybe it's a little tick under that
because of our lag. But overall, it's pretty close.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Great. And then the second question was, I think it was on September you switched your
interchange or card partner in Canada. Could you help us understand how that changes the dynamics either in sales or
profits on the business? And also, remind us when your Amex deal expires or when that's due in the U.S.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Sure. Well, we basically had long-term agreements in Canada, and we have one here. We
don't really talk about our current contracts. We'll let you know when and if anything happens, but any ongoing
contracts and anything, we really don't talk about. But in Canada, again, we made the switch. Currently, for I think
about a three-month period ending the end of this month, we accept both. So we started accepting MasterCard a couple
of months ago, and we'll continue to accept as well American Express in Canada through the end of the calendar year.
Look, we wouldn't have done it if it wasn't the most attractive deal for us. And remember, and I probably would reverse
the order if this was 10-K for our member and us long-term, because we're going to continue to try to drive value. And
so we think it's – the transition is always a little bit of a hassle, but we've worked well with both our former partner and
our new partner. Everybody acts professionally in this thing, and these things happen and we have a good relationship
currently in the U.S., so we'll see where that goes in the future.
But as it relates to Canada, I think we're now up to – and it's not required yet. As of last month, we were in the 30s in
terms of the percentage of people using MasterCard, recognizing 40%-plus of our transactions in Canada before
anything else is debit. And as you might expect, MasterCard has a higher penetration of cardholders in Canada. We
want to get that rewards based card out there and – because affinity programs drive sales not only at Costco, but reward
based credit card programs, when we get that member using that card, that co-brand card. And the same held true with
the American Express co-brand. When they use it elsewhere, it changes and improves the economics for us, which
allows us to again provide a better solution to our member, and continue to be more aggressive out there.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: That's helpful. Thanks.

[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Joe Feldman with Telsey Advisory Group.
<Q - Joseph Isaac Feldman>: Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. And most have been asked,
but I wanted to ask something related to the food side of the business. And I know in the past we've spoken about
opportunities within food, like new products, maybe organic, natural, more – and I know you've made strides with
some of that. But any update on where you stand with organic and natural? And how much you could do there?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Look, I think we can do a lot more. The supply chain is improving and increasing every
day, not just for us. We – again, I think in two years, we've gone in the U.S. from about a $1.4 billion to close to $3
billion in organic. And that's with supply constraints. So – and our view is there's a couple of positives from our view.
One is, it's not always a substitute sale. I gave the example – perhaps as an extreme example, but for the first $25
million of fresh organic ground beef we did a year and a half or so ago, on a multi-hundred million dollar fresh ground
beef program, but – again, $25 million – the first $25 million organic, 80% of it was to existing members that
historically didn't buy ground beef from us, because they buy organic. And so that was added sales in that way.
The other positive is, is, generally in the retail business, organic is a high – it was always a higher price point, but it's
also generally the higher margin item. It's kind of like the sale item you see on light goods is the refrigerator without
the icemaker and with a small freezer compartment, but then you go in and you want to – the one with all – the bigger
one with all the extra whistles and bells. Same thing with this, we can generally make a little bit better margin, and save
the customer more, and have a higher price point item. So, again, it's growing. It's a $3 billion business and I can't tell
you how quickly it will grow, but it's growing certainly faster than our top line overall.
<Q - Joseph Isaac Feldman>: Got it. Thank you. And then also wanted to follow up with the – you've mentioned
LivingSocial deal a couple times, this quarter, last quarter. Should we expect more on that front? Or more things like
that to come?
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Well, it's a catch-22. It works, recognizing we don't do a lot of it. But we also don't want
our members to get comfortable waiting, or people comfortable waiting for the next deal, so we're going do things on a
sporadic basis, or on an irregular basis. But we at least are, as Craig said to our Heads of Merchandising, E-Commerce,
and Membership Marketing, try some things. And so we're trying some things. So we're not – we'll let you know that
the things that we've tried generally work, but it's not like we want to change our methodology. We want to also make
sure that we – that the value of the membership is the value of the membership. But we'll keep trying some things.
<Q - Joseph Isaac Feldman>: Got it. Thank, and good luck with this quarter, guys.
<A - Richard A. Galanti>: Thank you. Why don't we take two more questions? I'm sure you guys are tired of listening
to me.
