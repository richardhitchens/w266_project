MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning and welcome to Johnson & Johnson's third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. All participants will
be able to listen only until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If anyone has
objections you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn the conference over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.
Louise Mehrotra
Good morning and welcome. I'm Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson, and it
is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the third quarter of 2014. Joining me on the call today is
Dominic Caruso, Vice President-Finance and Chief Financial Officer.
A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the
Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. I'll begin by briefly reviewing third
quarter results for the corporation and for our three business segments. Following my remarks, Dominic will provide
some additional commentary on the business, review the income statement and provide guidance for 2014. We will
then open the call to your questions. We expect the call to last approximately one hour.
Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is the schedule of sales for key products and/or
businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the Johnson & Johnson website as is the
press release. Please note we will be using a presentation to complement today's commentary. The presentation is also
available on our website.

Before we begin, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review are or may be considered
forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2013 and the company's subsequent filings identifies certain
factors that could cause the company's actual result to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking
statements made today. The company does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new
information or future events or developments. Our SEC filings including the 10-K are available through the company
and on our website.
During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business
performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for GAAP results. Tables
reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the press release and on the
Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website.
Now, I'd like to review our results for the third quarter of 2014. Worldwide sales to customers were $18.5 billion for
the third quarter of 2014, up 5.1%. On an operational basis sales were up 5.8% and currency had a negative impact of
0.7%. In the U.S., sales were up 11.6%.
In regions outside the U.S. our operational growth was 1% while the effect of currency exchange rates negatively
impacted our reported results by 1.3%. On an operational basis, the Western Hemisphere excluding the U.S. grew by
3.5%, Asia-Pacific Africa region grew 2% and Europe declined 0.8%.
The success of new product launches and continued growth of key products in all regions was partially offset by
divestitures, the most significant one being Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics. Excluding the impact of divestitures underlying
operational growth was 9%.
Turning now to earnings, net earnings were $4.7 billion and earnings per share were $1.66 versus $1.04 a year ago. As
referenced in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2014 third-quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude a net
gain of $457 million for after-tax special items. Third quarter 2013 net earnings were adjusted to exclude a charge of
$937 million for after-tax special items. Dominic will discuss special items in his remarks.
Excluding special items for both periods, net earnings for the current quarter were $4.3 billion and diluted earnings per
share were $1.50, representing increases of 9.5% and 10.3% respectively as compared to the same period in 2013.
Turning now to business segment highlights, please note percentages quoted represent operational sales change in
comparison to the third quarter of 2013 unless otherwise stated and therefore exclude the currency translation impact.
I'll begin with the Consumer segment. Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $3.6 billion increased 0.3% with U.S.
sales down 4.2% while outside the U.S. sales grew 2.6%. Excluding the impact of divestitures, worldwide growth was
approximately 2.5% with U.S. growth of approximately 1.5% and growth outside the U.S. of approximately 3%. Major
drivers of the results were Over-the-Counter and Oral Care products offset by the divestiture of the North American
sanitary protection business.
OTC sales growth was driven by upper respiratory products and analgesics. Upper respiratory products grew 10%
worldwide driven by sales growth outside the U.S. which included an early seasonal inventory build. Analgesic growth
was 7% in the U.S. driven by market share gains partially offset by comparisons to the third quarter 2013 trade
inventory build related to the re-launch of the products.
In the U.S. adult analgesic market share was approximately 11%, up from 8.5% a year ago while U.S. pediatric share
was over 40%, up from 26% a year ago. Oral Care results were driven by strong results for LISTERINE due to new
product launches and successful marketing campaigns.
Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment, worldwide sales of $8.3 billion increased 18.7% with U.S. sales up 33.1%
and sales outside the U.S. up 4.1% driven by both strong sales of new products as well as core growth products.
A major driver was our recently launched hepatitis C product called OLYSIO in the U.S. and EU and SOVRIAD in
Japan. Excluding sales of hepatitis C products, OLYSIO and INCIVO, underlying growth worldwide U.S. and outside
the U.S. was approximately 8%, 14% and 1.5% respectively.

Other significant contributors to growth were immunology products STELARA, REMICADE and SIMPONI ,
SIMPONI ARIA as well as XARELTO, INVOKANA, ZYTIGA, INVEGA SUSTENNA or XEPLION and recently
launched IMBRUVICA. Partially offsetting the growth were lower sales of ACIPHEX due to generic competition and
lower sales of vaccines.
The results for immunology were driven by strong double-digit market growth complemented by increased market
share for STELARA and SIMPONI, SIMPONI ARIA. We continue to be the U.S. market leader in immunology.
XARELTO sales were up 68% compared with the same quarter last year and grew 14.5% on a sequential basis. Total
prescription share or TRx for the quarter in the U.S. anticoagulant market grew to over 14.5% with cardiology TRx
estimated at 23.5%.
INVOKANA sales contributed over 3.5 points to the U.S. pharmaceutical growth rate and for the quarter achieved
3.2% TRx within the defined market of Type 2 diabetes excluding insulin and metformin, up from 2.4% in the second
quarter of 2014. TRx with endocrinologists grew to 9.2% for the quarter up approximately 1.5% sequentially.
The strong results for ZYTIGA in the U.S. were driven by increased market share in the combined metastatic castrate
resistant prostate cancer market and estimated market growth of 11%. ZYTIGA has captured approximately 33.5% of
that market. Continued strong market uptick and additional country launches drove the strong results outside the U.S.
ZYTIGA is approved in more than 90 countries.
I'll now review the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices and Diagnostics
segment sales of $6.6 billion decreased 4.6%. U.S. sales declined 6.5% while sales outside the U.S. declined 2.8%.
Excluding the impact of the OCD divestiture, worldwide growth was 1.6% while U.S. growth was 0.6% and growth
outside the U.S. was 2.4%.
Growth was driven by Orthopedics and Cardiovascular Care partially offset by lower sales in Vision Care and Surgical
Care. Competitive pricing dynamics impacted growth for Vision Care.
In Surgical Care, the success of the ECHELON FLEX Powered ENDOPATH stapler outside the U.S. was offset by
lower sales of women's health and urology products coupled with U.S. pricing pressure.
Orthopedic sales growth was driven by trauma, sports medicine, knees, and hips. Trauma was up 3% worldwide due to
market growth and new product launches, while the successful launch of MONOVISC coupled with the continued
strong growth for ORTHOVISC drove results for sports medicine.
Hip growth of 4% worldwide was driven by strong volume growth, partially offset by continued pricing pressure.
Primary stem platform sales were major contributors to the results. Knees worldwide increased 5% due to the
successful launch of ATTUNE, partially offset by pricing pressure across the regions. Cardiovascular growth was
driven by an 18% worldwide increase in our Biosense Webster business due to strong growth of the ThermoCool
SmartTouch catheter.
That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's third quarter of 2014. It is now my pleasure to turn the
call over to Dominic Caruso. Dominic?
Dominic J. Caruso
Good morning, everyone, and thank you, Louise, for sharing the highlights from our performance in the third quarter.
We are very pleased with our strong performance this past quarter as well as the progress we've made on our long-term
growth drivers. I believe we are well positioned in this evolving healthcare environment.
I'll take the next few minutes to highlight some of the progress we've made to advance our business as well as to review
some additional highlights of our financial performance for the third quarter. Then I will provide our guidance for you
to consider in refining your models for 2014. But before I do that, I want to comment on what we're seeing in the

market for healthcare.
Although modest, we have now seen two consecutive quarters of positive momentum in hospital utilization rates,
which is in line with recently published analyst reports noting this trend. We continue to remain confident that as
economies recover and as healthcare reform continues to gain momentum here in the U.S. and abroad, utilization rates
are going to increase.
At Johnson & Johnson, we've continued making very good progress on our near-term priorities of achieving our
financial commitments, restoring and relaunching our U.S. OTC products, continuing to capitalize on the potential of
the DePuy Synthes acquisition, and building on our strong momentum in pharmaceuticals. At the same time we've
continued to focus on advancing our long-term growth drivers, which you are familiar with from our previous
discussions.
During the quarter, we've made several significant advancements against these long-term growth drivers that are worth
noting. We continue to create value through innovation, as evidenced by the strong performance of our newly launched
products as well as by gaining regulatory approval for expanded uses of important products in our portfolio, such as
INVOKAMET, which is a combination of INVOKANA and metformin into a single pill to treat diabetes that the FDA
approved in August.
Further, IMBRUVICA added a third indication in July when the FDA approved it for use in treating patients with
chronic lymphocytic leukemia who have a specific genetic mutation that occurs when part of chromosome 17 is
missing. That's an important advancement for these patients who are considered to have the poorest prognosis and very
limited treatment options.
The CHMP also recommended IMBRUVICA for approval for similar uses in Europe. And just yesterday, we
announced that we entered into an agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pharmacyclics to evaluate IMBRUVICA
in combination with an investigational PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor as a potential option for patients with
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. And in our Cardiovascular business, we launched INCRAFT Stent Graft System for the
treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms in both Europe and Canada.
Looking longer term, we continued to make important investments to access early-stage innovation. In the quarter, we
acquired Covagen, a company that is focused on developing new therapeutics for the treatment of a broad range of
inflammatory diseases. And on September 30, we announced an agreement to acquire Alios BioPharma, which will
give us a promising Phase 2 potential treatment for RSV, a major pediatric disease with no effective therapy available
for prevention or treatment. Their pipeline also includes two early-stage compounds for hepatitis C that could
potentially augment our existing portfolio. We anticipate that the Alios acquisition will close later this quarter.
And we're also leading with purpose, as demonstrated through our partnership with the NIH, to fast track the
development of an Ebola vaccine.
Now let's review some highlights from the quarter. Turning to the next slide, you can see our condensed consolidated
statement of earnings for the third quarter of 2014, which reflects both the success of our new products and the strength
of our core businesses. We're pleased to show strong reported sales growth in the quarter of 5.1% or 5.8%
operationally, as Louise showed you earlier. This growth was driven in part by the continued uptake of our newly
launched pharmaceutical products, including hepatitis C treatment OLYSIO, which is sold as SOVRIAD in Japan.
Please note that this is the first quarter reflecting the divestiture of our Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business. And in
order to mitigate the EPS impact on future earnings from the OCD divestiture, you will recall that in July we
announced a $5 billion share repurchase program.
Excluding the impact of the divestiture of Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, our sales increased nearly 8.5% on an
operational basis in the quarter. Our hepatitis C products contributed approximately one0half of that growth.
Please now direct your attention to the box section of the schedule where we have provided earnings adjusted to
exclude special items. Adjusted net earnings were $4.3 billion, reflecting an increase of 9.5% over the third quarter of
2013. And adjusted earnings per share were $1.50 in the quarter versus $1.36 a year ago, which was up 10.3%,

exceeding the mean of the analyst estimates as published by First Call. Profitability from sales of OLYSIO net of
investments we made contributed approximately $0.06 of EPS this quarter and approximately $0.20 of EPS for the nine
months of this year.
As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2014 third-quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude the
following special items: the net gain associated with the OCD divestiture; cost associated with the continued integration
of Synthes; additional reserves for litigation expenses and the DePuy ASR Hip program; and an accrual for final IRS
regulations related to the branded prescription drug fee.
Let me now provide some background about the Branded Prescription Drug Fee, which we have treated as a special
item this quarter. As you know, in 2011 we and all participants in the U.S. pharmaceutical industry were required under
the Affordable Care Act legislation to begin paying a fee based on our respective shares of branded prescription drugs
sold to the U.S. government.
The accounting for that fee has been consistently applied by the industry since that passage of the act as agreed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission. During the third quarter, the IRS issued final regulations which had the effect of
changing the recognition of the fee for accounting purposes from the period in which the fee is paid to the period from
which market shares used to allocate the fee are determined.
Therefore, we and other industry participants are now required to record an additional year of the fee. Note that as the
fee is still payable as originally provided for in the act, there was no resulting cash flow impact.
Now, let's take a few moments to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. I'm pleased to point out that
we saw very good operating performance. Cost of goods sold was 120 basis points lower than the same period last year,
primarily due to our product mix offset by currency impact. Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 60
basis points lower as compared to the third quarter of 2013 due to growth of new products in our pharmaceutical
business and overall good management of cost primarily in our MD&D businesses. These factors more than offset the
inclusion of an additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee, which I described earlier.
Excluding the impact of this fee, which we have treated as a special item, these expenses were 180 basis points lower
than in the prior year.
Our investment in research and development as a percent of sales was down compared to the prior-year primarily due
to timing of various R&D programs that we have and we will continue to make important R&D investments for the
future.
Overall, our pre-tax operating margin increased 240 basis points. And excluding the incremental accrual for the
additional year of the Branded Prescription Drug Fee, pre-tax operating margins increased 360 basis points, OLYSIO
was a major contributor representing slightly more than one half of that increase.
Interest expense net of interest income of $112 million was slightly higher than the prior-year. Other income net of
other expenses was $1.3 billion in the quarter as a gain compared to $943 million of expense in the same period last
year. Now, excluding the special items that were included in this line item, other income net of other expenses showed
a net expense of $25 million this quarter versus a net gain of $43 million in the prior year.
In the quarter the effective tax rate excluding special items was 24.2% compared to 18.9% in the third quarter of 2013
and for nine months excluding special items, the tax rate was 21.9% compared to 19.3% in the same period last year.
This was due primarily to the geographic mix of the results in each of the periods. Now, I will provide some guidance
for you to consider as you refine your models for the balance of 2014. Before I discussed sales and earnings, I will give
some guidance on items we know are difficult for you to forecast beginning with cash and interest income and expense.
At the end of the quarter we had approximately $17.7 billion of net cash, which consists of approximately $33 billion
of cash and marketable securities and approximately $15.3 billion of debt. For purposes of your models, assuming no
major additional acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you consider modeling net interest expense of
between $400 million and $500 million which is consistent with our previous guidance.

Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as
gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation as well as
divestitures, assets, sales and write-offs. We would be comfortable with your models for 2014 reflecting other income
and expense excluding special items as a net gain ranging from approximately $300 million to $400 million, which is
lower than our previous guidance.
And now a word on taxes; our guidance for 2014 anticipates that the R&D tax credit will be renewed by Congress and
although that has not yet occurred, we do anticipate that it will be retroactive for the full-year when it is eventually
passed, consistent with our previous guidance. If the R&D tax credit is not approved, it will negatively impact our
effective tax rate by approximately 0.5%.
We would therefore be comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2014 excluding special items
of approximately 20% to 21%. This is an increase in our effective tax rate to reflect a higher portion of our earnings
this year being subject to the U.S. tax rate. As always, we will continue to pursue opportunities in this area to improve
upon this rate.
Turning to guidance on sales and earnings, as we've done for several years, our guidance will be based first on a
constant-currency basis, reflecting our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business and we believe
this provides a good understanding of the underlying performance of our business.
We'll also provide an estimate of our sales and earnings per share results for 2014 with the impact that current
exchange rates could have on the translation of those results. Our sales and earnings guidance for 2014 takes into
account several assumptions that I highlighted to you in previous quarters.
For sales, our assumptions remain consistent from earlier guidance that PROCRIT will not have biosimilar competition
in 2014 and for INVEGA SUSTENNA and RISPERDAL CONSTA we do not anticipate generic entries for these
products this year. Further, our guidance reflects net incremental sales from our hepatitis C products as well as the
divestiture of Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics.
Considering the factors I just noted, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase
on a constant currency basis of between 5.5% and 6.5% for the year. This would result in sales for 2014 on a constant
currency basis of approximately $75 billion to $76 billion. This is an increase to our previous guidance.
Our underlying operational sales growth in this 2014 guidance, excluding the impact of the hepatitis C products and the
OCD divestiture for the full-year 2014, is approximately 4.5%, a higher growth rate than the estimate we provided on
last quarter's earnings call.
We're not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to give you an idea of the potential impact on sales, if
currency exchange rates were to remain where they were as of last week for the balance of the year then our sales
growth rate would decrease by nearly 1.5%, reflecting the recent weakening of the euro and other currencies against the
U.S. dollar. Thus under this scenario we would expect reported sales growth to range between 4% and 5% for total
expected level of reported sales of between approximately $74 billion and $75 billion.
Our 2014 earnings guidance reflects the strength of our performance we've seen thus far, including the strong
contribution of OLYSIO, which as I noted earlier, contributed approximately $0.20 to 2014 EPS for the first nine
months net of investments we've made in the business. Therefore, we suggest you consider full-year 2014 EPS
estimates, excluding the impact of special items, of between $5.94 and $5.99 per share on an operational or constant
currency basis, which is higher than our previous guidance.
Moving to reported EPS, again, we're not predicting the impact of currency movements, but to give you an idea of the
potential impact on EPS if currency exchange rates were to remain where they were as of last week for the balance of
this year then our reported EPS, excluding special items, would be negatively impacted by approximately $0.02 per
share due to exchange rate fluctuations. This represents a $0.07 per share unfavorable swing from our previous
guidance with the weakening euro as a major factor.

We therefore suggest that you model our reported EPS excluding special items in the range between $5.92 and $5.97
per share for a growth rate of about 7% to $8. This is higher than our previous guidance as our strong operational
earnings performance is more than offsetting the negative impact of currency movements.
And as a reminder, our full-year earnings guidance includes intangible amortization of approximately $1.4 billion
before tax or an impact of approximately $0.38 on earnings per share. Please note that our guidance does not include
the impact of an official devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar or any other currency. And while we're not providing
guidance for 2015, if currency exchange rates were to remain where they were as of last week for all of 2015, that
impact would be a headwind to earnings per share of approximately $0.15 per share to $0.20 per share.
As you update your models for the guidance I just provided, you will see that we do expect that our pre-tax operating
margins will show a significant improvement in 2014 over 2013 levels; and approximately half of that is attributed to
OLYSIO net of the additional investments we're making in the business.
In summary, we are very pleased with our strong results this quarter and with our ability to deliver an even stronger
earnings performance for the full year than our previous guidance. Our new products continue to produce strong
growth; and we are advancing our near-term priorities while also continuing to make investments to fuel future growth.
Now I'd like to turn things back to Louise for the Q&A portion of the meeting. Louise?
Louise Mehrotra
Thank you, Dominic. And, Stephanie, could you please give the instructions for the Q&A session?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning, Mike.
<Q - Mike J. Weinstein>: Good morning, thanks for taking the question. So, Dominic, first one clarification, the $0.06
you called out this quarter and $0.20 for the year for OLYSIO, that would seem to imply probably about $0.20 or more
of investments netted against that to get to that $0.20 number. So can you just maybe outline that so that the $0.20
versus what profitability could have been for that product?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure, Mike. We're not going to give very specific profitability by product, but generally
speaking when we saw the uptick in OLYSIO sales this year, we knew we had the opportunity to invest more in the
business, including both some marketing investment as well as new R&D program; so we expected that we would do
that while still having our investors see the benefits of the uptick in the OLYSIO product. So I can't give you the
specifics, but generally speaking about $0.20 for the year. If you assume that OLYSIO is a high gross margin product
with very, very little cost associated with it, you can probably estimate what the total impact would be.
<Q - Mike J. Weinstein>: And do you view that $0.20 as one time, essentially going away next year? Is that how you
want the Street to be thinking about 2015?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: I think so because it's obvious that we saw such a significant uptick this quarter and you all
know that Gilead's compound in this space was just approved Friday. I think we all expected that. So we took the
opportunity to invest. I think we're being very transparent with investors on what the impact to this year's earnings are
net of the investments, of course. And, yes, we don't expect that that will continue into next year.
<Q - Mike J. Weinstein>: And one last question. You walked through the assumptions that you've made for this year
relative to biosimilar competition. Do you have any preliminary comments relative to 2015 and how you're thinking

about competition for REMICADE or any of the other products in the portfolio?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure. Louise, we've spoken before about the fact that 2015 is – there is biosimilar impact
for REMICADE in Europe in particular.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Correct. And as far as INVEGA SUSTENNA and RISPERDAL CONSTA, we're not aware
of any ANDA filings on them at this point in time.

Your next question comes from Larry Biegelsen of Wells Fargo.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning, Larry.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Hi, Larry.
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: Good morning, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a question about international
growth, which has slowed the last couple quarters. The U.S. has obviously been very strong. But can you talk about
what you're seeing outside the U.S. and why the U.S. – OUS, I'm sorry, isn't growing quite as robustly as the U.S.? And
then I had a follow-up. Thanks.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Right, a couple things. This quarter of course we have the impact of the OCD divestiture,
so the quarter-over-quarter comparisons are difficult for that. So Europe, I think you saw published operational growth
of negative 0.8%. Without the OCD impact, it would have been positive 1% growth. That is slower growth than we've
seen before. I think you're all very familiar with the fact that Europe is in fact slowing down, and we're seeing that
across our businesses as well.
<Q - Larry Biegelsen>: And then, Dominic, on Vision Care, it was down 13% this quarter. Can you give us a little bit
more color about what's going on there? Is that a market issue? Is that a J&J specific issue and how long do you think it
will take to recover? Thank you.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Right, we mentioned in the comments by Louise earlier that there are some competitive
pricing dynamics that we're seeing in the market for our Vision Care products. So we took the opportunity to price reset
some of our products in that marketplace. We have a lot of new and important innovations coming to market soon. And
when we noticed what was going on in the market, we wanted to price our products competitively with those in
anticipation of the new products we have coming in the near future. So I would say there's a little bit of a slowdown
overall market, but the impact you saw for our business was primarily a result of our price reset.

<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Hi, Jami.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Good morning. Just if you don't mind if I follow up a little bit on OLYSIO, so just to be clear,
Dominic, you said $0.06 net of investments. Are you talking net of general investments or net of investments in hep C?
What is your commitment level to hep C going forward? And given the new pricing around the Gilead combo, it would
seem that OLYSIO, even if you cut the price dramatically, would have a hard time competing. Are you planning to cut
the price? And would you expect the $2 billion that you've generated year to date to just basically go away next year?
And then just lastly, back to the margin contribution, I think you were a little bit more explicit on the previous call. I
think you had said two-thirds of the 230 basis point improvement was attributed to OLYSIO. If I assume the same
thing this quarter, that would have led to about a $0.15 contribution, and that of course it does not include investments.
So if you could, just confirm that. And then lastly, I'm obliged to ask this. Do you have any double Irish exposure?
Thanks very much.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Okay, let me see. I think I counted eight questions, Jami.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Because I only get this opportunity four times a year.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Okay. So just to be clear, when I talk about the impact of OLYSIO net of investments, I'm
talking about net of all investments, not just investments in hep C, so investments across the full range of the Johnson
& Johnson portfolio. We are committed to hep C. We're continuing to do studies in combination with other products.
We think there are important new advances still available in that marketplace. We think the market is substantial and
it's worth pursuing, so we're still committed to investment there and we're doing those clinical trials. As you know, we
have already filed with the FDA for our combination of the OLYSIO with sofosbuvir, and then we have additional data
coming out I think later this year in addition to that.
And then finally, you had asked about pricing given the impact of Gilead's new pricing for HARVONI, I believe the
product is called. And I would just offer the following comments. First of all, we believe that OLYSIO is in fact a very
good – has very good safety and efficacy results and has strong physician and patient experience to date. We plan to
remain competitive in the hepatitis C category, and we will work with payers to maintain access for OLYSIO in the
marketplace. And given the size, complexity, and diversity of this patient population, we think physicians will continue
to need multiple treatment options, and hence my comment earlier about our commitment to continue to study OLYSIO
for hep C as well as some other combinations. We think having a potent protease inhibitor available to physicians is
important, and we're committed to doing that.
As far as double Dutch or Irish sandwiches or whatever they're called, I'm not going to comment very specifically
about what we do or we don't have, but we'll have to wait to see what the Irish legislation actually says. But we
understand from all the comments that have been made by Irish regulators that there will certainly be some
grandfathering period for any changes that they propose because they do expect to keep Ireland competitive in the
world economy. So we certainly expect that there will be some grandfather period, I don't know how long it will be but
we've heard in the range of five years. It could be three years to five years. It could be five years to seven years, but we
expect that the grandfathering provisions will give us all enough time to adjust any plans that we might have as a result
of any impact.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: You're welcome.

<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Hey, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Good morning. I want to focus on your Orthopedics business. Your U.S. knees and your
U.S. hips came in a little bit better than we were thinking. So, Dominic and Louise, can you provide some commentary
about what you see on the U.S. side in terms of volumes? Are things feeling a little bit better after a softer first half?
And then as a follow-up, Louise, you mentioned in your prepared remarks pricing pressure. I wonder if you can
characterize the pressure that you saw in 3Q and compare it to how you saw it in 2Q and 1Q. Thanks.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Okay, let me start with just a few comments on volumes. We did see increased volume in
the third quarter, consistent with what we expected where we thought that this second half of the year would be
stronger than the first half of the year. So just by way of reference, last year, our hip and knee growth, we experienced
70% of that growth in the fourth quarter. So obviously, we've now seen a new seasonality that's very clear in the hip
and knee market and we're seeing an uptick in the third quarter or in the back half of the year as we expected we would
see. And, Louise, on pricing?
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Okay. And so just a little further on the market, so we are the first ones out, but our best
estimate of the U.S. market growth for the third quarter was hips about 3%, so we grew slightly faster and knees about
4% which we also grew slightly faster. But that's again just a big estimate because we're the first through second one
out of that depending on how you count it.
Regarding price, so in hips this is U.S. only, price was minus 5%, which is additional negative by 1% versus sequential
basis and mix was virtually flat. So net-net, price mix in the U.S. for hips was down about 5%. For knees, price was
negative 2.2% so that's a little better than the second quarter. Mix coming in about 1.5% positive so negative 0.6% on
the quarter price and mix together and that's better than the second quarter.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: And as a follow up, Louise, that negative 5% on hip, that's a big number. Do you have any
commentary why negative 5%? We've been kind of thinking the market overall for hips would be down more 2% to
3% and you're coming in at negative 5%. Was there any contracts that rolled off? Any additional commentary you
could provide? Thanks.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Yes, there were some additional contracts that were renewed in the third quarter. And that is,
you're seeing that impact in the minus 5%.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Okay, thank you very much.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Okay. Do you want me to do spine, price in the U.S. was down 5% and that's more negative
versus the second quarter. Mix is up a positive of 1%, for a negative of 4% altogether, price mix for spine in the U.S.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Okay.

Your next question comes from Derrick Sung, Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I just want to start with a follow-up on your biosimilar
comments for next year? So two things, can you help us think about how we should think about the impact of
competition in Europe sort of relative to maybe what you've seen with your EPO franchise and such. And then in the
U.S. in terms of biosimilar threat there, last month the U.S. Patent Office issued a final rejection on one of the key
REMICADE patents under re-examination. Now we understand that the final rejection still has an appeals process to it,
but I was wondering if you could kind of give us some insight into what that appeals processes is and how you think
about your IP position in the U.S. with potential FDA approval of Celltrion's REMICADE next year as well?

<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: So, Derrick, thanks for the questions, so biosimilars in OUS first. We haven't seen much of
an impact. And we know that even pricing is sort of in the 30% range, down from the branded product, but we haven't
seen much of an impact of biosimilars in Europe such as PROCRIT and we're not seeing much of an impact on any
other biosimilars as well, including REMICADE.
In the U.S., you raised a question about the potential biosimilar impact in the U.S. because of Celltrion's filing. Just as a
reminder, we have a patent in the U.S. which goes until 2018 and yes, it's true that the patent office recently issued a
rejection to that patent, but we have recently filed a revised amendment to that which is now in the public domain and
until the patent is finally adjudicated, which could go up to the Supreme Court, with the number of appellate arguments
and appellate avenues that we have available to us, we don't expect that there will be a final adjudication of the patent
for several years now.
So whether or not the biosimilar comes to market, in the face of that particular patent situation, is up to the competitor,
but we certainly continue to believe in the strength of our patents and in the validity of those patents and we're in active
discussions with the patent office and we will pursue all available appeals and all the available jurisdictions and
avenues of jurisdictions that we have to us which, again, I would say would take several years before they would be
finally adjudicated.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Okay, great, that's very helpful. Thank you for that, just a quick follow-up on your utilization
comments. You've called out the fact we've seen a couple quarters of utilization pick up on the hospital side of things. It
didn't look like that really translated to a pick-up in your Surgical sales, and I was just wondering if that's a result of
that being obscured by pricing or some other factor, and when would we expect to see some of that utilization pick-up
be reflected in your MD&D sales?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Right, a couple of things to remember. The MD&D sales, Surgical Care in particular, have
been impacted by lower women's health and urology sales. You'll remember we withdrew the Morcellex product from
the market. So there was some negative impact related to that. There was also some negative pricing pressure in the
quarter. And the overall utilization uptick that we saw was in the very low single digits. I mentioned it was modest
growth, although encouraging that we saw it in two quarters in a row, but still very modest, Derrick.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Okay, great. Thank you very much, Dominic.

Your next question comes from Vamil Divan, Credit Suisse.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Good morning, Vamil.
<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple on the diabetes side
here with your SGLT2. Can you just comment what you're hearing from physicians around the differentiation for your
product versus some of the competitors that are now in the market? And are you envisioning any tougher pricing
dynamics going forward with that class given that there are competitors? And last, on the combination with SGLT2 and
DPP4s, can just you remind us if you guys are working on that. I would think that would be a good strategy to kind of
maintain your position and your competitors certainly are working on those combination agents?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: With respect to the differentiation of INVOKANA to the new competitors, INVOKANA of
course continues to do very well. And the data as you know as filed was a result of something like eight different
clinical trials, which showed both the safety and the efficacy of INVOKANA. It seems to continue to do well even in
the face of new competition, so we're still growing share even with new competitors coming to the market.

We don't see much of a price issue in the marketplace. They're all relatively priced competitively. Remember, this is a
very large market and the fact that more SGLT2 inhibitors come to market we think is good for the market overall
because it increases physicians' awareness of the use of that particular mechanism of action. I think the market can
withstand a number of competitors and so we think overall there will be market growth as a result. As far as the
combination, I'm not aware that we're studying the combination with DPP2 and SGLT2 inhibitor combination.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: So INVOKAMET was just approved, right, which is a combination with metformin. And if
you look at the usage of INVOKANA right now, about 50% of it is in triple therapy, so they're actually able to get the –
do the combination themselves.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Right.
<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: Okay, thanks, so just one quick follow-up, if I could, on the schizophrenia market, just the
LAIs. The growth there was a little bit less than we anticipated. Can you just provide any color there on the
deceleration in the U.S. and outside the U.S. this quarter?
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: I think for our business, the combined still grew very well. If you take a look at our INVEGA
SUSTENNA and RISPERDAL CONSTA together. So the U.S. is up 10% due to an increase in combined market share
for our growth. And that's INVEGA SUSTENNA, RISPERDAL CONSTA together. OUS is up about 3%, so
worldwide it's 6% on the operational level.

Your next question comes from Kristen Stewart, Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to go back to Orthopedics. I was
wondering, Louise, if you could just provide the pricing on trauma and then I have a real question.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: I figured someone was going to ask that one. Okay. So for trauma, U.S.-only price is 0.5% –
0.7% negative, and mix was very strong at 2.5% positive, so net-net roughly 2% positive.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. And then more strategically just thinking about the Medical Device business, I don't
expect you to comment on rumors, but I guess there was some speculation that you guys may be looking to sell some
portions of the Cordis business. Can you maybe just tell us, Dominic, just how you're thinking I guess more broadly
about MD&D. You've always expressed an interest in cardiology more broadly, although have also said about the
comments on the growth rates there, but has anything changed just overall in the strategic value of having a more
broad-based Medical Device business and maybe make some comments in that vein on just the consolidation that
you're seeing in your competitors?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Right. Kristen, thanks for the question, so a couple things. So nothing has changed with
respect to our overall strategic approach to the space. We're looking at areas where we think there'll be strong market
growth either because of demographics or because of innovation or because of our own ability to compete in the market
bringing in new technologies with our current presence. As you know, we made a determination some time ago that we
were going to focus on surgery, general surgery and Specialty Surgery and Orthopedics and have less of a focus on
Cardiovascular and you know we got out of the drug-eluting stent business as we saw that become a commoditized
business.
Within the overall approach to medical devices, we still believe surgery is the place to be. We're obviously very happy
with our market position there. We made a big bet as you know in Orthopedics and we're continuing to see the benefits
of that combination with Synthes. And with respect to cardiology, we believe that there are specific areas of focus
within cardiology that are important. And for example, electrophysiology where we're a leader there and we've seen

very good growth, I think nearly 18% growth this quarter from our Biosense Webster business. So nothing has really
changed. We believe these are the two main areas within MD&D that we're going to focus on, Surgery and Orthopedics
with selective investments in selective growth areas within cardiovascular medicine.
I think our competitors have basically followed suit in terms of those combinations in orthopedics, as you know. And
there are also combinations along with a current large player in cardiology now acquiring a major player in surgery,
again confirming our approach that in fact surgery is the place that we're see sustainable growth going forward. So
nothing has changed, and I hope that overall picture that I gave you is consistent with the previous discussions we've
had, and we're moving along that strategy.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Then on the Ortho side, we've seen the special charges for Synthes continue for longer
than I would have anticipated. When will that business be fully integrated in, and when will all the one-time charges
that are more recurring charges stop for that business? I've just been surprised by the magnitude and by how long we've
been seeing that.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Right, we were very careful to integrate this business in a way that wouldn't be disruptive
to our customers, and we made sure that that was our first priority. There are a number of sites that we have to
consolidate. These are two very large businesses, as you can imagine. So these integration activities are winding down,
and we should see less of these special charges going forward. And I would say that we're very close to actually
completing the full integration of Synthes.

Your next question comes from Bob Hopkins, Bank of America.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning, Bob.
<Q - Robert A. Hopkins>: Hey, good morning. Thanks, just a couple of quick questions, first, Dominic, for you. You
mentioned a couple of headwinds for calendar year 2015. I think you said that if currency rates should stay the same,
you'd see about a $0.15 to $0.20 headwind. That's pretty clear. But on OLYSIO, I just want to make sure I understand
what the message is in terms of looking forward. Should we think about that as a significant EPS headwind in 2015, or
are you going to reduce the expenditures that you've got running through in 2014 and 2015 such that that won't be a
significant EPS headwind in 2015?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Right, one way to think about it is that OLYSIO has been a major contributor this year, but
we of course invested, as I've mentioned earlier, some of that upside in the business so that overall next year when you
see a reduction of that contribution, overall net-net it wouldn't be as significant as you might think. And that's why I
quoted the net $0.20 impact for the first nine months.
We don't believe that given the dynamics in the marketplace of this significance that we should overreact and adjust our
business too drastically just from one year to the next. Considering the fact that we have many investment
opportunities, the businesses are still growing nicely, and in fact the overall pharmaceutical business, as you know,
even without OLYSIO is still growing at high double-digit rates, and we continue to bring our consumer products back
to the marketplace. So we don't want to really overreact from a big change in a single item that we believe the
investment community is very well versed on. and so we'll continue to invest in our businesses appropriately going
forward.
<Q - Robert A. Hopkins>: Okay. I asked the question just because – and I realize it's only one year, but there are a
couple of headwinds for next year that people are trying to get ahead of from a modeling perspective, so I just wanted

to make sure we understand all the moving parts.
The second question I wanted to ask was back on your utilization commentary, which did seem more constructive this
quarter relative to last quarter. and one thing you've commented on in the past is your suture business perhaps is a good
indication of what's going on from a surgical procedure volume perspective. So I was just wondering if you think your
suture business this quarter provided any insight into what's going on. I was wondering if you could just give us a sense
as to how much that grew this particular quarter.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Right. So we saw – as I mentioned earlier, we did see positive utilization trends two
quarters in a row. So we have two dots we can connect I guess, but these are very, very modest, very low single-digit
utilization rate increases. And our suture business also had modest low single-digit growth, offset by a little bit of price,
but overall modest growth. So I think that's consistent with the utilization trends we've seen.
<Q - Robert A. Hopkins>: Okay.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: The best estimate from our surgical care group is that the market was flat in the U.S. And
then, as Dominic said, there was some negative price on it. And then internationally, sutures grew about 2%, so on a
worldwide basis we grew 1%.

Your next question is from the line of Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matthew Stephan Miksic>: Good morning, thanks for taking the questions. A couple – I think most of the topics
have been pretty well covered, but I did want to drill into a couple of comments on Orthopedics. In particular, you
mentioned your estimates for market growth approximately 3% hips, 4% knees. And I realize that we're early, about a
third of the market has reported. But as you think about U.S. versus Europe, I guess one of the things in OUS that's a
little bit surprising to us is the strength that we've seen overseas. If you could, maybe comment on in a seasonally slow
quarter, how we're seeing things like 6% operating growth for example in knees OUS. If you could highlight a little bit
of what you're seeing, and then I have one follow-up.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Well, Matt, one of the things that we're benefiting from is the launch of ATTUNE, our knee
platform and it's done very well as its continued to launch throughout the world and we're seeing significant growth
from the ATTUNE launch in Europe in particular. So that's a major factor that's specific to our business and not the
overall market.
<Q - Matthew Stephan Miksic>: And then the other would be on the share dynamic. And as I think about trauma and
hips and knees coming together, we've all been talking for a long time about the potential benefits of bundling. I'm
wondering whether you're growing a little bit faster than the market, as you commented on. But is any of that coming in
the form of either share ahead of some of the strategic or hypothetical strategic actions in the space or just benefits of
having a broader bigger trauma, hip, knee offering in Orthopedics?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: I do think that we are seeing the benefit of having a broader offering in Orthopedics. And
we had estimated some sales synergy from combining these businesses. And we just got a report recently from the
team, and we're ahead of the sales synergies that we had expected. So I think the overall combination is working well
for us. This is a marketplace, as you know, where share changes are not very dramatic and they're gradual over time,
but we're seeing positive momentum in that regard.

<Q - Matthew Stephan Miksic>: Nothing on the share gains related to dyssynergies or reps jumping ship from some
of these other competitors?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: I think a little too early to tell that, but we do think that is an opportunity going forward.
There will be disruption as we experienced ourselves when we combined our two spine businesses. So we think that
will be an opportunity for us on a go forward basis.
<Q - Matthew Stephan Miksic>: Great, thanks.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: You're welcome.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: With respect to everyone's time we'll take two more questions. Next question, please.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen and Company.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning, Josh.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Hi, Josh.
<Q - Josh T. Jennings>: Good morning, thanks a lot. I just wanted to follow up with a question on the Ortho unit.
You've, obviously, established breadth and scale there, but just wanted to see if you would comment on where some of
the weakness in the portfolio is that's serving on as an anchor to the overall growth of the franchise. And then also does
J&J need a robotics platform for the recon and/or spine businesses to compete effectively in the future?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Let me just say that with respect to the second question, I don't think we need a robotics
platform of our own to effectively compete in the future. We are in fact utilized in the robotic platforms that exists
today with our products at the end of – vector end of the robotic arm. So we do participate in the robotic, but I don't
view it as a critical enabler of growth for us in particular. And then secondly, with respect to the overall Orthopedics
business, I would say the only place we saw some softening is in trauma, in the extremities portion of trauma, so lower
foot and ankle kind of trauma products. That market seem to be growing more rapidly than the overall market and we
have some new innovations coming to market, but not yet there. So we're not yet participated in that growth, but we
will be going forward.
<Q - Josh T. Jennings>: Okay.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Next question, please, next and last question, and then we'll turn it over to Dominic for some
final remarks.
Operator
Your final question will be from the line of David Lewis, Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Thanks, guys, for squeezing me in here. Louise, just related to ZYTIGA, the U.S. growth rates
were actually relatively strong, but the international growth rates slowed a little bit. I know it was a very challenging
comp outside the U.S. Can you just update us on any dynamics outside the U.S. for ZYTIGA? And then specifically in
the U.S., maybe insight you can give us on competitive share and key patient indications and how you're trending?
Thank you.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: So for the U.S., about 90% of our shares are going through the oncologists and about 10%,
11% going through the urologists. In the third quarter, 16% plus was in the naïve versus the refractory. And I think
what you're seeing outside the U.S. is continued new introductions into the market.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Okay. Thank you very much.

<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: You're very welcome.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: So some final remarks from Dominic.
Dominic J. Caruso
Okay, thank you, everybody, for your thoughtful questions, and I hope you will agree that our continued investments in
innovation and our strategic portfolio management are delivering very strong performance and positioning us well for
growth moving forward. While we couldn't do that without the great people who work at Johnson & Johnson, I would
like to thank them for all they do every day and the contributions they make on behalf of the consumers and patients
whose lives we touch around the world every day. So thank you very much for joining us today, and have a great day.
