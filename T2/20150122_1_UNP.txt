our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Rob Knight, our Chief Financial Officer.
This morning we're pleased to report that Union Pacific achieved fourth quarter earnings of $1.61 per share, an increase
of 27% compared to the fourth quarter 2013, and another quarterly record. Total volumes were up 6% with increases in
all six of our business groups. Industrial products and coal showed particular strength up 10% and 9%, respectively.
These strong volumes along with solid core pricing and productivity helped drive 3.6 points on our operating ratio to a
record 61.4% for the fourth quarter. These strong fourth quarter results rounded out a full year 2014, which was very
successful on many fronts. We posted record financial results in revenue, operating income, earnings per share, and
operating ratio. The strong demand we experienced back in the first quarter was sustained throughout 2014, driving
total volume growth of 7% for the year.
Robust volumes challenged our network for much of the year and we remain focused on adding the necessary resources
to safely improve service and were encouraged with the progress that we're making. We remain fully committed to
deliver safe, efficient value-added service for our customers.
So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Eric.
Eric L. Butler
Thanks, Jack, and good morning. In the fourth quarter, volume was up 6% as solid demand across our franchise led to
volume gains in all of our business groups. Strength in industrial products and coal led our volume gain for the quarter,
and intermodal and chemical volumes were strong as well. Growth moderated in Ag products during the quarter as we
are now comparing to the strong grain harvest in 2013.
Core price increased 3%, which drove average revenue per car up by 3% in the quarter. Our volume growth and
improved average revenue per car combined to drive freight revenue up 9%, which set a fourth quarter record of $5.8
billion. Let's take a closer look at each of the six business groups.
Ag products revenue was up 9% in the fourth quarter on a 4% increase in volume, and a 5% improvement in average
revenue per car. Grain car loadings were up 3% in the fourth quarter, reflecting another record crop year for both corn
and soybeans. U.S. corn production was up more than 3% and soybean production was up 18% over the 2013 crop.
We saw a strong overseas export feed grain shipments this quarter partially offset by lower exports for Mexico as
receivers switched to local supplies. Domestic feed grain shipments also contributed to our growth as lower corn prices
drove demand. Wheat car loadings continued to be a headwind as lower wheat prices drove export – drove down export
shipments.
Grain products volume grew by 4% as strong gasoline demand and favorable export conditions drove another strong
quarter of ethanol shipments. Food and refrigerated shipments were up 4% for the quarter. There was a strong domestic
sugar beet crop, which combined with continued import beer growth to more than offset salted, fresh, and frozen food
shipments.
Automotive revenue was flat in the fourth quarter on a 2% increase in volume. Average revenue per car was down 2%,
driven by the previously reported change in the way we handle per diem shipments and also by mix. As a reminder, we
lapped the per diem change at the end of 2014, so we will not have this impact going forward.
Finished vehicle shipments were up 2% this quarter, driven by continued strength in consumer demand. The seasonally
adjusted annual rate for North American automotive sales was 16.7 million vehicles for the fourth quarter, up more
than 1 million units from the same quarter in 2013. Partially offsetting our volume gain was production variability at
some key plants. On the parts side, increased production and the continued focus on over-the-road conversions drove a
2% volume increase.
In chemicals, our revenue was up 8% for the quarter on a 5% volume increase and a 3% improvement in average
revenue per car. Fertilizer shipments were up 17% in the fourth quarter, driven primarily by strong international

demand for potash and shipments of phos rock. Crude oil volume was up 7% in this quarter.
We saw gains in shipments from the Niobrara and Uinta basins which more than offset continued weakness in Bakken
shipments caused by unfavorable price spreads. Finally, liquid petroleum gas storage shipments along with fuel
additive and lube oil demand drove our petroleum and LPG shipments up 5% for the quarter.
Coal revenue increased 9% on a 9% increase in volume and a 1% increase in average revenue per car. Southern Powder
River Basin tonnage was up 17% for the quarter. You will recall that we have an easy comp due to a snowstorm that
impacted shipments out of the southern Powder River Basin in October of 2013.
In addition, strong demand from lower inventories and stockpile replenishment ahead of the winter contributed to our
growth and offset volume headwinds from our previously reported legacy contract laws. Colorado/Utah tonnage was
down 11% for the quarter, driven primarily by continued soft demand for export coal.
Industrial products revenue increased 15% on a 10% increase in volume and a 5% improvement in average revenue per
car. Non-metallic minerals was up 28% for the quarter, again, primarily driven by a 35% increase in frac sand
shipments. We continue to see demand for construction product shipments, where volume was up 17%, based on
demand for aggregates and cement. Lumber shipments were up 10% in the quarter, driven by housing and
non-residential construction demand, as well as growth through over-the-road truck to rail conversions.
Finally, in intermodal, revenue was up 11%, driven by 6% increase in volume and a 5% improvement in average
revenue per unit. We had another strong quarter in domestic intermodal with volume up 10%. New premium services
and highway conversions continued to drive and led to a best ever fourth quarter in domestic intermodal. Our
international intermodal volume was up 2% as new business volume and continued economic strength in the U.S. offset
headwinds created by reduced West Coast port productivity.
Let's take a look at how we see our business shaping up for 2015. In Ag products, the strong corn and soybean crop and
competitive corn prices should sustain domestic demand though worldwide grain inventories are relatively high
creating a potential headwind for exports.
Ethanol margins are tightening, which can lead to a reduction in ethanol production in the near term. Longer term,
increased gasoline consumption and export opportunities should create strength in the ethanol market and demand for
DDG should strengthen as China re-enters the market. We also anticipate another strong year of import beer growth.
In automotive, finished vehicles and auto part shipments will continue to benefit from strength in production and sales
driven by an improving U.S. economy, replacement demand, and lower gasoline prices.
Low inventory levels should continue to drive replenishment demand for coal into 2015. We are watching natural gas
prices closely, but at this point we have not seen lower prices impact demand for coal.
We expect most of our chemicals markets to remain solid in 2015, but we think crude oil would be a headwind
throughout the year. We will keep a close eye on oil prices as the year progresses, as the recent drop has led producers
to reevaluate their plans for 2015. Ultimately, if the oil prices remain at current levels, it will impact our crude oil
shipments.
We also expect energy market to be a factor in our frac sand volumes in industrial products. The decline in oil prices
has impacted rig counts. So it is unlikely that we will see the robust levels of growth that we saw in 2014; however, our
franchise is well positioned to participate in ongoing fracking operations. We'll have to see how the energy markets
play out to see what the ultimate impact will be on our sand volumes.
Also, in industrial products, we expect the market in construction products to continue, particularly in the southern part
of our franchise. We also anticipate year-over-year improvement in housing and other construction markets to drive
demand for lumber.
In intermodal, consumer demand and highway conversions will drive growth in domestic intermodal in 2015. In
international intermodal, we would expect increased imports to drive growth this year; however, the deterioration of

productivity at West Coast ports is having an impact on our volume early in the first quarter. At this point, while we are
hopeful that the parties will come to a resolution soon, international intermodal will be a headwind until the labor
dispute is resolved.
To wrap up, there are a number of uncertainties on the horizon. We're keeping a close eye on the impact of crude oil
prices, softening global economies and the West Coast labor dispute. Overall, we expect the U.S. economy to continue
to strengthen this year and drive growth in many of our business groups. With our diverse franchise, strong value
proposition and continued focus on business development, we expect to deliver another year of positive volume and
profitable revenue growth.
With that, I'll turn it over to Lance.
Lance M. Fritz
Thank you, Eric, and good morning. I'll start with safety, where our full year results included a record low reportable
personal injury rate of 0.98, an 11% improvement versus 2013. I'm very proud of the team as we made a nice step
forward on our commitment that every employee returns home safely after each shift.
In rail equipment incidents or derailments, our reportable rate improved to 7%, to 3.00, falling just short of an all-time
record. Enhanced TE&Y training and continued infrastructure investment helped reduce the absolute number of
incidents, including those that do not meet the regulatory reportable threshold to a record low.
In public safety, our grade crossing incident rate increased 5% versus 2013. Driver behavior continues to be a critical
factor in crossing incidents. We continued to reinforce public awareness through community partnerships and public
safety campaigns and focused our countermeasures on high-risk crossings. In summary, the team has made terrific
progress on our goal of achieving annual safety records on the way to an incident-free environment.
In regards to network performance, we worked hard in 2014 to match network resources with the robust volume growth
we enjoyed. During the latter part of the fourth quarter, our available resources were largely aligned with demand. That
combined with the successful Thanksgiving holiday operation, and better winter action plans, contributed to substantial
service improvement in December. The net result was sequential velocity improvement in each region of our network,
all while handling strong volumes.
And while our velocity in December was more than a mile an hour faster than November and the best since January,
our service performance still fell short during the fourth quarter. As reported to the AAR, fourth quarter velocity was
down 8%, and freight car dwell up 11% when compared to 2013. Our performance in December was a step in the right
direction, but we are still not where we need to be. The team continues its relentless push to handle our customers'
growing volumes while improving service.
Moving to productivity, volume trends from the first nine months of 2014 largely continued in the fourth quarter,
including relatively balanced growth in each region. We continued to leverage volume by increasing train lengths.
During the fourth quarter, we set best-ever records in nearly all major categories. The exception was in intermodal,
where new service offerings created a headwind. Even so, we still generated a year-over-year increase, in part
reflecting our success in growing volumes within these lanes.
And our fuel conservation initiatives generated positive results in 2014, including a 2% improvement in the fourth
quarter. We found new opportunities to reduce waste and continued to deploy advanced technologies that assist the
engineer in saving fuel and that [ph] optimized train meets (13:09). With the workforce and locomotives resourced to
match demand, we are positioned to generate both productivity gains and improve network fluidity.
Last year, our total TE&Y workforce increased by more than 1,700 employees, and our active locomotive fleet
increased by around 800 units. Surge resources, activated during the year, accounted for some of the TE&Y and most
of the locomotive growth. In addition to recalls, we hired around 3,600 TE&Y employees in 2014. Approximately
1,000 of these new hires moved from training to active status during the last three months of the year. For 2015, we

plan to hire 2,800, TE&Y employees to cover growth and attrition and to generate incremental service improvement.
We also plan to acquire 218 locomotives on top of the 261 units we purchased in 2014.
As 2015 unfolds, we will adjust resources based on demand and network performance. Rebuilding our surge resources
is an important part of our operating strategy. Capital investment in our track infrastructure has also helped us handle
volume growth while maintaining a safe and resilient network.
In total, we invested just under $4.1 billion in our 2014 capital program. This includes $2.3 billion in replacement
capital to harden our infrastructure and to improve the safety and the resiliency of the network. At the end of the year,
roughly 99% of our track miles were free of slow orders. Spending for service, growth, and productivity totaled $1.4
billion, driven by investments in capacity, commercial facilities and equipment.
Major growth investments included the completion of our Santa Teresa, New Mexico facility, as well as the Tower 55
project in Fort Worth, Texas. Both alleviated key bottlenecks. We also invested $385 million in positive train control
during 2014, bringing our cumulative PTC investment to $1.6 billion of the roughly $2 billion projected spend.
Assuming moderate economic growth, our overall 2015 capital plan will likely be higher than last year's spending.
New capacity investments will continue in the eastern third of our network. And we will advance corridor strategies
and reduce bottlenecks across the system. Our core investment thesis will not waver, which is to maintain a safe, strong
and reliable network and to investment in service, growth and productivity projects that meet our aggressive return
thresholds.
To wrap up, as we start 2015, our operating strategy is to continue to move our service volume frontier up and to the
right. As a result, we expect to generate record safety results in our way – on our way to an incident-free environment.
We expect to create opportunities through improved network performance, and to continue working with connecting
railroads on key gateway interchange performance.
And we'll invest in the resources and network capacity needed to overcome congestion and to handle increased demand
leveraging volume growth and productivity gains to drive incremental operating ratio improvement. And we will
remain agile, adapting and adjusting resources according to network performance and demand.
In fact, we've already started to rebuild our surge fleet moving around 100 older, less efficient locomotives into storage
and 400 or so employees into furlough or alternative work status. Ultimately, running a safe, reliable and efficient
railroad creates value for our customers and increased returns for our shareholders.
With that, I will turn it over to Rob.
Robert M. Knight
Thanks and good morning. Let's start with a recap of our fourth quarter results. Operating revenue grew 9% to nearly
$6.2 billion, driven by strong volume growth and solid core pricing. Operating expenses totaled just under $3.8 billion,
increasing 3% over last year. The net result was operating income growing 20% to about $2.4 billion. Below the line,
other income totaled $71 million, up from $37 million in 2013. Included in the $71 million was approximately $0.02
per share of one-time items, including real estate gains.
Interest expense of $146 million was up 15%, compared to the previous year, primarily driven by increased debt
issuance during the year. Income tax expense increased to $867 million, driven primarily by higher pre-tax earnings.
Net income grew 22% versus 2013, while the outstanding share balance declined 3% as a result of our continued share
repurchase activity. These results combined to produce best-ever quarterly earnings of $1.61 per share, up 27% versus
last year.
Turning to our top line, freight revenue grew 9% to nearly $5.8 billion. This was driven primarily by volume growth of
6% and core pricing gains of 3%. Fuel surcharge revenue was about flat for the fourth quarter, as the decline in fuel
price was offset by the lag in fuel surcharge program and higher volumes. All in, we estimate the net impact of the
reduced fuel prices added a nickel per share in the fourth quarter versus last year. This includes both the surcharge lag

and the lower diesel costs.
Business mix was also about flat for the quarter, as the positive mix impact from frac sand volume was offset by the
increase in lower average revenue per unit intermodal shipments during the quarter. Other revenue increased 8% in the
quarter. Primary drivers included revenue associated with the per diem on auto parts containers, as well as subsidiary
related volume growth.
Recall that last January, we began reporting per diem revenue on auto parts containers in other revenue as a result of
the change in how we are compensated for this service. And as Eric just mentioned, we've now lapped that change on a
year-over-year basis. So we won't see a variance from the per diem change going forward.
Slide 22 provides more detail on our core pricing trend in 2014. Fourth quarter core pricing came in at 3%, reflecting
steady improvement throughout the year and a more favorable pricing environment. For the full year, core pricing was
around 2.5% demonstrating our commitment to market pricing at reinvestible levels above inflation. While 2014 was a
legacy light year, we do expect to see some benefit in 2015 from legacy renewals.
And I'm pleased to announce that we have successfully retained 100% of the legacy business that was up for renewal
beginning in 2015. In addition, we have also successfully renegotiated a year early the legacy business that was due to
expire in 2016. So with the exception of only a few small contracts in the out years, we have now successfully
addressed all of our remaining legacy contracts.
Moving on to the expense side, slide 23 provides a summary of our compensation and benefits expense, which
increased 7% versus 2013. Higher volumes, inflation, and increased training expense were the primary drivers of the
increase, along with some increased costs associated with running a less than optimal network.
Looking at our total workforce levels, our employee count was up 4.5%, when compared to 2013. At this point in time,
we plan to hire around 5,700 employees in 2015 to cover attrition of just under 4,000, as well as for volume growth and
capital programs. And as Lance just discussed, the bulk of this hiring will come in our TE&Y ranks. Labor inflation for
2015 is expected to come in between 4% and 5% for the full year. This is driven primarily by agreement wage
inflation.
Turning to the next slide, fuel expense totaled $813 million, down 10% when compared to 2013. A 7% increase in
gross ton miles was more than offset by lower diesel fuel prices in the quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of last
year, our fuel consumption rate improved 2%, while our average fuel price declined 14% to $2.66 per gallon.
Moving on to our other expense categories, purchase, services and materials expense increased 14% to $665 million
due to volume-related contract and subsidiary expenses, higher locomotive and freight car material costs and crew
transportation and lodging expenses. Depreciation expense was $489 million, up 7% compared to 2013, and in line
with our 7% to 8% full-year guidance. In 2015, depreciation expense is expected to increase between 4% to 6% for the
full year.
Slide 26 summarizes the remaining two expense categories. Equipment and other rents expense totaled $296 million,
which is 5% favorable when compared to 2013. The favorability was primarily attributable to lower lease costs, as a
result of exercising purchase options on some of our leased equipment.
Other expenses came in at $228 million, up $40 million versus last year. Higher state and local taxes, personal injury
expense and damaged freight and equipment costs contributed to the year-over-year increase. Other expenses finished
the year up 9%, within the range of our full-year guidance of 5% to 10%. For 2015, we expect the other expense line to
again increase between 5% and 10% on a full-year basis, excluding any unusual items.
Turning to our operating ratio performance. We achieved a quarterly operating ratio of 61.4%, improving 3.6 points
when compared to 2013. The net impact of lower fuel prices contributed about 1.5 points of the improvement. I'm also
pleased to report a full-year operating ratio of 63.5%, which is 2.6 points improvement from 2013. As you will recall,
from our Investor Day event this past November, we have issued new operating ratio guidance of a 60% operating
ratio, plus or minus, on a full-year basis by 2019.

Slide 28 provides a full summary of our 2014 earnings and a full-year income statement. I'll walk through a few
highlights from a record-setting year. Operating revenue grew more than $2 billion, to $24 billion. Operating income
totaled almost $8.8 billion, topping 2013 by 18%. And net income was just under $5.2 billion while earnings grew 22%
to $5.75 per share.
Turning now to our cash flow, in 2014, cash from operations increased to almost $7.4 billion, up 8% compared to 2013.
After dividends, our free cash flow totaled $1.5 billion for the year. This is down $581 million from 2013, reflecting
primarily higher cash capital and dividend payments along with the headwind of bonus depreciation.
Taking a closer look at 2015, we will see the benefit of 2014 bonus depreciation, which was passed just before
year-end. This benefit will nearly offset the cash tax payment associated with prior-year programs. As a result, the net
impact of bonus depreciation on this year's cash flow will be close to neutral.
Slide 30 shows our 2014 capital program of just under $4.1 billion. In 2015, we expect to increase our capital plan
somewhat from 2014's levels to approximately $4.3 billion pending final approval from our board of directors in
February. The chart on the right shows our improvement in generating returns on these investments over the last
several years. Return on invested capital was 16.2% in 2014, up 1.5 points from 2013. Of course, as we've said many
times, if you calculate it on a replacement basis, our returns would be significantly lower.
In addition to funding our capital program, our record profitability and strong cash generation enabled us to also
significantly grow shareholder returns. We increased our quarterly declared dividend per share twice in 2014 to $0.50
per share by the fourth quarter, up 27% from the fourth quarter of 2013. For 2014, we achieved a declared payout ratio
of just above 33%, up from 31.5% in 2013, and consistent with our new guidance of growing dividend payout target to
35%.
We also continue to be opportunistic in our share repurchases. In the fourth quarter, we bought back more than 7.7
million shares, totaling $880 million. For the full year, purchases exceeded 32 million shares and totaled about $3.2
billion, up 45% from 2013. Our current repurchase authorization of up to 120 million shares over a four-year time
period went into effect January 1 of 2014. About 88 million shares remain on that authorization as of year-end 2014.
When you combine dividend payments and share repurchases, we returned almost $4.9 billion to our shareholders in
2014. These combined payments represented a 37% increase over 2013, continuing our strong commitment to
increasing shareholder value.
Taking a look at the balance sheet, we increased our adjusted debt by approximately $2.1 billion in 2014, bringing our
adjusted debt balance to $14.9 billion at year-end. This increases our adjusted debt-to-cap ratio to 41.3%, up from
37.6% at year-end 2013. This puts us in line with our guidance of an adjusted debt-to-cap ratio in the low-to-mid 40%
range. We also finished the year with an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.4 and remain committed to our
longer-term guidance of an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 1.5 plus.
So that's a recap of the fourth quarter and full-year results. As we look ahead to 2015, we are well positioned to achieve
yet another record year in many of our key financial measures. Solid core pricing, ongoing productivity initiatives and
volume leverage opportunities, assuming the economy cooperates, should help drive continued margin improvement.
And as Eric highlighted earlier, we have growth opportunities across a variety of market sectors that should drive
modest volume growth for the first quarter and the full-year. And we'll continue to focus on improving returns and
generating strong cash flow, which will support our ongoing capital investments, as well as our commitment to
increasing returns to our shareholders.
So with that, I'll turn it back to Jack.
John J. Koraleski
Okay, thanks, Rob. So as you'd expect with 2014 behind us, we're intently focused on the year ahead. Here's what it's
looking like: overall, the U.S. economy continues to move forward at a moderate pace, but, of course, there's always

some uncertainty out there. Clearly, one of the biggest uncertainties is the outlook for energy markets, which will bring
both challenges and opportunities as we move ahead. Lower energy prices could slow the recent shale-related domestic
energy boom, depending on how low the prices get and how long they stay there. On the other hand, lower gasoline
prices could spur continued auto sales and help strengthen the consumer economy, which would create opportunities in
our other market segments.
So on balance, with all the pluses and minuses taken together, we expect to see positive volume growth for the 2015
year. We'll watch closely and stay agile so that we can meet our customers' needs across our diverse franchise. We'll
also continue to build on the progress we've made in improving our network capability so that we can provide the safe,
reliable service our customers expect and deserve. We're entering the year well-resourced and we're looking forward to
safely providing efficient, value-added service for our customers and increasing returns for our shareholders in 2015.
So with that, let's open up the line for your questions.

Thank you. We'll now be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes
from the line of Allison Landry with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Thinking about frac sand in 2015, and the
number of wells drilled is expected to be down somewhere in the 25% range and sort of offsetting that would be the
better capitalized E&P companies high-grading and improving productivity per well. So if you sort of balance these
factors, do you think you can still grow frac sand car loads year-over-year? And in what scenario do you think that
volumes would outright contract?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Okay, Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yes, sir. Allison, I think you have it exactly right where there are ins and outs in terms of there
have already been reported probably about 20% rig reduction, but the well-capitalized companies are focused on
continuing to drill where they could make their profits and there's a wide range of economics in all of the shale, so
thinking of all of those factors right. Having said that, I think it really is too early to tell how all of that's going to play
out. We certainly don't know if oil prices will remain this low. If oil prices increase, certainly that's going to be a lift for
us.
So there are a lot of ins and outs. We feel really, really good that we have the premier franchise in terms of kind of frac
sand coverage. We have the best franchise for most of the major shales, particularly, the shales that will arguably still
be profitable, Eagle Ford, Permian, you can see growth in the Niobrara. There's even rumblings about the Haynesville
coming back. So we feel really, really good about our franchise and our position. And at this point, we, like everybody
else, is keeping a close eye on it.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Okay. That makes sense. And just as a follow-up question, Jack, some of your comments at
the end, I think, in terms of thinking about the broader economic benefit of lower oil prices sort of against the backdrop
of weakness in shale-related activity, how do we think about this in terms of overall volume growth? I mean, obviously,
there's a lot of puts and takes, but are you thinking about it sort of as like a net-net neutral, sort of, on a relative basis
with benefits maybe in autos, consumer products, et cetera, and then that being offset from crude-by-rail frac, could
you help us think about that?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Yes, Allison. I think your head's in the right place on that. I think when you look at it,
assume – I think popular people – popular opinions say consumers drive two-thirds of the economy. If consumers are
having discretionary spending and they're going to buy automobiles, they're going to build new houses, they're going to
buy new furniture, consumer goods, those kinds of things. Those kind of all hit right within the sweet spot of our
franchise. And we've seen that in the fourth quarter, the construction products up 17%, lumber up 10%. Automobile

business, the [ph] SAAR at 16.7% (34:09). So it's not unreasonable to think that knocking on the door of $17 million
for 2015.
So again, when we add it all up, pluses and minuses, we think at the end of the year, barring anything that is unusual
that we haven't seen at this point in time, we're going to still end up with positive volume by the time we get to the end
of the year.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Okay. Excellent. Thank you so much for the time.

Our next question comes from the line of Ken Hoexter of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Wonderful. Hey, good morning.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Hi, Ken.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: When you set the – Rob, I guess, when you set the operating ratio target, fuel was much
higher and you noted 1.5 points benefit. Are there any other offsets that don't get you to move up that timeframe? I
guess, if you think about the 1.5 points benefit from the 63.5%, along with the repricing that's already locked in, what
can happen in terms of – is there a chance you hit that target in 2015? Or is there something there that can offset that?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, Ken. I mean, clearly, this unprecedented falloff in fuel helped us, but – and clearly, if
it stayed at this level or dropped even further, that would be a contributor towards hitting our – achieving our targeted
60% plus or minus operating ratio target. But we'll see how fuel plays out. So I mean, I'm not willing to bet that over
the long haul fuel will stay where it is. And there's really no other – I mean, the rest of the story, if you will, in terms of
us running a safe, efficient railroad getting core pricing, squeezing out productivity, so I think what the drivers are
really going to get back to our core fundamentals in the business that will enable us to get to that sub-60% as soon as
we possibly can.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Hey, Ken said that 1.5 points came from fuel. I don't think that's quite right, is it?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Well, yeah, just to clarify, that, Ken, because I'm not sure I caught exactly how you asked it,
but just to clarify the impact of fuel, the benefit of the falling fuel price in the fourth quarter was about 1.5 points of
benefit in the fourth quarter. For the full year, the benefit of the fuel was more like 0.7 points of a helper on our
operating ratio.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Yeah. I was just extrapolating that fourth quarter benefit, I guess, through the year, if we
stayed at these lower prices.
If I could just get the follow-up, Eric, maybe on the – you mentioned low nat gas prices can impact. There's a lag
before it impacts coal flows. Can you maybe delve into that a little bit, talk about the outlook for coal? Do we see
maybe one more quarter of replenishing stockpiles, and then starting in the second quarter we see a falloff with these
prices? Or is it still kind of in that flux point even at these levels in terms of PRB switching? It seems like it's already
impacted the Colorado/Utah side. Maybe you can delve into that a little bit.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, Ken. So we've historically said and I think the market convention was kind of the
switchover point was the low-to-mid $2s for natural gas pricing. The Colorado/Utah impact was really an export coal,
world coal price impact. It's not a domestic U.S. natural gas impact. As we look forward, we're not really seeing a lot of
switchover impact for us now. We are still seeing replenishment. As you suggested, the inventory numbers for
December should come out here in the next couple of days.
We still expect that inventories are going to be low when they come out here in the next couple of days. But the other –
we've said forever the real driver is weather and the economy and so that will be the ultimate driver for our coal
volumes. We do feel really good about where we stand from a position. One of the strategic factors that I think may

have changed from the past is that if you go a year ago and what happened with natural gas prices there was a lot of
volatility and I think there's been rethinking on some of – on many of the utilities to really rethink coal as kind of a base
line fuel as a risk hedge against the natural gas volatility. So for that reason, I feel pretty good about our coal outlook.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Great insight. Appreciate the time. Thank you, guys.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from the line of Justin Long with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Justin Long>: Thanks and good morning.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Good morning.
<Q - Justin Long>: I wanted to ask a question about intermodal. I know this varies by lane, but when you look at the
price differential between intermodal and truck in your network today, what's the typical spread and how has that
spread changed, if at all, over the course of the last couple of quarters as we've seen fuel prices come down?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: So, Eric, that sounds like for you.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, Justin, I think we've said historically that the spread can be pretty wide as much as 25%,
30% in some lanes, and it could be narrow as low as 10%. I think the factors that we've been talking about are still [ph]
there (39:25), even growing the factors being driver shortages. I think that is still a factor that is going to drive
conversions. If you look at the experience that we've had, we've had another year of record domestic intermodal
volumes.
You can look at our fourth quarter volumes and we've had new products and services. Last year, we talked a lot about
the new services that we put in place. We opened Santa Teresa. So we're entering new markets. We still have driver
shortages. Growth in domestic intermodal, still a sweet spot. There still is a gap there, but as we are selling out value,
our goal is to grow volume and close that gap.
<Q - Justin Long>: Okay. That's great. And maybe as just a follow-up to that, do you think that 2015 is a year where
intermodal pricing mirrors contractual rate increases in truckload? I'm just curious if this would be the best proxy,
truckload rate increases? Or if there's a reason you think intermodal pricing should be any different than truckload this
year?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: We still think we have strong opportunity to grow price in our intermodal book of business. If
you look at what happened in 2014, as the truckers, as demand increased on trucks, driver shortages, et cetera, some
truckloads, some truck entities have shorter-term prices. So they probably were able to respond quicker than entities
that have longer-term contractual arrangements, but we feel really good about our opportunity to price going forward.
<Q - Justin Long>: Okay. Thanks, Eric, and congrats on the quarter.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Thank you.

Our next question is from the line of Tom Wadewitz with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Yeah. Good morning and congratulations on the strong results.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Thanks, Tom.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Yeah, yeah. I wanted to ask a bit about legacy contract repricing. I think you highlighted
that you were successful in retaining all of what was coming due in 2015; so that's good news, but also, pulled forward
what was in 2016. So I think in the past, you've talked about, maybe it was a 2013 impact, where you got like 1.5 points

boost to pricing to core price from legacy. Given the success on legacy in 2015, should we think of that as higher than
the 1.5 points impact to core price? Is it more like two points or above that? Or how can you kind of frame that legacy
impact to core pricing in 2015?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Okay. Rob, why don't you take that?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, Tom, what I'll tell you is it's a positive, but we're not going to give the specific
numbers on that as we never have in terms of our guidance. We're pleased with the business. We're pleased that we
were able to compete and retain those contracts that we talked about for 2015 and 2016 and it will certainly be a
positive contributor to our core pricing in 2015.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: I mean, is it reasonable to think it's maybe a bigger impact than 2013?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: I'm not going to answer that. The caution that you've heard me say many, many times, is I
wouldn't straight line past performance and overlay that on top of these contracts. When we report our pricing in the
first quarter and beyond, you'll see that embedded in the pricing numbers that we report, but I'm not going to give my
more details on it.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Okay. All right. Well, on the follow-up question, I guess, the industry had capacity
challenges in 2014. Your western competitor perhaps had greater challenges than others. And I think it's fair to say you
probably gained some volume as a result of that. How would you think about the impact of that to 2015 volumes?
There velocity seems to be improving. I think you said you believe that you're adequately resourced. So is there some
volume that goes back to them potentially? Should we assume your volume growth slows down because you don't gain
share like you did? Or how would we just frame that potential impact from changing capacity and service performance
of your competitor?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: I think overall, Tom, when you look at the business that we were able to move in 2014, the
table is set for us to prove the value proposition of Union Pacific versus our competition. And our competitor has
always been right there chomping at the bit. So it's always a head-to-head competition in any one of those
opportunities. And our challenge and our ability to convince those customers that the Union Pacific value proposition is
what fits in their business model more effectively is really what we're all about here. So, yeah, we may lose some of
that business, we may gain some additional business. We'll just have to see how the competitive world plays itself out
in 2015.
<Q - Thomas Wadewitz>: Okay. Great. Thanks for the time.

Our next question is from the line of Tom Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Thomas Kim>: Good morning and thanks for the time. I wanted to follow on Tom's earlier question on the
legacy reprice. First off, can you just quantify the amount that was up for renewal for 2016, as you highlighted what
was for 2015 previously?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Sure. Rob?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, I mean, Tom, I would just call your attention to the, I think, the last pie chart we
showed at the Investor Day. The revenue that we reflected there, which was based on historical by the way, it's not a
projection of what those contracts are going to drive going forward. But we said there was about $300 million of
revenue in the legacy bucket for 2015, and about $140 million in that bucket for 2016. So those are the buckets that
we're talking about here.
<Q - Thomas Kim>: Okay. That's really helpful. And just our understanding with regard to the timing, should we sort
of factor this in sort of staggered over the course of the year? Or is this sort of a Jan 1 effect? If you could just give us a

little bit of sense in terms of how to be thinking about how that flows through that would be helpful. Thank you.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah. The bulk of that $300 million for this year was front-end loaded. So we should start
getting it relatively early on that piece this year.
<Q - Thomas Kim>: Great. Thanks very much.
Operator
Our next question is from the line of Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. So I actually had one more follow-up on the legacy stuff.
So, Rob, is there any way to put some color on historically, how much of the benefit of a legacy deal was in the base
rate? And how much was just getting a fuel surcharge for the first time? And just to that – could that suggest that
maybe the legacy benefit isn't as good as maybe as it would have been now that oil is much lower? That's one question
on fuel.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, I mean, fuel not only in the legacy contracts, but in all of our contracts will obviously
play a role in how much – what we report in average revenue per car per unit. But in terms of your question of can I
give you some historical or shed some light on that, the answer to that is no. It was a combination of walking up the
pricing on our historical legacy renewals, and as you know, rolling up or improving.
It wasn't always the case of going from zero to adequate, in some cases there were fuel surcharge mechanisms in place
in some of those older contracts. We just were able to look at them and make sure they were adequate. And I would say
the same thing applies in this go-around. But, trying to quantify or give you a percentage split, I can't give you that.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Okay. That makes sense. And then, can you guys just give an update on what you're seeing at
the West Coast ports? What contingency plans you have in place in case there's a lockout or a strike? And just how
you're thinking about what the impact there could be?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Sure. We've been staying very close to the situation and working with our customers. Eric,
why don't you kind of talk about some of the things that we're doing and thinking about?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah. I think you probably know that both sides did ask for federal mediation, so that mediator
was appointed, I think, last week or so. And they're going through the process. I don't think we have any unique
knowledge of how that process is going. We're hopeful that the issue does get resolved. We have put a contingency
plans in place in the event of a work stoppage and we've communicated those to our customers in terms of the things
that we'll do to manage our network and do the best job we can of managing customer needs and expectations through a
work stoppage. So, as Jack said, we're staying close to it. I'm not sure we have any specific knowledge beyond the
parties and the federal mediation that's going on.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Do you think just the uncertainty is going to have an impact on your volume or ability to get
price?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah. The uncertainty has, I guess, nothing to do with price. The price is driven by kind of the
market opportunities and the value of our product and that still remains. Certainly, in the short term, BCOs are doing
what they need to do to protect their supply chain, that's expected. That's what has occurred at times in the past when
similar labor issues have gone on in any port. We think, going forward, that once the issues are resolved and they're
behind, the whole supply chain effectiveness of the rail transportation network, our rail transportation network with the
ports of Long Beach, L.A., still there's a premier way of getting product into this country. The Southern
California/West Coast destination market is still a huge market. So we are very comfortable going forward with the
value of our franchise and our proposition once this labor issue is resolved.

Our next question is from the line of Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your questions.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Hey. Thanks for taking the questions this morning. As a follow-up to Allison's earlier
question regarding the frac sand franchise, could you give us a sense how the split of that business is broken down by
contracts versus tariff pricing? And any sort of overall exposure that you guys have to the different shales?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah. So we don't talk about kind of the structure of our pricing by business. We don't do that.
What I would say is – and if you refer back to some of the materials at the Investor Day, we did share that the majority
of our franchise is destined in the Eagle Ford and Permian shale plays, I think we said about 60% of that, but we do
have a great broad franchise in all the shale plays whether you want to look at Niobrara, Uinta, if you want to look at
Marcellus, Haynesville, et cetera. We have a great franchise. And so we think that does provide us a natural hedge for
whatever the changes that the market these low oil prices may bring.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: And then, Rob, just switching directions over to the core pricing side of the equation, with
that hundred and – the roughly 140 for 2016 will we be experiencing a step up in 2015 regarding that pricing? Or are
you just kind of saying that we've already locked in the pricing which will commence in 2016?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah. I'm not going to get into the details of that particular renewal. So we're confident with
the business that we renewed. We like the pricing. We like the margins on it, but in terms of the timing, I'm not going
to get into that.

Our next question is from the line of Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Hey. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on the quarter.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Thanks, Brandon.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Eric, you know in the past, you guys have quantified your exposure to the frac sand,
the crude oil and the pipe. Is there any way that you can just update investors right now at your aggregate volume
exposure to those three segments?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yes. I think in the past, and I'm checking the number, but I think in the past, we probably said
about 5% of our volume is related to that, but I think that's about the number.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Okay. And for my follow-up, Jack talked about construction --
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Hey, Brandon, hold on a minute. Let's do some clarifying here.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah. Just to be clear, you were asking in total what's our sort of oil frac sand market share
or percent of our volume. We've said 4.5% all in, 2.5% from the sand, the rest like 1.5% from oil, and then the
remainder is some of the related materials, pipe, et cetera, just to kind of size our total.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Okay. Well, that's helpful, because obviously folks have a pretty negative outlook
on where that could go if oil stays at $50. But, I think Jack hit on it earlier that you're seeing quite a bit of improvement
in your construction markets. So can you talk about – and I know this might be more difficult to quantify, but what's
your exposure to non-res construction or even housing starts? And how do you weigh that versus where you think
construction projects were going into the energy markets? And does that become a net benefit for you going forward?

<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yes. I think what you're asking is geographically where are our markets. And so it's – we've
shared before kind of the fastest growing states are kind of in the southwest, and the west, and then the southeast. And
certainly, when you think about the south, the southwest, and the west, we have a great franchise exposure to those.
Certainly, some of the growth has come from the growth – energy-related growth in Texas, particularly around the
Houston market, but we're seeing good growth in our construction projects and construction products and housing in
non-Houston, non-Texas markets also.

Our next question is from the line of Jason Seidl of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. You mentioned that there's probably going to be a little
shift change between international and domestic intermodal, particularly in 1Q, given what's going on in the ports. Can
you remind us the impact that's going to have on your intermodal yields?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: So we have not discussed what our yields are by our intermodal business. We are seeing positive
trends and yields across our book of business, whether it's domestic or international, because of our strong pricing, and
we expect that trend to continue.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Well, I'll ask it a different way. Is there any big difference between the length of haul between
domestic and international?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: There's not a significant difference in the length of hauls between those two. There's a minor
difference, because again, our domestic business runs east-west, from the West Coast kind of to the Midwest, Chicago,
and Midwest interchange, and our international business runs over that same route. The minor difference would be the
mix of our business that runs north-south, which would have a shorter length of haul.
<Q - Jason H. Seidl>: Okay. And sort of related as a follow-up, I guess this might be a little bit more for Lance, but,
obviously, the rail industry was challenged in 2014 operationally. It impacted sort of everybody's bottom line. Can you
talk about productivity gains assuming that sort of everyone shows a little bit of improvement this year in 2014, if we
can put a number around it?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yeah. Without putting a number on it, I'll remind you that when we went, as we discussed
going through 2014, we said we were getting significant productivity and probably a little bit aberrational in that we
would have liked to have had more crews and locomotives to run the network.
As we move into 2015, we expect to continue to get productivity. I would expect it maybe not to be quite as
turbocharged as it was in 2014, because we'll now be matched in terms of resources to demand, but we will get
productivity continuing in 2015.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Well, and especially as cycle time improves, we're able to pull locomotives out of – put them
back in storage, pull them out of service, those kinds of things. Those are the least productive units that we'll be storing.
So...
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yeah.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: ...there's just some natural productivity that occurs as the velocity spools up. And I think our
latest numbers that we reported is a velocity of 25.3 MPH and headed in the right direction. So we feel good about that.

Our next question is from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Hey. Thanks for taking the question, guys.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Sure, Chris.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Yeah. Thinking about pricing for a second, if we put legacy aside and think about sort of the
underlying potential of the business into 2015, it would appear that we're sort of getting a little bit of an inflection more
positively throughout the year of 2014. Just want to get a rough sense of how you think about the outlook for sort of
everything ex-legacy as we think about the next year sort of what you've had the opportunity to touch and maybe what
could be coming up.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah. As we've said throughout 2014 and as we're saying today, we feel good about our market
value and our opportunity for pricing. And we have a strong value proposition, the economy is strengthening, and we're
excited about our ability to get price going forward.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Yeah. Chris, this is Jack. We don't really see anything that's changing our view on our
pricing model at this point in time. Re-investability has to be the threshold to get on to the Union Pacific franchise.
Price to market take advantage of opportunities across the franchises as we see them. And we don't see anything that's
happened here recently that would cause us to veer from that at all.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Certainly. That makes sense. And then with the follow up, on the intermodal side, just
thinking about the international intermodal side with what's going on in the West Coast ports and the sort of prolonged
period of negotiations there, do you get any sense that some of the disruptions that you're seeing may ultimately be
permanent or semi-permanent as shippers look for other alternatives? We've talked about this before in the past, and my
guess is most likely business comes back once we get resolution, but I just want to get a rough sense, Eric, maybe how
we should be thinking about that. Do you hear that at all?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah, Chris, I think you're exactly right. Certainly any shipper in terms of while this uncertainty
is here, they are trying to identify options to protect their supply chain and you see that, for example, right now, with
growth into Oakland, or shippers trying to get into Oakland, which is part of our franchise also, long term, the port of
LA, Long Beach is in a sweet spot in terms of connectivity with the rail network. Our network, our competitive
network, and long term, the expectation is once these things are behind, that will be the preferred option for shippers.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks for the time, guys. I appreciate it.

The next question is from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Hey. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. A couple on trying to get
some help in modeling forward RPUs. As you think about the demand outlook, I think we've talked about in terms of
crude oil and frac sand, should we also be expecting that with any reduced demand for sand or oil transportation, there's
also going to be an impact on the RPU or is the pricing going to be pretty well divorced from the supply/demand
economics and the underlying commodity?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: As I said before, we still feel really good about our franchise and our strength and our value
proposition, and we still see upside opportunity to drive value and to drive price in that market.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: But if the price of frac sand goes down a lot, should we expect that that producer is
going to eat that or there's going to be a little bit of pain shared between the producer and their transportation partner?

<A - Eric L. Butler>: We have never and we don't anticipate ever tying our value of our transportation products to
commodity price values.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Okay. And then maybe just as a quick follow up, as you think about the outlook as we
talked about it, may be a little weaker depending on what oil prices do, maybe a little stronger on construction, as you
think about that mix impact, would you expect that the average RPU on the construction stuff that would be growing
would be directionally better or worse than maybe some of the oil-related stuff that's going to be coming down? I'm not
looking for specifics, I'm just trying to get a sense of directionally what impact that mix should be having on the result.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Yeah, I think overall when you look at it, it will depend on which market. So if it's a
manifest business, if it's the lumber business and things like that, it tends to have a somewhat longer haul than some of
our frac sand, but there are so many moving parts to this, David, that it's pretty difficult for us to say what mix is going
to come our way as we look ahead to the year.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Can you give us any insight into that directional sort of the average construction unit
versus the average sort of crude and frac unit, higher/lower?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Rob?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: David, let me take a shot at your overall question here. There is no answer to your specific
question. But you heard me say many times that we avoid giving any guidance on average revenue per car. And that's
not a negative thing, it's just what I think what it says is the strength of the UP franchise is so diverse that we play in
multiple markets and just because one piece of business has a lower average revenue per unit is not a bad thing, it
might have a higher margin.
So I don't – that doesn't bother us when we see an average revenue per unit go up or down, because it speaks to the
diversity, it speaks to the mix. And in every case, we're focused on improving our margin.
The other thing, it's clearly going to impact the average revenue per unit right now, and potentially throughout the year
it's going to be the impact of fuel. So you're going to see, I think, some swings up or down, but that in and of itself
doesn't trouble us, and we can't give guidance on that.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Yeah. I appreciate it. Thanks anyway.

The next question is from the line of Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - William Jeffrey Greene>: Yeah. Hi. Good morning. Hey, Rob, I wanted to ask a question on the cost side, and
that is there's a sense that given the number of locomotives and employees that we've added and embedded in the cost
structure, if volumes disappoint us, perhaps in the second half of the year or whatnot for whatever reason, that you've
embedded a kind of fixed nature into this cost structure. Can you speak to the variability of the cost structure? How
much you could take out if you had to adjust because the markets turned against us in ways we don't expect?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah, Bill, I would answer that by saying we're not projecting that. As you know our
guidance is positive volume for the year with all the moving parts. But to your point, I think we've sort of proven over
the years when there are times when the economy goes south on us that we've taken the right steps, and Lance
highlighted some of in his talk, the furlough opportunities, the storage of the less efficient units. If you had to go
deeper, you've got opportunities to consolidate terminal operations, et cetera.
So without putting a number on it, I would just tell you that that's something that we take pride in, in terms of being
agile and being able to react to market conditions. So as Lance pointed out in his comments, we feel like we're fully
resourced right now with people and locomotives. We played catch-up, if you will, through the back-half of 2014, and
we're confident that there are still opportunities to grow our business and we got attrition on the labor front still in front
of us. So we're confident we'll make the right steps should what you're outlining play out.

<Q - William Jeffrey Greene>: Okay. Fair enough. And then, Jack, I wanted to ask you more on the legislative front.
We've seen that Senator Thune is potentially going to put forward the bill that he's talked about in the past. I don't know
how much of the bill you've seen, but maybe you can speak a little bit to is this the sort of thing that you can work with
them on? Is there something here that we could get out of this? Or is it all sort of bad news and we'd rather keep the
status quo as we have? Can you speak to any of that?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: You know, Bill, I think we have – Senator Thune has kind of opened the door to comments
and to working with the industry and asking us what we think about the provisions of the bill and things like that.
We've been able to provide some inputs. As always, we try to be a positive force, or a positive voice at the table and
look at both the good opportunities as well as the challenges that each piece of legislation presents. And I have no
concerns that we won't be able to do that again.
<Q - William Jeffrey Greene>: Okay.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: I think we will have an opportunity here to help shape that piece of legislation and work to
mitigate any of the negative consequences and hopefully even add some positives for us.
<Q - William Jeffrey Greene>: That's great. All right. Thank you for the time.

Our next question is from the line of Matt Troy with Nomura. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Thanks and good morning. The service issues that plagued the industry through much of 2014, each
carried varying degrees, you know, operations seemed to have stabilized, if you talk to a lot of the IMCs out there, kind
of mid to early fourth quarter with some improvement. Just wondering the next two months are critical from a weather
perspective, what specific steps are you taking? You talked about the loco adds and the crew additions and the head
count additions, but what do you see is the critical focal points of your service remediation improvement plans, let's call
it, in the first three to four months of the year as we look at winter that so far has been benign.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Sure. Lance?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Sure. So, Matt, one thing we've done is learned from last year's experience during very difficult
weather environments and we've beefed up our winter action plans. That includes that any sign of inclement weather,
24/7 command centers, locally, that can make the right adjustments and calls on the ground, we have taken advantage
of this benign weather and done some engineering work on our track that is positioning us better for the spring thaw. So
I'm very pleased with that.
And we've also been working with our interchange partners at critical gateways like Chicago to put in early warning
systems that are more robust and have more robust action plans around them, and they've actually kicked in at different
points during this winter, during bitter cold periods and proven themselves to be very effective. So I'm really, really
pleased with how we're navigating this winter, notwithstanding that it, in certain parts of our territory, has been a more
benign winter than last.
<Q - Matt Troy>: Sure. Thank you for that. And I guess second question or follow-up question would be just to clarify
on the surcharge. There seems to be varying opinions out there in terms of the potential benefit of lower fuel costs if
they were to remain down where they are currently. If oil stays kind of in this mid-$40 range, is it fair to think about –
you had mentioned I think something to the tune of a nickel of a benefit from lower fuel costs in 4Q. If I just look at the
slope and the two-month lag, it would imply something similar, maybe a cent or two higher. Is that a fair assumption
with fuel where it is and should we expect thereon if fuel stays down here at the same level that it becomes somewhat
of a wash in second quarter and beyond? Just thinking about kind of the benefit, I know it's a long run net neutral, but
just timing is obviously an issue here. If you could help us there, that would be great. Thanks.

<A - Robert M. Knight>: I mean, Matt, under your assumption if fuel kind of stayed in the same neighborhood it is
through the first quarter, I would expect that the first quarter looks similar to what we saw here in the fourth quarter. So
that's consistent with your thinking. Beyond that, you know, there's some 60 plus different surcharge mechanisms and
we are not guiding that fuel will stay flat forever, but we endeavor, of course, to keep the costs of impact neutral. So if
it did just kind of flatten out, that would be certainly be our objective. It doesn't usually play out that way, but I don't
think – I don't think you're thinking about it wrong.

The next question is from the line of Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research Group. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Thank you very much and thank you for taking my question. Just a follow-up; I think most
of my questions have been answered at this point. I think you mentioned a higher amount of labor costs per employee
inflation in 2015. Could we delve into a little bit more detail on that? And in particular, I'm thinking more on the
pension and benefits side. Can you talk about any headwinds that you will have in 2015 there?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Sure. Rob, why don't you handle that?
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah. I said the labor inflation line for 2015 was going to be more in the 4% to 5% range,
and really the big driver of that is the wage inflation. There were a couple of kicks, if you will, at wage increases in the
contracts that were negotiated several years ago and there's an – a kick up of, call it half a point or so in that number of
higher pension expense as well. And those are the two main drivers.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Okay. So mostly base wage.
<A - Robert M. Knight>: Yeah.

The next question is from the line of Keith Schoonmaker of Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Yeah. Thanks. With Santa Teresa open now, could you highlight two or three of the
capital investments you expect to be most impactful in the next couple of years?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Yeah. Lance?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Sure. So let's go around the railroad a little bit. Let's start down in the southeastern part of our
network. We have been increasing our capital investment in Texas, Louisiana, up into Oklahoma and Kansas, both on
our north-south routes and in the Texas area. That will continue, and pay very big dividends for a multitude of
commodities that use those routes.
We have added about 40 miles of double track on the sunset. We are going to continue to add double track there. We're
at a point now we're about 80% double tracked on that route. So that will be good.
We're adding some capacity in the P&W for our critical bulk and premium routes. We are adding capacity in Chicago.
We have a public/private partnership project on our primary corridor in and out of Chicago, which is the Geneva Sub,
the triple track, a critical portion of that, that's shared with a Metra service and that will be very, very helpful.

And then we've also announced a Hearne new network terminal in the middle of Texas and I think at the Investor Day,
we talked about a $600 million kind of number and a 2,500 daily car count kind of number and that will be very
impactful. Probably taking us the next two and a half years or so to build, maybe a little more.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Thanks. And a question on intermodal, looking at the AAR velocity data, it appears that
you maintained intermodal velocity quite well, even when overall velocity slowed a bit. And I recognize that velocity is
only one measure. So could you speak perhaps to your on-time performance within intermodal. Is it where you want it
or excluding new intermodal lane offerings, is this still an area in which you expect a little improvement?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: We do expect improvement in intermodal. If you look backwards, I would not be as charitable
in terms of our premium intermodal service in 2014 as you were. Our expectations were for better performance than
that. We were able to differentiate the service compared to other services we provide. A real positive note is that in the
peak season ending the year, we performed very well. And as we're entering this year, that same level of performance
has sustained. There are opportunities, you know, on certain lanes in our premium, domestic, intermodal franchise, but
it is showing better service and I anticipate it will continue to show better service this year.

Our next question is from the line of Ben Hartford with Robert W Baird. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Ben J. Hartford>: Hey. Good morning, guys. Back to the West Coast issues, putting aside some of the labor
disputes at the moment, how much conversation have you had with some of the international intermodal shippers that
are more reluctant today than they have been in the past to allow some of their containers to free float inland and more
interested in doing transloading activity to make sure that the containers get back to Asia. Can you talk about any sort
of conversations that you might be having that could affect international intermodal volumes in 2015, and, you know,
presumably to the benefit of some transloading and domestic intermodal activity? Thanks.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah. As you mentioned, that has been a trend going on for probably three years to four years
where international shippers are seeing a value proposition of letting their ISO boxes or international boxes to just
destine on the west coast, transload into a domestic box and then go inland.
So that trend we have been seeing for probably three years or four years. We think that that is a trend that will probably
continue, namely because a lot of the BCOs, as part of their supply chain organizations are using the transloading
function, as part of their kind of distribution management strategy.
So it's less kind of a transportation driven issue, but it's part of their overall warehousing and distribution center
management strategies. So we think that that is a trend it will continue. I don't think that West Coast labor issues are –
have any particular significant long-term change to that trend that has been going on for several years.
<Q - Ben J. Hartford>: Okay. So when we look at some of the expected weakness in international intermodal in 2015,
we should ascribe it to the ongoing labor dispute and not an acceleration of that transloading trend?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: That would be the assessment right now.
<Q - Ben J. Hartford>: Okay. Thank you.

<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: Thank you for your time. My first question is related to the impact of the recent volatility in
energy markets or on your investment and business development. Please help us understand how you're thinking about
it. Are you looking at winners and losers from the environment of sustained low prices? You expecting these to
recover? For example, is the southern chemical franchise less of an urgency and consumer related areas more in focus?
Please highlight a few areas that are gaining traction in business development for you this year. Thank you.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: So I'm not quite sure exactly what the question is. I would say we are continuing a focus on
business development. Energy, even with the recent volatility, still, I think has some positive drivers for us in North
America, because we still have relatively low energy prices and, in fact, even lower energy prices than what we thought
earlier. That is going to be a positive driver for things like chemicals production in this country, that's going to be a
very positive driver in terms of continuing the trend that we have seen for near-sourcing. We have talked in the past
about the trends of manufacturing, moving back to North America. We think that that's still, if anything, is going to be
even more positive driver for some of the volatility. So we still think that that's positive.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Yeah. Cleo, I think one of the things that as we look at this and as we talk to our customers,
first of all, this is still a relatively early phenomenon in terms of the dramatic reduction in oil prices that we have seen.
Nobody that I can find expects that this is going to be a long-term trend and certainly no one at this point in time had
made any decisions to alter long-term capital facility expansions or things like that. I think it's just way too early to see
if this is a sustainable trend in energy prices.
<Q - Cleo Zagrean>: Thank you very much. And my second question relates to operations, productivity specifically.
Can you share with us a few operating initiatives that your team is most excited about this year so that apart from
volume and price impact on the operating ratio, we can get a sense of where you might gain the next important
improvement in the OR? Thanks so much.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Sure. Lance?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yeah. So, Cleo, one of the things that we talk about routinely that continues to be an exciting
opportunity for us, is the penetration of UP way concepts. That's our interpretation of lean manufacturing principles and
Cameron and the operating team, actually the whole corporation is doing a wonderful job of absorbing those principles,
turning them into projects and action plans and removing variability out of the network.
So I can see dozens of different projects at any given time that are going to be paying off, either from a productivity
perspective, a safety improvement perspective or a service improvement perspective. That's the first thing I would
highlight.
The second thing I would highlight is we've got a very robust menu of capital investment that is gaining significant
traction as we enter this year. And each one of those critical investments is going to make an improvement in safety and
service and in productivity, and unleash different bottlenecks around the network. So I'm just really, really jazzed with
what we've got facing us for the coming year.

<Q - John Engstrom>: Gentlemen, good morning. Thank you very much for your time. Looking at intermodal, and
I'm trying to tease out the story, which is the difference between competition with truck versus having low diesel prices
versus a weak retail season and things of that sort, also with a soft year-over-year base line. Can you talk to me a bit
about, given the sequential decline in car loads, how you think about what the primary drivers were behind that? Thank
you very much.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: You're talking about an intermodal sequential decline in car loads? I mean, what are you looking
at?

<Q - John Engstrom>: Yeah. So I'm looking at the sequential between 3Q and 4Q, just given that the year-over-year
comps are a little challenging given the winter and December last year. I'm just trying to kind of tease that story out.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Yeah. So, again, the international side of our intermodal business had all of the West Coast labor
challenges through the fourth quarter, all of the uncertainty. The domestic side of our intermodal business, with the new
products and services, and the over-the-road truck conversions, and the whole story about truck availability and all of
that, we have had a record year on the domestic side of the intermodal business.
<Q - John Engstrom>: Okay.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: And we see that trend continuing.
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Right.
<Q - John Engstrom>: Yeah, that's fantastic. And so one follow-up question on capacity. So we talked a bit about
adding crews and locomotives to – as a primary lever behind velocity. I'm wondering if you can talk a bit about your
CapEx investments and Fort Worth, Robertson County, opening up Santa Teresa. And if you also see that increased
capacity as being another lever, which is sort of beneficial for you guys moving forward on velocity and there's a bit of
a tradeoff moving forward?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Sure. Lance?
<A - Lance M. Fritz>: Yeah, John. So, absolutely, the investments that you outlined have helped us in terms of
velocity and service performance. You take just a little snapshot like Fort Worth and Tower 55, we increased speed
through that facility on both the north-south and an east-west route. We increased capacity adding the ability to run an
incremental about 20 trains a day through the facility and we reduced the complexity of the facility itself and simplified
its signal systems, which is a safety enhancement.
One project that did all three, and we've been seeing the benefit of it and on that particular route, that impacts our
manifest product to and from the shale play. It impacts our premium intermodal product from the West Coast to the
southeast United States. So, it's – yeah. You outlined it just right.
<Q - John Engstrom>: Yeah. Fantastic. Thank you very much for your time.

Our next question is from the line of John Barnes of RBC. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - John Barnes>: Right. Thank you, guys. Great quarter. Appreciate you taking my questions. Just two quick ones.
Number one, on the west coast issue, if in the event that there is a more pronounced labor action and as much as a
shutdown, how much will that impact service level immediately in terms of just equipment imbalances. And then, once
normal operations resume, how long does it normally take you to recover from those imbalances and get the intermodal
network, the velocity there back up to kind of normal levels?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: John, we have been monitoring this closely and already taking steps storing equipment and
staging them in critical locations so that if the next move takes place of a total shutdown, we will embargo, we will lock
down and not allow the congestion of the ports to impede on the velocity of the rest of our network. We can't allow that
to happen. So we have plans in place to take those steps. We have communicated with customers about our intent to do
exactly that in the event of a total shutdown. And I feel pretty well about our ability to stage and think about this, so
that if it does happen, we will have positioned ourselves for a quick return once service has been restored to the ports.
Anybody see that differently, Lance, Eric? Rob? Are you good with that? All right.
<Q - John Barnes>: All right. And secondly, the eastern rails have talked a little bit about that their coal franchise has
become more surge dependent and base load dependent, and therefore, more dependent on heating days than cooling

days. Where do you believe your coal franchise stands, and in kind of that paradigm? Are you close to a point where
it's more surge dependent or is just the cost benefit still close enough that you're still seeing as a vital piece of the base
load in the western U.S.?
<A - John J. Koraleski>: Eric?
<A - Eric L. Butler>: Coal remains a vital piece of the base load energy in the western U.S. It is a critical part of
utility and manufacturing fuel source.
<A - John J. Koraleski>: John, if you think about it, so our coal business has always been very dependent on weather,
whether you have cold or hot summers and those kinds of things. So to that extent, there is some surge component, but
I think the interesting thing that Eric talked about in his remarks is a realization that a coal base kind of helps cushion
against the volatility of natural gas. And I think that realization on the part of the utilities is making it a little more
stable than what most people would think.
<Q - John Barnes>: Okay. All right. Again, thanks for your time. I appreciate you taking my questions.
Operator
Thank you. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Jack Koraleski for closing comments.
John J. Koraleski
Oh, great. Thanks, Rob, and thanks, everybody, for joining us on the call today. We'll look forward to speaking with
you again in April.
Operator
