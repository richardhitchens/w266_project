Martin J. Barrington
Thank you, Sarah. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call. Altria continued to make excellent
progress against its key strategies in the first quarter of 2014. We're maximizing our core premium tobacco businesses
over the long term and making disciplined investments to grow new income streams with innovative products.
Altria grew 2014 first quarter adjusted diluted EPS by 5.6% behind a strong performance from our Smokeable Product
segment and growth in our Smokeless Product segment. Lower financing costs also contributed to adjusted diluted EPS
growth in the quarter. So we're off to a good start against our full-year objectives.
Here are the highlights from the quarter. Our Smokeable Product segment continued to deliver against its strategy of
maximizing income while maintaining modest share momentum on Marlboro over time. The segment produced strong
adjusted operating companies income growth of 6.4% and expanded its adjusted operating companies income margin,
primarily through higher pricing. PM USA's 2014 first quarter reported shipment volume decreased 2.5%, primarily
due to the industry's decline, partially offset by changes in trade inventories and retail share gains.
PM USA's income and volume performance benefited from modestly higher wholesale inventories compared to the
same period last year, though we expect inventory levels to moderate as we move through the year. Marlboro continues
to be strong, at 43.8 share points, larger than the next ten brands combined. PM USA successfully grew Marlboro's
retail share behind investments in the Marlboro architecture and grew its total share of the cigarette category, driven by
Marlboro and L&M in the discount segment.
Turning to Smokeless Products. The segment grew first quarter operating companies income by 7.7%, primarily
through higher volume. The segment also grew Copenhagen and Skoal's combined volume and retail share behind
another strong quarter for Copenhagen Long Cut Wintergreen, which has now posted 14 consecutive quarters of retail
share gains.
During the first quarter USSTC began implementing strategies to enhance Skoal's equity and carefully manage Skoal
Classic price gaps in select geographies. These strategies, including changes to Skoal's promotional plan, resulted in
some retail inventory movements that negatively impacted USSTC's first quarter shipment volume. While these
short-term dynamics also may impact the segment's second quarter results, USSTC's strategy should strengthen the
brand over the long term and we're encouraged by the early results.
This strong performance by our core tobacco businesses was partially offset by comparatively lower gains on asset
sales at Philip Morris Capital Corporation and lower earnings from our equity investment in SABMiller, primarily due
to gains from common stock issuances in the first quarter of 2013.
Moving to innovative products. Nu Mark continues to make excellent progress against its long-term goal of achieving
e-vapor leadership. The company is on track to begin its rolling national launch of MarkTen in June. And earlier this
month, Nu Mark completed its acquisition of Green Smoke, adding significant e-vapor experience, broadening Nu
Mark's product offerings and strengthening its supply chain capabilities. We're happy to welcome Green Smoke's
talented employees to our team.
And, of course, Altria focuses on returning large amounts of cash to shareholders. During the first quarter, Altria paid
$957 million in dividends and purchased shares valued at approximately $272 million.
So to sum up, we're pleased with our first quarter performance and we're continuing to focus on our key strategies to
deliver strong, consistent results for the long term. Altria reaffirms its guidance for 2014 full-year adjusted diluted EPS
to be in a range of $2.52 to $2.59, representing a growth rate of 6% to 9% from an adjusted diluted EPS base of $2.38
in 2013.
We expect stronger adjusted diluted EPS growth in the second half of the year compared to the first half, driven by
various factors, including lower fourth quarter costs in the Smokeable Product segment due to the end of the quota,
buyout payments and a significantly lower fourth quarter effective tax rate compared to the year-ago period resulting
from our 2013 debt tender offer.

I'll turn things over to Howard, who will discuss Altria's business results in more detail.
Howard A. Willard
Thank you, Marty. Good morning, everyone. As Marty mentioned, our Smokeable Product segment delivered strong
first quarter results. The segment grew adjusted operating companies income by 6.4% to over $1.5 billion and
expanded its adjusted operating companies income margin by 2.2 percentage points to 44.1%.
Adjusted operating companies income growth was primarily driven by higher pricing, partially offset by lower volume.
The Smokeable Product segment's reported operating companies income declined 20.3%, primarily due to the NPM
adjustment settlement in the first quarter of 2013 and lower volume, partially offset by higher pricing. After adjusting
for changes in trade inventories, PM USA estimates that its first quarter domestic cigarette shipment volume declined
approximately 3.5%, less than the category decline rate, which PM USA estimates was about 4%.
PM USA grew Marlboro's retail share by two-tenths of a percentage point, to 43.8%, and increased its total category
retail share by two-tenths of a percentage point, behind gains for Marlboro and L&M in the discount segment. These
gains were partially offset by share losses on other portfolio brands.
In cigars, Middleton grew Black & Mild's first quarter retail share by three-tenths of a percentage point, while shipment
volume was essentially flat. Our Smokeless Product segment grew operating companies income by 7.7%, to almost
$240 million, driven by the higher volume and higher pricing, partially offset by increased promotional spending. The
segment also expanded its operating companies income margin by 1.1 percentage points, to 62.1%.
USSTC and PM USA grew combined reported domestic Smokeless Products shipment volume by 5.9% in the first
quarter, primarily due to volume growth for Copenhagen, partially offset by declines for Skoal. The segment's first
quarter reported volume benefited from an extra shipping day that was partially offset by changes in trade inventories.
After adjusting for calendar differences and changes in trade inventories, USSTC and PM USA estimate that their
combined domestic Smokeless Product shipment volume increased approximately 4% for the quarter, while Smokeless
Products category volume grew at approximately 5.5% over the last 12 months. USSTC grew Copenhagen and Skoal's
combined first quarter volume by 6.3%. USSTC also grew Copenhagen and Skoal's combined retail share by
two-tenths of a percentage point, to 50.8%, driven by Copenhagen.
Turning to innovative products. Nu Mark continues to use its two MarkTen e-cigarettes test markets to refine the
brand's value equation. For example, Nu Mark has experimented with different tools for creating awareness and trial in
Arizona. While brand shares continue to move over time as manufacturers change promotion levels, MarkTen
remained the leading e-vapor brand in Arizona during the first quarter. Nu Mark's test markets are providing valuable
insights that we'll use to compete for category leadership over the long term.
In the wine segment, Ste. Michelle grew first quarter operating companies income by 10%, primarily driven by
improved premium mix. Ste. Michelle's wine shipment volume increased 1.1%, primarily driven by increased
distribution of 14 Hands, partially offset by changes in trade inventories.
That wraps up our operating results. Marty and I will now take your questions. While the calls are being compiled, let
me cover a few first quarter housekeeping items. Marlboro's price gap versus the lowest effective priced cigarette was
33%. Marlboro's net pack price was $5.91, up from $5.80 in the first quarter of 2013. The lowest effective priced
cigarette was $4.43, up $0.10 from the first quarter of 2013. The cigarette discount segment's retail share was 25.1%,
down from 25.5% in the first quarter of 2013.
The estimated weighted average cigarette state excise tax at the end of the first quarter was $1.48 per pack, up $0.06
from the end of the first quarter of 2013. Copenhagen's price gap versus the leading discount brand was 32%.
Copenhagen's retail price was $4.09, up from $4.07 in the first quarter of 2013. The price of the leading discount brand
was $3.10, up $0.11 from the first quarter of 2013. CapEx was $27 million, and ongoing depreciation and amortization
was $50 million.

Operator, do we have any questions?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator instructions] The first question comes from the line of Owen Bennett of Nomura.
<Q - Owen M. Bennett>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Good morning.
<Q - Owen M. Bennett>: And a couple of questions, please. Firstly, I was just wondering if you've got any comment
on the pending deeming regulation announcement that's been in news articles this morning and how you expect this to
impact both your e-cigarette and cigar growth?
And then secondly, obviously you had a very strong margin performance in the quarter, particularly in Smokeables. I
was just wondering what was driving this and how we can expect margins to play out into the rest of the year and
ignoring the fourth quarter [ph] relief (13:55) from the tobacco buyout quota. Thank you.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Sure. Thanks for calling in. I don't have a comment on the deeming because I haven't
read them yet. I guess they're releasing them even as we're on the call here. So, I've read only the press reports this
morning and I would like to read them before I comment on them.
With respect to margins, you're right to point out that we did have good margin performance. We had growth in
Smokeable, we had growth in the Smokeless. And that's all consistent with our strategies in the core tobacco business,
which is to grow our income in the Smokeable, maximize our income in the Smokeable segment and then to grow our
income through volume growth in Smokeless.
So, I don't know, Howard. Do you want to say more about quarters or no?
<A - Howard A. Willard>: No, I think certainly in the first quarter we had 3.8% revenue growth on a per pack basis in
Smokeable and that was the strong driver in the first quarter. And I think you said it, it's consistent with our strategy of
maximizing profitability.
<Q - Owen M. Bennett>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Thanks for calling.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of David Adelman of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi, David.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Marty, two things I wanted to ask you. First, the comment about faster second half earnings
per share growth and alluding to the absence of the quota buyout cost in the fourth quarter, that obviously only flatters
your profitability if pricing were to more or less be as it would have been otherwise. In other words, if you or the
industry collectively promote that away, it wouldn't have that benefit. So implicit in what you're saying about the
outlook for the fourth quarter, is that your intent and hope to capture at least some of that net cost reduction benefit?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well, I think it's consistent with what we said before when we've talked about quota,
which is if you are trying to maximize your income in the Smokeable segment, you obviously want to take every
opportunity you can to do that. And that's how we're thinking about that.

<Q - David J. Adelman>: Okay. And that's a good segue to my second question, which is to talk about pricing and
your attitude and approach to pricing in the Smokeless business, Marty, because the profit in the quarter, last year,
profits have been growing 7%. That's not shabby. But there really hasn't been any net pricing in the last couple of years.
I mean, do you aspire to get to a point and a place where you can add to volume growth with net pricing? And what's
holding it back? Is it the performance of Skoal? Is it the competitive environment in discount brands, et cetera?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah, sure. Let's go back. Well, what I would say first of all is, remember, for us, in our
Smokeless business, we have margins above 62%. So, of course, you can always have a better net pricing realization,
but in a category that has margins like that and where the category is growing, we can grow our income very nicely.
And remember, what we're trying to do there is to grow that income off of the volume, in line with the category growth
and then to have modest share momentum on Copenhagen and Skoal. So that's the approach.
And, gee, I think at CAGNY we did a fairly good job I think of laying out how that's played out over the last five years
since we got the business. And whether it's volume growth or income growth, we've really grown those businesses very
nicely. Copenhagen, of course, has taken off well and we're now working on Skoal.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Thanks for calling in.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Nik H. Modi>: Yeah, good morning, everyone.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi, Nik.
<Q - Nik H. Modi>: Hey, how are you? Marty, two questions. First, it's kind of interesting how the weather was so
disastrous in the U.S., at least for January and February. And from this earnings season, broadly speaking, companies
really haven't seen the impact. I'm just curious on your kind of State of the Union on the consumer. Is the consumer
stronger than we all thought as we started out the year?
And then the second question is, now that the Green Smoke acquisition is closed, curious on if you plan on kind of
launching it nationally in conjunction with MarkTen so you have kind of two different brands in the marketplace to try
to capture as much growth as you can?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Sure. Good questions both. Thanks, Nik. Look, with respect to the weather, we did see
some disruptions from time to time, but actually it didn't really translate into a drag on either our operating or our
financial performance.
With respect to the adult tobacco consumer, I don't think that our view has changed since last we spoke about this.
Given the unemployment and the underemployment rates and labor participation rates and the like and consumer
confidence still being better but nowhere where it needs to be, we're hopeful that things are going to improve. But our
operating plans for 2014 assume that the adult tobacco consumer is going to be cautious, as he or she was in 2013.
Good question about Green Smoke. We closed on Green Smoke and we're working now. We have our integration
teams working on supply chain and marketing and the like. Our launch, though, nationally, will be focused on
MarkTen. And then obviously Green Smoke has retail opportunities in the U.S. and we'll be working on that, but that's
not a part of the national plan.
<Q - Nik H. Modi>: And, Marty, one follow up to that. It strikes me that the innovation cycles in the e-cig category are
much more rapid, obviously, than the traditional cigarette tobacco businesses.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Yeah.

<Q - Nik H. Modi>: What is Altria doing, just from a capability standpoint, to kind of prepare for a faster innovation
timeline? It seems like most companies are struggling right now. They have the next generation of products, but they
can't launch them because they still have the existing products in the marketplace. I'm just curious on your view on that
topic.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: That's another good question. We actually started back on this, Nik, a couple of years
ago to really improve our innovation system as a whole. We felt that we had opportunities to get faster, to develop
better consumer insights and to more rapidly turn them into products to satisfy their needs. So we've actually been after
this, not just on e-cigarettes, but on all of our businesses for about two years now and we've made significant
improvements, I'd like to think, in the system itself.
And then with respect to e-vapor, you're right to point out that the learning cycles are shorter. And so we're working
very hard on our Consumer Insight system and our market read systems to make sure that those systems are adjusted to
give us quicker reads of what's happening with the consumer and in the marketplace. And we're using lots of
techniques, like ethnography and other techniques, to make sure that we are staying close to that consumer because
they're moving around a bit.
<Q - Nik H. Modi>: Thanks a ton, Marty.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Thanks for calling, Nik.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Judy Hong of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi, Judy.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: So my first question is just really trying to better understand your investment spending behind
the Nu Mark and MarkTen. Specifically, just looking at the All Others segment with the loss of $1 million, it's actually
a little bit better sequentially from the fourth quarter. So trying to strip out what was PMCC versus your investment on
Nu Mark.
And then, as you prepare for the national launch in June, do we see a step up in terms of the spending, particularly in
the second quarter there? So just any help on your thoughts on the investment spending there.
<A - Howard A. Willard>: Sure, Judy. This is Howard. I think, as you look at the year-over-year comparisons in the
Other segment, I think first quarter reflects what we said is going to occur for the year, which is, we had unfavorable
comparisons year-over-year on PMCC and we've also increased our investment related to Nu Mark. And I think, as we
move into the second quarter, you're going to continue to see trends of us continuing to invest in Nu Mark as we kind
of ramp up to that national launch in June.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: So if I can follow up on that, Howard, because just in terms of thinking about guidance, there's a
lot of moving parts below the line. So if you can just help us understand, just in terms of the interest expense, because
you did see a big drop off. And if we just take the run rate for Q1, it's a pretty meaningful decline in terms of the
interest expenses.
And then just in terms of the SABMiller, it seems like that's coming in, on a year-over-year basis, more of a drag in
terms of your guidance. So any help you can provide us in terms of Q1 below the line, and then how we should think
about that for the rest of the year?
<A - Howard A. Willard>: Certainly. And I'd refer back to our annual guidance. And I think you are right that this is
going to be a bit of a unique year in that, as the quarters unfold, you might have different trends in the quarters than are
reflected in the total year performance.

Page 7 of 11
And certainly that's reflected in the first quarter related to SABMiller. At SABMiller, we actually had an unfavorable
year-over-year trend, although that was really driven by the fact that SABMiller issued more stock in the first quarter of
last year than they did in the first quarter of this year, that has a negative impact on our earnings. If you actually looked
at the performance excluding that, SABMiller had a growth in the quarter. So I think that that certainly was a unique
impact in the first quarter with regard to SABMiller.
We've already communicated that, on an annual basis, because of the strong asset sales in the past from PMCC, as
those slow down, there's going to be an unfavorable impact. But then of course, kind of below the operating companies
income line, there are a number of favorabilities for the year. And you started to see the interest decline in the first
quarter, which certainly benefited earnings, and that will continue to unfold through the year.
You also see that our tax rate on an adjusted income basis has come down in the quarter, and that is going to be
reflected through the total year. And then of course, there's an impact on EPS growth from our share repurchase
program. So there were certainly a number of positives in the quarter, including a strong performance on the
Smokeable segment, but that is being offset by SABMiller, by PMCC, and some investments in Nu Mark, although
ultimately resulting in what we thought was a nice 5.6% EPS growth for the quarter.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Is the run rate for the interest expense for the year, the Q1 run rate, should be what we should be
using?
<A - Howard A. Willard>: Yeah, I don't know that you can just take and annualize the first quarter, because there
were a number of different things that happened last year. But certainly you should expect to see a nice favorable
interest impact to the total year, just like we had a nice favorable interest impact in the first quarter.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. And then, Marty, I just wanted to go back to sort of the cigarette industry consumption
question. And the question just really is more just thinking about the longer-term run rate because, clearly, you have
smokeless and some of these other tobacco products that have grown pretty nicely. And also just thinking about your
MarkTen launch in a couple of test markets, what are you seeing in terms of substitutability and the tradeoff you're
seeing on cigarette consumption versus e-cigarettes? So is really the decline for cigarette consumption, even if we come
out of the economy and the more challenging economic conditions, does the decline really get accelerated just because
all these other tobacco products really grow at a faster pace?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: That question comes up a lot but there's no reason to think that right now. We don't
predict the consumption decline rate going forward, but we do look at a number of factors, as you know. And what we
have seen is that over the last several years it's really been 3% to 4%, and that's been through periods when there have
been other products that come into the marketplace, e-cigarettes, I would argue, being just among the last.
So is it possible that it could speed up or head the other way? I suppose anything is possible. But when we look at the
data, and we look at it pretty carefully to see if there are any new drivers that would change what the historical rate has
been, at least right now, Judy, we don't see that.
Our model, as you know, is to use an estimate of secular decline of, call it, 2% to 3%, in that neighborhood. And
embedded in that in our model are people who are trying other products or even, indeed, migrating to other products.
And that seems like that plus the historical price elasticity still seems to do a pretty good job of explaining the decline
rate.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: And the test markets that you've launched MarkTen, any difference that you're noticing in terms
of the cigarette consumption behavior?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: No. But that's pretty early there with respect to the test markets to be reading that.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Bonnie Herzog of Wells Fargo.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Hi, Bonnie.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Hi. I have a two-part question on Marlboro. I guess, first, could you drill down further on
what drove the share gains and then how much of the gains were driven by your relatively new line extensions? Or has
your core Marlboro improved and contributed to the gains?
And then second, I'd be curious to hear from you how you're going to balance keeping your eye on your core Marlboro
brand and then innovation behind the brand while also focusing on driving innovation in e-cigs. I know you touched on
this a little bit, but I just wanted to hear from you how you think about the priorities for the businesses.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Sure. Let me start with Marlboro. I think the answer to Marlboro lies [ph] in the name
and (28:17) the implementation of the Marlboro architecture, which is itself a terrific example of innovation in the
business. So you know the story behind the Marlboro architecture, I won't repeat it. But what we see there is is that by
employing it we've been able to reach out in different ways to adult smokers.
You take Marlboro Black, which is doing extremely well, and then really the Marlboro architecture along with
innovations, say, on Marlboro.com and the age-restricted website and the like, has really helped Marlboro grow in a
way that it wants to grow. I would also say if you look at Marlboro's historical share growth, it's completely consistent
with that. So I think that's the answer on Marlboro. And, you know, so far we have been able to execute our strategy
well I think of maximizing the income while keeping Marlboro on a good momentum path.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Okay.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: The way we describe the answer to your question about how can you focus on your core
business while also paying attention to innovation is almost exactly like that; we call it maximizing the core business
while innovating to the future. And our organization is filled with enough talented people and we have enough
resources to do both. I just don't accept the notion that the world is so binary as you have to do one or the other. And I
think that you've been able to see that recently.
We continue to maximize the income that comes out of our core tobacco businesses at the same time we've entered the
e-vapor space, we've created our own product, we've been in two test markets, we've done a transaction with PMI to
hopefully sell those products internationally. And now we have done a very nice tack-on acquisition to improve our
capability in such things as the supply chain and entrepreneurial culture. And you know what? I am very proud of the
organization. We have really done quite a good job of describing this to our people and where we're going and how
we're going to get there and I'm very proud of the work that's been done in that regard.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: Okay, that's helpful. Just looking at other companies historically, a lot of times they fail as
they start to chase growth and maybe lose focus on the core. So I think it's just something to make sure you guys are
paying attention to. So that was very helpful.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Thank you.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: And then my next question is a little bit of a follow on in terms of your approach to building
your e-cig business. You did mention you're going to make disciplined investments. So I'm curious to hear how willing
you are to let this business be a drag on your earnings, or how should we think about this in the next couple of years in
terms of the potential impact on earnings?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well, the way we think about it is through our mission. And our mission is to satisfy the
tobacco consumers. And if adult tobacco consumers want to move to innovative products like e-vapor, probably won't
be the last, by the way, there'll probably be other products that they want to try, particularly those that may hold out the

promise for less harm if the FDA were to approve them. I think it's the wrong approach to try to run the business in a
way to hold that back.
We're in the job of satisfying our adult tobacco consumers and we're going to have products for them that are premium
and that have margin and that are done responsibly. And that's how we think about it. So it's about understanding your
consumer and trying to give them what they want, all the while, of course, paying attention and keeping – you know
,the word discipline is important and we use that word deliberately so that we keep our eye on our core businesses.
<A - Howard A. Willard>: Bonnie, this is Howard. I do think, though, that we remain committed to our long-term
EPS growth of 7% to 9% and continuing to return a large amount of cash to shareholders through our 80% dividend
payout ratio. And as we see it now, we think the different levers we have to pull and the strength of our business
platform ought to allow us to make the appropriate investments and stay consistent with our long-term strategy.
<Q - Bonnie L. Herzog>: All right. Very helpful. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Good morning, Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Hi. I just had two questions for you, if I could.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Sure.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: First would be, I've asked you before about, you've had a pretty healthy stream of new
products while the industry has been a little, especially in cigarettes, a little slower just due to the SE approvals. And
we have more of those theoretically coming up from the FDA. So, it's maybe not so much your portfolio or innovation
of new products, but do you expect to see an increase in activity with these new SE approvals coming out over the next
few months?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: I suppose so. I mean, you may have seen that the FDA issued new performance metrics
about how it's going to try to turn SEs faster beginning with fiscal year 2015. And they've some inquiries from various
people about the time it's taken for SEs. So I can only talk about ours, of course. But we remain I think with a very
healthy portfolio. But I ultimately, of course, that's the way the industry is going to work; the FDA is going to have to
look at new products and approve them.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. And then just a question in relation to taxes. There's obviously an SET proposal
for this year. I just want to get a sense of what you're expecting at this early stage of the year for state excise taxes for
the year. Do you think they'll be a larger than average burden this year?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well, I hope not. And we've been working very hard to make that not happen with many
others. You know, so far, the activity, Chris, has been very active in terms of proposals, but actually fairly modest in
terms of passage. So we don't have any SETs to memory that have passed so far this year, although there have been lots
of proposals and there remain proposals in the State Houses. And so our Government Affairs team is hard at that. The
FET is still hanging around out there, although it does not seem, at this moment in time anyway, to have gained a lot of
traction.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. And if I could just ask one quick one maybe of Howard in relation to share
repurchase activity. You have some availability and you're going to finish that by the third quarter. By my calculation,
you've got a lot of free cash flow as well still coming through this year. So are there any other unusual or needs for that
cash that maybe keep you from being a little bit more aggressive with share repurchase activity this year?

<A - Howard A. Willard>: Well, I think you're right to point out that on the current program we're coming towards
the end of it. We've got about $187 million left. And our normal practice has been to have most of the cash returned to
shareholders come through our 80% dividend payout ratio, but opportunistically we'll do some share repurchase. So
additional share repurchase is sure to be a discussion topic here over the next several months.
And I think, with regard to incremental cash needs going forward, I don't think we see that there are dramatically
different incremental needs going forward than we've had over the last year. So certainly, use of cash is something we'll
be looking at over the next few months.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Good to hear from you, Chris.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Thanks.

[Operator instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery of CLSA.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: Good morning.
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Good morning, Michael.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: So, I guess almost conspicuously absent is any mention of competitive impact from new
product launches in your largest non-menthol non-full flavor segment. Can you just give a little color there? You've
gained share and since 3Q, your price mix gains have accelerated. How does that look? I mean obviously, you're
getting on just fine. Can you give a sense of what you're seeing in the market there?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: Well, I think PM USA – the short answer is, PM USA has done a heck of a good job of
managing its plans. You know, we say this at the beginning of the year and it's a good reminder to us actually; when we
do our planning, we take everything into account, including the fact that competitors will launch products from time to
time. And so we don't disclose how we think about that, or the actions that PM USA takes to protect its franchise. But
you're right to point out, I think, that the metrics of its performance in the face of that and other challenges really
speaks to the strength of the PM USA franchise.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: Okay, that's fair. And then just looking back at PMCC. Versus about three years ago,
your asset balance there is less than half what it was. And certainly if you had the asset sale run rate that you did over
the last few years, that business would entirely go away in two and a half or so years. But I realize there's some assets
that don't make sense to sell for any of a combination of reasons, and there's probably a little bit of a long tail.
Just looking ahead, can you give us a sense of what you expect in terms of the split in that segment, its income between
sales and just ongoing operations? Are there still sales that make sense to do? Are they going to be sporadic or few and
far between? Can you just give some color on how the outlook is there?
<A - Howard A. Willard>: Sure. I think you've assessed PMCC about right, which is, our goal really has been to
rapidly unwind that business, but to do it in a way that is maximizing the profit and cash flow that Altria gets from it.
And so we're pleased to see that we're down to a net finance receivable of only about $2 billion, down quite
significantly. Frankly our goal, with an eye towards still having an appropriate earnings impact and cash flow impact, is
to unwind that business as quickly as possible, because we think that our focus really is elsewhere at this time.
I would say that we've had quite strong asset sales over the last couple of years. I would expect to see those asset sales
continue, but at a lower rate. And that's really what our belief is. And I think that what results from that is, that while
we'll continue to get an income contribution from that business, the year-over-year comparisons, certainly for this year,
are likely to be unfavorable.

And it's going to be lumpy; in any given quarter, you're going to see part of the variance in that quarter driven by what
goes on at PMCC. I think the good news is, as you pointed out, the business is a much smaller part of Altria now, and I
think its impact is going to diminish greatly here over the next year or two.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: That's helpful. And then just lastly, this is nitpicking your wording a little, but you
mentioned in your release closing the Green Smoke deal and its affiliates. Does it have any notable affiliates, like
maybe a vaporizer business or anything that you might be looking at that's interesting? Or is that just terminology that
doesn't really mean much to it?
<A - Martin J. Barrington>: It's just meant to describe that there was more than one company in that family, but the
business is exactly as we described it before.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
