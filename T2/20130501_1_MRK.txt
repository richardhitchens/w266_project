MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to Merck's first quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Today's call is being
recorded.
At this time I'd like to turn the call over to Alex Kelly, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Alex Kelly
Thank you, Jackie, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Merck's first quarter 2013 conference call.
Before I turn the call over to Ken, I want to point out just a couple of items. First of all, there are a number of items in
the GAAP results, such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs and certain other items. You should note that
we've excluded those items in our non-GAAP reconciliation tables, and you can see them in our press release in Table
2, and that will give you a better sense of the underlying performance.
There are three tables in the press release. The first table is the GAAP results. Table number two reconciles our GAAP
P&L to the non-GAAP results for the first quarter, and Table 3 provides the sales performance for the company's
business units and our products, both on a reported basis and excluding exchange. During the call, we will be referring

This morning I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Roger Perlmutter, our new
President of Merck Research Laboratories; Adam Schechter, our President of Global Human Health; and Peter
Kellogg, our Chief Financial Officer.
Now I'd like to introduce Ken Frazier.
Kenneth C. Frazier
Thank you, Alex. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining the call today.
Our results for the first quarter underscore the challenges of managing through a major patent expiration and the impact
of headwinds, which were even tougher than we had anticipated. However, we took the focused actions necessary to
drive our business and deliver our first quarter EPS target on an operating basis.
Given the trends facing us for the remainder of the year, including substantial non-operational impacts such as foreign
exchange, we have adjusted our 2013 guidance downward. Peter Kellogg will discuss our guidance in more detail.
Despite these short-term challenges, we remain committed to driving shareholder value. One way we demonstrate that
commitment is by returning cash to shareholders. In the first quarter, we delivered a 2.5% dividend increase and nearly
$600 million in share repurchases, and this morning, we announced a $15 billion expansion of our share repurchase
program. We expect to repurchase approximately half of that, or $7.5 billion, in the next 12 months.
Also key to creating shareholder value is our four-part strategy, which is focused on executing on our core business,
expanding in key markets geographically, extending our complementary businesses, and excelling at managing our cost
structure. This strategy enables us to take a balanced approach to address the short term and long-term challenges and
opportunities inherent in our business.
We knew the first half of 2013 would be challenging for us due to the patent expiries we faced. And the first quarter
results illustrate that challenge. We fell short of our expectations for top line performance and are not satisfied with our
overall number for the JANUVIA franchise, which along with the continued decline in sales of SINGULAIR and other
products with patent expirations, led to a 9% decline in worldwide sales. However, the opportunities for JANUVIA
remain strong, and we are deploying more resources in a targeted manner to this important brand moving forward.
Let me be clear. I am confident in the continued growth of our diabetes franchise, both in the United States and
globally. Adam will walk you through the human health product performance, including additional context for the
JANUVIA performance this quarter. Overall, it is important to note the good performance of vaccines, immunology
products and ISENTRESS, as well as animal health and consumer care in the first quarter.
In response to the challenges we encountered this quarter, we moved quickly to reduce SG&A spending and prioritize
our investments versus our previous plans. We continue to decrease costs without compromising our best opportunities
for future growth, such as the necessary investments in our core brands and product launches.

Turning to our expansion strategy in key geographies, the emerging markets grew 8% excluding exchange and
accounted for approximately 21% of pharmaceutical sales for the quarter. We continue to make investments in
commercial, manufacturing and R&D to align with the long-term potential of the emerging markets. For example, just
last month, we opened a new manufacturing facility in Hangzhou, China, with capabilities to supply our high quality
medicines to China and the Asia Pacific region at lower cost.
In terms of our complementary businesses, our animal health sales grew 4% in the quarter, excluding exchange. We
had continued strong performance in the U.S. and Northern Europe, despite challenging market conditions. We drove
continued growth in the poultry business as well as the companion animal business, which was led by strong uptake of
our new product ACTIVYL for ticks and fleas.
Merck Consumer Care also continued its top line growth, driving good demand in several key markets, including the
U.S., Canada, Mexico and Russia. Sales grew 4% this quarter ex exchange driven by Coppertone and Claritin, as
retailers gear up for the allergy management and sun protection seasons.
Moving now to R&D, we continued to advance the pipeline in the first quarter. We now have five products under
regulatory review, including suvorexant for insomnia and sugammadex for reversal of neuromuscular blockades. As
I've underscored many times, innovative R&D is the cornerstone of Merck. Given how central R&D is to our long-term
future, I am pleased to welcome our new President of Merck Research Labs, Roger Perlmutter to today's call. As you
know, Roger is a world-class physician scientist with an established track record of successfully leading large research
organizations and delivering a broad and diverse pipeline of medicines.
With his deep knowledge and appreciation for basic science and the opportunities for applied biomedical research, the
challenges we face from regulatory authorities and especially payers to demonstrate the comparative safety, efficacy
and cost advantages of new drug candidates and the implications of all of this for how we can best use R&D resources,
Roger is the ideal leader for our research labs. I am confident that under Roger's leadership, Merck will increase our
return on R&D capital while successfully bringing forward transformative medicines that make a real difference for
patients and shareholders alike. Although he's only been with us now for about two weeks, I invited Roger to make a
few remarks.
So, Roger?
Roger M. Perlmutter
Thanks, Ken. I feel very, very privileged to have the opportunity to lead the Merck Research Laboratories. As many of
you know, this is a true homecoming for me, since I was responsible for basic research and early clinical development
at MRL about 15 years ago.
I've spent the last two weeks familiarizing myself with the current state of the laboratories and with our most critical
projects. As Ken mentioned, both suvorexant, our dual orexin receptor antagonist, and sugammadex, our modified
cyclodextrin that permits rapid reversal of neuromuscular blockade during surgery, are currently under regulatory
review. We're looking forward to having more detailed discussions with the FDA on these agents.
Last week we announced that the FDA had granted breakthrough status to lambrolizumab, also known as MK-3475,
which is our investigational PD-1 specific monoclonal antibody for the treatment of advanced malignancy. As you are
aware, a 510 patient Phase II study of this agent in malignant melanoma is currently underway. We will be presenting
more mature data from our Phase Ib study in the same indication at the American Society for Clinical Oncology
meetings in early June, which will demonstrate why we're so enthusiastic about this new approach for treating a variety
of otherwise devastating malignancies.
I've also had a chance to review the odanacatib program. Last year an independent Data Monitoring Committee
recommended that our pivotal study be closed for robust efficacy and a favorable benefit risk profile, while noting that
safety issues remained in certain selected areas. The DMC recommended continuing the previously planned extension

study in a blinded format to collect important safety and efficacy data. That extension study is proceeding apace. We
have a good plan in place and hope to accrue the necessary data and allow for a 2014 filing as previously discussed.
Finally, just two days ago we announced a worldwide collaboration agreement with Pfizer to develop and
commercialize our investigational SGLT-2 inhibitor, ertugliflozin for the treatment of type-2 diabetes. This partnership
builds on our very significant expertise in diabetes and will permit the exploration of a potent and selective SGLT-2
inhibitor both as a stand-alone intervention and in combination with other agents including, of course, JANUVIA.
There's more work ahead over the next three to six months, as I continue assessing the labs and our pipeline, so it's too
early for me to go into details about my views about specific programs or what changes I see ahead for Merck research.
Suffice it to say that when the time is right, I'll have more to say on all of these topics. Meanwhile, know that I'm
excited to be back at Merck and delighted to be working with the gifted scientific team at MRL in addressing the needs
of patients around the world.
Kenneth C. Frazier
Thank you, Roger.
In terms of R&D, as you could hear, we remain committed to accessing the best opportunities, whether they're internal
or external, and this year we've already entered into a number of new licensing agreements. In addition to the diabetes
partnership with Pfizer that Roger just mentioned, last week we announced a Hepatitis C agreement with Bristol-Myers
Squibb to study MK-5172 in an all-oral combination with Bristol's NS5A inhibitor in a Phase II study. And in
February, we announced an agreement with Samsung, which combines Merck's global commercial presence with the
development and manufacturing capabilities of Samsung to increase access to biosimilars.
In closing, our top line performance for the quarter reflected both the challenges facing Merck and the benefits of our
broad diversity across businesses, products and geographies. While we are not satisfied with our first quarter top line
results, they are also not indicative of the future opportunities for our business. Despite the continuing economic
pressures and the need to manage through patent expiries, we are committed to driving better top line performance with
key growth products such as JANUVIA in key geographies, advancing and augmenting our pipeline and taking out
costs through continuous productivity improvements. By doing these things well, we will continue to generate steady
cash flow and drive shareholder return over the longer term.
I'd like to now turn the call over to my colleague Adam Schechter.
Adam H. Schechter
Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone. This morning I'll focus my remarks on three areas. First, our core products;
second, our core markets; and third, the launches we anticipate later this year, and those we're preparing for beyond this
year that will provide additional long-term growth opportunities.
So let me begin with our results. Human Health sales declined 12% year-over-year. There was a $1.4 billion impact
from the loss of exclusivity of SINGULAIR, PROPECIA, CLARINEX and MAXALT and there was weakness in the
yen. While the loss of exclusivity was expected, the rate and the level of erosion has been more rapid. In addition, we
had an unexpected decline in U.S. wholesaler inventory levels of about $150 million.
Though I am not satisfied with our results this quarter, I am confident in our future outlook. So let me share with you
what I do to get a sense of the underlying business performance. First, I look at sales on a constant currency basis. I
also exclude sales from products that lost exclusivity. Then I look to see if there's an impact to the business from
wholesaler purchasing patterns. Putting that aside this quarter, our underlying growth was 4%.
I'll now provide more details. Starting with JANUVIA and JANUMET franchise which has sales of $1.3 billion and
1% growth ex-exchange. 7% growth in international markets was offset by a 5% decline in the U.S. this quarter. Let me

take a moment to talk about the factors that affected the growth rate this quarter. This is important context that I want to
provide.
First, in the United States, let's talk about demand, price, and inventory. With regard to demand, as you can see from
prescription data, growth was about 4% this quarter. This was significantly lower than the demand growth in the first
half of last year. The growth last year was driven by the TZD market events. There is no longer opportunity to grow
share from the TZDs. In addition, we're comparing versus a very high volume increase last year.
Regarding price, the market is very competitive. We are seeing rebate and pricing pressure as newer competitors seek
to improve their formulary positions by lowering price. We have maintained greater than 75% market share, and we
have an 85% preferred formulary status despite these attempts.
Finally on inventory, our customers reduced their inventory levels for the JANUVIA franchise by about $70 million in
the first quarter. We believe this is a one-time adjustment. If we exclude this inventory reduction, we believe our sales
would have grown by about 5% in the United States.
Now moving to international markets, JANUVIA and JANUMET grew 7% ex exchange. In Japan, we are starting to
see lower year-over-year growth due to high mark penetration. The DPP-4 class is the number one class of oral diabetic
medicines in Japan. They are ahead of metformin, they're ahead of sulfonylureas and we are the market leader with
close to a 70% share.
So let's talk about our expectations for JANUVIA in the remainder of this year. In the United States, based on current
Rx trends and the competitive market, we anticipate mid-single digit sales growth. Internationally, we expect to see a
return to low double-digit growth ex exchange. That's consistent with the underlying demand growth this quarter.
There continues to be good growth opportunities in the future, diabetes prevalence is growing around the world, and the
sulfonylurea class still represents about 35% of patient days of therapy worldwide. We have made strong inroads in
some markets like Japan. But this has proven to be more challenging in other markets like the U.S. We're increasing
our investments make inroads into the sulfonylurea class. For example, in the United States, we have recently trained
and reassigned additional, dedicated sales personnel to JANUVIA.
Moving now to ISENTRESS. ISENTRESS continues to be an important core brand for Merck with sales of $360
million and 8% growth. In the United States, we're maintaining our patient share, despite new competition. Outside of
the U.S., ISENTRESS continues to have good volume growth, offset partially by pricing pressure in certain European
markets.
In our cholesterol franchise, ZETIA and VYTORIN global sales were slightly down over the prior year. ZETIA sales
growth was offset by a decline in VYTORIN sales. We're looking forward to our potential launch of [ph] Liptozet
(18:19) in the United States and I'll talk more about that in just a moment.
Moving now to immunology, the combined immunology business, consisting of REMICADE and SIMPONI grew 10%
in the quarter ex exchange driven mostly by SIMPONI. Sales of SIMPONI grew 40%, exceeding $100 million in
quarterly sales for the first time. We're seeing a positive impact from the recent launch in France and from the
reintroduction of the autoinjector in Germany.
Moving to VICTRELIS. Global sales were $110 million this quarter. Continued growth in international markets was
offset by a decline in the United States compared to the prior year. While we are pleased with our strong global market
share, we continue to see a contraction in markets, particularly the U.S., France and Germany due to warehousing and a
large number of clinical trials.
Lastly, moving to vaccines. Vaccines had another strong quarter with combined growth of 25%. GARDASIL
maintained a strong performance with over 30% growth year-over-year. Strong growth in the United States reflects
continued uptake of the male indication, and includes about $50 million of higher public sector purchases this quarter.
Moving on to ZOSTAVAX. ZOSTAVAX sales increased significantly over prior year to $168 million reflecting strong
demand in the U.S. and Canada. The sequential decline versus fourth quarter sales was expected, given seasonality. As

Page 6 of 20
you may recall, we saw very strong demand in fourth quarter, driven by patients representing themselves during the flu
season. We may see another sequential decline in second quarter, given that the first quarter included a benefit from the
flu season extending into January.
In the United States, we estimate that about 20% of the population ages 60 and older have received the vaccines so
there remains opportunity for growth. In addition, we continue to anticipate ex-U.S. launches beginning this year. The
UK has announced plans for a national vaccination program with ZOSTAVAX, which is expected to start this fall.
Now I'd like to discuss our performance on a regional level. Let me start with the United States where sales were
significantly affected by patent expirations. Excluding sales from products that lost exclusivity, U.S. sales in the first
quarter increased by 4%. First quarter sales in Europe and Canada declined by 4% ex exchange. Good volume growth
from many brands only partially offset price pressures and austerity measures.
Moving to Japan, first quarter sales declined 7% ex exchange, the decline was driven by the prior year biannual price
cuts, generic competition and timing of sales to our partner. Our volume growth is outpacing the market, and we
continue to expect sales growth on a constant-currency basis for the full year of 2013.
In emerging markets first quarter sales of 1.9 billion, grew 8% ex exchange. Growth in China alone was 21%. Growth
in emerging markets was broad-based, coming from core business, early contributions from our joint ventures in China
and Brazil and from new products.
This year we have plans to launch a significant number of new products across the emerging markets. In key emerging
markets our growth is outpacing the overall market and we expect to deliver strong growth in 2013.
Now I'd like to move from our quarterly results to some of our future growth drivers. We have five products currently
under review with regulatory agencies. Let me touch on two launches we are planning for, if approved in the United
States this year, [ph] Liptozet (22:03) and sugammadex.
First, [ph] Liptozet (22:05), the combination of ZETIA plus atorvastatin many patients continued to have high LDL
cholesterol, despite the wide use of statins including generic atorvastatin. [ph] Liptozet (22:17) can lower LDL
cholesterol by more than 50% at the starting dose. We believe many patients can benefit from this product.
Second, sugammadex, our novel reversal agent for deep neuromuscular blockade. Now marketed in 50 countries,
BRIDION had $260 million in sales last year. We believe the U.S. represents a significant opportunity. There are 30
million general anesthesia surgeries in the U.S. annually. BRIDION could be used in about a quarter of these, based on
the type of surgery and the type of muscle relaxants utilized.
This brings me to upcoming new product launches for which we'll begin to prepare for this year. First, the potential
launches of suvorexant, our novel therapy for insomnia. The U.S. and Japan, our first two major launch markets,
represent 75% of the 3.3 billion global insomnia market and two billion patient days of therapy in each of the markets.
We may have approval in Japan by the end of this year, and pricing approval early next year. We while we anticipate
FDA action by the middle of this year, there's also a subsequent DEA review.
Second, our Allergy Immunotherapy Tablet for grass has been filed with the FDA, and ragweed has also been
submitted. Currently there are about three million moderate to severe allergy sufferers in the United States who receive
immunotherapy shots. There are also many people who opt out of receiving shots or drop off from therapy. Our AITs
are daily sublingual products that we believe will be well received in the market. And third, we continue to anticipate
filing odanacatib in 2014.
So in closing, in addition to a significant sales decline due to loss of exclusivity, we saw pressures to some of our
growth drivers this quarter. We have a strong and diverse portfolio, and despite these challenges, I remain confident
that we can drive growth of our core products and our growth markets in 2013. We also have many future growth
opportunities coming in the short and in the long term and we continue to look forward to sharing our progress on these
with you as we move forward.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague, Peter Kellogg.

Peter N. Kellogg
Thank you, Adam, and good morning.
In the first quarter, we worked hard to offset the top line pressures posed by patent expiration and foreign exchange to
deliver the bottom line. We accomplished this by holding our costs flat to achieve our first quarter guidance.
Additionally, we had a benefit from unanticipated tax items, which drove our earnings up to $0.85 on a non-GAAP
basis.
Although we achieved our first quarter guidance, the pressures on the business are greater than we had previously
anticipated. As a result, we have updated our full year guidance to reflect additional top line pressures, including from
foreign exchange, as well as new R&D programs and revised tax rate. I'll talk about that in a minute. Separately, we are
significantly increasing our share repurchase activity to increase the amount of cash we return to shareholders.
Now before I discuss our 2013 outlook and the new share repurchase program, I'd like to review the operating results in
the first quarter. My remarks will focus on our non-GAAP financials. On this basis, we earned $0.85 per share this
quarter, compared to $0.99 in the prior year. The biggest driver of the decreased EPS was the loss of sales due to
generic erosion of SINGULAIR, MAXALT, CLARINEX and PROPECIA.
Now these are all relatively high gross margin products and the erosion created a 2.3 point headwind on the gross
margin this quarter. As a result, the overall gross margin was lower in the first quarter of 2013 on a year-over-year
basis and on a sequential basis as we said it would be on our last call. Our non-GAAP gross margin declined on a
year-over-year basis to 74.4%. Now, on a full year basis, our productive gains will offset part of the patent expiry
impact, but we still expect about a one point reduction in our full year gross margin compared to the prior year gross
margin of 75.9%.
Turning to marketing and administrative expenses, our first quarter SG&A expenses were about $50 million lower
year-over-year. During the quarter, we proactively reduced spending in response to the top line pressures. Whereas we
previously felt that there was upward pressure on SG&A spending in this year, we now expect SG&A spending in 2013
to be lower than in 2012 due to our cost reduction actions.
Moving on to R&D, research and development expense in the first quarter was about $50 million higher year-over-year
due to up-front payments and milestones for newly in-licensed programs. Excluding these items, R&D expense would
have been lower than prior year.
Moving on to the other expense line, results in the first quarter reflect a one-time exchange loss of approximately $140
million due to the impact of the Venezuela currency devaluation as we previously announced.
Moving to tax, our non-GAAP tax rate was 12.5% in the first quarter. This is significantly lower than expected, due to
some unanticipated tax benefits of $0.06 per share. While we had expected a significant portion of these tax items in
our full year guidance, they came through earlier than we were anticipating.
Now let's turn to the 2013 outlook. On the bottom line, our 2013 non-GAAP EPS guidance range is now $3.45 to
$3.55. On a GAAP basis we expect to earn between $1.92 and $2.16. Let me explain some of the drivers of our revised
guidance. Basically, we see three pressures: additional top line pressures, mostly due to foreign exchange, as well as
new R&D programs and a revised tax rate.
Let me start with revenues. During the first quarter, we saw further deterioration of the yen, a stronger dollar trend
globally, and the currency devaluation in Venezuela. If these current rates persist, we would expect full year 2013 sales
to be down 3% to 4% with foreign exchange accounting for about 2.5 points of the decline.
Adam described some of the operational trends affecting sales. While we expect a 3% to 4% decline on a full-year
basis, we have known that the first half of the year would be the most challenging due to the effect of annualizing U.S.
SINGULAIR patent expiry, as well as the more recent patent expirations. Because of the seasonal increases in

SINGULAIR during the second quarter of 2012, we anticipate similar top line pressures in the second quarter of 2013
and a similar year-over-year decline in sales as we saw in the first quarter. Once we annualize the SINGULAIR effect
at the end of the first half, we should see better revenue performance in the second half of 2013.
On the R&D expenses, new deals like the SGLT-2 inhibitor from Pfizer bring up-front payments, milestones and
development costs into 2013. In addition, we are accelerating development of our breakthrough PD-1 monoclonal
antibody. As a result, we now expect our 2013 non-GAAP R&D expense will be higher than the 2012 level on a full
year basis. These R&D investments will partially offset the SG&A savings that I mentioned earlier, but in total, we
expect our full year operating expenses to be slightly lower in 2012.
The final element that I will discuss is the tax rate. At year end, we indicated that the tax rate in the first quarter would
be the lowest of 2013 due to the 2012 R&D tax credit. As I mentioned in addition to the R&D tax credit, we also had
about $0.06 of tax benefits that were originally expected in subsequent quarters of 2013 and assumed in our prior
full-year guidance.
Separately, the product mix shift that we're seeing in the business actually puts upward pressure on the overall rate in
2013. We are now estimating our 2013 non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 22% to 23%. As a result, the tax rate in
the remainder of the year will be significantly higher than it was in the first quarter.
Speaking of the quarters from an EPS perspective, the second quarter non-GAAP EPS is expected to be lower than the
first quarter. Remember, the tax rate will be significantly higher than the first quarter.
Before I close, I would like to discuss capital allocation. Over the past three years, we have paid out about $15 billion
in dividends and have repurchased more than $6 billion of common stock. Consequently, we have returned more than
70% of our free cash flow to shareholders over this period. In the first quarter, we continue this pattern of returning
cash to shareholders by repurchasing nearly 14 million shares of stock for approximately $600 million. Given our
sustained strong cash flow and financial position, the low interest rate environment and our desire to continue to return
a high percentage of our free cash flows to shareholders, our board has authorized a $15 billion increase in our share
repurchase authorization. We expect to repurchase about half of this amount or $7.5 billion worth of common stock
during the next 12 months and the remainder will be available on an open-ended basis. We believe this action, which is
factored into our full year EPS guidance, demonstrates our long-term commitment to shareholder value. At the same
time, we remain committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet and a strong financial position.
In conclusion, while the first quarter was challenging, we were encouraged by a number of bright spots such as
vaccines, immunology, HIV, emerging markets, animal health and consumer care. We managed our cost base well to
achieve our bottom line EPS targets. Additionally, we're taking significant new actions to return more cash to
shareholders. And most importantly, we advanced some very high-potential pipeline programs and brought in others.
Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: ...in addition to the PD-1 program, I was wondering if you could talk about what that means?
And what the programs are that you're planning on?
And then second just on odanacatib, can you just give us a sense of how we should be thinking about hearing from you
later this year? How you're thinking about letting us know what's going to happen here? And just what the update is?
Thanks.
<A - Alex Kelly>: Okay. Roger, the question, I think, was about PD-1, the first question and then...
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Maybe you could give me the first question on PD-1 again because it's – unfortunately,
we can't hear you very well. So go ahead.
<A - Alex Kelly>: Marc, would you mind repeating your question on melanoma? Or on PD-1? He may not be there. So
I think the question was: what is the status of the PD-1 program? What are we thinking about other indications?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Again, as I indicated, we're going to have the opportunity to review in detail the Phase Ib
data at ASCO. And in addition, we have an ongoing Phase II study in malignant melanoma, and as everyone knows, we
do have breakthrough designation from FDA as we recently announced. We have the belief that the drug may have
potential in a variety of other indications. We've been conducting a Phase I study in which we're looking at a variety of
other malignancies. And using those data, we'll be able to target the appropriate patients and really ascertain whether or
not the drug can make a big difference for patients with malignant disease.
Your second question related to the tempo of data from the odanacatib study. And as I indicated, the Data Monitoring
Committee had requested that we continue this blinded study in order to obtain additional data on efficacy and safety.
We're doing that. We have a good plan in place. And as these data become available for review, we will, as soon as we
can, let you know what our plans are, but we have to wait and see the data.
<A - Alex Kelly>: Okay. Next question, please.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Peter, my first question to you is if you could walk us through the math on your share repurchase
program? You said you're going to buy $7.5 billion over the next 12 months. That would, just based on my
calculations, reduce your share count by about 340 million or so which would be highly, highly accretive, so, you
know, just related to your new guidance, I guess if you could just walk us through what your expectations are for the
accretive impact from the buyback so we can figure out what the other offsets are? And am I thinking about this
correctly? Obviously you don't get that full benefit in 2013, but I would think you would get a big chunk of that benefit.
And then just secondly, Roger, I think that what Marc was trying to ask is what are the practical implications of
breakthrough status or breakthrough designation for your PD-1? Thanks very much.
<A - Alex Kelly>: Peter?
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: Sure. Hi, Jami. It's Peter. Let me take the first part. So what we did indicate, I think you got
this right, is that we're going to repurchase over the next 12 months $7.5 billion. So our stock is in the 40's. You can do
the math. I don't think it's quite 340 million shares. That might be for the full $15 billion over a longer period of time.
And you know, I think obviously the other thing I'd just advise is obviously going against that, you do have to factor in
the fact that we do have stock being issued as part of our compensation program. Just as a metric, in 2012 we issued
about 50 million shares. So that's kind of the run rate there.
But in general, we have factored in the benefit of the share repurchase into our EPS guidance for this year. And I think
what's really important to recognize on our guidance is that we have a very strong international business which has,

positives and negatives obviously, but when foreign exchange rates shift as strongly as they have in Japan and in
Venezuela, it does impact us.
We mentioned earlier this year that Venezuela would be an impact to us on a full year basis. However we kept our
guidance range and that pushed us down low in that range obviously and I think everyone was able to do the math on
that. That's about on a full year basis about a $0.07 per share impact to our EPS. The other pressures we're seeing right
now, most notably the yen obviously, but other currencies as well around the world, add about $0.10 of headwind to
our performance this year. We have a little bit of spending on R&D, as I mentioned in my comments, and we're
reducing costs elsewhere throughout the company pretty aggressively.
So that gives you a sense of roughly how the EPS has been impacted in the top line. Obviously it has been impacted
before. We'd indicated that we would be near prior year ex-exchange and there would be a 1% to 2% impact on foreign
exchange now. We've updated that to say there will be about a 2.5% impact on foreign exchange on the top line. So if
you work those factors into a model, I think you'll see that obviously offsetting that we have taken a lot of costs out but
still the guidance range is appropriate given the foreign exchange impacts.
I think that we haven't given any specific guidance on the pace or specific timing of the share repurchase activity, and
I'm going to hold off on that. We're not going to give any guidance on that until we finalize our plans.
<A - Alex Kelly>: Roger, do you want to talk about breakthroughs?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Yeah, Jami. With respect to the implications of breakthrough designation, this is a new
program, as you know, from the FDA. The Agency is eager to work closely with sponsors when they identify product
candidates that potentially could have a large impact in treating a grievous illness and we've found already that there
have been lots of productive interactions with the Agency in terms of the design of our program. We're moving forward
quite aggressively in that. We really believe this can have a big impact and we're delighted to be able to work closely
with them.
<A - Alex Kelly>: Okay. Next question, please.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.
<Q - Seamus Fernandez>: Maybe, Ken and Roger, can you both talk a little bit about what this sort of predetermined
mandate is? There is a period within which one can accelerate programs which may be tied to increased spending and
R&D, so I'm just kind of wondering what the mandate is in terms of near-term improving efficiency in R&D, given the
higher spend versus some of the peers. And then, longer term, how you see improving the productivity of the
organization overall?
And then a second question for Roger on PD-1. Can you just clarify what were the reasons offered or how did you
position PD-1 to gain breakthrough status in melanoma? Was the design of the trial specifically the fact that you tested
this on YERVOY failures and achieved a 40% response rate? Was that a particularly strong contributor to gaining that
status? Thanks.
<A - Alex Kelly>: So why don't we start, Ken?
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: Well, I would say that when Roger came in, and again, I'm very pleased that Roger has
rejoined us. I worked with Roger for a number of years in his prior Merck career. I think the three things I think I've
asked Roger to do and he's agreed to take on.
The first one is to look at the organization and to make the kinds of assessments that are necessary to enhance the
overall longer term capability of MRL, to continually be successful, if you will, in its endeavors of looking for these
transformational drugs that are so important to companies like Merck.

The second one is looking at the various programs that are underway and making assessments, along with his
colleagues, about those programs that are most productive so that we can ensure that the capital that we're spending on
R&D is productively spent.
I would say that the third thing I've asked him to do, and this of course is a critical thing, is to continue looking for the
best opportunities both inside and outside so that we have a flow of significant products in our pipeline to drive our
future success.
Roger, you can comment on how you're looking at it. He's only two weeks in.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Yeah, so the – it won't surprise anyone on this call that you bring in a new guy and a
fresh pair of eyes that there are going to be some changes that take place and Ken would not have wanted me to come
here and assert that everything is going to be exactly as it was before. I'm doing a very detailed review of programs, of
process and people and already two weeks in, I can say there are some opportunities for acceleration and for
productivity enhancement, and you can be confident that I'm going to address all of those and we'll have a chance to
talk about them in much more detail going forward.
With respect to the PD-1 breakthrough designation, it's all about the data. I mean you have seen the data that was
announced early on. There'll be more of it at ASCO. Those are the data really that persuaded the agency that this was
something important to pursue.
<A - Alex Kelly>: Okay. Next question, please.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Thanks for the questions. My first one was on capital deployment priorities and what
got you to this $7.5 billion target in the next 12 months? I guess specifically as we're thinking about this, what does this
mean for potential dividend increases going toward with this announcement?
The second question was on JANUVIA, and just kind of like just a little bit more detail just kind of what happened
here? It seems like we've had competitors in this space for some time. Did something change recently? And without
this TZD kind of tailwind, what do you think you need to do better job highlighting to physicians to really get the class
of JANUVIA back on track? I'm looking for just a little more color there. Thanks.
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: Well, before Peter gets into the details, I think our approach to capital deployment is to try
to figure out after doing a rigorous analysis, how we can create the most shareholder value. And I'll turn it over to Peter
to give him an opportunity to speak to that. But that's what the real key here is driving the most shareholder value.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: Yeah, Chris, thanks for the question. The dividend has always been our primary means for
returning cash to shareholders, and this announcement today doesn't change that at all. Obviously we increased our
dividend about 2.5% this year and increased it 11% in 2012. So I think, you know, our commitment to the dividend
remains very strong.
What we did here is we did a rigorous analysis of our capital structure and liquidity, and from that, we concluded that
our current strong balance sheet and financial position are more than adequate to achieve our capital structure priorities
and to preserve our ability to invest in the business in the ways we want to, even in a down side scenario.
So it gave us, you know, we feel like we've definitely got the capacity to fund both internal and external growth
opportunities and we certainly will be doing that, but we also, as Ken said, are focused on shareholder value and
returning cash to shareholders. And so with kind of marrying up of the strong dividend program that we continue – we
plan to continue to support, we felt this share repurchase opportunity was appropriate and certainly reasonable.
<A - Alex Kelly>: Okay. Adam.

<A - Adam H. Schechter>: Yeah, so, Chris, let me give you some additional thoughts on JANUVIA, and I want to
first start off by saying we remain confident that there are growth opportunities for JANUVIA and for the DPP-4 class
moving forward. The opportunities are that diabetes prevalence is growing. Sulfonylureas still represent a huge amount
of patient days of therapy, about 35% of patient days of therapy, and we've been successful in some markets where in
Japan, for example, DPP-4s now represent more patient days of therapy than the sulfonylureas do. We have to continue
to talk with physicians and show them the benefits that you can get by adding JANUVIA to metformin and I think with
the additional dedicated resources that we're putting behind JANUVIA in countries like the United States where we
now have full-time dedicated people in discussion with physicians, that will give us some additional momentum.
I also want to give you additional perspective on what has occurred and what we see as we move forward and I'll go
back to demand and I'll give you a little bit more color on demand. So if you look at IMS data, you can see about 4%
growth. But if you look prior to TZD events, you can see JANUVIA volume growth was in the single digits. It was
somewhere between 8% and 9%. When the TZD opportunity occurred, we increased our resources, we focused on the
opportunity and we saw growth between 11% and 16%, so we saw a very big acceleration. There's very difficult to
compare now to back then when this acceleration was occurring. So we believe that there is room for us to continue to
grow and as we get through this summer when the acceleration started to go away, we'll start to see better comparisons
year-over-year in terms of Rx growth.
In terms of price, we have increased our price consistent with the market. The rebates and discounts have increased
because new competitors are seeking to try to improve formulary positions by lowering price or offering more rebates.
So our discounts have gone up since last year, but we manage them closely and we manage them to maximize access.
And the good news is, we have very strong managed care access, with about 85% preferred formulary status, and if you
look at our share in the U.S., we still have about a 75% share, despite all the competition.
And then the last thing, which I mentioned before, our customers did reduce inventory levels in the U.S. by about $70
million for the JANUVIA franchise in the first quarter. This is the lowest days of supply that they've been running for
about 2 years. So if you excluded that, we would have seen sales growth of about 5% in the United States.
Outside the U.S., the underlying growth remains in the low double-digits, and that's what leads us to feel confident that
we anticipate mid-single digit growth in the United States, and we expect this return to low double-digit growth outside
the U.S. So we believe that there is opportunity for JANUVIA moving forward.
<A - Alex Kelly>: Okay. Next question, please.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: ...and hey, Roger, I just want to say, it's nice to hear your voice and it's great to have
you back again. Sorry if I accidentally ask you a few Amgen questions every now and again.
If I could just go back to JANUVIA, thanks for the color, could I just expand on that though? The $70 million
inventory reduction, you mentioned you think it's one-time; can you just elaborate on why you think it's one time? And
should we thus expect to commence a return to more normal wholesaler levels next quarter so we can expect a
sequential bump up and we should be thinking about that in our models?
And then if I might, on the anit-PD-1 program, there's been several questions, but I wanted to ask something a little bit
more direct. Is the ongoing melanoma trial, which is technically labeled as a Phase II in clin trials, but is actually rather
large, I think 500 or 600 patients. Could that or is that a pivotal trial that could support registration? Have you seen a
signal in lung cancer yet? Thank you.
<A - Alex Kelly>: Okay. Let's start with Adam.
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: So thanks, Mark, for the question. With regard to JANUVIA, we believe there's a $70
million inventory reduction in the United States, and we base that upon days of supply on hand that we receive data on.

And I think what happened was with the very strong acceleration that we saw with the TZD volume, wholesalers were
buying in based upon that volume growth. Now that we've seen less of a volume growth, they've kind of taken the
inventory down to, I think, manageable levels. They're at levels where they can consistently supply to the market, but
they're at days of supply that are lower than they've been before.
So we don't expect them to go lower but I would not necessarily expect a bump up in the future. What we expect is
mid-single digit sales growth in the U.S. and that's reflective of the current RX trends and the current marketplace
competition and then outside it's low double-digit growth and that's really what we're seeing with underlying demand in
growth for the first quarter.
<A - Alex Kelly>: Okay. Roger, do you want to comment on PD-1?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: And, Mark, thanks for your comments. With respect to PD-1, again, it's too early to
really be just talking about regulatory strategy. You're right that we have an ongoing Phase II study. It's relatively early
days for this 510 patient study in malignant melanoma. Everything will depend on the data, and as you know, in
oncology, there are a variety of mechanisms that permit a relatively early entry if the data are especially strong, you can
be confident that we'll pursue all of those possibilities through our discussions with the agency.
And with respect to other indications, we're very encouraged by what we're seeing now in Phase I studies in multiple
tumor types, but we need to wait for quite a bit more data before we'll know how best to use this agent in other
malignant diseases.
<A - Alex Kelly>: Okay. Thanks, Roger. Next question, please.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Baum with Citi.
<Q - Andrew S. Baum>: Firstly, with regards to your PD-1, there's a couple of early anecdotal case reports the drug –
potentially-drug related anorexia/cachexia, perhaps could you outline if there's been any additional cases reported or
whether you believe this is just anecdotal observations that may be independent of the drug or whether there's any
cytokine-related phenomenon either drug- or class-related?
And second, perhaps you could comment on the animal health business where you posted 2% growth, whether that's
just because of a high baseline effect, FX or are there other issues as well in that? Thank you.
<A - Alex Kelly>: So, Roger, why don't we start with you on PD-1.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: So with this question of PD-1, again, we'll have an opportunity to present in more detail
the safety analysis from the Phase Ib study at ASCO, and you'll be able to see that. Not surprisingly, in these very
seriously ill patients, there are a variety of signals that one sees but it's too early to know to what attribute those things
or to begin to talk about class effects. At the moment, I would just reiterate that we're very encouraged by what we see
in terms of the benefit risk profile at a very early stage in the development of this new intervention for cancer.
<A - Alex Kelly>: Okay, Ken, did you want to talk about animal health?
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: Well, this quarter, we continue to see strong growth in the U.S., about 19%. Northern
Europe was about 8%, but it was sort of offset by weakness in Southern Europe, which was down and Asia-Pacific,
which was down and also Latin America also grew slower sequentially. So I would say we saw some weakness that
was impacted in certain areas by economic conditions, but overall, we see excellent prospects for this business going
forward.

Your next question comes from the line of Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Tim Minton Anderson>: A couple of questions. One on consumer health, Ken, in the past you've said on several
occasions you have felt you don't have critical mass in this division, is that still the case, and if so, what options does
Merck have in front of it to address that?
And then yet another question on PD-1. It seems to be a class-based side effect where if you block PD-1, you get
pneumonitis and obviously with the Bristol compound we saw three pneumonia-related deaths or I should say
lung-related deaths. In your program, can you talk about pneumonitis that you've seen?
<A - Alex Kelly>: Okay. Yes. Ken?
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: Tim, thanks for the questions. I'll start with my thoughts on consumer. My thoughts about
the critical mass issue really have not changed. I think that continues to be an issue that we have to look at, and as I've
said before, we periodically assess our business strategy based on the fit and the business opportunity that we see. And
as I said in my earlier comments, we believe that this quarter our business diversity actually helped us, it was
complementary, it contributed to the top and the bottom line, growth that we need to have. But as always, we have to
look at all of our portfolio and make assessments about what's the best way to create shareholder value going forward.
<A - Alex Kelly>: Roger, do you want to comment?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: So specifically with respect to the pneumonitis issue, again I caution everyone that it is
too early in these studies to understand what is truly class-based but it is the case that there has been pneumonitis
reported. We can't compare the frequency of those events across studies, but we would say the majority of events that
we have seen with MK-3475 are grade one/two and we have not had any reported fatalities to date, so that's what we
know at this time, but as I say, early days.
<A - Alex Kelly>: Okay. Thank you, Roger.
Next question, please. Operator: Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.
<A - Alex Kelly>: David, are you there?
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Yes. Hi. Can you hear me?
<A - Alex Kelly>: Yes, we can now. Thanks.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Great. Thanks. So I just wanted to welcome Dr. Perlmutter and ask, I'm not sure if it's
appropriate for Ken, to answer this, but could you just talk about your mandate with respect to rebuilding the pipeline?
Whether you see doing that more internally and thus maintaining the R&D cost structure or taking the internal cost
structure down and going externally for products to accelerate the late stage pipeline?
And then second, another PD-1 question. Last year, when Bristol presented its early data on PD-1, it presented the data
in multiple cancers. Your Phase Ib trial, I believe, includes multiple cancers but you're only presenting the melanoma
cohort at ASCO. Could you just tell us when we should expect data in other cancers from your PD-1? Thank you.
<A - Alex Kelly>: Ken, do you want to start?
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: So Dave, let me start by saying that I'm also pleased that Dr. Perlmutter has rejoined us.
What's important for us going forward, if we're going to be successful in our strategies, we have to have the best
medically important products available, whether they are internal or external. You saw this quarter that we did some
deals showing that we are really very much focused on what's going on in the outside world, and so I've not tried to be
prescriptive to Dr. Perlmutter. I think it's all about the products. It's all about making sure that we have the right
products in sufficient numbers over a period of time to make sure that we have the ability to grow this company and to
meet the needs of patients around the world. So I'll turn it over to Roger to see if he has any other comments.

<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Yeah, David. Thank you. My response to the question about the sufficiency of the
pipeline is always the same. In my view, I always want more. It's never good enough. I want more products and I want
those products to be the very best possible. And I'm actually not so concerned about whether where they come from.
Let's be clear that no matter how good your research organization is, and we're very, very good, the majority of great
research is being down elsewhere. It has to be true because of the sheer bulk of research organizations around the
world, and I've worked with a lot of those people, and they're terrific. So I'm eager to take advantage of their programs
and bring them in house where that makes sense, where it complements our expertise and we will do that. And we will
also accelerate the process of bringing forward products internally. I hope that's helpful.
With respect to additional tumor types, yes, we do have a multi-arm study in our Phase I program. We're looking at a
variety of potential indications. The opportunity for an anti-PD-1 agent. Our antiPD-1 agent we believe is really quite
broad. But the data at this point, it's too early to present the data. Our Phase Ib study in non-small lung cancer is
ongoing. It's a little bit of a function of patient approval and how long it takes so, I don't want to promise you when
exactly the data will be presented, but suffice it to say we are working assiduously to bring this program forward.
<A - Alex Kelly>: Next question, please.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen.
<Q - Steve M. Scala>: Sorry if I missed this, but how much did currency contribute to the reduction in your full year
EPS guidance?
And then secondly, a question for Dr. Perlmutter, I think FOSAMAX was licensed and developed on your watch. How
does its benefit to risk profile compare to odanacatib based on what you now know about odanacatib? Thank you.
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: Okay. Let me just start to try to answer your questions about the factors and the primary
drivers that drove the change in the EPS guidance. I think the factors are the following. So let's just go back. We started
at $3.60 to $3.70. I said when we set that target that we were going to try to set an ambitious target given that we were
going through these patent expiries and last year was $3.82. So the original guidance was $3.60 to $3.70. Venezuela
knocked off $0.07. The additional FX pressures on our top line that we have seen since February when we last talked
about our guidance are another $0.10.
We also have some tax pressures that constitute about $0.05. As we look at the new R&D spend, that's about $0.05, and
the product trends that Adam referred to are about $0.06. So that all adds up to approximately $0.30 of pressure, $0.33
of pressure of which I would say 22%, $0.22 are, I would characterize as non-operational, and operational items are
about $0.11. And we are able to offset over half of those pressures with operational cost reductions versus our prior
plans.
So we're able to offset a huge amount of that by cost cutting, again, more than half, by my calculation, around $0.18.
But we still have with Venezuela and FX, those are still pretty significant drivers and those are what have led, among
other things, for us to say at this point we think it's prudent for us to take down our guidance.
<A - Alex Kelly>: Okay.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Yeah, and with respect to FOSAMAX versus odanacatib, just a few things. You're right,
of course, that FOSAMAX, I was deeply involved in the alendronate program here when I was at Merck previously. I
also supervised the Cath-K [Cathespin K] program which led to odanacatib so it was nice to be there at the beginning
and now I get to be here as we carry it over the finish line, too. And in addition, of course, I've had experience with
other anti-resorptive agents, most particularly denosumab at Amgen as well as anabolic agents so I have some
background in the area.

You can't compare different classes of anti-resorptive agents. The important thing to recognize is that there is great
need – in the osteoporosis population there is great need for new agents that reduce fracture risk. And what we have
heard from our data monitoring committee is that odanacatib has robust efficacy that's very important. We have an
ongoing Phase III, blinded study which the data monitoring committee has looked at. They've said they want us to
continue that study on blind to look at additional safety and efficacy data and we are doing that. We know from prior
studies that that odanacatib compares very favorably in terms of its ability to build bone mineral density and to
continue to build bone mineral density over time, other things will clearly distinguish odanacatib from bisphosphonate
anti-reabsorptive agents and the need is very, very large. So I'm encouraged by this, and I'm eager to see what the data
look like when we're finally able to get a complete un-blinding of the study.
<A - Alex Kelly>: Okay. Next question, please.

Your next question comes from the line of Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Good morning, and thank you for taking the questions. First for Adam regarding your recent
partnership with Pfizer, in general, where do you see the SGLT-2's fitting in diabetes, particularly relative to the
DPP-4s?
And then on Hep C and your partnership with BMS, my understanding was that you had your own NS5A which was
QD, was there an issue with that product that led you to partner with BMS, or was it simply that daclatasvir was so
much further ahead and that this would speed things up a little bit? Thank you.
<A - Alex Kelly>: Okay. Let's start with the first question, Adam.
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: So let me give you some background on the SGLT-2s, the first U.S. launch was less than a
month ago, so it's still pretty early. In Europe it was in late 2012, so it's early but we have some data on that, we've
done some market research in Europe and what we see that is in most cases, the SGLT-2 class is being used by
specialists after DPP-4 class. And you know diabetes is a progressive disease. Most of the patients are on more than
one prescription over time. The physicians typically begin treatment with metformin and then they add on therapies
until a patient ultimately gets to insulin. So we believe there's room for another class.
However, we believe the SGLT-2s will be used as an oral option after the DPP-4's. And we believe that JANUVIA will
continue to be the preferred choice as an add on to metformin because of the efficacy profile, the proven tolerability
and the five years of experience that we have, that physicians have with the product already. But we're very pleased to
be collaborating with Pfizer. We think that there is room to commercialize an SGLT-2 inhibitor and we're excited about
the potential combination because after utilizing JANUVIA, a nice combination with a high quality SGLT-2, we think
will be a very attractive option for physicians when they want to continue to use oral therapies prior to insulins.
<A - Alex Kelly>: Roger, do you want to comment about the Hep C?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Yeah, there's no problem with our internal program. We do have a very, very satisfactory
program, but on the other hand, the opportunity to collaborate with Bristol is a good one, and we clearly wanted to do
that. I should just say also with respect to SGLT-2 that we – I looked in detail at the materials, of course, from Pfizer
before we went forward with that deal and their molecule that we're pleased to be collaborating on has very desirable
properties and extremely strong Phase II profile. So there's reason to want to go forward with a leading molecule like
that in developing combinations.
<A - Alex Kelly>: Okay. Next question, please.

Your next question comes from Jeff Holford with Jefferies.
Company Name: Merck

<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: So first off, on the revenue guidance, the cut that you've made is greater than the incremental
FX headwind so I would assume that you've got some specific products which are lowering your internal expectations
for 2013. Could you just breakout what those are?
And then just secondly, on the decision around the share repurchase program that you've put in place, would you say
that that's coincidental in terms of timing with this quarter or potentially reactive to some of the pressure on EPS that
might be going forward is and potential things like JANUVIA estimates on the Street which I think the growth rates are
higher than you've talked about on this call might come down? Thank you.
<A - Alex Kelly>: Okay, Ken.
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: So let me start on the share repurchase question. So no, there's no connection to what
happened this quarter. There are no specific triggers for the program. Our Board approved the $15 billion share
purchase program because after a rigorous analysis of our capital structure and liquidity, the interest rate environment,
we thought it was a good way to return additional cash to shareholders while maintaining our capital structure
objectives. So if anything, it just reflects our longer term confidence in our future.
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: And with regard to revenue, there are three pressures that I think are important. The first
one is, if you look at the patent expiries, the rate and the magnitude of decline from the products that we mentioned
such as SINGULAIR, MAXALT, CLARINEX and PROPECIA, is very strong and it's even stronger than what one
would anticipate if you look at prior expiries. So we're seeing a more rapid, deeper loss in the patent expiry products.
And it's in the United States, but you're also seeing significant generic erosion in countries like Japan to a level that is
stronger than we've what we've seen before for patent expiries.
With the second pressure is hepatitis C where we're seeing very significant warehousing in countries like the United
States and Germany and France where physicians are really starting to have significant warehousing, which is in
addition to the fact that are there are a lot of clinical trials that are underway that are taking up a lot of available patients
into the clinical trials.
And the third, that we remain confident that there are growth opportunities for JANUVIA. There still is pressure on
JANUVIA as I've outlined before. So those are the three areas where we see increased pressure as we look at 2013.
<A - Alex Kelly>: Okay. Next question, please.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Michael Tong with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Michael K. Tong>: Two questions. One on ertugliflozin, just wondering what kind of differentiation do you see
in that molecule, given the fact that you may be number four or later to market?
And then secondly, with respect to clinical news flow, what Phase II or Phase III data would you highlight to investors
and analysts from now till the end of the year?
<A - Alex Kelly>: Okay. Adam, do you want to start this?
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: So I'll start with the SGLT-2 class and working with Pfizer and their compound. We're
excited about that opportunity. As I mentioned, we see SGLT-2s as a potentially important class that will be utilized in
an oral diabetic agent after DPP-4s, in particular, after JANUVIA. We think having a combination with the market
leader, JANUVIA, will represent a very significant opportunity. So it's early to see the exact data from the product as a
monotherapy, although, as Roger said, we're excited about the initial Phase II data, but we think the combination also
represents a very significant opportunity because of the success of JANUVIA in the marketplace.
<A - Alex Kelly>: Okay. Roger, why don't you speak to the Phase II news flow?

<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Yeah, so just, again, with respect to our collaboration with Pfizer, the importance of
combination therapy just can't be overemphasized, and again, to have a compound that based on what we can see plays
nicely with others. That's really important and provides us with a big advantage. Going forward, we have a number of
programs that we're going to be talking about. Of course, we spent a lot of time on the call talking about 3475, our
anti-PD-1 antibody, and there will be a lot of data coming out with respect to that. We'll also have the opportunity to
talk about other biologicals, particularly in the anti-inflammatory space. So there's additional data that will become
available from MK-3222, our anti-IL-23 antibody.
We're going to have the opportunity to have some discussion of our BACE inhibitor program as everyone is aware, the
impact of Alzheimer's disease is very profound, and we have a leading program for the leading hypothesis with respect
to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Safety analysis data will become available as part of our very large study in
patients with mild to moderate cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's Disease. We also will have a lot of data in the
HCV program, some of which has been touched upon during our call today. That's just a beginning because, of course,
we're very active in a lot of different fields.
<A - Alex Kelly>: Okay. Thank you. I think we have time for two more questions, operator.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Tony Butler with Barclays.
<Q - Tony Butler>: ...you commented about the construct, particularly in the U.S., of JANUVIA demand. It's very
appreciative, but the question really is around the increased level of spend which I think I heard earlier. Why the need
for that spend and under an environment of SG&A being down year-over-year, are you actually robbing from one
product to actually support another? That may be wise, but I'd love some color.
And secondly, Roger, beyond anti-PD-1 in the immunoregulatory arena, does Merck have other molecules that they're
pursuing or actually have in development? Thanks very much.
<A - Alex Kelly>: Adam, would you like to start?
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: Absolutely. So our goal is to maximum each and every growth opportunity that we have
on our most important growth products and our most important growth markets, and we really do invest our SG&A to
go after the opportunities that exist before us.
JANUVIA obviously is an extremely important product for us. We think there's significant opportunity with diabetes
prevalence and we're going to invest in order to make sure that as many patients that can benefit from the product have
access to the product. So we are committed to investing behind that product, not at the expense of other growth
opportunities, but in addition to other growth opportunities.
Part of the increased resources is actually an increased level of focus. So we actually have more dedicated people in
order to maximize the opportunities for each of the classes. So in the United States, for example, we have many more
people that are fully dedicated to our diabetes franchise where before they might have had part of their time on diabetes
and part of their time on cardiovascular. We've now made sure we have more dedicated people to each of the growth
opportunities before us. So I think it's an increased level of focus as much as anything else.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: And with respect to immunoregulatory molecules, the answer is yes. We have a broad
effort looking at immunoregulation. I think others have probably heard me speak about this before, but there is no more
effective method of killing cancer cells than by harnessing cytotoxic T cells, period. It's just very difficult for tumor
cells to escape that kind of attack, and that's such a profound observation, that it is has catalyzed our work, of course
the work of others too, but our work in particular and we'll have a lot more to say about that going forward.
<A - Alex Kelly>: Last question, please, operator.

Your final question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Bank of America.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: ...these pressures that keep coming up one last time, I wanted to make sure I'm understanding
which of these pressures are shorter term versus perhaps newer realities of the business and longer lasting. It seems like
FX is what it is, destocking happens from time to time, loss of exclusivity effect should not surprise you, frankly, or if
they have in certain countries, they will never again. So I want to make sure that I'm not missing anything that's new
that you might be factoring into your longer term models that you haven't sort of guided for yet.
And then for Roger, by when will you announce key decisions on the pipeline and your preliminary thoughts on
biosimilars conceptually? I assume you had something to do with Amgen's thinking there and how that evolved.
Thanks.
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: Yeah, so, Gregg, so I think you've outlined what we've said the most important issues that
we're facing right now. And the patent expiries, you know, you learn as you see them come. We haven't seen such rapid
loss at the rate of loss that we've seen with a product like SINGULAIR in the U.S. I mentioned it in the fourth quarter
but even in the first quarter of this year, if you saw, we had $1 million of sales of SINGULAIR in the United States, so
we learned from that. We understand that as we model for the future and think about the future, obviously.
Hepatitis C, frankly, it depends on what the data was going to look like from the all oral therapies. So it was very
difficult to predict what that data would look like and therefore, what the response would be in terms of physicians and
warehousing. So that's something we have to watch closely and as more data becomes available on the all oral
therapies, we'll certainly learn more.
And then I mentioned as before, the JANUVIA impact, I've tried to give you guidance for what we see in terms of
mid-single digit growth in the U.S. as we go through this year and low double-digit growth outside the U.S. So we tried
to provide you as much information about what we know in the short-term and as we look out to the future.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Yeah, with respect to key decisions on the pipeline, you know, the – this is going to be a
rolling process, of course. MRL is a large and complex organization and we have an awful lot of programs to review,
but you can anticipate that I'm not going to take forever here. So within the next three to six months, we're going to roll
out a number of different, I think, approaches to a variety of very, very important medical objectives that we're
pursuing.
Also with respect to the biosimilar issue that you've called out in particular, I'm very pleased with the deal that we've
made with the Samsung. I know that team well. I had the opportunity to speak with them previously, I know what their
capabilities are like and what they've invested behind it. And I think it will give us commercial access globally to a
large slate of biosimilar products that we'll be able to take advantage of.
<A - Alex Kelly>: Okay. Ken, do you have any closing remarks?
Kenneth C. Frazier
Well, first of all, thank you all for hanging in there for an extended call. Just to wrap up, I'll make three points.
First of all, we knew 2013 would be challenging but we are confident about the future, and we believe the second half
of this year will be a better indicator of the strength of our business.
Second, we are managing our cost space and taking actions to strengthen our overall organizational capabilities
including as Roger said several times in R&D that will allow Merck to be more successful in what will be the future
healthcare environment.
And finally, as I always say, we are committed to creating shareholder value in the short term and in the longer term.
