Now let me turn the call over to Frank Blake.
Francis S. Blake
Thank you, Diane, and good morning, everyone. Sales for the fourth quarter were $17.7 billion, down 3% from last
year. This year's fourth quarter consisted of 13 weeks compared to last year's fourth quarter which had 14 weeks.
Excluding that additional week in 2012, sales for the fourth quarter were up 3.9% from the prior year. Comp sales were
positive 4.4% and our diluted earnings per share were $0.73. Our U.S. stores had a positive comp of 4.9%. From a
geographic perspective, 17 of our 19 U.S. regions posted positive comps. The two regions with negative comps were
New York and New Jersey, both of which were overlapping last year's strong repair sales from Hurricane Sandy.
Counterbalancing that we had positive comp performance throughout our Western and Southern divisions and even
with the pressure from New York and New Jersey, our Northern division positively comped. We grew ticket and comp
transactions in the quarter, improved inventory turns and maintained our focus on expense control.
Our Pro customer had another quarter of sales growth. Adjusting for hurricane impacts, the Pro and consumer grew at
the same rate in the quarter. Marvin and the operations team continue to focus on improving the experience for our
Pros. We launched our Pro Xtra Program this past fall with Pro Xtra, our Pros can track their purchases, take advantage
of exclusive product offers and get access to helpful business tools. The rate of signups has increased and is over
10,000 per week and we'll be introducing new functionalities for our Pros throughout 2014.
In merchandising, as Craig will detail, we're pleased with the results of our Black Friday, holiday and gift center events
during the quarter. We saw strong growth on interconnected retail with dotcom sales growing approximately 50% for
the quarter on a 13-week basis. Our online customer satisfaction scores improved as we continued to enhance the
experience across our full site, mobile and tablet and we're seeing accelerated improvement in our conversion rates.
To support our interconnected retail efforts, we recently opened our first of three new direct fulfillment centers. Each
facility will have capacity to hold as many as 100,000 SKUs for direct ship customers. We already have the
convenience of 2,000 locations throughout the country for buying online and returning or picking up in store. These
facilities will now expand our capabilities to ship most orders the same day they are received.
As another part of our interconnected efforts, last month we acquired Blinds.com, we are very excited about this
acquisition. Blinds.com is the market leader in online window coverings with a compelling shopping, sales and service
experience for customers. In addition to the strength we believe they'll bring to us in this category, we also believe they
can help us develop best-in-class capabilities for selling customized, configurable products online and most
importantly, their entrepreneurial culture is a great fit with The Home Depot culture.
On the international front, in local currency our Canadian business had positive comps above the company average and
just last week we opened the first of our two new Canadian rapid deployment centers. Our Mexican business positively
comped for the quarter, making it 41 quarters in a row of positive comp growth.
Looking at the full-year 2013 we significantly exceeded our plan. On a 52-week basis we grew sales by over $5 billion.
We had the most transactions in the company history and our best annual comp sales increase since 1999. And looking
at our two-year stack comp rates we had very consistent double-digit sales increases in every quarter. The company,
with the help of our vendors, was able to respond effectively to this increased demand while maintaining tight
operational focus.

For 2014, as Carol will detail, we expect sales growth of 4.8% and diluted earnings per share of $4.38, a 16.5%
increase. 2014 GDP estimates call for low single-digit growth, so our 2014 guidance is premised on the housing market
as a continuing tailwind for our business. It is not our view that all housing metrics will sustain the growth rates from
2013 going forward. This last year saw a particularly strong recovery in housing prices, but we do expect the housing
recovery to continue, expect that home prices will increase even though at a lower rate and expect that affordability will
support growth in the home improvement market. Year-over-year, private fixed residential investment or PFRI as a
percent of GDP grew to 3.1% in the fourth quarter. This remains well below the 60-year average of approximately
4.6%.
Finally, today our board announced a 21% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.47 per share. This is the fifth
dividend increase in as many years and follows our targeted dividend payout of 50% of earnings. We remain
committed to disciplined capital allocation to create value for our shareholders. We will invest to sustain and grow our
business; our intent is to increase our dividend every year and we will use our excess cash for share repurchases.
Let me close by thanking our associates for their hard work and dedication. I'd like to give special thanks to all of our
associates who've helped their customers in their communities through the recent winter storms, often under the most
difficult of circumstances. It's a great reflection of everyone's hard work that this half, 100% of our stores qualified for
Success Sharing, our profit-sharing program for our hourly associates. We set a record for Success Sharing payout for
the full year of 2013, almost $0.25 billion. We're proud of that result and look forward to continuing this momentum in
2014.
With that, let me turn the call over to Craig.
Craig A. Menear
Thanks, Frank, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter although the
makeup of sales was very different by area of the country. The departments that outperformed the company's average
comp for the fourth quarter were indoor garden, kitchens, outdoor garden, plumbing, electrical and tools. Bath,
hardware, paint, decor, lighting, flooring, millwork and lumber performed positively. Comp sales in building materials
were negative, reflecting tough year-over-year storm comparisons in roofing.
Sales for the quarter were driven by great events including our outstanding Black Friday and strong gift centers and
flexible response in seasonal categories, including winter preparedness and decorative holiday.
As Frank mentioned, weather had some impact to our sales as we anniversaried last year's Hurricane Sandy sales, and
the fourth quarter this year saw severe winter storms and some of the coldest temperatures on record in the Midwest
and Northeast. As a result, our Northern division experienced negative comps in outdoor project categories like lumber
and building materials. This negative impact was partially offset by positive performance in weather-related categories
like portable heating, pumps, weather-stripping and snow removal equipment. In areas of the country that were not
affected by difficult weather, we saw continued strength across the store.
Across the country, including our Northern division, maintenance and repair categories like pipe and fittings, air
circulation, cleaning and HVAC had comps above the company average. We also saw continued strength in light bulbs
where sales posted a double-digit positive comp for the fourth consecutive quarter as continued innovation in LED
technology is becoming more widely adopted by our customers and is expanding to other categories of the store like
decorative and security lighting.
Categories that are traditionally dominated by our Pro customers also performed well. For example, dimensional
lumber, insulation, concrete and pneumatic fasteners comped above the company average.
As I shared with you last quarter, we executed several events planned to drive sales. In decorative holiday, several new
products were introduced including our expanded assortment of pre-lit trees. While the holiday selling season was
compressed by one less week compared to 2012, we drove positive comps in these categories, including our online
channel.

Thanks to our amazing values and execution by our associates, we had one of our best sell-through rates ever. Black
Friday sales were the highest on record, and gift center sales exceeded our plan. Outstanding exclusive offers driven
with our vendor partners allowed us to be first to market with product and result in great performance in power tool
accessories, hand tools and portable power.
Total comp transactions grew by 3.3% for the quarter while average ticket increased 1.1%. The total impact to ticket
growth from commodity inflation was flat. Transactions for tickets under $50 representing approximately 20% of our
U.S. sales were up 2.5% for the fourth quarter. Transactions for tickets over $900 also representing approximately 20%
of our U.S. sales were up 5.5% in the fourth quarter. The drivers behind the increase in big-ticket purchases were
appliances and the continued recovery of our Pro customer.
Now let me turn our attention to the first quarter. We're excited about the opportunities we have as we enter into our
spring selling season. Our new assortment planning tools provides us the ability to optimize our assortments at a local
level and help us better prepare for spring. As many of you know, spring is our biggest selling season, so for the fifth
consecutive year we will have our spring Black Friday event. Working with our vendors, we plan to bring in special
buys and extraordinary values on popular spring items like patio furniture, grills, landscape and live goods, to name a
few.
In addition to this event, we're also excited about the new products our merchants have added to our assortments. In
outdoor living we are introducing higher-end patio furniture from Brown Jordan that is available online and showcased
in some of our stores. This exciting new product allows customers to customize the furniture and fabric to fit their
space with fabric options from Sunbrella.
We're also adding five new collections to our core patio which will expand our assortments and offer our customers
more options than they have ever had.
In grills, Weber's new exclusive Spirit series, with the Gourmet BBQ System, offers our customers several attachments
to enhance their barbecuing experience and we're also expanding into new brands with the addition of charcoal and gas
grills from KitchenAid.
New for 2014 in outdoor power is a full lineup of cordless power from EGO, including a lawn mower, string trimmer,
blower and hedge trimmer. These tools are powered by a 56 volt lithium-ion battery with 40% more power compared to
other batteries in the industry and a remarkable recharging time that allows a dead battery to be fully charged in as little
as 30 minutes.
While we're loaded for the outdoor spring selling season, we also have a strong lineup of product for projects inside the
home. New for bath, Delta's ActivTouch H2O hand shower combines a fixed showerhead and hand shower with nine
spray settings and the ease of active touch technology which allows for one hand operation. Also for bath, through an
exclusive partnership with Kohler, we're introducing a new lineup of bathroom products including the toilet seat with
an integrated LED light. And for our Pro customers we're introducing a new line of water heaters from Rheem with
innovative features and improved diagnostic controls. These water heaters decrease energy usage by 10% as compared
to current models and increase available hot water by up to 25%, saving both time and money.
In addition, many of these models already meet with 2015 Department of Energy specifications a whole year in
advance and are exclusive to The Home Depot.
Heading into the 2014 spring selling season we believe that we are well positioned and are excited about the
opportunities that it brings.
And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Carol.

Thank you, Craig, and good morning. In the fourth quarter sales were $17.7 billion. As Frank mentioned fiscal 2012
included a 53rd week, which added approximately $1.2 billion in sales to the fourth quarter and the year. The extra
week is not included in our 2013 comp or same-store sales calculation. Comp sales were positive 4.4% for the quarter
with positive comps of 3.7%in November, 6.9% in December and 3% in January. Comp sales for U.S. stores were
positive 4.9% for the quarter with positive comps of 3.7% in November, 7.8% in December, and 3.8% in January.
For the year our sales increased 5.4% to $78.8 billion excluding sales from the 53rd week in fiscal 2012 total sales for
fiscal 2013 increased 7.2%. For the year, total company comp sales were positive 6.8% and comps for U.S. stores were
positive 7.5%. Our total company gross margin was 35% for the fourth quarter, considerably better than our plan and
was 10 basis points higher than last year of which 14 basis points came from our U.S. business.
The year-over-year expansion in our U.S. business can be explained by the following. First, we experienced six basis
points of gross margin expansion due to productivity within our supply chain. The remaining eight basis points of
expansion reflects the net impact of a change in the mix of products sold, and in some cases, higher co-op and rebate
levels than last year as we reached higher purchase tiers. For the year we experienced 18 basis points of gross margin
expansion.
Operating expense as a percent of sales decreased by 26 basis points to 25% in the fourth quarter. Excluding last year's
extra week, operating expenses as a percent of sales decreased by 54 basis points. Fiscal 2013 operating expense as a
percent of sales was 23.1%, a decrease of 106 basis points from what we reported last year. On a 52-week basis, our
expenses grew at 32% of our sales growth rate, in line with our guidance.
In the fourth quarter interest and other expense was $178 million, an increase of $18 million from last year and for the
year, interest and other expense totaled $699 million, an increase of $154 million from the prior year. The increase in
interest expense is primarily attributable to $4 billion of incremental debt issued in fiscal 2013. Our income tax
provision rate was 36% in the fourth quarter and 36.4% for the year.
On a reported basis, diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.73, an increase of 7.4% from last year. On
a 13-week basis, diluted earnings per share grew by 19.7%. For the year, on a reported basis, diluted earnings per share
were $3.76, an increase of 25.3% compared to the prior year. On a 52-week basis, diluted earnings per share grew by
28.3%.
One last comment on earnings per share; you will recall that in fiscal 2012 we incurred a $145 million nonrecurring
charge related to the closing of our China stores, which had a $0.10 negative impact to fiscal 2012 diluted earnings per
share. We've provided a supplementary schedule in our press release that sets forth a year-over-year comparison with
and without this charge.
Now moving to our operational metrics, during the fourth quarter, we opened three new stores in Mexico and one in the
U.S., and ended the year with 2,263 stores. At the end of the year, selling square footage was $236 million, about flat to
last year, and sales per square foot increased 4.9% to $334. At the end of the year, inventory was $11 billion, up $347
million from a year ago. Inventory turns were 4.6 times, up from 4.5 times last year.
Moving on to our share repurchase program, in the fourth quarter, we received 3.4 million shares related to the true-up
of an accelerated share repurchase, or ASR, program we initiated in the third quarter. Additionally, in the fourth
quarter, we repurchased $2.1 billion, or 26.4 million shares. This included 7.5 million shares repurchased on the open
market and 18.9 million shares repurchased through an ASR program that was initiated and closed in the fourth quarter.
For the year, we repurchased a total of $8.5 billion or 111.3 million shares of outstanding stock. Computed on the
average of beginning and ending long-term debt and equity for the trailing four quarters, return on invested capital was
20.9%, 390 basis points higher than at the end of fiscal 2012. We detailed our 2014 guidance in our press release, but I
want to take a few moments to comment on the highlights. Remember that we guide off of GAAP, so fiscal 2014
guidance will launch from our reported results for fiscal 2013.
As we look to 2014, we are basing our sales growth assumptions starting with GDP growth forecast, which for the U.S.
are approximately 2.8%. We are also projecting that the U.S. housing market, namely home price appreciation,

household formation and housing turnover; will contribute approximately 200 basis points of comp growth in 2014.
While some of the macro and housing data have softened over the last few months, we continue to believe that we are
in the moderate stage of housing recovery. As Frank mentioned, some affordability is still quite attractive and we are
continuing to see home prices improve, both of which are positive for our business.
For the year, we expect comp sales growth of approximately 4.6% and total sales growth of approximately 4.8%. Some
may see this as slightly lower than the preliminary 2014 guidance we gave in December of 2013. While nothing has
materially changed in our economic outlook, we did adjust our 2014 plan to reflect a weaker Canadian dollar than what
we experienced last year. I'll also note that the extreme winter weather in February hasn't been our friend, but our
February comps are positive and we know firsthand that many homeowners have some major repairs ahead of them,
which suggests we should have a great spring selling season.
For 2014, we are projecting no gross margin expansion, consistent with our intent to use cost out savings to support
recovering and growing lower margin product categories. On the expense front, we are forecasting our expenses to
grow at approximately 33% of the rate of our sales growth. For the year, we project that our operating margin will grow
by approximately 70 basis points, and we expect diluted earnings per share to increase by approximately 16.5% to
$4.38. Our earnings per share guidance includes our plan to repurchase approximately $5 billion of outstanding shares
during the year using excess cash.
Our 2014 capital spending plan is approximately $1.5 billion, an 8% increase from what we spent in fiscal 2013 in
support of interconnected retail. For the year, we project cash flow from the business of roughly $8.8 billion. We will
use our cash to invest in our business and to return capital to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and
dividends. Our commitment to shareholder return continues to be a hallmark of The Home Depot. On top of our intent
to repurchase $5 billion of outstanding shares in 2014, as Frank mentioned we just announced a 21% increase in our
quarterly dividend which equates to an annual dividend $1.88, in line with our targeted dividend payout ratio of 50%.
So we thank you for your participation in today's call. And, Lisa, we are now ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Yes. Of course, ma'am. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe
Research.
<Q - Aram H. Rubinson>: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Good morning.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Good morning.
<Q - Aram H. Rubinson>: I wanted to ask you a question about growth kind of beyond recovery. A lot of companies
in cyclical businesses have turned to acquisitions when economic growth moderates. I'm wondering if you can tell us a
little bit about your appetite for acquisitions as it is today and also as you look at few years out and the economic
environment moderates a little bit, how you think that might develop.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Okay. Thanks, Aram. And I'll let Carol comment on this as well. But I'd say what you see
from us now and what I would expect to continue is that we use acquisitions really not as a supplement to sales growth
but as a supplement to competencies that we think are important to add to our capabilities. And I would anticipate that
that will be the case going forward.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes indeed, Aram. We've got a filter that looks at opportunities for growth through acquisitions
just in that light, how can they enable our existing business? So if you look at Blinds.com, the most recent acquisition
that we made, not only are we getting a terrific online configurator, one that's much better than what we have, we're
also getting [ph] a tremendous (26:18) call center and these people know how to close sales. This is enabling a business

of ours that we think has huge growth potential.
<Q - Aram H. Rubinson>: And so if growth won't be coming let's say post-recovery from acquisitions, would we'd be
kind of banking more on share repurchase, more on added leverage, or is there some other innovation that you would
point us to think about what it might look like three or five years from now? Thank you.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: So, Aram, we constantly think also about taking share and expanding categories in our store
and improving the productivity of our store, and we've actually been through quite a long period of not having growth
in our market, and we have some experience of being able to generate positive comp growth even in a flat-to-down
housing market. 2010, 2011, were not friendly years in the housing market and we were positively comping.
<Q - Aram H. Rubinson>: Thank you, and terrific results. We'll talk next quarter.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Thank you.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Thank you.
Operator
And we'll go next to Eric Bosshard from Cleveland Research.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Good morning.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Good morning.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Good morning.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Good morning. I was wondering if you can speak a little bit to your terming the recovery now in
the moderate phase. As you look through the last three months or the last six months, what you are seeing different in
terms of consumer demand and appetite either around categories or price points or in the area of discretionary remodel,
but how you are seeing that evolve and if anything changed in the last three months relative to the prior three months in
terms of the intensity or the areas where demand is appearing?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: So, Eric, again I'll let Carol comment on some of the macro things that we're seeing but I'd
also just preface this by saying it's difficult to tease those conclusions out from a quarter where you have a lot of
particularly unusual weather and some unusual overlaps for us. So as Carol mentioned in her comments, we do see
housing as a tailwind but not perhaps quite as much as it was in 2013, but again, if you look just at the last quarter, hard
to tease out some of the specifics on that.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Right. So as we look the macro we think housing will be a contributor to our growth next year
of about 200 basis points. And we think it contributed about 250 basis points in 2013. The biggest driver is home price
appreciation and last year home prices were up double digits. We're not forecasting that in 2014, we think it'll be up
around 6%. Now home prices have 21% to go before they return to peak. So perhaps it's a conservative outlook but we
think it's a realistic outlook to build a plan on.
One comment I might say about the consumer, and Craig, maybe you want to jump in on this, is that as we look at sales
against opening price points at good, better, best, all the way to premium, we've seen growth in premium priced
products in all four quarters including this last quarter. So it doesn't really seem to us like there's a change in the
consumer. I mean there's been some weather disruptions for sure
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Right.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: But it doesn't really seem like there's a change in the consumer.
<A - Craig A. Menear>: No not at all. And as Carol mentioned, we're seeing the growth opportunity going up the line
structure, and I think the other comment would be that over the past few quarters we've shared that our Pro business has
been recovering. So you're seeing growth across categories like lumber and building materials that historically, during

And we'll take our next question from Dennis McGill from Zelman & Associates.
<Q - Dennis McGill>: Hi, good morning. I guess first question, you noted that areas not impacted by weather, which I
guess were few and far between, saw continued strength. Can you maybe just put some numbers behind that and maybe
if we look out West where snow wasn't as much of an issue?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: So, Dennis, the Western division was our strongest performing division and that was the least
impacted by weather.
<Q - Dennis McGill>: And I guess when you say maintain the strength, is it fair to say comps were comparable then to
the prior quarter?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: In the Western division I would say that our comps were about twice the company average.
<Q - Dennis McGill>: Okay, that's helpful. And then, Carol, I think you mentioned that gross margins were well above
plan. You kind of went through the levers there versus the year ago. But relative to plan, where was the upside driven
and how does that kind of factor into the flat outlook for 2014?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Sure. Well, you remember that we were anniversarying strong sales from Hurricane Sandy. We
had about $225 million of sales that we had to anniversary. Nonetheless, we built a plan that had our building materials
department growing year-on-year, and as Craig pointed out, it didn't grow year-on-year. And that's good news from a
margin perspective because we had a benefit from a lower penetration of a lower margin category. So that was one big
change.
The other change is the purchasing tiers that we hit in certain categories and this is just a function of demand. So we hit
new purchasing tiers for refrigeration, insulation, plumbing repair. We hadn't planned on that and that gave us higher
co-op and rebate.
<Q - Dennis McGill>: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Best of luck.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Thank you.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Thank you.

And we'll go next to Kate McShane from Citi.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: Thank you. I was hoping to follow up on a question asked previously with regards to the
housing market trends. Carol, you've always expressed your thoughts on changes in the environment, and I wondered if
you could add your perspective on any opportunity for the easing of lending or the lowering of FICO scores and how
that might play into your guidance.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes. We've said all along that credit availability was a big driver of the housing recovery and
the shape of the recovery curve. We are very encouraged by what we have seen at Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo has
announced that they are taking the FICO scores for FHA loans down from what was 640 to now 600. We think that will
be very good, particularly for those new households who are buying their first home. It also is a good news story when
you think about the affordability curve because if you look at an affordability zone, mortgages that are a $100,000

mortgage and this would be a great mortgage for an FHA loan, that stays in the affordability zone until mortgage rates
reach 9%. So we're encouraged by this, and we also hear that other lenders are starting to discuss a loosening up. It's
still a very tight environment, make no mistake, but there are encouraging signs.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: Okay; thank you. And if I could just quickly follow up about the sales from the affected
regions by weather. How much do you think will be pushed into Q1 and how much do you think is just lost at this
point?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Really we don't see any loss at this stage of the game. It's very, very early obviously in the
quarter, and we're experiencing what maybe many wouldn't say is a more typical winter.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: Thank you.

And we'll take our next question from Scot Ciccarelli from RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Good morning.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Good morning.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: Carol, I know you've mentioned about a number of macro factors, but are there certain factors
you're particularly concerned about now? And then I guess for both Frank and Carol, when you guys kind of talk about
PFRI as a percentage of GDP, call it 3.1% today, the long-term average of 4.6%, is it realistic to get back to 4.6% or
what is the more – what do you think is the realistic target to kind of reach over time given the current environment and
current size of GDP?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: So, Scot, first on the factors that we are concerned about, Carol just went through a discussion
on one of them that has been a long-standing concern, which is credit availability and indicated we're starting to see
some improvement there. But that's certainly been a key factor that we've watched. In terms of the recovery of PFRI
and whether it gets back to 4.6%, economists would tell you things have a tendency to revert to the mean, but there are
always exceptions to the rule.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Something will happen in 2014.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Right. It'll take us a while. That's exactly right.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: The other thing I would just point out, Scot, that we're looking at is household formation.
Candidly, it was pretty weak. But when you think about it, why was it so weak? It goes back to credit availability. So
we need to get those millennials into a home. And I'm, again, really happy with what we're seeing at Wells Fargo.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: So basically credit is kind of what you're looking at as driving all the other data, whether it's
turnover, housing prices, et cetera. You think that's going to be the major, let's call it, delta in the equation?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: That, Scot, plus the economy. I mean, the underlying engine remains job growth. We need
people to be getting jobs. We need GDP growing. And then we've absorbed, and more than absorbed, I mean, there is
no over capacity in the housing market. We're actually down to a very, very low inventory level. So it really does come
back, if you've got the job growth, if you got GDP growth, then the other key factor to watch is the credit availability.
<Q - Scot Ciccarelli>: All right. Very helpful. Thanks, guys.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes.

And we'll go next to Laura Champine from Canaccord.
<Q - Laura A. Champine>: Good morning. Could you comment on your market share trends in the quarter?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Yeah, so if you look at a rolling 12 basis, we were up roughly 35 basis points to 26.5% based
on the NAICS data. And when we look at third party data that tracks consumer only spending, we were up in roughly
10 out of 22 key classes or departments, if you will. So 10 departments, 22 classes, so we feel good about the fact that
we're continuing to grow share.

And we'll take our next question from Seth Basham with Wedbush Securities.
<Q - Seth M. Basham>: Good morning. First question is around share gains as well. Can you help us better understand
what's happening with appliances, how much share you are getting in appliances this quarter relative to recent quarters?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: When we look at the most recent quarter, it shows based on again third party tracking that
we've picked up about 180 basis points of share in the quarter and that compares to about 170 basis points on a rolling
12, which would be over the four quarters obviously.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Appliances contributed about 60 basis points of our comp growth in the quarter.
<Q - Seth M. Basham>: Thank you. And then secondly, if I may, follow up regarding the macro. If you think about
credit availability being relatively tight and you look at some metrics like DTI, debt to income, and LTV ratios. Those
don't seem too tight to norms in the past. So how do you rectify that against other dimensions of credit availability?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Oh, gosh, Seth, if you worked for a financial institution and you took billions of dollars of
losses, you're in an interest rate environment that so low it's hard to make a buck. You're going to be shy and you're
going to be very cautious in terms of underwriting. I mean I would imagine and this is what financial institutions will
tell us. So while it's a better environment to lend into, and I suspect that's why banks are starting to signal that they're
willing to change, it's been a tough road for those folks.
<Q - Seth M. Basham>: Great. Thanks, guys.

And we'll go next to Jaime Katz from Morningstar.
<Q - Jaime M. Katz>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my call. Can you guys comment on just how the Mexican
and Canadian businesses have been doing, add a little bit more color and then maybe talk about how you guys are
planning on marketing to the Pro business this year to grow that business a little faster?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Okay. Jaime on the Canadian and Mexican business, first comment on Mexico, as I said
Mexico has now had 41 quarters in a row of positive comp growth. This year that performance I mean we say that and
we sort of don't spend a lot of time dwelling on that but this year that performance was really pretty extraordinary in the
context of what was happening in the Mexican economy, which went through a significant adjustment and a significant
adjustment that was centered very much around changes in housing policy. So we're very pleased with how our
business not only has historically performed but performed this year again positively comping in a difficult
environment. Then on Canada, Canada adjusting for FX, had a stronger comp growth in the fourth quarter than the
company average. Again, we're very pleased with how our Canadian business is doing. We feel like we're
well-positioned in that competitive environment and have been positively comping really for the last several quarters in
a row there.

<Q - Jaime M. Katz>: And marketing to the Pro?
<A>: From a Pro perspective, Frank mentioned our program we launched, Pro Xtra, which we are excited about. We
are signing up 10,000 customers per week and so great momentum there. And also, we are very pleased with our
mobile app in Pro. That is allowing us to really help our pros run a better business, leverage some of our online tools
and connect our pro both virtually and in our brick-and-mortar locations. So in addition to that, we are going to
continue to be aggressive on conventional means of advertising like radio, which really resonates well with our Pros.
But at the end of the day for Pros, it is about a couple of fundamental things and that is convenience, great service, they
can get in and out fast and value and we are going to focus on those three things as well.

We'll take our next question from Greg Melich from ISI Group.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Hi, thanks. I had two questions. One was just on the comp trend through the quarter and into
this quarter. I was surprised at just how strong December was given how strong it was a year ago. Could you explain
what that was and the impact of Sandy? And it looks like January was the weakest month of the quarter. How much of
that was weather and what do you expect for those trends or how are they looking into February?
<A - Craig A. Menear>: As it relates to December, let me address that first. We had, as I mentioned in my comments,
we had a record-setting Black Friday. We had great gift center sales that exceeded our plans. Events were a strong part
of December sales overall, and we had a terrific season as it related to our decorative holiday and live trees. And so we
were very, very pleased with the performance and the programs that our merchants put together and how well our
stores took that and drove it. Our associates just did an excellent job. When you look at January, certainly as you would
expect with some of the weather impacts in parts of the country, we saw a little bit of softening in the more
discretionary spend categories in that month, and certainly that was a factor, so the mix of sale changed in the month of
January.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: We don't like to use weather as an excuse, but we think we probably lost $100 million in the
month of January. Atlanta was frozen for example. It was tough here.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: I guess a lot of salt sales and nothing else. My other question was sort of bigger picture,
whoever wants to address it. We did implement the Affordable Care Act. I know one of the things we were watching
was how many of your employees take up the new plan structure. Anything you can update us there in terms of takeup
rates of your own plan or how you are baking into your guidance for SG&A would be helpful?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Yeah, Greg, we're not going to get into the specific details around take-up other than to say it
was consistent with what we planned for.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: Was it up? I assume.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Yes.
<Q - Greg S. Melich>: And that didn't – the guidance didn't change?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Right.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: The guidance didn't change. Our HR team is doing a fabulous job of working through ways to
mitigate any cost pressures that may come at us by re-bidding out placement services, plan redesigns, so we're
providing insurance for our associates and taking care of our shareholders at the same time.

And we'll go now to Michael Lasser from UBS.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Good morning, thanks a lot for taking my question. Frank, it seems like home prices and home
price appreciation has been the biggest driver of the market for the last 12 months to 18 months. At what point do you
think turnover will again overtake that and you may see a re-coupling between home improvement comps and housing
turnover?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Michael, it's an interesting question. We were just talking about that very question amongst
ourselves, and interestingly, historically for us, housing turnover has not been that great a predictor of our sales if you
go back over time, and so I'm not sure that the way the housing market will play out for us is that as price appreciation
slows down, the correlation will shift to another element of the market.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: So here's just a couple of data points for you. I find this to be very interesting, if you look at the
correlation between housing turnover and home-improvement sales between 2000 and 2013, you've got a high R
square, something like 0.7. If you look at it from the period 2010 to 2013 the R squared is 0.3. So the housing market is
just changing. It's a good way to explain but not necessarily a good way to predict.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Okay. Carol, I guess if you look at the metric from 2000 to 2010 presumably the R squared
would be higher?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: A little bit but not much.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: My second question is on the acquisition of Blinds.com. As you become more proficient with
interacting and engaging your customers online, do you think that puts you more in the crosshairs or potentially more in
the crosshairs of the online-only retailers?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: We think we're in those crosshairs.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: But even more so than you already are? I mean there...
<A - Francis S. Blake>: We don't think that does anything to our being in their crosshairs. First off acquisitions like
Blinds.com as Carol said the explanation for it is the competencies that it brings internally to allow us to better compete
in interconnected retail. But we imagine that pretty much everybody out there with an Internet-only offering that relates
to home-improvement already has a target on us.
<Q - Michael Lasser>: Okay, that's fair enough. Let me ask one last question. What does the duration look like from
extreme winter conditions and spending associated with the repair from that? How would you contrast it to perhaps
tornado or hurricane-related spending? Thank you.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Michael, that totally depends actually on when spring breaks. So I would suspect there are,
and I can look at my own yard, there are people who have, right now, needs. But depending on when the spring breaks
will depend on what that duration time is between the recognition of the need and the action to make it happen.

We'll take our next question from Mike Baker from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Mike A. Baker>: Thanks. Two questions. One, on buybacks, so $5 billion this year, is there any upside to that? I
think a year ago, you talked about $4.6 billion, but said there could be upside to take on more debt and you certainly

did that and upside the number. A year later, we are closer to your 2.0 target leverage ratio, I think. So just wondering if
you could characterize any upside in that $5 billion number.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, today we're planning $5 billion using excess cash and to your point we're not at our max
target of two times adjusted debt to EBITDAR. Today would have about $1.9 billion of borrowing availability if we
were to leverage up to that target. We don't have any plans to do that right now. We raised a whole lot of debt last year
and just always a good idea to let some time lapse before you go back to the market. Just so you have excellent
execution. Yeah.
<Q - Mike A. Baker>: Yeah, makes sense. The second question, and maybe this is just looking at it to finely, but your
comp guidance suggests a 200 basis point deceleration from 2013. You think about 50 basis points of that comes from
housing. The other 150 basis point deceleration, is that just being conservative, not prudent to expect a comp at 7%
every year, or is there something else in there that we should be thinking about?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: I'd asked you to think about commodities. In 2013, we enjoyed commodity inflation. Not
thinking that's going to happen this year. In fact, we're going to have some pressure from commodity price deflation. So
that would be one driver. The other driver, as you know, is that we rolled out our extended appliance assortment to
many of our stores, something like 500 stores. So we'll be lapping against that. So that puts a little bit of headwinds on
us.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: And we don't plan on storms.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Thank you. We don't, but we'll take them.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Right.
<Q - Mike A. Baker>: Very helpful. Just to go one more time, can you quantify the commodity impact in 2013 and
2014?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: It would be – I'm going to be rounding here. It's 80 basis points to 90 basis points.

<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Yes.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Gary Balter from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Gary J. Balter>: Thank you. Just following up actually on the last question, how much of your comps were
helped by share gain from some competitors that may be struggling and what do you assume in your 2014 guidance?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, as Craig pointed out pursuant to the NAICS definition, we enjoyed share appreciation in
2013, about 35 basis points of share appreciation. We don't tend to build a plan based on share capture. That doesn't
mean, Gary, that we won't do everything to get that share capture and take care of our customers, but we don't tend to
plan for that.
<Q - Gary J. Balter>: Okay. And then you made some comments on Canada and the currency decline. Is there a way,
and I am not asking you to play economist, but given the declines that you are seeing in their currency, which makes
their purchasing power a little bit better for Canadians, do you think that that will help the underlying business at some
point, putting aside the currency impact?

And we'll take our next question from Keith Hughes from SunTrust.
<Q - Keith Hughes>: Thanks. You finished off a great year with products or projects $900 or greater. Given you are
comping against that in 2014, what kind of number are you expecting there in the same-store sales guidance you gave
earlier?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: So we actually plan our year based on growth for both transactions, as well as ticket, and we
plan that roughly equal. And if you look at the year, we are pretty close to that in terms of it was pretty balanced
between tickets and transactions.
<Q - Keith Hughes>: I was asking specifically around the transactions greater than $900.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Oh, Keith, we wouldn't plan at that level.
<Q - Keith Hughes>: Right. Okay. Is your sense that it will be greater than the comp sales or come back down in line
with it?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: No, I think if we see the continued recovery, I think the opportunity there driven by continued
Pro business, driven by customers taking on larger projects if their home values continue to hold, I think we could
expect to see the bigger ticket continue to grow.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: And from a shape of the year perspective, I think the growth would be heavier in the back half
than the first half because we're still anniversarying from Sandy storm in Q1. We've got about $150 million more or
less in Q1 and Q2 was an outstanding year for us. So I think if you're trying to build a model that way, Keith, that's how
I would build it.

<Q - Alan M. Rifkin>: Thank you very much. Your growth in the dotcom side of the business is quite admirable and
given the investments that you have made to date, one would have to assume that dotcom continues to outpace the
brick-and-mortar side. Carol, what effect on EBIT margins going forward will an accelerated growth on the dotcom
side of the business have on EBIT?
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Well, a couple of things about the profitability of our dotcom business. First, year on year was
much more profitable this year than last year which was is a good news story, and as we think about 2014 and beyond,
we factored into our guidance the impact of a dotcom business that's growing faster than the core, because to your
point, it is.

<Q - Alan M. Rifkin>: Okay. And one last question, if I may. Just playing devil's advocate here, I believe in the past
you have actually said that the single most important macroeconomic variable to your business is GDP, even greater
than that of housing because GDP obviously incorporates housing plus everything else. Your guidance for GDP is
actually higher in 2014 than 2013. So even with the expected deflation in commodity prices that you're anticipating in
2014, why are we not looking for a slightly higher comp than what you've laid out today?
<A - Francis S. Blake>: So, Alan, I'll make a couple of comments and then Carol can add to them. Our commentary
around GDP has been the most significant thing for us was those comments were given in the context of a housing
market that was frankly still flat to down. So in 2010 and 2011 when we were positively comping, what we were
expressing was that was a reflection of a recovery in GDP. We were not yet seeing, and the country wasn't seeing a
tailwind from housing. What we tried to lay out both in our June 2012 and our December 2013 conferences was now
we see a time when housing will be a tailwind to GDP and when you compare 2014 to 2013, a somewhat less of a
tailwind than we saw in 2013, but Carol if you want to add some comments to that.
<A - Carol B. Tomé>: Sure. So if you think of the drivers of housing that most impacted our business, we do believe
home prices will appreciate in 2014 but at half the rate they appreciated in 2013, so that's a year-over-year change. In
terms of turnover, we think the turnover as a percent of units will be about 4%, so that's down slightly from 2013. All
of this is a directionally correct but imperfect model, we're taking all the data that we can Alan, and we come up with
our point of view on what the business will do.
<Q - Alan M. Rifkin>: Okay. Thank you both very much.
<A - Francis S. Blake>: Thanks, Alan.
