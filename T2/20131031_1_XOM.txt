[Operator Instructions]
Good day and welcome to the ExxonMobil Corporation third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Today's call is
being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks I would like to turn the call over to the Vice President of Investor
Relations and Secretary, Mr. David Rosenthal. Please go ahead, sir.
David S. Rosenthal
Good morning. And welcome to ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings call and webcast. The focus of this call is
ExxonMobil's financial and operating results for the third quarter of 2013. I will refer to the slides that are available
through the investors sections of our website. Before we go further, I would like to draw your attention to our
cautionary statement shown on slide 2.
Moving to slide 3, we provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. Global economic
growth remained constrained in the third quarter with mixed performance across the region. The U.S. economy
continues to grow at a moderate pace following an upward revision of second quarter growth. China's growth improved
modestly while Europe's economic conditions remain uncertain.
Energy markets delivered mixed results compared to the second quarter, with higher crude oil and lower natural gas
prices. Global industry refining margins deteriorated significantly reflecting moderate demand and improved capacity

availability. Chemical commodity product margins strengthened during the quarter on lower feedstock costs and
increased U.S. demand.
Turning now to the third quarter financial results as shown on slide 4, ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings were $7.9
billion or $1.79 per share. The corporation distributed $5.8 billion to shareholders in the third quarter through dividends
and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding. Of that total, $3 billion was used to purchase shares.
CapEx in the third quarter was $10.5 billion and $32.6 billion for the first nine months of 2013, in line with anticipated
spending plans.
Cash flow from operations and asset sales was $13.6 billion. At the end of the third quarter, cash totaled $5.7 billion
and debt was $21.3 billion.
The next slide provides additional detail on third quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter, cash increased
from $5 billion to $5.7 billion. Earnings, depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items and our
ongoing asset management program yielded $13.6 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses included
additions to plant, property and equipment of $9.1 billion and shareholder distributions of $5.8 billion. Additional
financing and investing activities increased cash by $2 billion. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are
expected to be $3 billion in the fourth quarter.
Moving on to slide 6 and a review of our segmented results. ExxonMobil's third quarter earnings of $7.9 billion
decreased $1.7 billion from the third quarter of 2012. Lower downstream earnings were partly offset by higher
upstream and chemical earnings. In the sequential quarter comparison shown on slide 7, earnings increased by about $1
billion across all segments reflecting higher upstream realizations, lower refining maintenance, improved chemical
commodity margins and lower corporate and financing expenses. Guidance for corporate and financing expenses
remains at $500 million to $700 million per quarter.
Turning now to the upstream financial and operating results and starting on slide 8.Upstream earnings in the third
quarter were $6.7 billion, up $740 million from the third quarter of 2012. Stronger prices increased earnings by $440
million as worldwide crude oil and natural gas realizations increased by $2.85 per barrel and $0.56 per thousand cubic
feet, respectively. Production volume and mix effects increased earnings by a net $20 million as the benefit from higher
liquid volumes was mostly offset by the impact of crude underlifts and lower natural production. All other items,
mainly favorable tax and foreign exchange impacts, increased earnings by $280 million. Upstream after-tax earnings
per barrel for the third quarter were $18.16.
Moving to slide 9, production increased by 58,000 oil equivalent barrels per day or 1.5% from the third quarter of last
year. Liquids production was up 83,000 barrels per day or 3.9%. Lower down time, mainly in Nigeria, the U.S,
Kazakhstan, and Canada, ramp-up at the Kearl and Nigeria satellite projects and continued increased production from
liquids-rich unconventional plays in the U.S. were partly offset by field decline. Natural gas production was down 147
million cubic feet per day. As expected, lower U.S. production and field decline in several areas were partially offset by
lower down time, mainly in Qatar and project ramp-ups.
Turning now to the sequential comparison, starting on slide 10, upstream earnings increased by $408 million versus the
second quarter. Realizations increased earnings by $410 million as worldwide crude prices increased $7.67 per barrel
and natural gas realizations decreased $0.53 per thousand cubic feet. Volume and mix effects decreased earnings by
$150 million as increased liquids production was more than offset by the impact of underlifts in a number of regions
including the North Sea and West Africa and by lower natural gas production in Europe. Other items had a positive
impact of $150 million, primarily reflecting the absence of expiration cost reimbursement to Rosneft in the second
quarter.
Moving to slide 11, oil equivalent volumes were down 1.4% sequentially. Liquids production increased 17,000 barrels
per day mainly due to project ramp-ups in Canada and Nigeria and lower overall downtime, partly offset by field
decline. Natural gas production was down 440 million cubic feet per day sequentially. Lower seasonal demand in
Europe and field decline were partially offset by lower downtime in Qatar. Our year-to-date production volume
performance continues to be in line with the projections presented at the analyst meeting in March, with strong uptime

performance, increased North American unconventional liquids production, and higher European gas demand for the
year offsetting the slower than anticipated ramp-up of Kearl. We remain on target to meet the 2013 volume outlook
presented at the analyst meeting.
Moving now to the downstream financial and operating results, starting on slide 12, downstream earnings for the
quarter were $592 million, down $2.6 billion from the third quarter of 2012 due to lower global refining margins of
almost $2.4 billion. Volume and mix effects increased earnings by $150 million driven by lower refining maintenance.
Other items reduced earnings by $380 million including the absence of gains from the Switzerland divestment.
Turning to slide 13, sequentially, third quarter downstream earnings increased by $196 million. Lower global refining
margins decreased earnings by $870 million, while volume and mix effects increased earnings by $500 million
reflecting reduced maintenance activity. Other items increased earnings by $570 million primarily due to the absence of
the Dartmouth refinery conversion costs, lower maintenance expenses and favorable foreign exchange impacts.
Moving now to the chemical, financial and operating results and starting on slide 14. Third quarter chemical earnings
were just over $1 billion, up $235 million versus the prior year quarter due mainly to stronger margins from higher
commodity realizations in all regions.
Moving to slide 15, sequentially, chemical earnings increased by $269 million. Improved commodity margins helped
by favorable feed cost in the U.S., increased earnings by $110 million. Strong U.S. commodity sales volumes further
increased earnings by $60 million. Lower costs associated with Singapore's new steam cracker start up and lower plan
maintenance favorably impacted earnings by $100 million.
Moving next to the third quarter business highlights beginning on slide 16. The next two slides provide an update on
upstream projects which recently started or will start production next year. Beginning with the 2013 project startups, at
Kearl we are currently producing at or above 100,000 barrels per day. Over the past few months, we have undertaken
normal startup-related fine-tuning and synchronization activities of our facilities, which are not unusual for new
operations of this scale and magnitude. Kearl incorporates a number of technology innovations such as our proprietary
froth treatment process, which significantly enhance environmental performance and reduce capital investment.
Successful application of this new technology was confirmed as Kearl bitumen is now being processed at a number of
ExxonMobil and third party refineries.
The Kearl expansion project is on budget, on schedule and now nearly 60% complete. Fabrication and assembly of pipe
rack and equipment modules for the bitumen processing plant are progressing in Edmonton and are 80% complete.
Learnings from the initial development are being applied to the construction and commissioning of the expansion
project.
On the logistics side, Enbridge initiated construction of the Woodland Mainland Pipeline which will extend 385
kilometers south of Cheecham to the Edmonton terminal and connect with refineries and export pipelines. This new
pipeline will have an initial capacity of 400,000 barrels per day, with the ability to expand to approximately 800,000
barrels per day depending on crude viscosity.
The Kipper Tuna Turrum project in Australia has started, with gas production from the Tuna field via two new gas
pipelines and first oil production from the Turrum field through the new Marlin B platform. This project represents the
largest new domestic oil and gas development on the Australian Eastern seaboard. With reserves of 1.6 trillion feet of
gas and 140 million barrels of recoverable oil and gas liquids, Kipper Tuna Turrum will help secure East Australia's
energy future.
First production from Kashagan was achieved in September and production ramped up to near 80,000 barrels per day.
In late September and, again, earlier this month traces of gas were detected along the onshore gas pipeline route from
one of the production and drilling islands to the onshore processing facility. The operator is currently investigating the
root cause of the events, and it is now anticipated that inspection and investigation will take some weeks to conclude.
Production will remain shut-in until this work is complete.

Turning now to slide 17 and an update on some of our projects scheduled to start up in 2014. The P&G LNG project is
now more than 90% complete. We achieved several important milestones during the quarter including completion of
drilling at the first well pad and starting the commissioning phase at the LNG plant, with preparation of production
startup in the second half of 2014. The plant has now been pressured up with gas to initiate power generation and
enable testing of key facilities and equipment. The estimated cost of the project remains at $19 billion. Reflecting
disciplined project management in a unique and challenging work environment.
The Cold Lake Nabiye development in Canada is 60% complete and progressing per plan towards a 2014 startup. This
is another long plateau development which will access a resource of 280 million barrels of oil and produce an
additional 40,000 barrels of bitumen per day. The Nabiye includes a new steam plant, field production pads and
associated facilities. Equipment installation is well underway, and six of the seven initially planned drilling pads with
24 wells each have been completed to date.
Moving next to Qatar, the Barzan project is another major step in our long and successful relationship with Qatar
Petroleum. All of the 30 production wells are now complete and the well-head platform topsides have been installed.
Startup is planned for late next year. When completed, the project will provide gas to the state of Qatar to meet the
country's growing need for clean-burning natural gas. The first phase of the project is to supply about 1.4 billion cubic
feet of gas per day together with the sale of associated condensate, LPGs and ethane.
Also in Qatar the Helium 2 plant project operated by RasGas started up during the quarter. The plant is expected to
produce 1.3 billion cubic feet per year when fully operational. The Helium 2 plant is the world's largest helium refining
facility and makes Qatar the largest exporter and second largest producer of helium in the world. As Qatar continues to
reliably supply international markets with LNG extracting helium from the produced gas is a profitable value added
activity which helps meet the world's ever growing demand for liquid helium.
Turning now to slide 18 and an update on our progress in Russia, I will start by highlighting another milestone in the
successful Sakhalin 1 development. The consortium marked 10 years of drilling success, pioneering the industry's
extended reach drilling technologies while leveraging ExxonMobil's 90-year history of Arctic expertise.
Since 2007, a number of world records in extended reach drilling have been set by the Sakhalin Yastreb rig at the
Chayvo and Odoptu fields. To date 23 of the 30 world's longest extended reach wells are Sakhalin-1 wells. The current
world record is held by a Sakhalin-1 well, which was drilled at the Chayvo field earlier this summer to a length of
12,700 meters. ExxonMobil's proprietary technology has minimized drilling vibration and improved overall economic
efficiency, while reducing the environmental footprint of the Sakhalin-1 project. The relentless emphasis on safety,
flawless execution and implementation of unique drilling technologies have made Sakhalin-1 a premier project in the
global oil and gas industry.
Now turning to our Arkutun Dagi, this will be the largest offshore oil and gas production platform in Russia, making
the Sakhalin shelf a model for arctic and subarctic project developments. Construction of the topsides was completed in
Korea earlier this year and commissioning of the drilling rig and topside facilities are 40% complete. Installation of the
topsides onto the gravity-based structure next year will set a new world record for floatover installation offshore at
42,000 tons. Startup is planned for the end of next year and production will peak at around 90,000 barrels per day.
In West Siberia, operations for the pilot program are underway. Instead of drilling new wells, we entered and deepened
existing well bores which has sped up the process to acquire new petro-physical log data and core samples. This
information will help identify key produceability parameters for the Bazhenov and will help optimize new horizontal
drilling locations planned for 2014.
In preparation for exploration drilling in the Kara Sea the Rosneft-ExxonMobil joint venture recently completed a
month-long ice defense field trial to test sea ice and iceberg tracking systems that will be used to protect the drilling rig.
All operations were successful and completed safely. ExxonMobil's arctic leadership and continued successful
execution at Sakhalin-1 position us well as we prepare to ramp up the exploration program in the Kara Sea in 2014.
Also in the Black Sea, site surveys were completed in preparation for drilling to begin in late 2014 or early 2015.

Turning now to slide 19 and an update on our global and broad exploration program. In September, drilling started on
the Mronge-1 wildcat in Block 2, offshore Tanzania. The Mronge-1 well targets reservoirs equivalent in age to those
successfully tested by the Zafarani and Lavani wells, in addition to another reservoir interval previously untested in
Block 2. Further wildcat drilling is planned for 2014.
In Argentina, ExxonMobil spud the first operated well on the Baho Del Choique block targeting the Vaca Muerta
formation. This is the first of three ExxonMobil operated wells that will be drilled in sequence on the block.
In Canada, ExxonMobil, in partnership with Imperial oil, acquired ConocoPhillips' interest in the Clyden oil sands
lease. The Clyden lease is near Imperial's corner lease holdings and contains 226,000 gross acres of high-quality oil
sands amenable to the steam-assisted gravity drainage, or SAGD, in-situ recovery technique.
Turning to Brazil, ExxonMobil was awarded the interest it successfully bid for in May. ExxonMobil acquired a 50%
interest in the Potiguar 762 block and a 50% interest in the Sierra 603 block, totaling more than 750,000 gross acres
offshore northeastern Brazil. ExxonMobil will be the operator for both blocks.
In Gabon, ExxonMobil has reached agreement to acquire a 30% participating interest in the offshore Arouwe Block.
The operator Perenco along with the third-party equity holder, Tolo, is planning a wildcat well in 2014.
Turning now to slide 20 and an update on our North American liquids activities. In the Permian basin we are ramping
up activities to develop both conventional and unconventional reservoirs across our leading position of 1.5 million net
acres. We currently have eight operated rigs and have turned almost 100 wells to sales this year across the entire basin.
Current net production is more than 90,000 barrels per day.
More than 65 workover rigs are also active on our Permian properties, increasing production by opening additional
zones and performing fracture stimulation treatments. We are also optimizing development and expanding
infrastructure in our CO2 projects in the central basin platform area in order to enhance oil recovery. We also continue
to actively evaluate unconventional potential across our Permian acreage highlighted by the Wolf Camp, Wolf Bone,
Wolfberry, and Bone Springs reservoirs.
In the Bakken play, our gross operated production recently hit a record 65,000 oil equivalent barrels per day. For the
quarter, oil equivalent production increased by 81% over the prior year quarter driven by a record 85 wells turned to
sales year-to-date and the 2012 Danbury transaction. This volume increase reflects the benefits of well pad
development drilling and optimized well completions across our core Bakken acreage.
In the Woodford, well results continue to be strong with peak 30-day equivalent production rates up 17% year-to-date.
For example, a recent five well pad completion had a peak seven-day production rate just below 4,000 barrels of oil and
13 million cubic feet of gas per day. We also continue to develop infrastructure for our growing liquids production,
recently putting in service a 65-mile oil-gathering pipeline in the Ardmore area.
In conclusion, in the third quarter, we earned $7.9 billion, generated $13.6 billion in cash flow, invested $10.5 billion in
the business, and distributed $5.8 billion to our shareholders. Business performance remains strong across our portfolio.
In the upstream, we increased liquids production from project ramp-ups and lower down time. Total production
volumes are on target to meet the full-year outlook provided at the analyst meeting.
In the downstream refinery throughput increased upon successful completion of the significant planned maintenance
activities in the second quarter. Chemical business results remain strong, on increased commodity product demand and
lower feedstock costs.
Across the corporation CapEx is in line with anticipated spending plans. Our cash flow remains strong and enables
robust shareholder distributions. We maintain a long-term perspective on our business with a relentless focus on
operational excellence and disciplined investing through the business cycle. As discussed in the business highlights, we
continue to progress a unique and diversified set of profitable growth opportunities, which position us well to deliver
long-term shareholder value.

That concludes my prepared remarks. And I would now be happy to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Evan Calio with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Good morning, guys, how are you?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Evan, how are you?
<Q - Evan Calio>: I'm good. I'm good. Maybe I missed it in your opening comments on the discussion on the cash
balance but the additional financing investing item, will that show up in the balance sheet? Meaning, what was the
change to debt in the quarter?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: That was the $2 billion, that was an increase in our debt.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Okay, Okay, and, well, while it may be premature and I know you guys addressed this at the
analyst day, but what are your thoughts with regard to potentially reducing CapEx on a forward basis, which has been,
you know, a theme primarily in Europe or using, as you did, in this past quarter, some of your significant and potential
leverage to continue to fund the buy-back.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Evan, if we step back to the analyst meeting in March, we did show somewhat of a rollover
in CapEx going forward, I think particularly in the upstream with a little higher investment in downstream and
chemical, and we will update that in the next analyst meeting, but right now I don't have any new number to give you
and so that's still a good outlook for us as we go forward.
In terms of leverage on the balance sheet, no real change in kind of our approach. You have seen us, over the course of
this year, increase leverage just a bit but that's really to get us back to where we were if you go back to about 2010.
So if you look across – if you look across the 2011 and 2012 timeframe where we had significant cash flow including
asset divestitures over those two years, we returned a lot of that cash to the shareholder, we also paid down a lot of debt
so this increase you've seen this year really just kind of gets us back to about where we were. But no real change in
approach to the balance sheet or distributions to shareholders.
<Q - Evan Calio>: Great. I'll leave it there, thank you.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Doug Terreson with ISI group.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Hey, good morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: I have a question about E&P, and specifically, after tax profitability appears to have
increased versus the year ago period in both the U.S. and international arena. But, in your E&P earnings charts that you
highlighted, they didn't indicate that volume mix effects played much of a role in this improvement and so I wanted to
see if you could provide some color on unit profitability excluding tax and foreign exchange benefits and specifically
whether or not the trend's improving and really just any of the drivers of E&P profitability that you're able to provide
color on.

<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure, I'd be happy to provide a little more color on that. So if you're looking at
quarter-over-quarter you see on the chart and I mentioned in my prepared remarks a net increase of about $20 million.
We did have an underlift this quarter of about 25,000 barrels a day in a number of areas, including West Africa and the
North Sea. And if we had not been under-lifted, earnings would have been notionally a $100 million or so higher.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: So that might have been more closer to what you expected. We did see quite a nice
contribution on the liquids side and that was offset a bit by declining as we expected and had talked about on the gas
side of the business. So if I look at the third quarter, things came out really just about the way we expected: higher
liquids, particularly in some of our more profitable areas and then a decline in gas volumes, particularly in the U.S.
So as we talked about at the analyst meeting, we are talking steps and will continue to take steps to strengthen
profitability. I think if you look at our third quarter results and the flow-through of higher realizations to the bottom
line, I think our unit profitability actually went up a little more than our realizations did, so I wouldn't want to take any
one quarter and say we've set a trend.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Sure.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: But we're certainly starting to see the impact of the higher liquids volumes and a little
lower gas volumes in the U.S. as we had expected.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Okay. Thanks a lot, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Doug Leggate with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks, good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Doug, how are you?
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Not too bad, thank you. I wonder if I could ask you about production volumes. I realize you've
got a lot of projects that are in the ramp-up phase and I guess slide nine shows us the year-over-year impact, but can
you help us understand what stage of their evolution the new projects are and what I'm really trying to get to is – I
know it's not an easy question to answer but are you at the point now where the ramp-up in the stuff that started up
already is now enough to offset the underlying decline so we can hit that inflection point in growth and I've got a
follow-up, please.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure, Doug. If you look particularly on the liquids side which is, I know, where the focus
has been, you're certainly starting to see an inflection point off of where we've been as the new projects have come
online. I mentioned it's really a mix, some things are doing a little better than we were expecting this year and that has
more than offset a little slower ramp-up in Kearl. So if I were to step up and look at overall as the projects are coming
online, the satellite projects in West Africa, the Kearl project, et cetera, you know, we are starting to see the kind of
turnaround that we talked about at the analyst meeting and we've been discussing since then.
One of the other things that we've seen this year, particularly year-over-year, is much lower down time. Our operations
are running very well this year. We're very pleased with the progress we've made, particularly on the liquids side in
some of our higher margin areas but also on the LNG side of the business so when you have the combination of lower
down time on some of your better profitable barrel equivalents and the turnaround and uplift that you're starting to see
from the liquids production volumes, including here in the U.S., you saw we had a nice increase just in the U.S, so I
would say, again, I wouldn't want to grab any one quarter but if you're looking directionally and looking at trends we
are starting to deliver on the commitments that we've made and the projects that we've talked about and then as I

mentioned in my prepared remarks, as we look forward into 2014, our major projects are on schedule, on budget and
we continue to be very pleased with that progress. And, as you know, that continues on into the 2015 and 2016
timeframe. So we're on track to deliver that big wedge of volume we talked about between year-end 2012 and year-end
2017 and things are progressing well.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thank you. My follow-up, David, is really – I know you've been on the road a fair amount this
last several months and there seems to be – I'm really looking for you to clarify or at least put the debate to rest, there
seems to be some debate over whether or not you are going to stick with your capital budget – your multiyear capital as
laid out at last year's analyst day and in light of where the share price is, I guess, it goes back to Evan's question -- the
share price has frankly been pretty awful this year, on a relative and absolute basis, how is management thinking about
the kind of reward that some of your overseas competitors have had by cutting back capital and how are you thinking
about maybe being a bit more aggressive on the buyback to take advantage or at least address the weakness that we've
seen so far this year and I'll leave it at that, thank you.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Thanks, Doug. Let me hit those three things. On the CapEx side, there is no new outlook
relative to what we said at the analyst meeting. We're certainly updating our plan now and we'll give an update in
March. But when we look at our investment plan that we showed you, we don't have any information to date that would
suggest, you know, a major change from what we said.
As opposed to – regards the stock price, you know, the market determines that. We are executing on the things that we
can control. Flawless execution of the base business, making sure our assets are up and running, when the margin is
good, as you've seen in the chemical business this quarter, where our uptime rates were extremely high and we're
capturing that value added there on the margin, particularly in the U.S. And then I mentioned the operations that we're
having in the upstream, so if we're looking at the things that really generate shareholder value, short-term and
long-term, running the business well, we're seeing that, and bringing those big projects online and benefiting from the
CapEx profile that we've had the last few years, and you've seen that.
In terms of the buyback, no change in the buyback, it continues to be a quarter-to-quarter decision. And I updated you
on the third quarter-or the fourth quarter, I'm sorry. And it's another $3 billion and we'll have another update on that in
the next earnings call.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: All right, thanks.

We'll move now to Ed Westlake with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: ...this year. Just on the CapEx comment you made, that about CapEx rolling over, that's,
presumably, mainly the Celtic operation that you flagged in analyst day?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: If you at look where we are on CapEx, I said we were in line with expectations but if you
kind of step back to the analyst meeting, we had said we would spend about $41 billion in total, we had about $3 billion
in there for the Celtic acquisition, so if you were look at what we showed you ex- acquisitions that would have been
about $38 billion. As we sit here through the third quarter, and we take Celtic and add in the Clyden acquisition, that's
about $4 billion, round numbers. If you take the $4 billion away from the $32.6 billion you're seeing year-to-date, that's
$28 billion and change, so I don't have another number for the end of the year but, you know, from what we can see,
we're going to be pretty close as we head through the fourth quarter and we're generally pleased with how we've been
able to manage such a large project load this year and keep that CapEx disciplined to bring these projects in on budget.
So, again, that's a large number, too close to call for the year-end, but we feel pretty good about where we're at.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: And just to switch to the downstream and chemicals, obviously, in the second quarter you
were still burdened with Singapore costs and you had, as you flagged, a lot of down time. When you think about the

third quarter operations as you look across the world, do you feel that that's a more normal kind of level of operations
that most of the turnaround and down time activity was not in that quarter so it was clean?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, when you look at – we step back to the second quarter, as we talked about on the last
call, significant down time, a lot of planned maintenance. Again, I'm happy to say that we came out of all of that very
successful on the turn-arounds and maintenance, concluded in a safe manner, and that's come out very well.
As we come into the – as we came through the third quarter, all of that equipment came back up fine, running well,
capacity utilizations doing well, so, you know, the third quarter is more of a kind of normal quarter, I guess if you were
looking from that perspective. We have some minor turnarounds, as we always do, coming up, but nothing specific. So,
you know, as we look into the third quarter and as you saw from our earnings charts, you know, the margin hit was big,
but the volume mix effects reflecting the turnarounds coming off and excellent operations, you know, boosted back, we
took what the market had on offer in terms of margins and were able to take that to the bottom line.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Maybe one final one, just on the sort of restructuring in the downstream obviously you've
already taken some moves to improve the competitiveness of the refining assets relative to the market environment, but
any thoughts about perhaps being more aggressive here given some of the trends in terms of capacity adds and gasoline
margins globally that we're seeing?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, I wouldn't want to give any guidance on – specifically on that program. We did, as
you point out, have a very successful multi-year program on some asset restructurings and some asset divestitures –
excuse me – in the downstream particularly during an up cycle in the business so we certainly brought a lot of value
home to the shareholder. Going forward, no big change in approach. You know, we're always looking at all of our
assets, we're always talking to people, people are approaching us and so we'll see how that goes. So no change, more
aggressive, less aggressive, just optimizing the business and bringing the value home whenever we have the
opportunity to do so.
<Q - Ed G. Westlake>: Thanks, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: All right, thank you.

We'll move now to Paul Sankey with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Hi, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: David, reading between the lines, are we saying that 2013 is a peak year for CapEx?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: If you look at the chart that we showed in March, it would indicate that this was a peak
year. You know, and, again, I really don't have a change to that, our expectation is what we've seen, which is the
upstream CapEx would trend down as some of these projects come on and other ones continue to spend. As we
mentioned, we still believe we have some nice investment opportunities in both the downstream and chemical, in
particular in chemical we've talked about a major expansion opportunity potentially in the gulf coast with a new steam
cracker and some polyethylene lines. We're expanding the specialties business elsewhere around the world. So those
investments still look good. We do have some nice investment opportunities in the downstream that still look attractive.
So I really don't have any different signal or any different fundamental change in the opportunity set than what we've
talked about this year. Of course we'll update that in March, but as of now, I don't see any change to what we've talked
about before.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Which would imply that it would be a peak year for CapEx. I guess the risks there, as you've
highlighted, is actually non-operated which is obviously the Gorgon Project.

<A - David S. Rosenthal>: We do not have an update on the Gorgon Project and, obviously, it would be appropriate to
defer to the operator for that kind of update but, you know, we don't have an update on that project as of today.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: And speaking of non-operated, could you – I think you may have done this, but could you just
remind us what the contribution of Kashagan was in Q3 and what you anticipate it will be in Q4?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, the – it was fairly small across the quarter. I don't have that exact number, I mean,
you know, it came online, it got up to 80,000 barrels a day and went down. Looking into the fourth quarter, Paul, I
really don't have any kind of an outlook or estimate for you. The operator is currently evaluating and inspecting the gas
line and trying to get to the root cause of what happened there and until we know that, it's hard to give an outlook.
You know, it – we just have to wait and see and find out what remediation, if anything, is necessary and how long that
might take. But as you would expect, that investigation and evaluation is ongoing as we speak. But we will stay shut-in
until it's complete and I just don't have any better outlook than that.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Understood, Dave. And then finally could you just remind us – I think what you said here was
that your debt levels in the quarter rose – net debt rose but you maintained your buyback. So, in other words, you're
now increasing debt in order to buy in shares, is that a fair statement?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I would separate those two things, you know, the share buyback is reflective of how things
are going in the quarter and looking ahead at the business and our cash needs and cash avails. The debt is simply
managing the capital structure on the balance sheet. We're kind of up, as I mentioned, to levels that we were a couple of
years ago, but still fairly conservative, a lot of flexibility as we like to keep on the balance sheet. I think our
debt-to-equity ratios and some of the other metrics that people look at on the balance sheet are all, you know, pretty
much within where we've been kind of historically coming out of the low period we had, as I mentioned, in 2011 and
2012. So, no real change in either approach or any other outlooks to offer in that regard.
<Q - Paul B. Sankey>: Okay, thanks, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure, thank you, Paul.

Our next question comes from Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.
<Q - Blake M. Fernandez>: Hey, David, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. We've covered CapEx pretty
well, so I was just going to see if we could maybe shift it over to divestitures. This may be a better question for the
analyst day. Some of your peers, in Europe, especially, have definitely gone into a mode of more aggressively divesting
assets. It seems like Exxon, in particular, would certainly have quite a host of opportunities there. Are there any
thoughts to maybe take advantage of that in the marketplace?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Well, you know, I think – the first thought I'd have is we don't ever announce in advance
what our divestiture plans are. Over time we think we get a little better value in the market if we don't announce in
advance what it is we're planning to do. And I really can't, again, forecast any particular outlook in terms of the
divestiture program.
As we talked about in the past some of the divestitures you've seen in the last few years have been strategic or initiated
from our standpoint but several of our divestitures have actually been buyers seeking our assets out, because in their
portfolio they viewed them as having more value than we valued them in our portfolio and so when you have that type
of a situation, it's very beneficial to make a transaction and we're always looking at that and we're always talking to
people. But, again, no change in our approach in any of our businesses or across the asset management program in
general.
You did see us with about, as I recall, $20 billion over the last two years, 2011 and 2012 in cash flow from asset sales,
several billion dollars in earnings, so that program was very successful. This has been a down year so far on that, but

again, it's not because we made any strategic decision or decided to change a program, it's just, again, always
optimizing the portfolio and taking advantage of the opportunities that the market presents us.
<Q - Blake M. Fernandez>: Okay, fair enough. The second question, David is on LNG. I didn't see any comments on
the slides on where you stand with regard to the LNG export facility in the U.S., could you just give us an update there,
please?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, I'd be – there's been no major change. We continue to look at that project and do
what we can while we're waiting for approval of our non-free-trade agreement permit that is pending with the
government and we're hopeful we'll get that permit approved soon. In the meantime, we continue to look at the project
and, again, develop what we can, pending the permit. So still looks like a very good opportunity for the company and
certainly a good opportunity for the economy and trade and we're anxious to get after that project as soon as possible.

We'll go now to Jason Gammel with Macquarie.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: Hi, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Hey. Hi, Jason. How are you?
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: Good, thank you. I just want to ask a few questions. Thank you for the detail, first of all, on
the project schedule, we always want more than you give us, I guess we have a healthy appetite. I was helping that you
might be able to first of all, discuss any commercial arrangements for the natural gas at Sakhalin, given the expansions
that you're going through there?
And also just within the gas business if you could talk about the potential for train three at PNG and what the process
will be leading up to that decision?
And then, finally, there has been a little more discussion on the monetization of Alaskan natural gas. Can you talk
about maybe what your intents would be on the Point Thomson lease?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure, Jason. That's – you've kind of hit all – a big piece of our opportunity set out there and
it is pretty broad. We have a lot of opportunities in a number of places around the world.
If I take them in order, while I can't ever discuss commercial arrangements or commercial negotiations that might be
ongoing in the business, I will say, as we look at Sakhalin gas and the gas resources that we have there, we are looking
at a potential LNG facility with Rosneft on Sakhalin Island. We're looking at some locations under consideration and
progressing the evaluation of that project and working on it pretty steadily here. So that's one opportunity that's
certainly out there. We have a very nice gas resource in the area, and finding a way to monetize that would continue to
make what's already a very attractive project even more so, so we're looking forward to working on that.
If we flip over to the Papua New Guinea plant, as I mentioned, that project is coming along very well, we're very
pleased with the progress, heading towards a startup next year. We are and continue to look at the potential for adding a
third train. We have space to do that there, a lot of opportunities. One, of course, is the discussions that are ongoing
with InterOil. I know it was in the press recently that our exclusivity period had ended, and that was correct, but we are
still discussing. We still have negotiations ongoing, and we'll just have to see how that bears out.
We also, in the area, have a pretty good opportunity set in terms of exploration, and we have had some success there
recently and we continue to evaluate that opportunity, so that's still a possibility. And, of course, adding a train to an
existing site is usually a pretty robust investment opportunity, so we'll continue to pursue that.

When we look at the potential of LNG exports out of Alaska, we did complete, in the third quarter, our summer field
surveys on the northern portion of the proposed pipeline route, which, of course, is the first field work required for
permitting, so we did a lot of work during the summer to analyze and particularly environmental conditions among
other items. So we continue to progress that on the project side. That is a – that would be a very, very large project, of
literally unprecedented scale and complexity. So it's going to be very important to have a good fiscal, sound fiscal and
stable fiscal regime there, and that will be one of the items necessary, of course, to continue to progress that project, but
it does move along. The Point Thomson project is also moving along. So that opportunity is still there.
I think what's really interesting, I think if you take a step back and look at some of the questions we've had today on
LNG, you really get a sense for the really rich opportunity set we have around the world for potential monetization of
our gas resources, particularly via LNG, mentioned the Sakhalin project, we've had great exploration success so far in
Tanzania. We have the Gulf Coast project that we're anxious to progress. We continue to evaluate the potential for
LNG exports out of British Columbia. And then we mentioned Alaska, and we have other opportunities. So it's nice to
have a real rich opportunity set that's geographically diverse, and we're spending, as you would expect, a lot of time
working on all of those and looking at which ones are ready and what order to bring forward for commercialization, but
it's great to have that portfolio and the ability to take a nice long-term view of monetizing those natural gas resources
we have around the world.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: Thanks for that very thorough answer, David. Maybe just a very quick follow-up, is the [ph]
Pinyang field (51:49) still a possibility for underpinning a Train 3 at PNG?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: That's one nice discovery that we've had. I wouldn't want to take it any further than that,
other than it is one of many opportunities that we have in the area and we're still evaluating that, to answer the question
that you've asked, while we consider other exploration potential in the area. I think the good news is the base project's
doing well, opportunities for expansion exist, and we have a couple of different opportunities we can pursue to effect
that expansion in due course, so more to come on Papua New Guinea in the future.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: Great. Thanks, David.

We'll move now to Asit Sen with Cowen & Company.
<Q - Asit K. Sen>: Good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Hey, good morning. How are you doing?
<Q - Asit K. Sen>: Good, good. Two quick questions. First on just following back on the PNG energy project. Looks
like the timeline has improved just slightly. Could you talk about the critical steps ahead before the first LNG sales take
place next year? You mentioned that you started commissioning the LNG plant, how long does that take and what does
the drilling program look like?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure. It's a little early to talk about a different startup timeline other than to say, you know,
we're still looking at the second half of next year. A lot to do. We're very far along. I did mention we started some
commissioning, feeding some gas into the plant for testing and making sure things are working. It's a very complex
project. Not just down at the LNG plant side, but up in the highlands. So there's still a lot of kit to put together and test.
But, again, all of that is ongoing. We're finishing up the pipeline. Drilling is continuing. We've had success and things
are going well as we did the initial drill pad and moved over to the second one. So I think as the months go by we'll be
able to give a little better update on the exact timing, but for now I would say everything is certainly on schedule and
going per the plan.
<Q - Asit K. Sen>: Thanks. And a quick unrelated follow-up. U.S. Chemicals looks like very nice numbers. What
percent of your U.S. business is specialty versus commodity? Could you provide any guidance on that?

<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, if we're looking at the split in the U.S. on commodities versus specialties, we're a
little higher, obviously, on the commodity side because of our big steam cracking operations, but the specialty business,
again, as well, but without giving a specific number in the U.S. alone, we're more heavily weighted to the commodity
side of the business than the specialty.

We'll move now to Faisel Khan with Citi.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Good morning, David.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Faisel. How are you?
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: All right. How are you doing?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I'm great. Thanks you.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay, thank you. Could you – I appreciate the detail on the unconventional resources in the
U.S. on production. But could you give me more color on if I look at the total liquids production in the U.S. of roughly
423,000 barrels a day, how much of that is really coming from kind of shale oil and shale liquids? It sounds like your
Permian production is mostly geared towards conventional and CO2 floodings, so it's not really at that level that where
you're producing anything from shale oil or tight oil.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Faisel, I don't have a specific breakdown just in the U.S. on conventional versus
unconventional. Certainly, as you said, in the Permian, the big uptick we've seen recently has been on the conventional
side with a lot of work going on in the unconventional and so whereas, you know, if you look at the absolute
production levels, more of it's coming from conventional than unconventional.
But certainly as we go forward, the conventional will continue to decline and even though I mentioned some of the
steps we're taking to stem that, we do see decline in Alaska and et cetera but the real key for the U.S. is we are just
really getting started on the unconventional side and, as I've mentioned before we've spent a lot of time the last couple
years evaluating what we've had, doing a lot of testing, a lot of technology work, a lot of research work, and that's why
I pointed out now you're really starting to see wells coming on, not for evaluation and delineation but to sell so we can
start ringing the cash register from these investments and you're starting to see that uptick.
So, although the absolute split, you know, you haven't really seen a huge change there. The growth is coming along as
we expected and we're very pleased with the progress, but I have to say it's not just the unconventional, we're happy
with what we've got going on in the Permian and some other areas to stem decline, base decline and do some things to
grow those very profitable barrels for us.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay and then along the same lines then, if you're starting to scratch the surface now, finally,
you know, finally monetize all this acreage that you've accumulated over the last few years or several years, I should
say, but what's your – in terms of your total rig count in the U.S, what is it and how much of it is dedicated, to, you
know, to oil and liquids?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I think our current rig count is just over 40 rigs. I think we averaged about 45 in the
quarter, and I think we're currently at about 41. In terms of where those rigs are drilling, just about all of them are
drilling liquids, liquids areas.
We have very, very few gas rigs running, only where, you know, we have an opportunity for a nice return on them. But
if you think about our three core areas, the Bakken and the Ardmore and the Permian, those are where the wells are
drilling, that's where we're seeing not only the increase in production, but very pleased with the progress we're making
on operating expense reduction, productivity of the wells, CapEx efficiency, and all of that, as you know, helps on unit

profitability in the portfolio as well as cash flow generation.
So if you think about those three core areas, you're really starting to see the benefit of the time we spent evaluating
those areas, understanding what we had, quietly adding acreage to our positions, which are now quite large in all of
those areas, so business is doing well and certainly a potential growth area for us that we're exploiting in due course.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: And last question from me, David. On the Bakken, if you could just give us what your average
well costs have been over the last quarter, just so that we can compare some of these efficiency gains you're talking
about versus what we're seeing with some of the other peers and competitors in the basin.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I understand the question. I really don't want to give out per-well costs and for a number of
reasons. One, for competitive purposes, but also at any particular point in time, what a well cost isn't near as important
as kind of what we're doing over the longer term period.
We did share some of that with you at the Analyst Meeting last year. We'll share some more at the upcoming Analyst
Meeting as we talk about, again, these productivity gains both from technology and approach and some of the
improvements we've seen there.
So, without giving a specific number, I can tell you that we are meeting or exceeding the expectations we had in this
area when we acquired XTO, and have added on to all of these properties, consolidated our acreage position, and now,
as I've said, really ramped up the activity there.

We'll move now to Roger Reed with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Good morning.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Roger.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: I guess, I mean, a lot of stuff has been already asked and answered but I just wanted to check
on a couple of things. Number one, as a follow-up to the last question on gas production – or production in the U.S. and
I guess specifically gas production, we've seen the expected slowing in the rate of decline. It doesn't sound like much of
that would have been due at this point to ramped up associated gas from some of the shale plays. So, is this just a
function of the decline rates are finally slowing enough and this will help that overall expectation of production growth
in 2014 and 2015 because you no longer have this drag, or is there something else going on here?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I'd say things are going exactly as we had anticipated. If you look at where we are, just, for
example, year-over-year in U.S. gas, we're down about 4% in the third quarter. And that's kind of in line with the
full-year look that we had in March. So, if I look across the year, things are going just as we had expected. You know,
you do see the impact of associated gases in there and it does offset some of the decline, but nothing going on any
different than what we expected coming into the year and, again, consistent with that full-year outlook that we gave
everyone in March. So, again, liquids up, U.S. gas down, have seen a benefit, as I mentioned over the year in some
European gas on demand, but things going pretty much as we anticipated.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay, thanks. And a follow-up question. Recently, the exploration expense had been moving
higher, and I know you can't predict when you'll drill a dry hole or successful well, but I was wondering does that
indicate a generally higher exploration spend overall as we're looking out?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I think if you look at total exploration expense from a programmatic standpoint over the
years, I wouldn't give any indication that it's any different than what we talked about in March. What you do see is
lumpiness in the actual booked exploration expense. We did have about $100 million higher exploration expense this

Our next question comes from John Herrlin with Societe Generale Investment.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Hi, Dave. Some quick unconventional questions.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: With the Vaca Muerta, you're going to drill four wells. Are you going to spud them more or
less sequentially and then frac them to see what you have?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yes, we'll do those sequentially. We've got a number of wells that we've drilled in the past
couple of years and they continue to be on test. We are starting our operated program and, yes, we will drill those
sequentially and then frac them, as you mentioned.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: And then, regarding your operated program, you don't have the same type of expenditure
commitments, correct, as one of your West Coast peers?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: When we look across our acreage, no, we don't – I wouldn't comment on other folks. But,
certainly, when we look at our 800,000 acres that we have down there, no, we do not have any significant committed
expenditures. We are continuing on the program of evaluating in due course, but we have a lot of flexibility in both the
pace and size of that program.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay, and last one for me. On the Permian you had eight drilling rigs. How much would be for
conventional activities and how much unconventional? And that's it. Thank you.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Oh, I don't have an exact split but I would tell you, generally, more doing conventional
than are doing unconventional.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay, great, thank you.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from Allen Good with Morningstar.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Good morning, Allen.
<Q - Allen Good>: Good morning, David. Just a few quick ones. First of all, on the Kearl volumes, can you give a
split between the amount or even the percentage that were run through Exxon refineries versus third party? And
long-term, is there a target as far as respect to integration with your downstream there with a certainly amount of Kearl
you'd like to run through your own facilities?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Sure, I'll start with the first part. Without an exact barrel split, the vast majority that we ran
in the third quarter we ran in our own refineries. Most of that went to our Joliet refinery in the Mid-Con area. We did
also get some down into the Gulf Coast to run at Baton Rouge and we ran some in Sarnia in Canada, so pretty good
dispersion there. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, all of the refineries experienced exactly what we were
expecting them to running that product, so again, a good demonstration of the technology.

Going forward, we will continue to expand the disposition of this crude in our other refineries. We'll probably run some
more down to the Gulf Coast into Baytown and then into our other Midwest refineries up in the Midwest, et cetera.
In terms of third party, we expect to expand that a little bit. I wouldn't mention the specific customers or give a target
rate other than one of the things that's really nice is we have the capability to take all of the crude into our refining
circuit. We have the pipelines in place to do so, but because of our integrated businesses and our unique supply
opportunities and coordination, we can place those barrels in third-party refineries where we actually get more value,
overall, by doing that and substituting other crudes into our refineries. And so, no target in any particular disposition,
just optimizing the value upgrade of those molecules across our circuit.
<Q - Allen Good>: Okay, great, thanks. And then, regarding some of your comments on the unconventional here in the
U.S. and saying we're sort of in the beginning phases of it, that seems to imply that you'll see increased capital moving
into the U.S. or lower 48 to exploit some of those opportunities. Is that assumption, one, correct, and two, is that largely
already built into some of the CapEx guidance that was given earlier this year?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I think if I take your second part of that question, all of that is built into the guidance that
we've given you. We are seeing a little better volumes than we'd expected coming in, which is good, but I wouldn't
have any specific guidance on lower 48 versus non-U.S. or in one particular type of resource development or the other,
other than to say we will direct CapEx to the areas where we get the most uplift. But, don't have an outlook any
different than what we've talked about in the last Analyst Meeting.
<Q - Allen Good>: Okay, thanks. Just one more quick one and this may be more of an Analyst Day question. Earlier
this year regarding unit profitability, there was obviously a variety of concerns and things that contributed to maybe the
lower earnings per barrel over the past couple years. I think one of those was unattractive commercial terms and
physical terms in some areas. Has there been any progress – and I'm sure you can't mention the specifics, if you can I'll
take them, but is there any progress with respect to commercial terms that may result in lower profitability per barrel
with respect to Exxon renegotiating terms, or even maybe trying to progress those assets and divest them longer term?
Or is that still sort of an issue that maybe has to be worked out over the longer term?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I'd say if I kind of wrap up each of those questions, one, it probably is a good question for
the next Analyst Day and we'll look forward to talking about that a little more. Having said that, I will say we have
progressed a number of initiatives across the year. I don't want to mention anything specifically, but we have
undertaken initiatives in a number of areas to improve unit profitability and to the extent we can be more specific at the
next Analyst Meeting we'll do so, but I do want to confirm that we are doing what we said we would do and we are
making progress in that regard.
<Q - Allen Good>: Okay, great, thanks.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Thank you.

We'll move now to Pavel Molchanov with Raymond James.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: Thanks for taking the question. In your U.S. downstream segment, can you talk about the
impact either in Q3 or year-to-date of having to purchase RINs [Renewable Identification Numbers]?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Yeah, if you step back and take a look at the RIN situation, it's not a huge impact on us.
We do generate the majority of our RINs by doing our own blending directly, so there's some minor impact, but not a
lot, financially, certainly nothing material in our results.
I think the more important thing in the whole discussion of the RINs is the issue of the blend wall and the industry
hitting that blend wall next year, and then, some of the things that could be done to alleviate that and we're certainly
supportive of those. But, if you're looking at just our third quarter results or year-to-date, the net impact of the RINs is

nothing that would show up as a material impact for us.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: Okay, appreciate it. And then just quickly, a lot of news flow recently, mostly bad,
frankly, from various shale gas opportunities in Europe, protests, political controversy, et cetera. You obviously have
acreage in a lot of those countries. Any comments on where you stand in the places where you still have acreage?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I think if you look at Europe, probably our biggest opportunity is in Germany where we do
have about 4 million acres prospective, unconventional resource opportunity. We continue to talk with the regulators
and the authorities in Germany about that opportunity and the prospectively of it and looking for an opportunity to
work on that and pilot some of that to see what we have. But, it's all about working closely with the communities, with
the regulators, with the policymakers so that we can all understand what the potential opportunities are and balance
those against the concerns.
So, outside of Germany, I probably wouldn't comment on any of the other European countries. But, it certainly is an
opportunity for us and potentially an opportunity for the country and one that we will continue to have dialogue on.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: All right, appreciate it.

We'll move now to Kate Minyard with JPMorgan.
<Q - Katherine L. Minyard>: Hi, David, thank you very much for taking my question.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Hi, Kate.
<Q - Katherine L. Minyard>: Hi. Just very quickly on going back to your answers on the Kearl project, you talked
about having the ability take all the volumes within the Exxon and Imperial system and you mentioned pipelines. Are
all the volumes moving via pipeline or are you moving any volumes by rail?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: No, all volumes coming out of the initial development are moving by pipeline.
<Q - Katherine L. Minyard>: Okay. Do you see the ability to accommodate – at what point do you need to start
moving via a mechanism other than pipelines? Or can you fully accommodate the expansion phases too, and also any
potential development for the further expansion at Cold Lake? And then, also, any potential future development of
Clyden?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: First, we talked about the Kearl expansion project, and as we look towards 2015 and
bringing that online we are looking at a number of logistical opportunities that we have, including pipeline routes and
certainly Keystone XL would be there for the industry in general.
But, as would be prudent, we are looking at other options, including evaluating a project to build a rail terminal in
Edmonton and then move some of that crude out of there into the lower 48 by rail. And we're in the process of
evaluating that opportunity and we'll have more to say on that in the future. But, certainly, as the Kearl expansion
project comes on, I mentioned the Nabiye project in Cold Lake, a lot of volumes to find disposition for. And, again, as I
think I mentioned earlier, we're very fortunate in that we have a very good logistics optimization opportunity and
network and a lot of avenues for us. But, we are actively working on all of the alternatives that are available to us to
move that crude into market and get the maximum value for those molecules.
In regards to Clyden, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, a very nice resource opportunity for us. It does sit near an
in-situ opportunity Imperial already has, so we're working together to take a look at all of that. I don't have an update
for you in terms of project timing or any of that just yet but we are evaluating that and looking at what we might want
to do in terms of development plans and timing, so more to come on that later.

<Q - Katherine L. Minyard>: Okay, thank you. And then just switching a little bit over to West Africa, can we get a
status update, maybe on the deep water satellites in Angola? You know, kind of timing and specifically whether you're
kind of actively drilling there right now or do you have a rig engaged?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: If we look at the satellite projects, both in Nigeria and Angola, I'll start with Nigeria first,
you know, that project is on and ramping up, the Angola satellites project also progressing per the plan. I can't give you
a specific answer in terms of, you know, a drill rig running or any of that sort of thing but I would say as we look at
these satellite opportunities, again to tie into existing facilities, those investments and projects are quite attractive and
they're coming along and ramping up as planned.

We'll move to Paul Cheng with Barclays.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Hey, guys.
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Hey, Paul. How are you today?
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Very good. Just one very quick one. Qatar, I think, several years ago, RasGas, your joint
venture between you and Qatar Petroleum did have a bond offering and they had their prospectus. In there it seems to
suggest that the local tax holiday for the RasGas six and seven will be expiring probably in 2014-2015. Can you give us
some idea that if indeed that that's the case, what in the financial impact both in earning and cash flow may look like?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: Paul, if we look at Qatar, all the various trains that we have on that have come on over the
years, they have their own unique fiscal terms and I wouldn't comment specifically on any of the terms, on any of the
trains, other than to say, you know, as -- as we move out into the future, there's nothing material in terms of our results,
no significant impact that we would see, but in terms of talking about the specific terms of those contracts, it just
wouldn't be appropriate for me to comment on them.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Okay. Final one, on Alaska, I think both your partner, Conoco and BP in the North Slope that
indicate with the tax law change, they're going to increase their spending there. Are you guys also aligned with them
that you're going to increase your spending in Alaska?
<A - David S. Rosenthal>: I think there are a number of opportunities for us in Alaska but I wouldn't comment
specifically on any specific plan to ramp up CapEx or to progress anything any faster than what we already have in the
plan, but, of course, anytime, you know, the fiscals improve, projects on the margin by definition become attractive or
more attractive and get reevaluated. But other than that, I really wouldn't have a specific comment relative to Alaska.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: All right. All right, thank you.
