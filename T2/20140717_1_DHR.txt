H. Lawrence Culp
Matt, thanks, and good morning, everyone. Our team executed well in a modest growth environment in the second
quarter. Core revenues increased 3% and were largely consistent with what we have seen over the last 12 months.
Geographically, high-growth markets led the way again as we saw continued strength in China and Latin America. The
developed markets were up low single-digits, with growth in the U.S. as anticipated and Western Europe slightly below
our expectations.
During the quarter, the Danaher Business System helped many of our businesses accelerate new product introductions
and enhance our sales and marketing team's effectiveness. These efforts combined with go-to-market initiatives in
high-growth markets drove share gains at Hach, ChemTreat, Implant Direct, Leica Biosystems, AB SCIEX and
Radiometer.
On the capital allocation front, we have been encouraged by the increase in our acquisition activity. Since the beginning
of April, we have announced or closed 10 acquisitions totaling over $1 billion, including four deals greater than $100
million each. These acquisitions will strengthen our existing businesses in the Environmental, Dental and Life Sciences
and Diagnostics segments. Just last night, as many of you may have seen, we announced Beckman Coulter's pending
acquisition of Siemens Clinical Microbiology business, a leader in automated diagnostic solutions that help healthcare
providers identify infection-causing bacteria and determine the best course of treatment. This transaction is our largest
in over two years. With our robust balance sheet and a healthy acquisition funnel, we remain confident in our ability to
deploy our more than $8 billion of M&A capacity. So with that as a backdrop, let me move to the details of the quarter.
Today we reported another record second quarter for Danaher. Diluted net earnings per share were up 9% to $0.95.
Revenues grew 5% to $5 billion, while core revenues were up 3%. The impact of acquisitions increased revenues by
1.5%, while currency translation had a positive impact of 0.5%. Our second quarter gross margin expanded to an
all-time high of 52.8%. With this increase in gross profit and our continued G&A leverage, we were able to boost our
investments in sales and marketing and R&D by approximately $85 million while improving core operating margins by
45 basis points. DBS helped us deliver strong cash flow performance. Our operating cash flow was $1 billion, and free
cash was $844 million. Our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio for the quarter was 125%.
Turning to the five operating segments, Test & Measurement revenues were flat, while core revenues declined 2%.
Reported operating margin contracted 250 basis points to 18.4%, and core operating margin decreased 155 basis points
primarily due to the decline in our high gross margin Communications platform. Our Instruments platform core
revenues were flat for the quarter.
At Fluke, core revenues increased at a low single-digit rate, marking the third consecutive quarter of positive core
growth for the team. Orders grew mid single-digits, with solid point of sales demand in North America and China.

During the quarter, we launched Fluke Connect, our collection of 40 wireless-enabled test tools that allow technicians
to analyze, share, and store data online and in the cloud. We also introduced several new thermography products
including the Ti90 and Ti95 thermal imagers. These imagers feature higher resolution than other entry-level models
and come standard with Fluke Connect. Orders for both Fluke Connect and the Ti90 and Ti95 imagers have already
exceeded our expectations.
Tektronix core revenues declined low single-digits, as modest growth in the U.S., military, and government sales was
offset by weak demand for our video products and a decline in technology spending in Asia. We were encouraged,
however, by our order growth during the quarter, which was positive for the first time since 2011.
Core revenues in our Communications platform decreased at a low double-digit rate as a decline in network monitoring
more than offset growth in network security solutions and installation tools. As expected, our network monitoring
business was adversely affected by delays in wireless carrier spending, which we now believe will also result in
negative growth for the platform for the rest of the year.
At Arbor, demand for our network security solutions remained strong with orders increasing more than 20%. Arbor is
recognized as a leading securities solutions vendor among both enterprise and service providers and was named Best
Overall IT Company in the 2014 Hot Companies and Best Products Awards in June.
Environmental revenues increased 6%, with core revenues up 3.5%. Core operating margin expanded 40 basis points,
while reported operating margin decreased 60 basis points to 21%, primarily due to the dilutive effect of recent
acquisitions. Our Water Quality platform core revenues grew at a mid single-digit rate, led by strong demand for our
analytical instruments and chemical treatment solutions.
Hach had another solid quarter with high single-digit growth in China and healthy municipal spending in both the U.S.
and Europe. Hach's investment in digital marketing and online distribution hit a major milestone this quarter, as our
U.S. website generated $1 million in weekly sales for the first time ever.
At ChemTreat, we saw robust demand for our chemical solutions in both North America and Latin America. You may
recall from our Analyst Meeting in December that ChemTreat is focused on expanding in Latin America and has
increased sales in the region four fold over the last four years. During the quarter ChemTreat acquired Chile-based
Aquafine, a leader in industrial water treatment instruments and services, which will further accelerate our growth by
expanding our localized product offerings in South America.
Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues grew low single-digits, led by healthy demand for vapor recovery products in
China and point of sales solutions globally. Also contributing to the strength was Insite360, our cloud-based platform
that allows retailers to remotely control their retail automation and environmental monitoring systems across multiple
sites, from any PC or mobile device in real time. Customer reception has exceeded our expectations with more than 100
retailers adopting Insite360 in June alone.
During the quarter, GVR completed the acquisition of ANGI Energy Systems, an innovator in compressed natural gas
fueling design and engineering. Compressed natural gas alternative energy solutions are being rapidly adopted,
particularly in the truck-stop market, and we believe ANGI will be able to take advantage of Gilbarco Veeder-Root's
leading presence in that space.
In Life Sciences and Diagnostics, we had an excellent quarter with top-line growth and operating margin expansion.
Revenues for the quarter were up 7%, while core revenues grew 5%. We also increased our investments in sales and
marketing and R&D nearly 10%, while still expanding operating margins by 145 basis points. The Diagnostics
platform continued its solid performance with mid single-digit core revenue growth. At Beckman Coulter, core sales
grew at a mid single-digit rate with double-digit growth in immunoassay and urinalysis. Geographically, high growth
market demand remains strong led by mid-teens growth in China, while the developed markets grew at a low
single-digit rate.
Importantly, the U.S. was up low single digits, marking our first quarter of growth in the U.S. since the acquisition. We
believe our higher customer win and retention rates in the U.S. and around the globe are the result of our team's

dedication to regulatory compliance, better service, reliable quality and on-time delivery. The team has also made
significant progress driving efficiencies, improving operating margins by over 150 basis points year over year to their
highest level since the acquisition.
Additionally, Beckman Coulter's first major bolt-on acquisition, IRIS, which closed in October 2012, delivered
double-digit growth and expanded operating margins over 1,000 basis points in the quarter. So, we were very excited
last night to announce Beckman's second sizable bolt-on acquisition of Siemens' clinical microbiology business.
Siemens microbiology produces highly accurate, automated instruments and consumables that help hospital and
research laboratories identify infection-causing bacteria and determine appropriate antibiotic treatments.
Notably, these solutions are capable of detecting a bacteria's resistance to specific drugs helping doctors to proactively
plan the best treatments for their patients. With over $200 million in revenue, this acquisition represents an attractive
opportunity for Beckman and the rest of the diagnostics platform and will expand our already strong presence in both
hospitals and reference labs. We believe the Danaher Business System will help Siemens microbiology enhance its
workflow automation solutions and develop go-to market collaboration strategies with our other diagnostics businesses.
This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory approvals and is expected to close in
early 2015.
Radiometer's core revenues grew high single digits with growth in all major product lines. AQT sales were particularly
strong increasing over 40% in the quarter. At the EPG conference in May, we highlighted the many ways in which our
platforms harness their scale to enhance growth and augment individual operating company strengths. Within
Diagnostics, we have seen terrific results from this collaboration as Radiometer utilized Beckman Coulter's commercial
capabilities in Turkey, South America and the United Kingdom to secure large project orders.
At Leica Biosystems, sales increased at a mid-single digit rate led by high-teens growth in the high growth markets.
Advanced staining grew mid-single digits as our increasing installed base of bond instruments drove solid consumables
growth. Aperio, our ePathology business grew double digits as doctors increasingly look to provide more accurate,
more secure cancer diagnostics for their patients. Our digital workflow solutions facilitate global collaboration between
doctors and other experts simplifying the process of developing precise diagnoses and treatment plans.
Our Life Sciences platform core revenues increased at a mid-single digit rate. AB SCIEX's core revenues were up high
single digits driven by strength in the academic and applied markets in both North America and Europe. We believe our
investments in new products has helped increase our market share over the past several quarters.
At the American Society of Mass Spectrometry meeting in June, we launched several innovative new products
including the TripleTOF 6600 and the 3500 Triple Quad. The 6600 enables scientists to obtain results ten times faster
than traditional methods. In combination with our SWATH Acquisition 2.0 software, it is the only system on the
market that provides a complete workflow solution for proteomics research. The 3500 is an easy-to-use solution that
provides laboratories a reliable and accurate way to ensure food safety and environmental compliance. With the
introduction of these products, we were able to meet the needs of researchers across a broader spectrum of disciplines,
experience levels and price points.
Leica Microsystems' core revenues were up low single digits with strength in North America, Western Europe and
Latin America. Sales of our confocal microscopy products increased over 20% in the quarter led by robust demand for
our flagship SP8 product line.
Turning to Dental, segment revenues grew 2.5% with core revenues up 2%. Core operating margin declined 55 basis
points while reported operating margin decreased 50 basis points to 14.8% due to both weak consumable sales and our
continued investments in new product development and commercialization in high growth markets. Through the first
half of the year, our core operating margin in Dental increased 50 basis points.
Over the last decade, our Dental platform has evolved from a collection of individual businesses to a unified group of
market leading equipment, consumables and specialty brands. At last month's Analyst Day in California, the team did
an outstanding job highlighting that evolution as well as KaVo Kerr Group's unique position within the dental industry
and how we use DBS to drive growth and innovation. For those of you unable to participate, I encourage you to watch

the replay which is available on our website.
Dental Consumables core revenues grew low single digits as robust growth in our implant business augmented modest
increases in our other businesses. During the quarter, we acquired DUX, a leader in restorative and infection control
consumables. DUX nicely complements Kerr's portfolio and broadens our range of offerings to general practitioners,
dental specialists and hygienists. We also expanded our presence in high growth markets with the acquisition of Reinor
Ortho, one of Ormco's longstanding South African distributors.
Dental Technologies core revenues increased low single-digits driven by healthy demand in high growth markets,
particularly China, which grew more than 25%. Our expansive range of imaging products delivered excellent results
growing mid single-digits in the quarter. Notably our focus on innovation in imaging has helped us build a growing
install base of more than 6,000 3D imaging units.
In addition at our Analyst Day, we discussed publicly for the first time another element of our digital dentistry
roadmap, our chair side computer-aided design and milling solution. This digital system will enable dentists to custom
design and manufacture crowns, fillings, and custom implant abutments in their offices in just minutes, significantly
reducing the amount of doctor time and patient office visits required to complete a dental prosthetic procedure. This is a
great example of how the KaVo Kerr group works together to meet customer needs as it will use Ormco's Lythos
digital impression system, eye catch treatment planning software, and KaVo's ARTICA milling machine.
Turning to Industrial Technologies, revenues increased 5.5% while core revenues were up 3.5%. Core operating margin
expanded 45 basis points while reported operating margin increased 30 basis points to 23.8%. Motion platform core
revenues increased at a low single-digit rate led by project wins in the high growth markets. This marks the first quarter
of growth for the platform since the fourth quarter of 2012. With our transition out of lower margin businesses largely
complete, Motion is now more profitable and better positioned for future growth.
Core revenues from our Product Identification platform were up low single digits, a solid growth in our inline variable
printing and packaging solutions globally was partially offset by a decline in our Laser Marking business.
Videojet grew to mid single-digit rate led by healthy demand for equipment and consumables in Europe and the high
growth markets. During the quarter we expanded our coating application offerings with the launch of the 9550
print-and-apply labeler. This product's breakthrough design controls a label from printing to placement, eliminating
everyday operational problems such as label jams, mechanical adjustments, worn out parts and failure points.
Esko continues to strengthen its leading position in packaging workflow solutions with sales increasing mid
single-digits. In May, Procter & Gamble chose Esko as an official strategic partner to provide hosting and
implementation of our Automation Engine and WebCenter solutions. Automation Engine and WebCenter combine to
provide a powerful web-based platform that helps brand owners and print professionals manage all aspects of the
packaging design workflow.
Also during the quarter, we hosted the highly successful Esko World Conference where over 400 customers
participated in 70 workshops on topics ranging from brand management to 3D package design.
So to wrap up, our team executed well in a modest growth environment delivering top line performance consistent with
the past four quarters. The Danaher Business System continues to help us as we invest in growth, drive share gains,
expand margins, and improve free cash flow. We believe our robust balance sheet, continued focus on organic growth
opportunities, and confidence on the acquisition front will drive solid performance in the second half of 2014 and
beyond.
So today we are initiating third quarter GAAP diluted net earnings per share guidance of $0.86 to $0.89, which assumes
core growth comparable with the growth rate seen in the first half of 2014. We are also narrowing our GAAP diluted
net earnings per share guidance for the full year to $3.67 to $3.72 from the previous range of $3.60 to $3.75.

Thanks, Larry. That concludes our formal comments. Tina, we're now ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first one from Scott Davis with Barclays.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Good morning, Scott.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: I'm trying to get my arms around the margin numbers, and you mentioned dilution from deals a
number of times, but it didn't seem like there's a lot of deals or at least – there's a few at least material deals. I guess my
question is why weren't the restructuring actions of kind of a year ago plus DBS and such able to offset the dilution
from the deals? And maybe just some granularity into when you think about the margin movement, what part of that
was deal dilution and what part of it was mix or anything else that might have impacted?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Scott, I would say that on balance, we were actually pretty pleased with the performance in
light of the volume. As you see here with core up at 3%, it camouflaged a little bit some of the stronger performance
we saw in three of the five segments. And we had some real standout businesses with water, certainly diagnostics, very
pleased with Beckman, Life Sciences, Videojet. It's a pretty healthy list there. And I think on balance having three to
five segments up 40 basis points in terms of the operating margin expansion, and particularly with LS&D, Life
Sciences & Diagnostics up nearly 150 basis points, a lot to attribute there to DBS, the restructuring you alluded to and
the like.
I think the long and the short of it is we've kind of looked at. I don't mean to suggest that we're in any way content here.
We had two businesses with high variable margins that finished softly, far softer than we would have anticipated there
in June. We saw some softness in the U.S. in dental consumable sellout. That in turn impacted our June there at Kerr
particularly.
But mainly, and I think this is the big issue, is that Tektronix Communications, the big carriers were soft here in the
quarter, far softer than we thought, and we have particularly high variable margins there. Fortunately Arbor and Fluke
Networks, our security and enterprise businesses were actually pretty good in the quarter, but it was really isolated in
that regard. And when we have that sort of revenue with those sorts of margins breaking away from us late in the game,
it doesn't help on the top, but it really does hurt the bottom all in.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: And second, regarding the acquisition, we talked last year, we had about $100 million of
restructuring spend generating about $20 million a quarter of savings, but we had approximately $20 million of
acquisition expense in the quarter. A lot of that's non cash. You've seen an increase in the number of deals. And from a
GAAP perspective, not from a cash flow perspective, we're feeling the impact of that on the margin.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Yes. Okay, that's really helpful. And then as a follow up, when you think about 3Q guidance,
I'm not surprised you're being conservative, but at the same notion, when you think about Life Sciences & Diagnostics
being kind of back in the game, core growth 5% good. And that seems – I'm guessing that's somewhat sustainable for
the rest of this year. And then you made some positive comments about the order rates, particularly in Fluke. And then
your comps are still pretty easy next quarter. Why wouldn't core growth accelerate sequentially from here?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Well, I think that as we look at the third, I think both from a geographic perspective, Scott,
and from a segment or platform perspective, what we saw in the second right now is probably what we're going to see
in the third, which is why we're kind of embracing that first half core performance as a good guide here for the third.
From a geographic perspective, we saw a little bit of a tail-off in June. I would say it was modest, but it was broad
based. So we've got a watchful eye there. Clearly, the U.S. it was a bit of an offset there both in terms of what we saw
and I think some of the macro data out there. But net-net the developed markets are probably where they've been.

I think some of our team are probably a bit optimistic in the high-growth markets as we go into the third quarter. Brazil
has got some of the noise relative to World Cup behind it, the India election, all of that. I don't think we're banking a lot
on any sort of uptick there. I don't know if that's conservative. I suspect that's just being pragmatic. So we get that core
there in line with the first half. We get similar margin performance in part because the Tek Comms dynamics is going
to be with us through the second half. It's probably going to cost us a couple of pennies a quarter as a result. We're
going to work hard to offset that. We're not happy with it. But it is what it is. And I think when you put all that together
you get the formal guide that we're offering this morning.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. Hopefully you're conservative. Thanks, guys. Good luck.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Thanks, Scott.
Operator
We'll take our next question from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Good morning, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: So just – obviously you commented on the Test & Measurement weakness, and it's been weakness in
the third year of soft to no growth. And I'm just wondering now if you can give some perspective on how much of this
is structural and how much confidence do you have that these businesses can return to an acceptable rate of growth
going forward?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Yes, well, I think you have to break it down by business, Nigel. And I realize at a high level
maybe some of the details don't matter so much. But at the operating level, I think we're very encouraged by what we're
seeing at Fluke. Three quarters in a row here of growth is certainly something we can all, I think, appreciate. I think
what we're particularly encouraged by is the combination of the new products. And Fluke Connect, I think, is a game
changer for them, but also the improved commercial execution around the world. I'm not sure that Fluke's ever going to
be our highest growth business. But can they be a consistent low- to mid-single digit grower for us, more so than we've
seen the last couple years? I believe so. And I think they're building momentum here very much in that direction.
I think Tek, as we've talked many times, has a different end market set of drivers there. Technology spending broadly,
including spending on the bench, has been muted the last several years, far more than we would have anticipated. But
there again, I think the order book's firming up, having first positive quarter in years there. Hopefully it's a beginning of
a trend. I think Fluke will in all likelihood outperform Tek in the near- to medium-term, and that's, I think, as straight as
we can call it.
I think within comms, we've been very fortunate to be part of the mobile network build out at Tek Comms. It's been a
mid- to high-single digit grower for us, double digits in many quarters, and what we're seeing right now is a delay,
broadly, with a number of those same customers, which we think is more timing than anything else. But it's clearly
going to put pressure on us as it did in the second quarter and the second half. I think we continue to be bullish about
that business long-term, and it's a business that's well complemented at the platform level by both what we do in
security with Arbor and what Fluke Networks does with the enterprise customers.
So three different stories, if you will. I think on balance, still good ones, but we need to build on the momentum at
Fluke and Tek to have a better second half to help offset some of this pressure we know we're going to see at Tek
Comms particularly in the second half.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay, good. That's really helpful, Larry. And just to clarify, you talked very clearly about the
pressure and the mantra is going to keep comms negative for the back half of the year. I just want to clarify if that was
comms, not the wider T&M segments?

<A - Daniel L. Comas>: That's correct. We expect our comms platform, which was down double-digit in the second
quarter, it could be down high-single digit, double-digit in the second quarter. We expect instruments to get a little
better. So we don't – we printed down a couple points here. I think we'll do a little bit better than that, but probably not
much.

We'll take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Hey. Good morning.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Just on the third quarter guidance, is there something that's getting unusually kind of weaker
there? Is there anything other than the kind of the tail-offs and maybe in June you said it was kind of broad based?
Maybe if you could just put a little more color around that, you know, that tail-off. Because, I mean, if I'm doing the
low end of the range gets you to actually below 24% of your year modestly below that, I haven't seen that from you
guys in the last couple of years. And so just the straight math on the seasonality would suggest something that's a few
pennies higher than what you guys have put out there. So is there something seasonally – even adjusted for the $0.02
from this quarter – is something seasonally there that's weaker than expected?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Well, Steve, one of the things impacting the guidance in Q3 is the $1 billion of acquisitions
that we've announced to close in the last four months. As you know, when we did the SCIEX deal, which was about
that size, we called out all the one-time stuff, which was pretty significant when it got to a $1 billion. We're not doing
that here. So part of the reason we're taking down the high-end of our guidance is we are going to have a fair amount of
acquisition noise. A lot of it's non-cash as a result of these five larger deals over the last three months.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Right. Okay.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: That's impacting and we had a little bit of that in Q2, but given these deals had just closed in
the case of Siemens, we're likely not going to close that until the first quarter, but given it's a carve-out transaction,
Beckman's actually is going to have to spend a fair amount of money in the second half here to get ready from a
systems point of view to bring that business in. We think it's a very attractive, high-return acquisition opportunity, but
it's going to hurt us a little bit from a GAAP EPS perspective over the next couple quarters.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: How much would that type of spending be?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Well, Beckman is going to cost them – it's going to cost the Life Sciences & Diagnostics
$0.005 to a $0.01 in the second half. Add to that the other, the deal costs, the inventory step-up from the other deals, the
other $250 million of revenues that are coming on board here, we're going to have $0.03, $0.04 of additional dilution
here from that. Again, a lot of it is non-cash but GAAP dilution in the second half.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Just at a higher level I guess, you guys are going to be at 3% to 3.5% organic for the year. That's
above the midpoint of the annual range. Yet, you're kind of guiding to the midpoint. We're talking about some
acquisition dilution. There's I guess spending to get ready for an acquisition. It seemed like in the past you guys had
kind of blown through all this stuff. There would be maybe some leftover scraps from restructuring or some other
levers to pull. I also don't recall this kind of lumpy mix creating somewhat of a visibility problem, perhaps. Did this go
to just the more complex nature of your portfolio and where the margins are today relative to maybe four or five years
ago? I mean this just feels a little bit different than what you guys used to kind of blow through in the past.

<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Steve, I appreciate the question, but the way I would respond to it is that the Danaher that
you've known is the Danaher that you've got today. And we've had a situation in the second quarter that's going to
perpetuate itself in the second half where our business has been on a literal tear for a long time is not going to
contribute to the top line. It's not that big of a deal, but Tektronix has been a real contributor to us, but here for the next
several quarters, we're going to miss that revenue, but we're really going to miss the variable fall through there.
And if that wasn't going on, particularly to the level that we've seen and that we anticipate, we wouldn't be talking
about any of this, quite honestly. So I think it's isolated. Not happy about it. But it is what it is. But when you look
more broadly across the corporation, there's so many good things going on from a segment, from a platform, from a
geographic perspective that we're not going to lose too much sleep here because we're building a business for the
long-term and feel as confident and as convicted about that as we ever have.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Right. Okay. Thanks.

We'll take our next question from Steven Winoker, Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Thanks and good morning.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: So I want to go back to Nigel's question on Tek, and specifically on Tektronix, not on the
Communications business. So I think this is the eleventh quarter of negative growth. You've talked about order growth
turning positive finally here after a very long period of time. But I guess I still at a more granular level am trying to get
the sense for what's structural versus what's cyclical here? In your sense when you dive into the different pieces, video,
et cetera, and you analyze the business, what gives you a comfort level that actually this is still a good market over time
and we're just in a cyclical kind of trough?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Well, Steve, when you talk about 11 quarters, right, that can be a fine line to draw. But I
think we continue to be optimistic about Tek and its markets. Again, I think we've seen – well, what we haven't seen is
that bounce back in bench spending that has typically followed every major downturn that we've studied in the history
of the company. Things have been grinding here for a while. I think we see that on the part of the global technology
customers, customers that we serve really without too many exceptions by vertical and by geography. So our task and
our challenge is to innovate as best we can and in the face of that execute as well as we can from a delivery, from a
service perspective in the field to drive the sort of order growth, which will lead to shipment growth in time. So I don't
want to blame it all on the market. We've certainly gotten better at Tek over the last several years in what we can
control. And I think that combination is what fuels that optimism. But you don't hear us banging the table, because we
need to prove it to you with real results on a sustained basis.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Is this a place – a particular segment that you would continue to seek to deploy capital
externally?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: I think the Tek's team – at Tektronix, their primary focus here, Steve, is to grow the
business organically.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. And just maybe as a follow up, on that 150 basis point decline core, and you
mentioned the high variable margin on the communications side driving most of that, but can you give me some sense
is all of that operating leverage? Or, I'm just trying to break out what went well in test and measurement versus what
was really just a function of the volume?

<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Instruments OP were relatively flat. OP dollars were flat with core growth that was also flat.
So they're obviously doing some things on the cost side to overcome inflation and others. But all the OP decline and all
the margin hit was not from the comp side, and that is of our equipment business that's our highest variable margin
business.

One moment. We'll take a question from Jeff Sprague, Vertical Research Partners.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Thank you. Good morning, gents.
<A - Matthew E. Gugino>: Good morning, Jeff.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Good morning, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Just a couple quick ones. Does your guide for 2014 assume a Q4 restructuring in the ballpark
of what you did last year? I think maybe you were talking $80 million-ish before relative to the $100 million as kind of
a ballpark idea?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Jeff, we're going through our planning process now. We would expect to have restructuring in
the fourth quarter. We haven't pinned down the number yet.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And then I know you haven't been a fan of programmatic share repurchase, but what's your
thought process on opportunistic share repurchase?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: I think that's a word we've used with some frequency over the years to describe our
philosophy with respect to buybacks.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And then just thinking about deal valuations, I mean, we see what Siemens is. What kind of
ballpark valuation on the other stuff that you're currently buying?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Jeff, we brought in roughly – if you look at kind of 2015, just run rate, we brought in about
$0.5 billion of revenue over the last four months. Not all that closed, but either signed or announced, and we paid
approximately $1 billion, all with one exception, which is more of a start-up, all profitable businesses. So pretty good
I'd say overall EBITDA sort of multiples and situations where we on a deal-by-deal basis expect to get to a – exceed a
10% return within three years. So I feel pretty good, and we've done five deals here between $90 million and $500
million over the last three months and feel pretty good about the valuations as well.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Do you think something has actually changed? Or is this kind of the random walk of deals
where there's nothing and then there's something and you can't time them? Or do you have some confidence that things
are actually picking up on the M&A front?

<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Again, and kind of what we've seen is sort of the mid-sized deals, these $100 million to $1
billion type transactions. We're pretty encouraged by the quality, not only the number of situations, but obviously along
these lines of these five situations where while things aren't cheap, we can get deals done under our return parameters. I
think we're still having active conversations on the larger opportunities as well. I think it's net-net an encouraging sign
here, but until we pull something bigger down, I don't want to sort of declare any victory.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Jeff, what I think stands out for me to build on what Dan's saying both in terms of what
we've announced here and how we think about the funnels is really the breadth of these dynamics. If it was in one space
it might be a bit more of a random walk, but this undercurrent is broad based. I think that's a good sign and part of the
confidence and conditioning we're reiterating this morning on the M&A front.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Thanks. And just finally from me, on this June fade, is that a U.S. comment?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: No.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Is that a global comment?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Jeff, really we were referring to Western Europe. That was just...
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Western Europe...
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: ...one geography that if you rolled up our – everybody came in line with what we thought at
the beginning of the quarter. Western Europe was slightly below what we thought at the beginning of the quarter and
that was most pronounced. It wasn't terrible, but it was most pronounced in June, a little bit of a tail-off there.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Great. Thank you.

We'll take our next question from Julian Mitchell, Credit Suisse.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Hi. Sorry about that.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: No worries, Julian. We slapped Matt here for doing that to you. Good morning.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Yeah, good morning. Just on the equipment versus consumables mix, I think you'd called
out in Q1 that equipment sales are up 3.5% the best in a very long time. How did that play out in Q2?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: It was more or less in line, Julian, with what we had seen. Consumables broadly were good
and they led the way. Unfortunately, we had a little bit of a lag there in equipment, but it wasn't broad based. Again, it
kind of comes back to the issue that we flagged earlier around communications with Tek Comms being so soft. That
was really the major break on the equipment trend that we've seen in the last several quarters. Otherwise, the general
mix was very much in line with what we have seen fortunately.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Got it. And then just a follow up on Western Europe. You talked about the slowdown
there in June. I guess it seems like it's very, very short-term, so it's maybe hard to read too much into it. But I guess is
your sense that it's more that the – you had expected that to accelerate as we went through the year and it's just hit kind
of a ceiling on growth? Or was there actually some softness on order intake below sort of what you'd thought?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Julian, we had good growth in context. It just down ticked broadly versus our expectations
mid-quarter. So I don't think we're going to try to extrapolate that too far here too soon, but it is something we're
watching carefully as we start the second half here. Again, in part because it seemed to be broadly based as opposed to
the U.S. which was strong and where we saw softness at Tek Comms and in dental consumables that was particularly
isolated.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Got it. And then lastly very quickly, environmental you talked about weakness in the
U.S. municipal spend continuing. Looking at sort of local government finances, those have been improving in terms of

tax receipts and so on for 18 months now. When do you think that will start to feed through...?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Maybe we didn't get that right in the script. Actually our muni spending which had begun to
bounce back in Europe and has continued bounced back in the second quarter in the U.S. So Hach had good muni
spend in the U.S. in the second quarter.

We'll take our next question from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Isaac Ro>: Good morning, guys. Thanks. On Tek Comms, I just wanted maybe one more question on that.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Sure.
<Q - Isaac Ro>: Can you talk a little bit about the product specific trends there? And the reason I ask is I think in the
past we've talked a little bit about the secular shift towards software and you guys are taking some steps with Arbor
Networks. So I'm just wondering if there's an element of product innovation there that's factoring into your demand
profile and what can you shed light on there relative to yourselves as well as the competition?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Yeah, I think as we look at those dynamics, Isaac, we're really talking about specific
customers, specific programs and the timing they're in. And that's where we entered the quarter thinking that the rest of
the year was going to play out in one way. At this point it's going to play out another way and again not a way that's
necessarily helpful for us. But these are long-term relationships. We feel good about the value that we provide, the
function that the Tek Comms provide these mobile operators. So we're going to take a long view and continue to invest
and persevere, though it clearly puts some pressure on the margins in the near term.
<Q - Isaac Ro>: Okay. And then just a follow up question on the Healthcare side of the business, specifically
Beckman.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Yeah.
<Q - Isaac Ro>: You guys talked a mid single-digit growth. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about your view
on the sales funnel for that business just given all the uncertainty with hospital capital budgets around ACA and as a
corollary to that, the Siemens business that you acquired is I think about microbiology and the secular trends there are
okay, but not great, so just trying to get a sense of your plan to create growth and maybe grow faster in the end markets
in that business?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Sure. Well, you really have to like the Beckman headline number here in terms of the core
and particularly that turn in the U.S. I think the funnels are healthy, but again the funnels are healthy because of the
underlying actions, the team has really been hard at work in progressing the last several years. So when you look at
those funnels and more importantly the retention and win rates that come as a function of those funnels, we couldn't be
happier. And in turn and then to see those revenues come into the business, because as you know, Isaac, we can see a
6-month, sometimes a 12-month lag from the time a customer makes a decision before we can recognize that revenue.
I think that the microbiology lab is a good – or the micro bio space is a good space. It's not a space that we've been in.
And frankly, we'll take a mid single-digit growth business with the platform that we'll get from Siemens and do there I
think what we've done at Leica Bio, at Radiometer, more recently with the IRIS business and urinalysis and really work
hard to turbo charge that business. I think you've seen us do that from an innovation perspective. I think you've seen us
do that with respect to some of the go-to-market fundamentals. And that in concert with the synergies we should get
from the rest of the diagnostics platform is really the high level game plan that we have for this business once we get it
into Danaher. As Dan alluded to a few minutes ago, it's going to take a little while to carve out, so it's not the cleanest

integration that we're ever going to see. But frankly given the degree of difficulty at both SCIEX and at Beckman
Coulter and the team's subsequent success, we feel pretty confident they're going to knock this one down in the end.

And our next question comes from Andrew Obin, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Yes, just a question on cash flow. If I look, last year cash flow was relatively flat versus the
previous year, and I understand why. But it also seems that year-to-date free cash flow once again is relatively flat
versus year ago. And as a company that's sort of, we look at you on a cash flow basis, a) what's going on, if there is
anything going on or if it's just timing? And if it's just timing, should we expect a pickup in free cash flow in the second
half?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Andrew, it's Dan. You're right. Our year-to-date free cash flow is relatively flat. But as you
remember in the first quarter, our year-on-year cash flow was down a fair amount. We thought that was timing, we
thought we'd catch up to about flat by the mid year. That's occurred. I think it's trending well. We generated almost
$850 million of cash in the quarter versus less than $400 million in the first quarter. I expect that positive trend to
continue.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Terrific. And any more color just from printing ID on the short-cycle businesses? Anything
stands out on a positive or negative side to you in the quarter?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Within the product ID, Andrew?
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Yeah, product ID, yeah.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Yeah, I think the Videojet team continues to lead the way. They were up mid singles. If you
look at the last four, you look at the last eight quarters, I think we're very pleased both on an absolute and on a relative
basis with respect to what Videojet and Company are doing. I think Esko slowed down a little bit here, but has been a
very strong performer for us as well. And the announcement that we shared with you relative to Procter & Gamble, I
think, is important as we continue to digitize these packaging design work flow solutions on the web that really are the
major growth drivers for Esko. So I think all in all, I think we're pleased with where those businesses are today.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: But from a macro standpoint, no particular segment or geography really stood out?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Not really.

<Q - S. Brandon Couillard>: Larry, in Life Sciences, back on your comments around strength in the academic market

<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: I think we're feeling good about the execution there, but it's probably, frankly a combination
that is hard to titrate out one versus the other.
<Q - S. Brandon Couillard>: Okay. And then with respect to the Siemens Microbiology deal, can you give us a sense
of how do you see the competitive landscape evolving in that ID/AST arena? Particularly around mass spec and other
emerging direct from blood technologies? Can you leverage AB SCIEX to launch your own mass spec based solution
in that market?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Well, as you know, it's a complex landscape not only in terms of some of the strong and
outstanding competitors that we have there, but also the competing and evolving technologies. I think our view
particularly with respect to mass spec is that what we get with Siemens is quite complementary to what happens with
mass spec. We don't provide that product today from SCIEX, as I'm sure you know. I think over time we need to be
careful with how many fronts AB SCIEX takes on, because we're seeing broad potential application of mass spec
technologies. We don't want SCIEX to try to be all things to all people. So there will be situations where we have
relationships with others, where we may compete in one space and collaborate or cooperate in others. And I think that's
very much the creativity and the nimbleness that we're going to need the SCIEX team and the Beckman team as well
here to embrace and engage as we go forward.

We'll take our final question from Deane Dray with Citi.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Thank you. Just a quick clarification on the guidance for the third quarter. What was very
helpful is when Dan added that there was going to be $0.03 or $0.04 of deal dilution in the second half, and I think you
said on top of that is the $0.005 to a $0.01 and the integration costs you'll have to do for the Siemens Microbiology. So
that's $0.04 or $0.05 for the second half. How much of that is reflected in the third quarter guidance?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: There's about $0.02 impact in the third quarter and probably a comparable impact in Q4.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: So pretty linear. And split between what's non-cash and cash?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: It will be more non-cash. There will be some cash because of the Beckman integration, but I
don't have anything more. I don't have the exact breakdown of that.
