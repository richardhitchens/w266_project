MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to today's program. [Operator Instructions]
It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Lee McEntire. Please go ahead.
Lee McEntire
Thank you, good morning, thanks for joining us on the web as well as the phone this morning.
Before I turn the call over to CEO Brian Moynihan and CFO Bruce Thompson, let me just say that we may make some
forward-looking statements. For details on those, I'll refer you to page 24 and page 25 in our earnings deck material,
either the website or our SEC filings.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian.
Brian T. Moynihan
Thank you, Lee. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review the first quarter results.
As you can see from our numbers, we reported a loss this quarter. That loss reflects the cost of resolving more of our
legacy mortgage issues as well as adding reserves, primarily for previously disclosed legacy mortgage related matters.
As disappointed as we are in the bottom line results, we're pleased to report that the businesses reported earnings at a
level that will allow us to substantially offset these losses. And also at the same time, we were able to still grow and

improve our Basel III standardized regulatory capital ratio during the quarter.
Bruce will take you through the particulars of our results, but first I wanted to spend a couple minutes looking at the
progress we continue to make across the customer groups that we serve. In particular, we added some slides to the
appendix on pages 17 and 18, which highlight multiyear trends across our customer groups. Let me just touch on a few
those and connect them to our results.
When you think about our broad Consumer franchise for mass-market consumers as well as affluent wealthy
consumers, as we think about the mass-market group, the strategy in our retail segment has been to lower the cost of
service while we improve our customer experience. We do that by continuing to optimize our delivery networks of all
types in response to customer behavioral changes. Banking centers and basic tele-transactions continue to decline as
customers move their business to mobile and online transactions, yet we still have many millions of visits each week to
our branches.
But in the aggregate, our self-service channels of ATM, online, and mobile transactions continue to grow. This quarter
more than 10% of all the deposit transactions that consumers make in our company are now done through mobile
devices, as people effectively carry a branch in their pocket. This coupled with other measures allowed us to reduce our
costs in our Consumer Banking business 4% from last year's first quarter. It allows us to continue to invest in other
areas to further improve customer satisfaction and grow sales.
On the preferred side of our Consumer business where we serve mass affluent clients, we continue to invest in this
group by adding sales specialists. We now have more than 6,500 sales specialists concentrated in the top banking
centers. We also increased service associates to drive satisfaction to these clients as well. The end result when you put
all the Consumer business together in the segment is organic deposit growth of $23 billion from last year to a total of
$535 billion in deposits.
On the investment side of this general Consumer client base, our Merrill Edge assets grew 21% from last year. When
we put this segment together, the earnings in our Consumer and Business Banking business improved 15% year over
year to nearly $1.7 billion this quarter.
As we move to the wealthy part of our Consumer client base and our Wealth Management business with U.S. Trust and
Merrill Lynch, client balances again grew this quarter and now total over $2.4 trillion. This has driven record asset
management fees in this segment. And we are seeing growing demand from these customers for our other banking
products as loans and deposits continue to increase. This business made over $700 million after tax this quarter and had
a pre-tax margin of more than 25% for the fifth consecutive quarter.
Let me move to our company side of our house, our commercial and corporate client base. We continue to retain a
leadership position in investment banking fees, with $1.5 billion in fees received this quarter. We also saw solid loan
and deposit flows this quarter from our commercial customers. These activities drove a 6% increase in revenue in our
Global Banking business from last year.
In our Global Markets business, which serves investment clients, we earned $1.3 billion after tax, as our top-tier sales
and trading platforms generated over $4 billion in revenue this quarter. When we put it all together, we have leadership
positions that we continue to work on in each area and continued to see good momentum across the quarter.
We're pleased also to be in a position to return capital to shareholders as we increased dividends in addition to our
newly authorized share repurchase program. As usual, as we see it – each quarter we remain focused on executing this
strategy that connects the capabilities of this company with its customers and shareholders for your benefit.
With that, I want to turn it over to Bruce to cover the earnings results.
Bruce R. Thompson
Thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start on slide two and work through the first quarter results.

We did record a loss of $276 million or $0.05 per diluted share this quarter. Driving the loss during the quarter was
litigation expense of $6 billion, which cost us roughly $0.40 a share during the quarter. We recorded $3.6 billion in
litigation expense for the previously announced FHFA settlement, and we recorded another $2.4 billion primarily
associated with the increase in reserves for previously disclosed legacy mortgage related matters.
Revenue during the quarter on an FTE basis was $22.8 billion, which was $1.1 billion higher than the fourth quarter of
2013, but below the $23.4 billion we saw in the first quarter of 2013. On a linked-quarter basis, our revenues benefited
from improved sales and trading results and asset management fees and were offset by lower net interest income as
well as lower Mortgage Banking revenue. Compared to the prior-year period, revenue was down slightly on lower net
interest income, mortgage revenue, and sales and trading, but did benefit from higher asset management fees.
Total non-interest expense during the quarter was $22.2 billion, but did include $6 billion of litigation expense as well
as $1 billion of retirement-eligible incentive costs that we recognize during the first quarter of each year. If we exclude
these items from both the first quarter periods for comparability of the underlying trends that we saw within the
company, expenses did improve by $1.2 billion or 7% and were driven by lower LAS non-litigation costs as well as
some of the New BAC improvements that we saw. Versus the fourth quarter of 2013, the slight increase in non-interest
expense reflects increased revenue-related compensation in our Markets business and was partially offset by the decline
that we saw in our LAS non-litigation expense reductions.
Provision for credit losses was $1 billion during the quarter and increased $673 million versus the fourth quarter of
2013. In the first quarter this year, we released $379 million from our loan loss reserves, and that compares to a release
of $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013.
Before we move off of this slide, let me mention that we had a few other items in the quarter that in the aggregate
benefited EPS by about $0.04 a share, as higher equity investment security gains, net DVA, and the resolution of tax
matters were positives. And they were offset in part by the cost of retirement eligible incentives as well as the negative
market-related impacts on our net interest income.
One last point on FVO and DVA, this quarter and moving forward we report the net impact of these two items as one
net DVA valuation number for our derivatives and structured liabilities within our Global Markets business.
On slide three, you can see our period-end balance sheet increased from the end of 2013, as we grew both cash and
securities in light of increasing liquidity requirements in our primary banking subsidiary. Ending loans declined $12
billion, led by lower residential mortgages, principally within our discretionary loan portfolio, as well as seasonal
declines in credit cards. Loans were up in our Global Banking segment, which I'll cover in a bit. Period-end deposits
were up $14 billion from the fourth quarter and are up year over year by more than $38 billion.
Our tangible common equity ratio declined to 7% due to the increase in liquidity that I mentioned earlier. Tangible
book value did increase slightly during the quarter, and we repurchased 87 million shares for $1.4 billion, which
completed our share repurchase program that we established at this time last year. And following our CCAR results, we
announced a new $4 billion share repurchase plan as well as the intention to increase the quarterly common dividend to
$0.05 a share in the second quarter of 2014.
If we move to slide four and we look at our capital ratios under Basel III, recall this is the first period we're reporting
under Basel III transition, which became effective January 1 of this year. Under the transition rules, our common equity
Tier 1 capital was $151.6 billion while our risk-weighted assets were $1.28 trillion, which resulted in a ratio of 11.8%.
While there are no comparative reporting periods, we did provide pro forma fourth quarter 2013 numbers to allow you
to see the slight movement up in the ratio during the quarter.
We do continue to provide our Basel III numbers on a fully phased-in basis, as we have done in prior periods. The
numbers in the chart reflect risk-weighted assets under the standardized approach, with the common equity Tier 1 ratio
improving to 9.3% and remaining above our 8.5% proposed minimum requirement in 2019.
If we move to the advanced method, our CET1 ratio was 9.9% and was impacted by an increased level of risk-weighted
assets related to operational risk, which were largely offset by reductions in other risk-weighted assets as well as the

increase in capital.
If we move to supplementary leverage ratios, we estimate at the end of the first quarter of 2014 we exceed the recently
updated U.S. rules that apply in 2018. Once again, that would mean our bank holding company is above the 5%
minimum. And our primary banking subsidiaries, BANA and FIA, are both in excess of their 6% minimums. I also
want to remind you that our Tier 1 capital and supplemental leverage ratios will benefit by approximately $2.9 billion
in the second quarter of 2014 if we receive shareholder approval to amend our Series T preferred stock.
One last item I want to note regarding capital in the first quarter of 2014, it includes the adjustments to capital
allocations across our business lines. We included a slide in the appendix that notes the new allocation. As you look at
that, you'll see that the primary adjustments were allocating more capital to our Global Banking business given the loan
growth we've seen in that segment and, to a lesser extent, increases in both our Global Markets as well as our Global
Wealth Management business. As a result of these changes, the amount of unallocated capital that's held at the parent
declined from $16 billion to $5 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2014.
If we move to slide five, funding and liquidity, our global excess liquidity sources increased more than $50 billion to a
record level of $427 billion as a result of seasonally strong deposit flows as well as some of the bank debt issuance that
we did earlier in the quarter. Our total long-term debt of $255 billion was $5 billion higher than the fourth quarter of
2013.
These figures do not include the $7.6 billion of debt issuance that settled on April 1 and was executed at more favorable
spreads than our existing debt footprint. That issuance has enabled us to maintain our strong excess liquidity position at
the parent despite the cash flows required by both scheduled debt maturities as well as recent litigation settlements. Our
time to required funding remained very strong at 35 months, with parent company liquidity unchanged at $95 billion.
Moving forward and as we consider the FHFA settlement, we would expect parent issuance to be below maturities as
the focus evolves towards continued yield improvement following the past several years of sizable balance reductions
within our debt footprint.
If we move to slide six on net interest income, net interest income on a reported FTE basis was $10.3 billion, which
was a decline of $700 million from the fourth quarter of 2013. That decline was driven by a swing of roughly $500
million associated with our market-related adjustments for FAS 91. FAS 91 was approximately $300 million negative
in the first quarter of 2014 compared to the $200 million benefit that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2013. The balance
of the decline was largely due to two less interest accrual days in the first quarter of 2014 relative to the fourth quarter
of 2013. Our net interest income if we exclude those market-related adjustments was $10.6 billion, once again down a
little over $200 million from the fourth quarter of 2013.
Other drivers in the quarter were lower average consumer balances and yields, which were largely offset by a reduction
in long-term debt costs as well as continued declines in our deposit pricing. As a result of these net interest income
impacts as well as the higher earning assets, the net interest yield, once again adjusting for FAS 91, declined three basis
points to 2.36% in the first quarter of 2014.
As it relates to asset sensitivity on the balance sheet, we continue to remain poised to benefit from higher rates,
particularly when the short end of the curve moves up. As we continue to manage our OCI sensitivity, we're also
mindful of both liquidity and leverage rules. Our first quarter 2014 increase in securities included shorter-duration
Treasury securities instead of mortgage-backed securities, and these Treasury securities are much more LCR and OCI
friendly, but do have lower yields.
Given the continued growth that we've seen in our cash balances at central banks as we increase liquidity, we have
adjusted our net interest yields to reflect the impact of adding these low-yielding cash deposits once again at central
banks into earning assets. This had no impact on net interest income, but prior-period net interest yields have been
adjusted to reflect the change.
Given the added liquidity during the quarter coupled with the average balance impact of seasonally lower consumer
balances, we expect net interest income in the second quarter of 2014 may be slightly lower compared to this quarter's
$10.6 billion level excluding market-related adjustments before moving up modestly throughout the second half of

2014.
If we move to our expense highlights on slide seven, non-interest expense was $22.2 billion in the first quarter of 2014,
and once again included a $6 billion charge for litigation expense and a $1 billion cost for our retirement-eligible
incentives. As previously mentioned, the $6 billion litigation expense did include the cost of the FHFA settlement as
well as $2.4 billion in increased reserves associated with our previously disclosed legacy mortgage-related matters. If
we exclude the litigation and retirement-eligible incentive costs, our total expenses were $15.2 billion and declined
$1.2 billion from the first quarter of 2013, driven by lower LAS costs, but were up roughly $200 million from the
fourth quarter of 2013 on incentives related to improved sales and trading revenue.
Legacy assets and servicing costs ex-litigation of $1.6 billion declined more than $250 million from the fourth quarter
of 2013. As you look at that $1.6 billion number, the savings we generated during the quarter were 40% of our targeted
quarterly reductions that we've communicated to you previously. We continue to make progress on cost savings. And
as a result, our expense program targets for both New BAC as well as LAS remain unchanged.
Turning to slide eight, you can see our credit quality continued to improve again. Net charge-offs declined $194 million
to $1.4 billion, or a 62 basis point net loss ratio. Delinquencies, the leading indicator of charge-offs, showed
improvement again as well. And our first quarter of 2014 provision expense was $1.0 billion, and we released
approximately $400 million of reserves during the quarter. Looking forward, we would expect provision expense for
the balance of the year to reflect both modest reductions in net charge-offs as well as reserve releases.
Let's move to slide nine and go through the different business segments, starting with Consumer and Business Banking.
Net income of nearly $1.7 billion in the first quarter of 2014 was up 15% from the first quarter of 2013. Lower
expenses, higher service charges, a portfolio divestiture gain, and lower credit costs all drove that improvement in the
first quarter of 2013 (sic) [2014] (20:56). Return on allocated capital within the segment remains very strong at 23%
this quarter.
As we reflect on customer activity during the quarter, mobile banking customers grew 19% from the first quarter of
2013 to 15 million customers, and customer deposit transactions using these devices now represent 10% of all
transactions. Average deposits of $535 billion are up organically $23 billion or 5% compared to the first quarter of
2013, and our rates paid were reduced nearly in half to seven basis points.
Our Brokerage assets surpassed $100 billion in the quarter and are up 21% year over year, with the growth split fairly
evenly between both increases in flows as well as valuations within the market. Our card issuance remained strong at 1
million new accounts in the first quarter of 2014, but our end-of-period balances are down seasonally from the fourth
quarter of 2013. Importantly, our risk-adjusted margin remained above 9%. Overall, our credit quality within the
segment remained strong, as our net charge-offs declined versus both the linked-quarter period as well as the year-ago
period.
Provision expense was $812 million during the quarter. Net charge-offs improved $360 million from the year-ago
quarter. And we released $69 million in reserves this quarter, which is $220 million less than the first quarter of last
year and down $426 million from the fourth quarter of 2013.
One litigation item to note before we move off the Consumer results is the resolution we reached last week with the
CFPB and the OCC on issues related to the marketing, sale, and billing of credit card debt cancellation and ID theft
protection products. This settlement included cash payments to both regulators and provides for redress to customers
and was covered by reserves that had been established in prior periods.
If we move to slide 10, Consumer Real Estate Services, the higher loss in the quarter was driven by $5.8 billion of
litigation within the segment. Let's first focus on the reported sub-segment of home loans, where we recorded the
origination of consumer real estate. Our first mortgage retail originations of $8.9 billion were down 24% from the
fourth quarter of 2013, in line with overall market demand, and drove a 32% reduction in core production revenue as
margins held relatively steady compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. We continued to reduce production staffing
levels in the quarter consistent with the volumes that we're seeing, but those expenses don't flow through the P&L
immediately. Home equity originations of $2 billion were up from the fourth quarter of 2013 levels.

If we move to the Legacy Assets and Servicing sub-segment, once again the driver here is the previously mentioned
litigation costs. On litigation costs, you saw the press release on March 26 regarding our settlement with FHFA, which
identified the $6.3 billion payment and led to the $3.6 billion litigation charge this quarter. We're obviously pleased to
have this matter put behind us.
Within our earnings release, we also included information regarding a settlement with FGIC and related parties on
involved securitization trusts, which resolves all outstanding litigation and rep and warrant claims on second-lien loans
for approximately $900 million to $950 million, depending on the final outcome of two of the nine remaining trusts.
This settlement was covered by reserves that we had established in previous periods.
The primary revenue component within the LAS sub-segment, servicing revenues, declined $205 million versus the
fourth quarter, as the size of our servicing portfolio continues to decline as it aligns with our market share of
production, and we also had less favorable MSR net hedge performance during the quarter.
Also impacting revenue during the quarter was rep and warrant expense of $178 million, which increased by roughly
$100 million from the fourth quarter of 2013 given the settlement during the quarter with FHFA.
From a cost of servicing perspective, our 60-plus-day delinquent loans were reduced by 15% to 277,000 units at the
end of the first quarter of 2014. And once again, our LAS expense ex-litigation declined $262 million to $1.6 billion.
If we move to slide 11, Global Wealth and Investment Management, during the quarter we achieved record revenue of
$4.5 billion, which was up 3% from the first quarter of 2013 and 2% from the fourth quarter of 2013. The improvement
was driven by record asset management fees during the quarter. Net income of $729 million was slightly higher than
the first quarter of 2013 but was down modestly from the fourth quarter of 2013, as expense was 3% higher than both
periods.
Expense increased compared to both periods on higher revenue related incentives, increased volume-related costs, as
well as certain investments in technology. Notwithstanding those increases, our pre-tax margin remained strong, north
of 25% for the fifth consecutive quarter. Our return on allocated capital was 25%, but declined from prior periods as the
relative earnings stability was coupled with the increased capital allocations that I mentioned previously.
Client engagement remained strong in the markets, providing additional tailwind as our client balances increased $30
billion from the year-end 2013 to $2.4 trillion. Long-term AUM flows of $17.4 billion for the quarter were the second
highest in our company's history. Ending client loan balances of $120 billion reached record levels and are up 9% year
over year.
One other highlight I'd like to mention is the core dated referral efforts that we're seeing across Wealth Management
and the Banking groups, as we funded more than 300 institutional retirement plans worth more than $2.4 billion in
client assets during the quarter.
On slide 12, Global Banking, earnings during the quarter were $1.24 billion. Earnings compared to the first quarter of
2013 show a 6% improvement in revenue, but were offset by higher expense. Investment Banking fees for the quarter
were $1.54 billion, consistent with what we saw during the first quarter of 2013, but 11% lower than the record level
that we saw during the fourth quarter of 2013. We do believe for the second consecutive quarter this would rank us as a
global leader in Investment Banking fees.
The remaining revenue drivers in this business, Treasury Services and Business Lending, showed very positive trends
year over year across both our commercial as well as our corporate client base. You can see some of these metrics on
page 26 of the supplemental information that we provide to you.
Provision was up $116 million from the first quarter of 2013, driven by additions to our loan loss reserves. The first
quarter of 2014 included a build of $282 million versus builds of $81 million in the first quarter of 2013 and $434
million in the fourth quarter of 2013. The expense increase in the quarter of $186 million on a year-over-year basis
relates to investments in technology for our global Treasury Services and lending platforms, additional client-facing
personnel, and to a lesser degree some litigation that we saw during the quarter within this segment.

If we look at the balance sheet, average loans are up $27.4 billion or 11% compared to the first quarter of 2013 and are
up $2.6 billion compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. The overall pace of growth that we're seeing has slowed from
the past few quarters, as pricing for loans is quite competitive and we've chosen returns over growth in certain cases.
Return on allocated capital was 16% and is down from prior periods, reflecting stable earnings that were more than
offset by a 35% increase in allocated capital.
If we switch to Global Markets on slide 13, excluding net DVA, we earned $1.24 billion in the first quarter, which is in
line with the first quarter of 2013 and up $893 million from the fourth quarter of 2013. Ex-DVA, sales and trading
revenue was $4.1 billion, 1% lower than the first quarter of 2013 but 37% higher than the fourth quarter of 2013. Our
fixed sales and trading revenue was down 2% compared to the first quarter of 2013, but we would note it would be
down 15% after adjusting for a monoline write-down that we incurred in the first quarter of 2013.
Our rates and currencies experienced declines for market volumes and lower volatility during the quarter. I would note
that our FICC business did increase 42% over the fourth quarter of 2013.
Equity sales and trading flat with the first quarter of 2013 and up 28% from the fourth quarter of 2013; expenses were
stable compared to the first quarter of 2013. And when we compare expenses to the fourth quarter of 2013, they
increased $453 million on higher revenue-related expenses after excluding litigation of $655 million that we recorded
in the fourth quarter of 2013 within this segment. Our trading-related assets on average remained flat at $440 billion on
a linked-quarter basis. Our return on allocated capital during the quarter was 16%, even after we consider a 13%
increase in allocated capital.
On slide 14, we show All Other. Revenue was down $193 million from the fourth quarter of 2013 on lower net interest
income, which was driven by the swing in market-related adjustments that I discussed earlier and was partially offset
by higher equity investment gains, which were driven by the final monetization of an investment. First quarter of 2014
expense includes the retirement-eligible incentive costs, which are in line with last year but still drive the expense
variance compared to the fourth quarter of 2013, and was partially offset by lower litigation costs. Provision benefit in
the quarter was relatively flat to the fourth quarter of 2013 but did improve $385 million from the first quarter of 2013.
Net charge-offs of $206 million improved $88 million from the fourth quarter of 2013 and $279 million from the first
quarter of 2013. Our first quarter of 2014 results in this segment included a $341 million reserve release compared to a
release of $482 million in the fourth quarter and $235 million in the first quarter of 2013.
During the quarter, our effective tax rate was impacted by our loss position. For the rest of 2014, we would expect an
effective tax rate of approximately 31% absent any unusual items.
Let me make a few comments before we open it up for questions. We obviously don't like to report a loss to
shareholders, but this quarter we achieved resolution of rulings around significant legacy matters: FHFA, FGIC, CFPB
and OCC, as well as the positive court ruling on Bank of New York Mellon private label securities matters, which is
under appeal, just to name a few. We established additional reserves to help address previously disclosed
mortgage-related issues, and we did that and still built our already strong Basel III standardized capital ratio.
Our supplemental leverage ratios at both parent and banks are compliant well in advance of their 2018 implementation
dates under the more stringent new rules. Our liquidity is at record levels and we're well positioned to meet the new
LCR requirements. Asset quality is strong and improving. Our expense programs show good progress. And most
importantly, four of our five operating segments reported revenue and earnings that were essentially flat or higher than
the prior year. And In our fifth segment, Legacy Assets and Servicing, we made progress on legacy issues. We drove
down 60-days-plus delinquent loans, and our costs excluding litigation declined $1 billion from last year's first quarter.
So as we move into the second quarter of this year, we feel that we're better positioned than we were coming into 2014.
And with that, we'll go ahead and open it up for questions.

[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning, Betsy.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Good morning.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: A couple questions, one on the litigation reserve build that you did in the quarter. You
mentioned that the FGIC and the trust settlement were fully reserved for. So that means that none of the $2.4 billion
increase in reserves in 1Q that you called out was for that settlement?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: That's correct, Betsy. As we said, substantially all of the $2.4 billion related to a build in
our litigation reserves for matters that we've disclosed previously.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: So I guess I was just wondering if you could give us a sense or color as to what you're
referring to there. It doesn't look like it went to the monolines or the PLS. So is it something that's broadly mortgage
related, or is it something else? And given that it's such a large reserve build, does it suggest that there's another
settlement on a near term?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: You bring up a good point. It does not relate to the previously announced Article 77. It
does not relate to the remaining monoline exposure given that we settled the FGIC exposure within the context of our
reserve levels. So it relates to other mortgage-related matters outside of those that we have disclosed previously.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Okay.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: And I wouldn't interpret or necessarily assume that the build in the reserve suggests that a
settlement is imminent.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Okay. Just moving to capital on Basel III, you gave us some great information of the
transitional to the fully phased-in walk there in the appendix. I guess I'm just wondering. You did narrow the gap
between standardized and advanced by 30 bps. Could you run through how you did that in the quarter?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure. I think if you – obviously, the numerator in both is the same. And during the
quarter, we saw improvements in OCI as a numerator and we saw some significant improvements in our threshold
deductions. That numerator applies to both standardized as well as the advanced approaches.
If you look at the standardized risk-weighted assets, the big driver down there related to the reductions in our consumer
real estate, both first mortgage as well as home equity, as those portfolios reduce from longer-dated assets. In addition,
you have the seasonal decline within the card portfolio that helped, and that was moderated a little bit by the growth
that we saw in commercial loans. So I think as you look at that Basel III standardized ratio, what was driving
risk-weighted assets were actual reductions in exposure. There wasn't anything related to models or assumptions that
factored into that.
If you move over to the advanced approach, where we reported at 9.9%, which was down a touch, the biggest change,
and we continue to work with and look to refine and take guidance that we're getting with respect to operational risk,
the operational risk-weighted assets during the quarter as we continue to refine that were up about $50 billion and now
represent almost 25% of our overall Basel III advanced risk-weighted assets. I think as you look at relative to our peers,
brings us and puts us in line with where our peers are with that, and we'll continue to refine and work through that in
the future.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Okay, that's great, thanks for the color. Just lastly on expenses, you did show nice a
reduction in core expenses. Could you speak to some of the things that have been hitting the headlines recently? Cuts in
Global Markets, 5%, is this accurate? Is it part of New BAC, or is it more normal course expense management? And
then the branches are down 10% over the last two years. How much more optimization is there?

<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I'm sorry, Betsy. I missed the first part of your question on...
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: On the Global Markets, the trimming that we did was announced as the annual trimming
that goes on. You remember we always were adding. And we had, frankly, record hiring from schools this year coming
in. So we always are adjusting the head count to keep the expenses in line based on we have a lot of new people join us
here as we get to the summer that we've already made offers to, and it's the general vetting. So I wouldn't put that as
anything other than just day-to-day expense management and also just the natural turnover in a business. The second
part, Bruce?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah. On branch optimization, as we look at that, and I think you really get a sense for the
progress within branch optimization when you flip to the Consumer and Business Banking segment. A chunk of that
relates to New BAC. And you can see over the course of 12 months as we've taken the branches down by about 300
units, that's contributed to on a year-over-year basis the $180 million of expenses that we saw during the quarter.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Betsy, so this is a long-term strategy. So whether it's New BAC or not, we'll continue to
optimize the platform. And what we show you back in the appendix slide is the mobile banking growth is pretty strong.
So at the end of the day, if you look out across the last five or six years, we have more customers, a lot more deposits,
and a lot less cost structure as we've repositioned to meet the customers' changing usage of first computers, then phones
and the enhanced effect of ATMs. So you should expect those techniques to continue. But be that as it may, we also
still have 7 million – 7.5 million people come in our branches every week that are great opportunities to engage with
customers that we also continue to see strong foot traffic. We are manning this to meet those needs for both the people
who come into the branch and the people who use the automated techniques. And that is the challenge as we go
forward. I think we've done a pretty good job of bringing them down and keeping the expenses moving with the
customer flow.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Great. But from here, the branch level do you think holds, or do you still have more
work to do on pulling it down?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: We will adjust. Every month they keep looking at it and making adjustments as they look
over multiple years in the future. But if you remember, originally we said we'd get around 5,000 out of New BAC. That
was the number we gave you and we're there. But also remember that what you define as a branch will change. We
have these express branch formats where there are salespeople plus what we call ATAs, which are ATM machines that
you can actually pull up and work with tellers directly. It allows you to cash checks to the penny, authenticate without
your card to stick in the machine, the same things you do with a regular teller. And so it's all important to us. I think
focusing on the numbers as opposed to the overall cost of the structure, all the parts, and that's what I focus on. If you
look that, we continue to drive that down, taking all the costs of the whole infrastructure relative to the deposit base. It's
down near 200 basis points.
<Q - Elizabeth L. Graseck>: Got it, thanks.

We'll go next to Glenn Schorr with ISI. Please go ahead.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Thanks very much. I'm looking for a quick comment on the overall loan picture. There are
always a lot of puts and takes. So the Commercial side grew by 8% year over year. The Consumer shrunk by 4.7%. A
lot of that is runoff. So can you just give a general comment on how you're feeling about loan growth? And then weave
in there your commentary on the mortgage origination pipeline being up 23% in the first quarter. Thank you.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure. First, why don't we start – if you start within the Global Banking segment, you saw
loans relative to year end up about $2.5 billion and up more significantly than that on a year-over-year basis. We say
that we continue to see good loan demand within the Commercial space. It's across both B&I as well as real estate, so
we feel good about that. But I did note that during the quarter there were certain opportunities and things that we

looked at that we did not do and that we very much have a focus not just on growing the loans, but the return that's
generated from those loans. And going forward, you should expect to see us grow loans but we're going to be prudent,
and it needs to be at returns that make sense and for those customers that we have good relationships with.
If you move to the Consumer side, as I did note, and you can see it when you look within the CSBB segment that the
majority of the loan reduction we saw in Consumer was really three things. It was the payoff of first mortgage loans
that were held for investment purpose within the investment portfolio. It was the continued reduction within the home
equity business, where we have about $3.5 billion of home equity loans that pay each quarter, but those tend to be older
vintages. And I'll get back to the home equities that we're doing when I finish. And then the third was the overall card
balances were down about $4 billion, which on a seasonal basis is what we would expect. And we would look to see
those card balances stabilize as we go throughout 2014.
As it relates to new activity, we did note that the pipeline is up about 23%. What we saw was not materially different
from others in the first month, two months of the quarter. Applications and volume were down with some of the
weather, but we did see a pickup in that activity, which led to, obviously off of a low base, a 23% increase in the
pipeline as we go into the second quarter.
The other thing I would reference is if you look back, you can see that we have been able to increase and move up what
we're doing on the home equity front, where we had $2 billion of originations during the quarter. And I would just note
from a credit quality perspective and what we're seeing there, those loan-to-values tend to be at the 60%s, with FICO
scores deep into the 700s. So that area is providing an opportunity for us as well.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Summing it all up, I don't want to put words in your mouth. But if you look at the net of up
just 50 basis points for total loans year on year, it sounds like it's better than that just because of the runoff. I just
wanted to make sure that I get that specific on it.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Especially in the Consumer business, the runoff affects the overall numbers.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Because remember, we've still got the portfolios that we inherited from acquisitions that
are still running through the system.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Right. To follow up on legal, you mentioned the first two were fully reserved for, the $2.4
billion add to the reserve. Where are we now in terms of the estimated losses above and beyond what you're reserved
for? In other words, I would think it could go down as you continue to add to the reserve.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Are you referring to the range of possible loss that we disclosed when we put the 10-Q
out?
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Correct.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think we're working through and refining that. We don't put that out with earnings. We
put it out when we file the 10-Q. But to your point, I don't think there's – we obviously made progress with getting
FHFA put behind us as well as FGIC and some other related matters. And we're working through where exactly that
range of possible loss comes out, but I hear your point.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay, I appreciate it. And then last one on slide – I think it's 14, I'm just curious. The equity
investment income, what's driving that? It seems to have a nice steady and upward trending slope.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: As we noted in the script that we did complete the final monetization of an investment.
That was a decent chunk of that, so I would not expect to see those revenues at those levels going forward.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay, that's good for me. Thank you.

And we'll go next to Jonathan (sic) [John] (49:40) McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi. Bruce, hi. I was wondering. I just want to understand the dynamic of the net
interest income outlook I guess in the second quarter. Is the increase in lower-yielding liquidity on an average basis and
that's going to push the NII down a little bit that overwhelms the day count, is that what's happening in the second
quarter?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yes, keep in mind you only pick up one day Q1 to Q2. But I think you have a couple
things, as I mentioned. You've got relative to the first quarter, you do have lower card balances given the seasonal
bump that you see at year end that you carry a fair bit of during the first quarter. We did build up throughout the first
quarter a significant amount of liquidity in anticipation of those rules. That will contribute a little bit to the decline in
the second quarter. And then as we solve for that, you'd expect to see that move up, so nothing structural. We do have
some seasonal stuff in the Markets business that we do that depresses things a touch in the second quarter. So as we
said, it's obviously early in the quarter, but we're expecting a slight decline. But then we'd expect the trajectory to get
back to the levels that we've previously talked about.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And what's helping it grind higher beyond the second quarter, Bruce, just as a
reminder? What helps it grow in the third and fourth quarter and beyond?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure. I think as you look at it, one of the things that we continue to work through is that
the debt footprint will come down, although more modestly. But what we are seeing is as we look at the levels at which
we raise debt going forward, the cost of that has come down significantly, so you have some pickup there. You
obviously have some pickup with some of the loan growth that we're seeing within the Commercial space. And we
continue to take deposit pricing down as well, although we're down to levels that are harder to get much lower. And I
do just want to remind you, John, and I know you know this that as we give this guidance, it backs out and excludes
market-related impacts that come out of FAS 91.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Then on the litigation expense, Bruce, with the big reserve build and the
settlements this quarter, what's the outlook there? I know it's tough to forecast. But should we assume that a few
hundred million of litigation expense will persist for the next couple quarters?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: John, I think you have to split between – we continue to, and I'd just remind you, as you
look at the litigation pipeline and you look at where we are, we've obviously gotten through the base rep and warrant
with respect to the GSEs. We were able to get through and reach an agreement with FGIC, which is the fourth
monoline settlement that we have. And then we're working through and the Article 77 case is going through the judicial
process. So as we continue to reduce the number of outstanding litigation items that we have, that should obviously
bode well for what I would characterize as the base litigation expense.
That being said, I think we need to be realistic in your thoughts this quarter as it relates to the remaining couple of
matters that we disclosed, it can be lumpy and it's just very hard to predict. But as we talked about in the presentation,
during the quarter we did have a pretty significant build as we continued to evaluate those positions as well as the
discussions that we have that are parties to the litigation.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: John, I think the simple way, if you think about things, litigation matters that arrived after
2008 – 2009, the cost of those in the P&L is very modest, anything new. It just feeds off of costs that really relate to the
stuff that was before the crisis and we want to clean up. So to your point about what would be the ongoing litigation
costs, it would be much, much lower. But the question is, the lumpiness Bruce refers to is the transition we've got left
on a few of these matters.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then, Bruce, just to clarify the provision commentary that you made, your
outlook is for net charge-offs to grind lower modestly and reserve release to continue but probably at a smaller level
than the $380 million we saw this quarter?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think that's fair, John. I think it can bounce around in any one quarter, but I think the
provision number broadly speaking is in line with what we'd expect over the next couple quarters.

Page 12 of 21
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: So, John, one of the ways, if you look at the supplemental material and the pages on the
charge-offs by product, you've got to remember that if you look at the credit card charge-offs in U.S. and domestic,
they're down in the – this quarter it was $700 million and a 3.25% charge-off rate. You're hitting a place where the
business is geared to have some amount of charge-offs, and it's the way the business works or the cost of doing
business is a credit cost.
If you look outside that number, that is card charge-offs are 80% of the charge-offs or 60% to 70% of charge-offs, and
so they're going to be hard to get down a lot more. So there's work to do on mortgage charge-offs, some equity
charge-offs. But if you look across the rest of the board, we're in pretty good shape.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay, and last thing for me. I'm just wondering if trading and fixed income in
particular, did it have any notable sequential trends in the quarter? Did trading get better in March and early April as
rate volatility started to pick up a little bit or anything like that?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I wouldn't highlight any real seasonality of note as it relates to drastic ups or downs
throughout the quarter. The one piece that I would say that I think generally rates and foreign exchange, given where
the market was and the fact that there was not a lot of volatility in the quarter, was clearly negatively affected. On the
positive side, I would say that the overall credit trading businesses, whether it be loans, high-grade bond trading, or
high-yield bond trading, given market activity levels as well as our position from an underwriting perspective, were
very strong during the quarter.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay, thank you.

We'll go next to Paul Miller with FBR. Please go ahead.
<Q - Thomas LeTrent>: Good morning. This is actually Thomas LeTrent on behalf of Paul, another other expense
themed question. There has obviously been an increased amount of regulatory scrutiny on MSR transfers. Can you
flesh for me a little bit if those transactions got delayed or pushed out if it would impact your ability to meet expense
targets, or just a little color there?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: It's a very good question. What I would point out is if you go back to the fourth quarter of
2012, that was when we announced our significant MSR transfers. And so as you look at where we are as it relates to
just pure MSR transfers, we're through the significant majority of what we would expect. We've got some cleanup in
far smaller ones during the second, third, and fourth quarters. We don't have any reason to believe given they're small
and who they're going to that there will be a problem with the transfer. So we feel as it relates to getting to the expense
targets with what's left to go, that will not be an issue for us.
<Q - Thomas LeTrent>: Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you very much.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Thank you.

We'll go next to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Thanks, good morning. I wanted to ask you about operating leverage and again expense
progress. So year-over-year revenues plus or minus were down $1 billion. And if I'm looking at slide seven, I'm
looking at the core expenses were down a few hundred million dollars, and that's net of all the New BAC benefits. So
can you talk to us about just the push and pull between the net BofA, the New BAC reductions, and then what cost
inflation you're seeing, if any, underneath the core? And then as you look forward, just how should we expect that core
line to traject, the $13.6 billion excluding the retirement-eligible?

Page 13 of 21
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure. Let me answer the last part of your question first, which is we would expect the core
trajectory to trend down as we go throughout 2014. When you look at the – and if you're looking on slide seven and
you compare the $13.8 billion to the $13.6 billion, let me just consider and give you a couple numbers that affected that
core. During the first quarter of 2014, as we continued to reduce head count, we incurred over $100 million of
severance expense both on an absolute basis as well as a year-over-year basis within those numbers, so you had $100
million to the negative there.
The second thing is and as we disclosed, we have been investing within corporate banking, cash management,
salespeople, to a lesser extent capital markets people and some of the technology that goes along with that. And we
think as we look going forward, we're through a lot of that investment. But as I referenced in my comments, I would
ask you to flip back up to page 26 because we are seeing the benefit from revenue growth from those investments, and
we'd obviously expect those to moderate going forward.
The other couple things that I would note there is if you look within the Wealth Management business, you need to
consider within that area that we did have a $200 million-plus increase in revenue from asset management fees. So
there's obviously compensation the goes out with that as well as some of the technology dollars that were spent for our
MerrillONE project that we've rolled out within the Wealth Management area. So I would just say as you look at that
$200 million, the benefit from New BAC was clearly on a year-over-year much more significant from that, but we are
investing in the areas where we think and where we're seeing revenue growth. And we would obviously expect those
investments, given that they've been made and are generating the revenues, that you'd expect those to moderate going
forward.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Thanks, Bruce. And as just a follow-up to that then, we're going to see the continued
improvements to get that $2 billion New BAC level by mid-next year. But given what you anticipate on the revenue
side, do you feel that that's enough to get you where you want to go in terms of profitability improvement, or is there
anything that you can contemplate or need to contemplate as far as finding other incremental ways to fund those
investments or drive more to the bottom line?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Obviously, we continue to look at that and we continue. We started out, as you know, in
2011. And so if you go back, I think we had $80-odd billion of expenses when we started this thing. And so we've been
driving it down year after year after year, but that doesn't mean it stops with New BAC. It's just the challenge inherent
in the slow growth environment is how to manage and develop the investment rate, expense growth rate versus revenue
growth rate. And so that's something we as management continually have to focus on.
But if you think about $13.6 billion and think about continuing to make some improvements against it and annualize
that, add back whatever, $1 billion to the one-time retirement costs and then some litigation, you start to get into levels
that we think are consistent with the earnings, restoring the normalized earnings pool. The question is, and you're right,
is that we've got to make sure that the investments we make are yielding the revenue benefits and we've got to keep the
total expenses overall, and that's what we're up to. And I think the way to think about that is look at a 3,500 more
employee head count reduction this quarter, and you'll continue to see that work its way down. That is a leading
indicator of what's going to happen next quarter because those employees, that's a spot-to-spot number out there in the
quarter but they're still on the payroll for the quarter.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Got it, and one last one. Just card income and service charges, a lot of other banks have
been seeing weakness there, partially weather, partially regulatory, partial pricing changes. Anything that you guys are
seeing or anticipate seeing on any of those fronts looking ahead?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: If you think about the longer-term trend there, we had a big change in terms of fee
structures in the Consumer businesses broadly going back a few years ago, and you came through all that and that
affected. What's happened now is if you just look at our cards activity, our purchases on our cards are up by 5% or so
quarter to last year to this quarter – first quarter last year to first quarter this year. So we continue to see better than
market growth in the activity levels, general spending levels and things like that, which helps on the interchange once
we got off the reductions that were due to the changes in interchange rules. And so I think it will keep grinding forward
based on just general activity. Most of the real downdraft came out in 2011, 2012, early 2013 timeframe.

<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think another point too is if you look at within the Consumer business, we actually saw –
service charges during the quarter were up about 3% on a year-over-year basis. Some of the card income tends to be
seasonally higher in the fourth quarter. It drops in the first quarter then builds back up. But within the Consumer space,
we were pleased with what we saw on the service charge line during the quarter.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: So if you go back and look at slide 17, we've been producing from a 700,000 to 800,000
run rate in new cards to 1 million-plus, and those cards are being used as a core card by the customers. And that's
driving up – the pay rate is still high. So the balances aren't moving much, but the activity underneath it is moving. And
we're still replacing some affinity portfolios that we have – we've sold and things like that. So our view is that the
transactional behavior of our customers continues to grow and we'll benefit some of the fee lines through this.

We'll go next to Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael L. Mayo>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Good morning.
<Q - Michael L. Mayo>: First just a couple of follow-ups. So how much of the New BAC savings were achieved by
the end of the quarter?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: You should look at relative to the $2 billion a quarter, we're in the $1.7 billion area.
<Q - Michael L. Mayo>: All right, so you have $300 million left per quarter to be achieved by mid-2015?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: That's correct.
<Q - Michael L. Mayo>: Okay. And then the LAS savings, you have another $500 million a quarter to be achieved by
the end of the year?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: That's correct.
<Q - Michael L. Mayo>: All right. So $800 million total quarterly expense savings we should expect over the next
year or so. So should we expect all that to hit the bottom line?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: You should expect it to hit the bottom line with just the one caveat that to the extent that
there are revenue-related things that have costs attached to them, that could moderate that reduction. But ultimately,
that would be a positive to the pre-tax income line.
<Q - Michael L. Mayo>: Okay. And do you have an efficiency target for the firm? I'm just looking at page three of the
supplement, and the efficiency ratio is thrown off by the charges. It's been the 70s% the last few quarters. And 97.68%,
I don't think you consider that your core efficiency ratio. So what do you consider your core efficiency ratio and where
should it be and where do you hope to get, when do you hope to get there?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: If you go back and look at what we talked about in the fourth quarter where we talked but
where we'd like to get to from an ROA, return on tangible common equity, and we talked about once rates started to
move up that as we look out in a couple years that efficiency ratio should be in the high 50s%.
<Q - Michael L. Mayo>: Okay. So do you have a specific timeframe for that or just when rates go up?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think as we look at it, it's at the point in time that rates are up roughly 100 basis points
across the curve. And obviously, to the extent that we don't see rates move up, we're going to need to run harder on

expenses to try to get it to the extent that the rate environment doesn't move up.
<Q - Michael L. Mayo>: Shifting gears, the tax rate excluding the mortgage charge for the first quarter was what?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I believe it was roughly – I think it was about – somewhere between 58% and 60%.
<Q - Michael L. Mayo>: I'm sorry. The tax rate, you said the tax rate going ahead will be 31%.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Right.
<Q - Michael L. Mayo>: I'm just trying to figure out. What was the core tax rate for this quarter excluding the charge?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: The core tax rate we project out and look out over the year, so the core would have been
31%. But you always have a little bit of noise when you – and obviously it was a pre-tax loss but the discrete items
always overwhelm things in a low period. But the base rate from which you're starting from is 31%, and it was just a
little bit skewed given what we saw from a pre-tax loss perspective.
<Q - Michael L. Mayo>: Okay. You had record Wealth Management for the quarter. And one of the online brokers
recently said that the big brokerage firms are doing better. How much do you attribute the record Wealth Management
to the environment versus what you're doing versus it's better to be a big broker?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I'm not sure what the context is, Mike. But the net flows in the Wealth Management
business were around $11 billion, $12 billion this quarter, which was $17 billion to $18 billion due to long-term flows
and $6 billion of short-term liquidity flows out, so net to us around $12 billion. If you look in the Merrill Edge
platform, which is more akin to the online type of thing, I think we had 80,000-plus new accounts this quarter. The
assets continue to grow. It topped $100 billion. Daily average trades, DARTs are up I think 25% to 30% year over year.
And so it continues to progress and there continues to be good asset flows there too. So I think small, large, traditional,
all that blended together, we operate as a core consolidated franchise, you're seeing good momentum on both sides.
<Q - Michael L. Mayo>: You're allocating more capital to GWIM as well as Global Banking and Global Markets. Is
that increased capital allocation due to regulatory capital changes or a deliberate move by you guys to invest more for
growth in those segments?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Let me just start. The allocation of capital is how we take the capital that we have at the
company and push it out to the businesses. I think you need to go segment by segment within that, Mike. I think the
first is that as you look at the Global Banking segment and look at the allocation and what we've done, the first is on a
year-over-year basis you have average loans up about $30 billion. So there were more loan balances against which you
need to allocate capital. The second thing that I would say is as you look at that segment and you consider Basel III
standardized ratios, they tend to risk-weight almost all commercial loans at 100% regardless of what the models would
suggest they should be risk-weighted at. So I think the combination of the loan growth along with some of the impacts
from regulatory capital led us to increase what we did with respect to Global Banking.
Within Global Wealth Management, as you go back and refine operational loss models and assign operational risk
capital, that was topped up as well as reflecting the fact within the Wealth Management business that we've seen loan
growth within that segment, so there was additional money allocated there. And then as we look at and just continue to
refine and look at both comparables as well as asset mix, we thought it was prudent to increase modestly what we saw
within Global Markets. And as I said in my comments, I think when you consider it in the aggregate and we look at
where we're at relative to peers, we've got virtually all of our capital at this point pushed out to the different businesses,
which is the way it should be.
<Q - Michael L. Mayo>: I agree, so it sounds like it's partly business growth and partly regulatory related and partly a
desire simply to have less unallocated capital?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think the last one is what you've got to keep focused on.
<Q - Michael L. Mayo>: Okay. And then lastly, the Bank of New York ruling was good. I did not expect that, but you
still had a $6 billion charge this quarter and another $2.4 billion extra charge in the last 15 work days since the FHFA

amount was announced. And I know you've had several questions on the call. But what's left as far as potential legal
charges? Because it seems just so lumpy and that in just a few weeks you could have another $2.4 billion charge
seemingly out of the blue for some of us. What's left?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think when you look at it, as I commented, I think we give fairly fulsome disclosure in
the 10-K as it relates to the matters that are out there. And when you look at the matters and compare where we are now
to what's out there that obviously from the case that FHFA was resolved, and that was the $3.6 billion number we
mentioned, you've seen resolutions during the quarter from an Allstate RMBS perspective. You saw a resolution of
force-placed insurance. You saw CFPB OCC, and you saw the deal that we completed and announced with FGIC
today. So as you work through and look at those matters, it largely reflects disclosed [ph] leaves (1:12:40) with respect
to one monoline; and then in addition to the monoline, the other remaining legacy mortgage related matters that we put
out in our disclosure.
<Q - Michael L. Mayo>: All right, thank you.
Operator
We'll go next to Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Thanks very much, good morning. Let me just start out by saying on the litigation front, I
actually thought it was very good that you've provided now for a bunch of the issues that are actually still pretty visible
out there, so that's just a thank you for having done that. I have a question for you on the control environment costs.
Some of your competitors, JPMorgan and Citi, have spoken to $1 billion type numbers for increased control
environment costs in the wake of CCAR issues over the last few years and obviously all of the heightened scrutiny. I
was wondering if you could give us a sense for what your control cost increases have been over the last year or two.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Rather than give you a number, let me give you a way to think about it. In our
environment coming out of the extreme issues in 2008 and 2009, we built a lot of personnel and head count to get at
this stuff, and we're still finishing up the cleanup. And so if you look at the expense base, a lot of that has been in the
expense base for a couple years. And so if you think about something like our audit team, we've doubled the size of our
audit team in 2010, and it's been held pretty constant against the backdrop where we probably divested tens of
businesses and the rest of the head count in the company has come down fairly dramatically from of a high of around
305,000, I think. So the amount of control environment relative to the total cost structure has gone up. But the raw
numbers haven't gone up as dramatically because frankly we've put them back, a lot of them in in the 2010 – 2011
timeframe.
So it is our duty to get it right. It is our duty to keep working on it and make sure that we get these things wrestled to
the ground. But one of the key ways that we're doing this is by focusing the scope of the company. So the force-placed
– excuse me, the add-on product settlement this quarter, we quit offering those products a while ago. It just took a while
with the OCC and the Consumer Bureau to finish up the negotiations and finish up the rebate. We've been sending
money back to customers but we quit offering the product, as an example. And so the idea of narrowing the product
sets, narrowing the geographic scope of the company, making the company a lot less complex, we'll always be big but
we make ourselves less complex, but against that a growing – a strong growth in the total costs in the 2009, 2010, 2011
timeframe and then a flattening of that but relative to a smaller company is actually an increase.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Thanks, Bruce. That's helpful color certainly in terms of thinking about the timing. You did
allude to some increase in technology investment in GWIM, and obviously the margin there contracted a little bit.
Maybe you can give us a little bit of a sense for what this is. I think you alluded to MerrillONE.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: MerrillONE is a new product they brought out and it's been successful. And like anything
else, you put the product out there, you spend all the money to put the product together, and then the assets come on,
and so we are feeling good about that. Tens of billions of dollars of assets have moved to the platform. It is a good
platform for the customers and for the advisors.

I think more broadly, I talked about technology. If you looked at the expenses we had going back after the crisis, we
still had the Merrill transition expenses. And all in, we were spending around $3 billion on technology development a
year. We now spend about $3.5 billion, and obviously the transition expenses are out of there. So everything we're
spending is to better the platform, better the business, invest in the growth. And again, some of the early questions
about cost, that number I don't expect to change going forward because it takes that kind of technology investment to
drive the product capabilities of our company, MerrillONE being one product this quarter along with a new card
system, a new trading platform.
Tom [Montag] and his team are in the middle of putting in a new backbone for the company in terms of our general
accounting systems, which is in the tail end of going in across the board. So across a four of five-year format timeframe
we'll replace almost every system in the company, but we'd expect that to continue. So the GWIM, we swung around
off of last year. We did more in other businesses. Cash Management, we started building, rebuilt the front-end
mortgage process and a lot of other things. This year we swung more to GWIM, and it's really a decision of which
business we invest in at which time, and they asked more investment this year.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Thanks. And then final one for me, you gave the leverage ratio as being above the 5% and
the 6% requirements based on the most recent NPR. Subsequent to that, I guess Basel came out in March with some
suggested changes to the netting on a standardized basis for counterparty credit. And I was wondering if you have any
sense at this point what the impact on the leverage would be of those changes if implemented.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think the final supplementary leverage ratio rules that reflected that came out in April.
And so the numbers that we've given you that were above the 5% at the parent and the 6% at the bank reflects the
impact of those rules with respect to netting and the other changes. So the numbers we've given you reflect that April
release.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: That's from the Fed, right, that's there the April release from the Fed?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: That's correct.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Right. No, what I was referring to was that Basel had come out with something in March,
which one would assume that eventually the Fed will adopt for the standardized approach to counterparty credit. And I
think JPM alluded on Friday to the idea that that could add, depending on whether you look at the holding company or
the bank units upwards of 20 basis points to the leverage ratio because it takes into account the [ph] net (1:19:35) to a
greater extent. And I was wondering if you had done any preliminary work on that.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: No, I think we'll say that our focus has been on wrapping up the work given what the
April pronouncement is. And my understanding was that the Fed – I think what came out in April is what we're
assuming that we're going to need to operate in. And if there's something else that changes, where there's some benefit
that's great, but our assumption is we're going to be living with what came out on April 8.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. Okay, thanks very much. I appreciate that.

<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: If I could just follow up on the net interest income comment, I guess just bigger
picture, it seems like the outlook is a little bit lower than what you had previously thought. And I guess I think about
building liquidity tends to be dilutive to NIM but not net interest income dollars, and some of the things you point to
are seasonal. So just like big picture, I guess when you think about where you had thought NII might be a couple
quarters ago looking out, what's worse? Is it more runoff than you thought, less loan growth because you're tightening

up versus what some others are doing, or is it just the rates haven't moved at all or some combination of all that?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I'll make a couple points. If you go back the guidance that we've given is that we would
grind up from roughly a $10.5 billion number. And as we look out to the third and fourth quarter, that's what we see in
our numbers. I do think there have been relative to if you go back two, three, four quarters ago, several things that have
changed. The first thing is that as we've worked hard to get in the position that we're in from an LCR perspective, we
have migrated – and not only LCR but with the rate environment that we're in managing the OCI risk that we have
directed more of the investment portfolio to shorter-dated Treasuries as the mortgage-backed securities. And as you go
out over a couple of quarters, that has a negative impact.
The second thing, as you look at where we are and you look at the forward curve, our assumptions on what deals are
going to be that we can reinvest in outside of the switch in mix, obviously those yields have not moved to the extent
that the forwards curves would have suggested at that point. And I would say generally with respect to the loan
portfolio, I wouldn't say there's much change. I do think the one thing to note that we've not talked about, if you look
within our Global Banking segment, this is the first quarter in a while where we've actually seen the loan pricing spread
stabilize and actually in certain of the portfolios move up a touch, so that's a positive.
So I don't think there's anything, to your question, that's material. There are just some small things here and there. And
we wanted to update and share our thoughts with what we thought the second quarter would be. But longer term I think
we're still in the same place as far as the $10.5 billion grinding up.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Okay. And then just switching topics, on the core LAS costs, so ex-all the litigations,
you reiterated the target for year end I think of about $1 billion or $1.1 billion. Do you still feel good about the $500
million per quarter late next year?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yes.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Okay. And is that something that we could see overshoot to the downside like we're
seeing in charge-offs? Obviously, credit is getting much better than a lot of us would have thought a couple years ago.
Do you think those core LAS costs end up just being much lower than expected once you work through all the issues?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I hope so but I wouldn't – let's just get it down to that level and we'll figure out what we
can do from there. It's been an arduous task and there's still a lot of work ahead.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Okay. And then just lastly on the SLR again, do you just care to provide any more
details in terms of how much above 5%, how much about 6% roughly?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I would say we've said we're above 5%. We've said that assuming that the Buffett
preferred amendment gets done, that adds roughly another 10 basis points, which obviously helps move us up. And you
can assume that the bank ratio relative to the limit is stronger than where we are with the parent today. But once again,
the Buffett amendment will help.
<Q - Matthew D. O'Connor>: Okay, all right. Thank you.

about 25% of your risk-weighted assets. In doing that in the past, I found it's very sticky. And how do you think you

<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Your point, Marty, is a good one, which is that the operational risk models are based on a
fairly long time period as we look at it. And one of the things that we do continue to try to discuss and stress is that a lot
of those operational risk losses are with respect to activities that we no longer engage and have no intention to engage,
so some of that dialogue does continue. But your point, which is a fair one, is that the time periods are fairly long and it
will remain out there until the data runs out. I wish there was more that I can say, but your point is a fair one.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Is the only true way is just to almost disembark from mortgage because there was so
much in that particular area, the only way to clean up is to say maybe if that's all related to those mortgage-related
settlements that it's just not worth carrying that baggage going forward even though it wasn't really your fault, it was
the Countrywide legacy more than it was your own operations?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think your point, Marty, is the one that we're working through. In effect we've done what
you suggested that we've done in that if you look at those activities that led to those losses, we are no longer engaged in
those activities. If you look out at – we are not doing business with monolines from a new wrap perspective. You look
at private label securitization, that activity was rep and warrant. It is not continuing. So we think we've largely done
that, and I think the question just going forward is if you've proven and you clearly are outside of the activity, is there
any relief to be had? Not the way that it works now, we'll just have to work through and deal with it.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Got you. Secondly, you called out that mortgage servicing hedging was unfavorable this
quarter. If you look at the environment, it seemed like I've seen in others that it was actually a positive, not a negative.
What was in particular happening in your mortgage servicing hedging?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: There was really nothing. I think that the comment that we made was that it was a
question of the hedging performance this quarter relative to a year ago. So the hedging was still a positive number; it
was just less so on a year-over-year basis.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: Got you. And then lastly, when you think about moving from your mortgage-backed
securities into agencies and Treasuries that have shorter durations, that's throwing you to become more asset sensitive.
Are you thinking about because the liquidity rules are making the balance sheet become more asset sensitive,
employing more interest rate swaps or off-balance sheet hedging to rebalance and not become so much more asset
sensitive due to these other pressures?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: If you go back, we've been pretty consistent that the reason for the investment portfolio is
to preserve the long-term value of the deposits. And as you look at that portfolio, it's very clear there are only three
things that we do within that portfolio. There are Treasury securities. There are agency securities and there are AA and
AAA super-sovereign type activities. And as it relates to becoming a little bit more asset sensitive, we just think given
the – first and you've seen a large portion of it happen; that to drive and get to the point we have with LCR, the shift in
the portfolio helped this quarter. It has the same benefit, as I said, of shrinking and reducing your OCI risk as you go
through this. And we're not interested in starting to try to do things from a derivative and other perspective to somehow
change that. The investment portfolio needs to work with how we set it up, and we're going to be prudent with respect
to how we do it.
<Q - Marty Lacey Mosby>: All right, thanks.

<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Question on the Mortgage business. I think there was an article in the Wall Street Journal
this morning or somewhere that the business is getting off to a slower start than we would have thought given the
spring bounce-back that was expected from the winter weather. Has there been any rethinking, Brian, on the eventual
size and direction of the Mortgage business there?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Look, Nancy, we did that in 2011. We got out of all the direct-to-consumer. So basically
we have focused the business on really supporting the core customer base and not trying to drive standalone market
share in the scheme of things. And so what has happened with that is as we sold off the non-core servicing, we've
gotten down to a significant less number of loans serviced. And your originations, $10 billion just this quarter, are all
direct-to-consumer, which is the second-highest total in the country of direct-to-consumer mortgages. So I think we're
comfortable where we are.
Now the question is, putting LAS aside, the core business, what does it look like? And it will be a small business,
smaller business. It will generate mortgages for our customers because it's a core product they need. But also that sales
force, quite frankly, sells other products and does other things for us. It refers people for other products. So I think that
the days of being 20% market share and stuff are far behind us. The days of being 4% market share direct-to-consumer
and growing are there, and we'll make some money in it and we'll make some money servicing those core loans to the
delinquency statistics in those and what we've been doing in that are far superior to even what we would have
predicted, and that's how we'll run the business. So effectively, we've done what you said. It's just that we're still bound
by the overhang of effectively the LAS portfolio still working through the system and the 300,000 delinquent
mortgages, of which only about – the delinquency of the core portfolio is about 50,000 – 60,000 of that.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Also, could you make a similar pronouncement about the card business, where you stand in
terms of share and growth right now? And are you where you want to be?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: That's different in the sense that on the card side we actually took it down unfortunately
through charge-offs in 2009 – 2010 more than not. But I think we've been relatively consistent on a domestic piece
around $90-odd billion of outstandings and grinding up and down from there and producing more cards that are coming
out of the wallet first from our customer from 700,000 we showed you two years ago first quarter to 1 million-plus this
quarter. And pretty consistently it was 1 million-plus in the third quarter and almost 1 million in the fourth quarter,
another 1 million-plus this quarter.
But the core of what we see there is actually usage of those cards. They're sold 50%-plus to our primary customers, but
also usage of the cards because of the core three or four card products that's driving it. And we have some good affinity
programs. I think the card business likewise, it is we want it but it's a bit more of a payment stream business than it is a
pure lending business as it was in some of the past. So the balances ought to be stable and ought to grow. But with the
high-quality portfolio, the payment rate is in the 20%s now. People pay us off because they're using it as a transaction
card.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: And then just finally, Bruce, you indicated that net interest income is going to decline
somewhat due to liquidity issues, et cetera. Is that then going to be true of the NIM, or is there anything in the mix
change coming in the near term that can send the NIM up or the adjusted NIM up from this 2.36% level?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I just want to be clear. To the extent that we thought that the core NII ex-market related
impact would be down slightly in the second quarter and then build modestly through the rest of the year, what you will
see in the second quarter given that you have a full quarter of the liquidity that's on the books, you would expect to see
the NIM in the second quarter moderate little bit given that you've got the full quarter of the liquidity. And then
obviously, as it starts to grow during the latter half of the year, you'd expect the NIM to follow that.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Nancy, overall now that we have a better insight as to what these rules are, we then have to
go back and – we've got a 7% tangible common equity ratio, so we have very strong [ph] tangible (1:33:35) common
equity ratio. We have to go back and look at – Bruce actually with the rules now in hand, you can start to go work and
say okay, how do we optimize the next round because in terms of how we create maximum liquidity per dollar at a
balance sheet size, right?

We'll take our last question from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning, Jim.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Good morning. Hopefully, I'll keep these two quick. Just first on home equity net
charge-offs, I guess if you exclude the TDR impact last quarter, they were up and so were home equity NPLs. Can you
talk through what's going on there?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Sure. There were two things that, Jim, banged us up, good questions, to the tune of about
$50 million each. There was some home equity stuff that we just wrote off that was going to have foreclosure costs that
were greater than what it was going to be worth to try to get repaid, so that happened during the quarter. And then the
second thing is there was some regulatory guidance that was given as it related to second-lien loans that were behind
first liens that had been modified or charged off that we saw during the quarter. We think we got most of it in this
quarter. There may be a little bit left in the second quarter. But it's good question. Those two items banged us up to the
tune of about $100 million, and that was the reason for the change.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay, that's helpful. And then just on the Investment Banking pipeline, any commentary?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think what we've seen is the overall markets continued to be strong. The pipeline and the
amount of activity and discussions from an M&A perspective is encouraging. And I would say as we go forward that
we talked about we felt the pipeline was strong at the end of the year. And as we look at the pipelines, they've not
changed materially one way or the other at the end of the first quarter versus the end of the year. And as we said, we
feel very good about the quarter with the revenue side being north of $1.5 billion and the highest of any firm that's
reported at this point.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay, that's great. That's it for me, thanks.
