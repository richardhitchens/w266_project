Now, I would like to turn the call over to Gerald Hassell. Gerald?
Gerald L. Hassell
Thanks, Valerie, and good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us today. Our performance in the quarter capped
a solid year of delivering for our shareholders. Throughout 2014, we demonstrated our focus on and commitment to
controlling expenses to create positive operating leverage. We were disciplined in our efforts to continue to drive
profitable revenue growth. We maintained our strong capital position and executed on our capital plan. And we created
value added solutions for our clients and good returns for our shareholders.
So looking at the full year, earnings per share were up 5% on an adjusted basis. We generated significant positive
operating leverage, even while absorbing elevated regulatory compliance costs and investing in our business to support
future growth. Approximately 79% of our earnings were returned to our shareholders in the form of dividends and
share repurchases. Now, if you exclude a couple of the sizable gains that we had, our payout ratio was 94%, which is in
line with our targeted payout ratio objective of 80% to 100%.
And from a total shareholder return perspective, we outperformed the trust banks, the S&P 500 Financials, and the
median of our 11-member peer group in 2014. We also achieved that same feat over a three-year period, which is really
nice to see. So all in all, a good year. We got a lot done.
Now focusing on the fourth quarter in comparison to the same quarter a year ago, I'll provide you with some high level
overview and Todd will take you through the financial details. Earnings per share were $0.70, which included $0.12 per
share primarily for a previously disclosed tax benefit, net of litigation and restructuring charges. Importantly, on an
adjusted EPS basis, we were up 7%, year-over-year. We believe we did an excellent job in demonstrating our expense
discipline and we are confident that it is sustainable.
Now, just as a reminder, some of the actions that we've taken include rationalizing staffing levels, insourcing
application development, reducing our real estate portfolio, simplifying our operating environment, and focusing on all
of those little items and big items in the discretionary expense category.
Now, these actions are paying off, as total adjusted expenses were down 5% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Now
as we pointed out at our Investor Day conference, we are committed to EPS growth in all environments as we work
through the challenges of low interest rates and increased regulatory compliance requirements, which are impacting the
industry at large.
Now, looking at Investment Services, during the quarter, we delivered solid growth in asset servicing, which was up
4%, clearing services was up 7%, and treasury services was up 6%. Now, those areas of strength more than offset the
decline in issuer services, which was down 19% due to seasonality and Depositary Receipts and the episodic nature of
that business, as well as the ongoing maturation of high value securitizations in Corporate Trust.
Now, the good news is we are increasingly confident that we are near the inflection point for the improved revenue
growth in Corporate Trust. I should add that assets under custody or administration were up 3%, to $28.5 trillion, and
we had $130 billion in new assets under custody and administration wins in asset servicing.
Now, turning to investment management and performance fees, they actually declined 2%. Our Investment
Management was most impacted by the strength of the U.S. dollar. If adjusted for currency swings, fees would have
been up 2%. Now also impacting our business results were lower performance fees versus a strong quarter a year ago.
Now, assets under management increased 8% to a new record of $1.71 trillion, benefiting from improved equity market
values and net new business. During the quarter, we had long-term inflows of $27 billion, reflecting continued strength
in our liability-driven investment strategies, and we also had short-term inflows of $5 billion.

Wealth Management fees were also up 5%. Now as you know, we've been investing and expanding our Wealth
Management sales force and entering new markets. Those efforts are starting to generate revenue, which we are very
pleased to see.
Now, we've also been working to position Investment Services and Investment Management for long-term success by
focusing on several areas for growth. Within Investment Services, collateral services is a great example. Usage of our
optimization, segregation and securities financing solutions have been increasing, and as a result, the revenue
contribution from these services have been growing very nicely. Now, another example is foreign exchange, where we
have enhanced our platform. We're now capturing more volume as clients are increasingly utilizing our electronic
trading capabilities.
In Investment Management, some of the strategic initiatives we've discussed are coming through in the results. I have
already mentioned Wealth Management growth initiatives, and how that's beginning to generate revenues. But we've
also focused on expanding distribution of our investment solutions through the intermediary channels and further
accessing our Pershing platform that services broker-dealers and financial advisors. Now, these are just a few examples
of where we're investing in growth that leverage our strengths and business synergies to further extend our competitive
advantages.
Turning to capital. It remains very strong even after investing in our businesses to fuel future growth. And also
importantly, we repurchased 11 million shares during the quarter, for $432 million. And we also delivered a strong
return on tangible common equity of 16% on an adjusted basis for the quarter, and 18% on the same basis for the full
year.
So turning to 2015, we remain confident in our ability to execute on the strategic priorities we shared with you back in
October. They include driving further improvement in productivity and service quality while reducing cost and risk
throughout the organization; investing in opportunities that will help us deliver innovative solutions and differentiate
our service offerings; achieving profitable revenue growth; and maintaining a strong capital position while returning
significant levels of excess capital to our shareholders. And we continue to look for ways to deliver even greater value
to clients and shareholders.
Now, we have implemented processes, capabilities and organizational enhancements that are making us more efficient
and effective. And we have added new executive talent to our leadership team and to our board to complement our
existing expertise that will help drive the execution of our plan. So with that, I'll turn it over to Todd.
Thomas P. Gibbons
Thanks, Gerald, and good morning, everyone. My commentary will follow the financial highlights document, starting
with page six. That details our non-GAAP results for the quarter. As Gerald noted, reported EPS was $0.70, that
includes the $0.12 benefit related to the tax carryback claim, and it is also netted of litigation and restructuring charges
in the quarter.
We had a number of items impacting our fourth quarter and our full year results. The larger of which we've listed on
page 21. So as I go through this report, I'll focus on the numbers adjusted for those items.
Revenue in the fourth quarter was down approximately 3% year-over-year, as strong growth in asset servicing, clearing
services, and treasury services was offset by lower issuer services fees and performance fees. Expenses were
significantly lower year-over-year and down slightly sequentially, representing our continued expense discipline, and
the progress on driving efficiency and transformation.
Our strong commitment to expense control resulted in us generating 232 basis points of positive operating leverage
year-over-year on an adjusted basis. Income before taxes was up year-over-year. On a year-over-year basis, our pre-tax
margin increased approximately 200 basis points to 28% from 26% in the fourth quarter of 2013. Return on tangible
common equity remains strong at 16%.

We had a modest negative impact to pre-tax income from a stronger U.S. dollar, that's for the whole company. It
reduced – and this is in the fourth quarter – it reduced our revenue and expense each by approximately 1%. At the
business unit level, the currency impact was unfavorable to Investment Management and slightly favorable to
Investment Services. Our capital ratios were not affected by the currency moves.
For the full year, shown on page nine, revenue declined slightly and expenses were down even more, enabling us to
generate 87 basis points of positive operating leverage, or 190 basis points if you exclude investment and other income
and securities gains. Income before taxes was up slightly, and our operating margin remained unchanged from the prior
year at 28%. EPS for the full year was up 5%. Return on tangible common equity for the full year was approximately
18%.
Page 10 shows the drivers of our Investment Management business that help explain the underlying performance. In the
fourth quarter, we achieved record AUM of $1.71 trillion, that's up 8% year-over-year, and driven by the equity market
values, new business, and was partially offset by the dollar impact.
During the quarter, we had long-term net inflows of $27 billion, and that reflected the continued strength in the
liability-driven fixed income and alternative investments. Short-term net inflows were also positive. They were up $5
billion. For the full year, we experienced net long-term inflows of $48 billion.
We had net outflows and equities in the fourth quarter and we also had them on a full year basis. And that's been
consistent with what we've seen elsewhere in the industry.
Our Wealth Management business continues to perform well. Average loans and deposits continue to trend up nicely.
Turning to page 11, you can see our financial results for Investment Management, I'll touch on just a few points before
I move on to Investment Services. Performance fees were $882 million, which – I mean excuse me, investment
management and performance fees, which includes the performance fees of $44 million. Investment management fees
reflects the dollar impact, also benefited, however, by higher equity market values. Compared to the third quarter of
2014, our performance fees doubled from $22 million. That is a seasonal event for us. And as Gerald noted,
performance fees were lower versus a much stronger than average year-ago quarter.
Other revenue was $7 million in the fourth quarter compared with $43 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, and $16
million in the third quarter. The year-over-year decrease primarily reflects lower other revenue related to hedging
activity within a boutique and also lower seed capital gains. The hedge is designed to mitigate the impact of market
movements in future fee revenues. Given the substantial growth in related AUM, we'd expect future revenues to more
than offset the loss on the hedge.
Income before taxes, excluding amortization of intangible assets and the charge related to investment management
funds net of incentives, was 8% lower year-over-year and essentially unchanged sequentially. If you adjust for the other
revenue and currency impact, the earnings would have been up 7%.
Turning to our Investment Services metrics on page 12, you can see that assets under custody and administration at
quarter end were $28.5 trillion, that's up 3% year-over-year, primarily reflecting higher market values and net new
business, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. Linked quarter, AUC/A was also higher.
Many of our other key Investment Services metrics show growth on a year-over-year basis. The market value of
securities on loan at period end again showed strong growth, especially as compared to the fourth quarter of 2013.
Securities on loan were up 23% to $289 billion, largely due to higher levels of equity collateral, as well as higher value
of fixed income and equity securities.
Average loans and deposits were both up. Our key broker-dealer metric of average tri-party repo balances also grew.
All of our clearing metrics recorded solid gains with DARTS volume and average long-term mutual fund assets each
showing double digit growth.
Looking at the DR program metrics, you'll see that we had a focus on exiting low activity programs and programs that
did not meet profitability criteria. This combined with routine disclosures due to corporate actions has resulted in a net

decline in the number of DR programs in our portfolio.
On page 13, you can see detailed segment reporting for Investment Services. The key variances are reflected in fee and
other revenue and our consolidated results on page 14.
Moving to that page, you'll see that asset servicing fees were up 4% year-over-year and down 1% sequentially. The
year-over-year increase primarily reflects organic growth and net new business, partially offset by the unfavorable
impact of a stronger U.S. dollar. The sequential decrease primarily reflects the impact of the dollar, and it was also
offset a little bit by new business.
Clearing services fees were up 7% year-over-year and up 3% sequentially. Both increases were driven by higher
clearance revenue reflecting higher DARTS volume. The year-over-year increase also reflects higher mutual fund and
asset-based fees.
Issuer service fees were down 19% year-over-year and 39% sequentially. The year-over-year decrease reflects lower
corporate actions and dividend fees in Depositary Receipts. The sequential decrease is primarily related to seasonality
in Depositary Receipts, but that was partially offset by slightly higher Corporate Trust fees. We are pleased to see signs
that Corporate Trust revenue is stabilizing as expected.
Treasury services fees were up 6% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, as we saw higher payment volumes. FX and
other trading was up 3% year-over-year and down slightly sequentially. For this line item, you can also refer to the
table at the top of page eight in the earnings press release, to see the details I'm going to go through right now.
FX revenue of $165 million was up 31% year-over-year, and up 7% sequentially and that reflected higher volumes and
volatility in both periods. In the fourth quarter, we did see a seasonal drop in DR-related activity that offset some of the
effect of the higher volatility. In other trading, we had a loss of $14 million, which compared with revenue of $20
million in the year-ago quarter, and a loss of $1 million sequentially. Both period comparison decreases in other trading
revenue primarily reflect lower fixed income derivatives trading, since we're exiting our derivatives sales and trading
businesses, as well as losses on hedging activities within one of the Investment Management boutiques that I discussed
earlier. Partially offsetting this was the favorable impact of interest rate hedging activity, which was offset elsewhere in
net interest revenue.
Turning to the net interest revenue on page 15 of the financial highlights, you'll see that NIR on a fully taxable
equivalent basis was down 7% versus the year ago-quarter, and down slightly from Q3. The year-over-year decrease
primarily resulted from lower asset yields and higher premium amortization on agency mortgage-backed securities. As
you may recall in the fourth quarter last year, a sharp rise in interest rates temporarily slowed the amortization of
premium on mortgage backed securities. The year-over-year decrease also reflects lower accretion and the impact of
interest rate hedging, which is primarily offset in other trading.
The decrease was partially offset by a change in the mix of assets, and the higher average interest earning assets driven
by higher deposits. So we did see a little bit of growth in deposits. The sequential decrease in NIR was driven by the
impact of the interest rate hedging of approximately $13 million, and that's offset in the other trading revenue. In the
fourth quarter, we completed our plan to reduce interbank placements and increase our high quality liquid assets in the
securities portfolio to better and more efficiently comply with the evolving liquidity requirements.
On page 16, you'll see that non-interest expense decreased by 5% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Both
comparisons reflect lower staff expense, lower asset based taxes and the favorable impact of a stronger dollar. That was
partially offset by higher professional, legal, and other purchase service expenses. The increase in that line item was
primarily related to the implementation of strategic platforms to support future revenue growth. Both comparisons also
reflect the fluctuations in business development expenses, which was higher quarter-over-quarter and lower
year-over-year.
Turning to capital on page 17, capital ratios were flat. That's largely driven by an adjustment in the other
comprehensive income related to pension liabilities, reflected changes in the discount rate as well as the mortality
assumptions there. Our estimated supplemental leverage ratio declined by 10 basis points to 450 basis points, and that

was driven by a modest increase in quarterly average total assets. One final note about the quarter, as you'll see in our
release, our effective tax rate was 9.4%, which includes a 16.5% benefit related to the previously disclosed approval of
a tax carryback claim, and the impact of a consolidated investment management fund.
Now, a few points to factor into your thinking about the first quarter. We would expect total staff expense to increase
sequentially by approximately $100 million from the fourth quarter, and that's driven primarily by the acceleration of
long-term incentive compensation expense. As you recall, that typically takes place in the first quarter of each year.
Occupancy costs should rise by about $7.5 million related to the sale of One Wall Street, as we are planning to move
into our new headquarters. That will result in double rent in 2015. That rent will – that will more than reverse itself in
2016, when we begin to see the quarterly benefit from consolidating our New York space.
We also need to note that we are subject to the European Resolution Fund in 2015, although we're not certain of the
actual expense that might create. We believe the impact of all of these items, offset somewhat by our expense
management efforts, should result in expenses up around 1% to 2% in the first quarter of 2015, versus the first quarter
of 2014. This is as expected and well within our Investor Day guidelines.
Net interest revenue should be about at the level we saw in the third quarter. The effective tax rate should be around
26% to 27%.
So to summarize, we had a good quarter. Overall, we're pleased to see the results of the expense control efforts falling
to the bottom line and creating significant positive operating leverage. As we look ahead, we're focused on creating
value for our clients and shareholders by driving organic revenue growth, and by continuing to be relentless in the
pursuit of additional efficiencies and the savings as we execute on the strategic plan that we discussed at Investor Day.
We are also focused on maintaining our expense discipline to reduce costs and maintaining our strong capital position.
With that, let me hand it back to Gerald.
Gerald L. Hassell
Great, Todd, thanks a lot. And, Wendy, I think we can open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. At this time, we are ready to begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first
question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hey, thanks very much. So looking through all the disclosure, I'm not sure I missed it yet, but
have you disclosed what you think your TLAC ratio is, and where you need to be?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, we have not, Glenn. We would estimate that we're probably around 20%. We do
have a fair amount of debt at the holding company, as you can see. I think the talk out there, the ranges are 16% to
20%. At this time, there's a proposal but I don't think it's adequately defined to really go much beyond that.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: And just making sure, the 20% does not exclude your – the buffers which, for you guys, isn't
as big as most, but that's another 3.5 off. Okay. The bottom line is you're in a reasonably comfortable range is the
bottom line?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: From what we can tell at this point.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. And then I apologize, I missed all the commentary on the $14 million loss in other
trading related to the fixed income trading. So, one, if you could just repeat, what was it specifically related to? And

then, two, am I reading too much into – in the exiting the business that should not repeat, is the balance sheet related to
that business all closed out? I'm just curious on where we're at in that process.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Okay. Well, there are really three kind of unusual items in there, Glenn. One is that the
exit did – and certainly on a year-over-year basis had an impact because he had pretty decent revenues there in the
fourth quarter of last year, but we did incur some losses in the exit process. We could see some little impact on a
go-forward impact basis, we wouldn't expect it to be much one way or the other. Obviously, we're not going to see an
increase in revenues as we exit. To answer kind of second question there, it has had some modest reduction in our
trading assets at this point and we'll continue to see that reduce going forward.
So, A, it was the derivatives exit. The second thing that went on in there is we had a hedge in one of our boutiques
against fee revenues that – that hedge actually had a loss. And those two things were partially offset by gains on our
interest rate hedging, which actually was a negative to interest rates but a positive to other trading. That's where the
minus $14 million came from.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. I appreciate it. That's my one and one.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Okay, thanks, Glenn.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Thanks, Glenn.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: You got it?
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: Hi, good morning, guys. I was wondering if you could just give us a little bit more
detail in terms of magnitude, when we try to separate what the impact on Investment Management fees and Servicing
fees is from the FX translation, and then kind of underlying growth that we don't quite see on the surface because of it.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, the – so if you look at it, Ken, it's about – it's probably a little bit over 1% on the
overall revenue growth rate, and a little bit over that on the expense rate. So that puts you – maybe talking around $40
million or so in the quarter.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: On total revenues?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah. And so if you really look at the drivers of the revenues in the quarter, it's a
combination of that, and what we saw in issuer services. So issuer services was down substantially both sequentially on
a year-over-year basis. That tends – that's almost all DRs, and that tends to be episodic. And so last year, we saw quite
a few transactions that fell – or we saw some transactions that fell into the fourth quarter. We didn't see any of that in
this fourth quarter. So that's our most capital markets transaction-like business, that's a little bit less predictable.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: Okay. Got it. And then my second question is just, you guys did a really good job,
certainly relative to how you had talked about expenses at the third quarter conference call, and adjusting in part to the
revenue environment here, but Gerald, I was wondering if you could just take us a step further. I know expenses will be
up 1% to 2% year-over-year, are there other things that you're contemplating now from an expense control perspective
that we might not have heard at Analyst Day in terms of your view of the overall revenue environment and any
incremental need to just tighten things up even more?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Well, Ken, that's a great question. I think that's a continuous process improvement program,
if you want to call it that, that we have all throughout the company in every expense category. It's really taking hold.
And it's in operations, it's in technology, it's in business partners, it's in every single line item in the company. And we
see further opportunities to continue to ratchet those expenses down as we get more efficient and more productive. And
so that's why we're very confident that our expense control environment is very sustainable going into the future.

A lot of the regulatory costs that continue to rise, the rate of rise is slowing down. So we've gotten a lot of that in the
run rate. So I think we feel very good about the ability to continue to control and manage expenses into the future
certainly within the guidelines that we gave you at Investor Day. That being said, we're very cognizant that it is a very
tough revenue environment, and so we're going to be even more diligent on the expense side to offset any potential
slowness in the revenue side.
<Q - Kenneth Michael Usdin>: Understood. Thanks, Gerald.
Operator
Thank you. The next question is from Brennan Hawken with UBS.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Good morning. Couple quick questions on the revenue side, just a follow-up on one of
Glenn's questions and thinking about the derivatives – the bond derivatives trading. That $34 million year-over-year
revenue delta, is that the sort of run rate we should be looking for, for a headwind for the next three quarters as that
rolls off, or is – was that comp particularly difficult? Can you give us an idea about what kind of run rate we should
look to reduce?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, Brennan, I think that comp was a particularly difficult one. We weren't making a
whole lot of money in the derivatives business as we went through the course of the year. There was probably one good
quarter and it was a little bit of softness and some of the unwinding in the fourth quarter. So I think that's not something
that I would factor into your model.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. Great. Thank you. And then what do you think drove – FX was certainly good versus
history, but when we look at what State Street and Northern printed this quarter, you came in comparably a little
weaker. Is there something that happened in FX that prevented you from capitalizing on the environment to the same
extent that competitors appear to? Or can you help us maybe understand the delta there?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Sure. I think we outperformed a bit in the third quarter. It's not – that's not unusual for us,
because we have a lot of ADR activity in the third quarter that we don't see in the fourth quarter. And, in fact, we saw
almost zero ADR activity in the fourth quarter. So that's probably the differentiator for us. If you look at us on a
year-over-year basis, we're up strongly.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Terrific. Thanks very much.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Okay, thanks, Brennan.

Thank you. The next question come is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hi, good morning. I don't know if I missed it, but, Todd, I know you went through
the SLR ratio at year ended, 4.5%. Can you just give us the plan to get to 5%, and can you get there without a rate rise,
meaning does getting to 5% require some of the excess deposits to come out?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, it would certainly be easier to get it, Betsy, if the excess deposits ran off. We think
that could generate as much as 100 basis points on its own. We'll have to be a little more aggressive. So the downside is
if we don't see any rate movement, we'll probably have to generate 20 basis points or 25 basis points or so on the – on
the way we manage deposits.
We mentioned on Investor Day that one of the things that we would be doing is if we were in the 90% to 100% on our
payout ratio, we still get pretty significant capital retention, as you saw this year. That generates about 70 basis points
to 80 basis points by the time this gets implemented. We have a matched book that is run out of treasury, that's
consuming about 25 basis points or so that we could unwind. That would come with a little bit of expense, not much.

We do earn a little bit on that matched book, but that would be something that we might be able to take down.
We do think that we're going to be able to deconsolidate our variable interest entities. That's another 10 basis points or
so. The trading book that we've talked about, that's coming down. That's probably going to create another 10 basis
points. So there's a lot of things that are underlying this, that will slowly grind its way up to the 6% to 7% where we
think we will be.
We also have the ability to issue preferred, which would be a lower cost of capital. We haven't made a decision around
that. But those are the steps. I mean, we printed them in the Investor Day, and we're going to move along that course.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Right. Okay. And then, just on the managed deposits point there, can you give us
some color on how you're thinking about that, especially given what's going on in Europe recently with the Swissies
going to negative 0.75%, et cetera.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Sure. With the negative interest rates, as you know, not only in Europe, but Swiss and
Denmark, we are passing that impact on through charging for those deposits, and we will adjust as the markets adjusts.
We saw a little bit of a decline in euro deposits over the course of the quarter, not much, but a little. So there was – and
I'm not sure that's directly in reaction to that. But we can get just more aggressive as we feel – as we might need to be
in order to charge for the use of the balance sheet.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Right, and even with you charging for the use of the balance sheet directly like that,
you really haven't seen that much movement in deposit as a result?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: We did see some.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Some, okay. All right. Thank you.

Thank you. The next question is from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Hi, good morning, folks.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Hi, Brian.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Just a little bit more on the balance sheet. Can you talk about what you view as your excess
deposits? I'm sorry if I missed this, the excess deposits level and trends coming into 2015, I guess in conjunction, Todd,
with being able to pass through the lower central bank rates and just how you think that might play out as we move
through the year?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: We probably see it, if we look at what happened to us mostly in dollars from the
quantitative easing in the U.S., most of that came through institutional depositors. So the trust banks were big recipients
of that. Our estimate that that's probably in the $50 billion to $70 billion range, Brian, so if we were to see a normal
drain, that we would see that money go away.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Consistent with what you've outlined on Investor Day still?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, I don't think that has changed. Now, the mechanism for the monetary policy change
is still a bit uncertain. So it might have to be done through pricing.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Right. Right. Okay. But as we move through 2015, you're expecting only part of that to move
through? This is more of a 2-year to 3-year evolution; is that correct?

<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Well, it would actually depend on the course of monetary policy. If nothing happens, we
wouldn't expect any of it to move. And eventually, we will start to – like I had mentioned earlier, we'll just start to
charge more and more, and drive some of the deposits away, based on the cost.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Brian, it's Gerald. We're managing the company assuming that there's no rate rise, and
therefore, both on the revenue and the expense side, and the balance sheet, we're really trying to make sure the
expenses are in line with a slow revenue growth environment. And if we need to be more aggressive on the deposit side
to make sure we achieve the capital ratios that are expected of us, we'll be more aggressive there, too.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Okay. Okay. That's great color. And then just on a couple revenue items. Maybe just the
outlook into 2015 on the – within issuer services, the DR side, looks like the Corporate Trust, like you said, is
beginning to inflect. So maybe what your view is on Depositary Receipts coming into 2015 on a year-over-year basis
versus 2014. And then also, on the collateral service side, sounds like you're gaining good traction in there. Any kind of
color on revenue growth in collateral services?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Brian, why don't I ask Brian Shea to take that one.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Okay.
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: Hi, Brian. Look, the Depositary Receipts business, as Todd mentioned, tends to be
volatile, high margin revenue for us. And what you saw in the year-over-year comparison, is that we had large
corporate action activity last year and not this year, so it didn't repeat itself in the four quarter this year. And the rest of
it in the sequential quarter is really the seasonality, the third quarter tends to be a high dividend quarter, and the fourth
quarter it falls off. So that's pretty typical.
But overall, we're still winning more than our fair share of new Depositary Receipts assignments. I think we had a
significant increase in new programs year-over-year, and we – the net issuance in the fourth quarter was up. So I would
say that, while it is seasonal, cyclical, we don't have any structural concerns about the DR business, and we feel like the
year-over-year comparison will be solid in 2015.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Mike Mayo with CLSA.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. I'm looking at third quarter to fourth quarter, and the expenses didn't decline quite as much
as the revenue declined. So on the expense side, you had a $67 million increase in professional fees, and I'm guessing
that's somehow related to retiring one of your platforms. And if so, shouldn't a retiring of a platform help to reduce
expenses?
And on the revenue side, I hear what you're saying, Corporate Trust is at an inflection point, you're winning more than
your fair share in the DR business, but the issuer services line, the revenues, look like the worst since 2007. So, what
can you say? It seems like you're confident, yet results are down. So, I mean, can you talk about the backlog? What do
you think about the first quarter for that business? So just – I think those two items would help with this expense to
revenue relationship.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Okay, Mike, it's Todd. I'll take that question. You asked two questions. So I'm not sure
we'll give you a follow-up here. But the first question's on the quarter-to-quarter, so from the third quarter to the fourth
quarter, we typically see exactly that, because there's a very sharp decline in DR revenue. And DR revenue is – the
costs are basically fixed associated with that. It gets offset somewhat by the increase in performance fees that we – the
seasonal increase that we see in performance fees, but that comes with quite a bit of compensation expense attached to
it. So that's not unexpected.
Your point around us being at the lowest level since 2007, I haven't looked that up, but it sounds accurate. As we've
been pointing out since the crisis, Corporate Trust has been contracting, but it's been contracting at a slower rate. It has
been painful and it's been a differentiator for us. We now see and actually saw flat to slightly up from Q3 to Q4. We

actually now see Corporate Trust turning the tide. So rather than contracting at a 5% to 10% type of level, it's actually
going to be flat to showing some growth.
DRs, I think Brian just gave you the – DRs tends to be a cyclical business. As you see, a flight to risk, that's a good
thing. If you see a flight to quality, it's typically not a good thing. But we've been through that cycle and I don't think
there's anything structurally different in that business.
I think your other question was related to the increase and where did the increase in the – in consulting and professional
services and legal. We did see a sharp increase – we do typically see a seasonal increase in the fourth quarter in that
line. Some of that is in the business partner, some of that is investment in our risk and finance systems. Most of it is
related to the buildout of the platforms that we've discussed at Investor Day. And then some of that is related to higher
legal cost .
We would expect that run rate to decline somewhat in the first quarter. Actually, it should decline substantially in the
first quarter, but all within the rates – the growth rates that I had mentioned to you in my comments, is I that think we'll
be up 1% or 2%, primarily because of the acceleration we have. We're going to have a little more cost due to the
acceleration of long-term incentives in the first quarter of this year than we did last year.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And just the last point was the custody platform. Did you actually retire a custody platform, and
when do you see the benefits from that? And can you talk about head count reductions in the recent quarter?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Do you want to talk about the custody platform?
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: Yeah, Mike, as you know, we had three – it's Brian Shea – we had three custody
platforms. We have consolidated that down to two. We completed that over the summer, by the end of the third quarter
of 2014, and we're now working on consolidating the remaining two to one, and we're deep into that process and that
will carry us into early 2016.
And as we've mentioned at Investor Day, we're in the process of simplifying our technology infrastructure overall. So
we have other platform consolidations underway. Overall, we have retired or – a couple hundred applications in the last
couple years and we have a road map to do more. And that's why I think Todd and Gerald have said, we're not only
managing discretionary expenses carefully, which are kind of short-term things, but transformation process that we laid
out on Investor Day includes technology simplification, insourcing, real estate and facilities actions and other actions,
which are long-term contributors to the structural costs reductions, which is why we have confidence that we can
sustain – good expense discipline over the long term.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: And Mike, I'll take the – in terms of head count, we were able to manage head count down
for the year. As you know, we took some actions in the second quarter and that helped us do that. I think you'll see the
head count's down about 800 for the full year. That also includes the fact that we were insourcing into our technology
our application development team. So that insourcing process is now over, or pretty much completed. And so, on a
sequential basis, you also saw a decline in head count. Part of that is because we're no longer insourcing the other heads
that were offsetting some of the benefit from reductions we had made elsewhere as we make ourselves a bit more
efficient.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right. Thank you.

<Q - Alexander V. Blostein>: A couple of quick follow-ups here. So, I guess, on NIR as we kind of take a look at it in
2015, the moves in rates we're obviously seeing this year are pretty onerous. I was just curious how you guys think
about the prospects for NII into 2015 if we don't see much move in rates until kind of the end of the year. Maybe an
update on where you guys are in terms of remixing kind of the composition of the balance sheet out of cash into
securities to help sustain the same level of net interest income.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, Alex, our estimate for that is that we will see a little bit of growth in net interest
income for the year, even with this difficult backdrop. It's not great in Europe and it's not great in the U.S. either. We
have moved a fair amount of cash into the securities portfolio, so it has grown by about $20 billion over the past six
months or so. And we expect to see some additional growth over the next few months in that as well. So we are putting
more cash to work.
We discussed on Investor Day how we're going to work through the HQLA. And so you are seeing a continued growth
in our HQLA assets, and that will, I think, be able to offset some of the lower rate environment. So we think it's – the
fourth quarter was a bit of an anomaly because of the way the hedging worked itself out. But we think that we're
running at about 725, 730, and we should be able to see a little bit of growth to that.
<Q - Alexander V. Blostein>: Got you. That's very helpful. Thanks. And then, just another follow-up, I guess on the
DR business and understanding the seasonality and kind of the choppiness of it. But if we sort of take a step back, can
you guys help us understand the impact of just maybe a structurally stronger dollar and maybe a little bit of weaker
emerging markets on that business over the course of the cycle? Right. So if the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen,
does that matter for the issuance?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah, I think for all of our businesses, if we see continued flight to quality, less
transaction – less cross-border transactions, that's not good for us, Alex. It reduces volumes. It moves things into
treasuries and banks rather than into capital markets. We want to see capital market activity.
Where that is displayed somewhat is in the ADR business. Now, the ADR business has a fairly large energy component
to it and there's a lot of action there, and that's somewhat helpful. It's actually been kind of interesting. We've seen
interest in it and some growth in issuance rather than contraction. So with prices and the dollar down, it's actually
brought some – in some ways, it's made it more attractive.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: And again, Alex, DRs in some ways, a lot of the revenue growth is around corporate actions
and episodic events. And so, if you see or believe there's going to be increasing either merger and acquisition activity,
particularly in the energy sector, that could actually be beneficial to the business.
<Q - Alexander V. Blostein>: Yeah. Understood. Thank you so much for the color.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Thanks, Alex.

Thank you. Our next question is from Adam Beatty with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Adam Q. Beatty>: Thank you. Good morning. Question on Wealth Management. You're good enough to give the
overall flows for the Asset Management business. I'm just wondering if what you're seeing in Wealth Management is
similar, suggestive of maybe a risk-off and how your clients are reacting. Are they spooked by volatility or encouraged
by what is still, at least domestically, a rising market year-over-year? Thanks.
<A - Curtis Yates Arledge>: Hi, it's Curtis, Adam. How are you doing?

increase the overall return of their portfolios but within the framework of definitely aware of the risk environment
being challenging.
I would tell you that we had – I think our Wealth clients have generally had a view of U.S. – the equity markets being
reasonably positive and have not been afraid of risk in the U.S. equity markets, generally. But as you think about
expanding portfolios and making them more global, some of the things that they're reading and hearing about, they've
definitely taken a bent to be biased away from it. So, again, it's hard to describe an entire client base all in one answer,
but generally, I would say that there definitely is still sensitivity about volatility in markets in those portfolios overall.
<Q - Adam Q. Beatty>: But a search for income too? Yeah?
<A - Curtis Yates Arledge>: The search for income is real. And it's one of the great things about the business we have
is the breadth of clients that we are dealing with. As rates are falling, there continues to be – income continues to be the
thing that people are increasing their search for, whether they're sovereign wealth funds or Wealth clients or any other
array of our client base.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: And Adam, just as a reminder, as a business, it's a terrific business. We like it a lot. The fees
are growing nicely. Loans are up. Deposits are up. We're utilizing the Pershing platform and the advisory network to
source business. It's a terrific business, and that's why we're investing in it. So it's very good margins, very good growth
rates on a relative basis. And while the clients may have different investment strategies and concerns, as a business
overall, it's very attractive.
<Q - Adam Q. Beatty>: Agreed. Thanks very much. And then just a quick follow-up on collateral management and
kind of where that stands. Is it living up to your expectations so far? As regulations get layered on, are clients kind of
holding off to a steady state or are they trying to get out in front it? Just where you see that and what inning you're in
right now.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah. I think I'll have Kurt Woetzel to answer that, who's running our Markets Group now.
<A - Kurt D. Woetzel>: Hey, Adam. So, great question. The business still is performing as we outlined in the Investor
Day. We're actually at all-time highs in our balances in our program. It's really being driven by three factors. One is
equity financing is still a strong business in the sell side. Secondly, as you pointed out, a little about regulation.
Regulation continues to drive the fact that synthetic structures need to be collateralized. And the third component of
that really is that the OTC derivatives market is now a market that you need to segregate, if you will, the initial margin
and where the likely place for that to occur. So those factors really continue to drive the business.
And I'd say a fourth component, again this goes back to regulation, is that there is a shifting of the sell side's books
around to places that may be more efficient from a capital structure standpoint. And that shifting is also playing well
into our global program, as, we have a program that's very much global in nature and allows us to take advantage of
where that shifting may happen.
<Q - Adam Q. Beatty>: So not just collateral but capital efficiency?
<A - Kurt D. Woetzel>: That is correct.

<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah, Ashley, it's – that's why we point out to the number of programs, it's really not very
material on either the revenue or the expense side, it's just the fact that we're having to carry the positions and actually
have some staff or people looking at them. It's really not material to the overall business. We're generally just focused
on the profitable business and making sure we're applying the best resources to the profit end of it. So I wouldn't look at
it as material event for DRs.
<Q - Ashley N. Serrao>: Okay.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: And Ashley, this is Todd. Just one other comment. We've struggled to find a metric that is
helpful to project where you might be able to expect performance to be because it just is so episodic. But ultimately, if
you look at issuance and cancellations, and you kind of look at the number of programs you get, that's some basis, but
it's not a great – it's not greatly correlated to revenue.
<Q - Ashley N. Serrao>: Okay. And I think just one quick one on expenses, what's your outlook for pension expense
next year – I mean this year, I mean?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: We do expect pension expense as we had talked about on Investor Day to increase, could
be by as much as $60 million or so. And in the directions that I gave you around the expense increase for the first
quarter, that would reflect that as well.

Thank you. The next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Thank you. Good morning, Gerald and Todd.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Hi, Gerard.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: A question on the strength of the U.S. dollar. Is it right to assume – obviously, it's a
negative drag on revenue but you get the positive benefit on expenses. So the net of it is it's not a negative for the
bottom line. And if that assumption is accurate, is there any environment of the dollar going forward by strengthening
even further as it has, since the first of the year, that concerns you?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Yeah – you want me to take that?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah, go ahead, Todd.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: I have to think through that one a little bit.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Well, your first statement is pretty accurate. Net-net, it really didn't have a tremendous
bottom line impact because, as you suggest, the strengthening of the dollar had negative impact on revenues and
positive impact on expense. So the net-net was pretty marginal for the company broadly, but the further strengthening,
Todd, that's you.
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: All right. So almost all of the impact from the dollar took place in fourth quarter, when we
talk about the impact on revenues and expenses. So when you look at the full year, it's about the same – not exactly, but
it's about the same number. So we talked about a 1% move for the fourth quarter, so you can figure, it's not too
meaningful for the full year.
I guess there's a – there's a correlation to the strengthening of the dollar as a flight to quality and less transaction, and
something I'd mentioned on one of the earlier questions, that would be my concern. So my concern is that there's less
issuance, less cross-border transactions other than flight to something like U.S. Treasuries. That's not great for our

business model, if that were to persist.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: And in the strengthening, is it primarily against the euro that you're referring to or is it a
basket of currencies?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: I would say it's a basket of currencies. One offset to that, Gerard, is this is coming with quite
a bit of volatility. And volatility is – has always been healthy for us. So, we are seeing the benefits of that in the first
quarter.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Great. And as a follow-up, Gerald, you mentioned in your opening remarks about the
inflection point for improved revenues in the Corporate Services area. Can you share with us some of the improvement,
what type of products are doing better now? What are some of the actual numbers that you're seeing that gives you that
comfort to say that it's working?
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Yeah, sure. In Corporate Trust, as you know, we suffered the last several years from the
"high value securitizations been rolling off". That's coming closer to an end. So that's one step in the process.
Secondly, we're seeing new issuance. With low interest rates, you're seeing traditional new issues on the debt side.
We've seen growth in the CLO marketplace again. We're not seeing as much traditional securitizations, although some
asset-backed securitizations are starting to re-emerge. Plain vanilla ones. So we're starting to see that. We're getting our
fair share. I will say that for a good part of 2014, with the rumored sale of Corporate Trust in the marketplace, we
weren't getting as much revenue as we would like. Now that that's over and done with, I think people realized that
Corporate Trust is a key component of our business and we're back in the growth mode.
So I feel pretty good about both the new issuance market, the decline in the old business, and us being able to get back
into business is giving us the feeling that we're at that inflection point. And I'd say, Europe continues to see more debt
issuance, and its bank balance sheets can't support whatever development occurs, when the bank balance sheets have to
come down, securitization market's the place to go. So all of those factors are giving us a lot more confidence that we're
reaching that inflection point sooner than we, perhaps, said you to earlier in the year – earlier last year.

Thank you. Our next question is from Luke Montgomery with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: Good morning, thanks. So, just a quick question on the money market fee waivers. I think
you've said the impact is roughly $0.06 to $0.07 per quarter, split 50/50 between asset management and clearing. So,
maybe an update on those estimates. And then, you calculate that against the contractual rate or some effective rate
before you started waiving fees and along with that, has there been any change you're thinking about possible
competitive pressures as rates rise and you try to recapture those fees?
<A - Thomas P. Gibbons>: Why don't I take some of this and maybe I'll ask Curtis to fill in some of the other color.
So that relationship, it's not quite 50/50 between Investment Services and Investment Management. It's a little bit more
in Investment Services, Luke. In the year-over-year and the sequential, it really hasn't changed. We've been running at
about the same rate. So we've indicated the net income hit to us is about $0.06 to $0.07. What is going to happen
competitively from here, I think, Curtis, maybe you can answer.
<A - Curtis Yates Arledge>: Yeah, I'll make a couple comments. I know Brian Shea also has the view from all the
business at Pershing and the cross investment services as well. We talked about this a lot. But there's no question that
there are – there actually are now lower fee money market funds in the market. And they are typically delinked from
the intermediaries and the sources of a lot of the cash.
So, remember, a lot of money market fund assets actually are connected to client accounts where there are significant
other services being provided, and distribution fees are a component of the overall fees that are earned in the money
market fund business. So a lot of these products that exist now with lower fees actually don't gather assets in any
significant way as a percentage of market share.

So, I mean I completely understand your question. We're in a world where passive products and lower fee products in
asset management across many asset classes are growing and more the norm, so the question makes sense. But I do
think that understanding the distribution and the relationships with distribution partners to gather assets is a really
important component of this. Brian, I don't know if you'd add anything to that.
<A - Brian Thomas Shea>: I would add, we still see significant cash balances in money market funds and FDIC
insured sweep type products. So I think, particularly in the fourth quarter, there was a little increase in cash
management balances on the Pershing platform, for example. Having said that, we've been, as Gerald mentioned, we're
sort of running the business as if the rates aren't going to rise. But we do think eventually there will be some increase in
short-term rates, which will help restore yield and fees in the money market fund business.
So, I guess my one comment – summary is that the fundamental agreements and structures of the arrangements have
not really changed between the money market providers and distribution platforms. And so my expectation, which is
not 100% necessarily right, but it's my expectation is that since the fundamental structure hasn't changed and everyone
has shared in the fee waivers on the way down, that I think you'll see a sharing of the restoration of the fees and yields
on the way up. And so we feel pretty good about the – that we'll have improvement in this as rates rise.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: Great. Thanks. Very helpful. I think I'm going to leave it there.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: Thank you.

Thank you. The next question is from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.
<Q - Geoffrey Elliott>: Hi, good morning. The shift within the Investment Management business towards
liability-driven investment continues for another quarter. So, could you discuss, as that mix shift takes place, how it
impacts profitability, how the profitability of LDI compares with the other major elements of AUM on the Investment
Management side?
<A - Curtis Yates Arledge>: Yeah, hey, Geoff, it's Curtis Arledge. So, first of all, I'd tell you that one of the things
that's happening – I mean, one of the most significant trends that's happening in the investment landscape is the
de-risking of pension plans globally. And so, the growth of our LDI business has a lot to do with the fact that pensions
– changes in accounting, substantially lower tolerance for pension surplus volatility, has caused pension plans, again on
a global basis, to look to de-risk. And there are cases where they are hedging that through LDI strategies.
And actually, as you may have seen, there have been an increasing number of pension risk transfer transactions, where
pension plans have actually purchased risk insurance, and effectively eliminated their pension risk from a market
perspective. And that's a major trend that BNY Mellon was very early on playing a pretty important role in. Insight
specifically, an investment firm that was acquired several years ago, is a market leader there. We have other LDI
products at Standish and Mellon Capital and really work closely with pensions globally on this.
I like the way you asked the question about the profitability. It's a very profitable business. Sometimes in the
marketplace, people will use the fee – and the word fee and the word margin interchangeably. The fees are generally
lower, but the margins are attractive. It's a great business. Also in the fact you're not just providing a product to a client.
You're actually evaluating their entire asset liability framework and their – truly the word solution that gets used too
much, I think, in the marketplace. You do help them with the overall portfolio solution. So for the portion of their
portfolio that they don't hedge, you still have to help them think about how that should be invested, and that has
actually led to follow-on capabilities that we have being used by those clients. And so it's been a great springboard into
other businesses with those clients.
So it's a very large trend, as you're seeing with falling rates, pensions are once again experiencing falling funding ratios,
funding ratios had gotten into the mid-90%s. They're kind of back into the high 80%s sort of on average. And it's just
continuing to be one of the things that private corporate plans are very focused on and increasingly public plans also.

<Q - Geoffrey Elliott>: So if we think about it as basis point fees, then it's lower than some of the other products, but
if you kind of look at the overall profitability of the relationship, it's something you think is very attractive?
<A - Curtis Yates Arledge>: Yeah, it's very attractive. Again, the fees per AUM are lower. The AUM is quite large,
generally. We're talking about – frequently people – some clients will actually hedge the majority of their plan. And
then, again, it also leads to a broader relationship. I will tell you that some clients will pay a slightly higher fee and
others want to pay a lower fee and have a performance element to it. And some of our performance fees actually come
from that. So the management fee is not always the entire fee. You have to look at the total fee dynamic.
<A - Gerald L. Hassell>: And it is a scale business. So therefore as a business, it's a very nice one, and it's growing
very healthy. And so we like it a lot and the team does a fantastic job in servicing our clients.
<A - Curtis Yates Arledge>: Yeah.
<Q - Geoffrey Elliott>: Great. Thank you very much.
