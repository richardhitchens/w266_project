As many of you know, I am retiring from Duke Energy at the end of this year, so this is my final earnings call. Over 40
years ago, I began my professional career with Duke Power and have experienced a rare opportunity to come full circle
in my career ending with Duke Energy. I have over 35 years of combined service to the company and its predecessors
including 25 years devoted to Investor Relations. During that time, I was fortunate to meet a lot of great people in the
investment community. I especially appreciate all the wisdom, the guidance and feedback many of you have shared
with me over the years. The goal was always to move the Investor Relations function forward. I will truly miss the
camaraderie that develops within Investor Relations teams, but I'll leave knowing that our Duke IR team is in the very
strong and capable hands of Bill Currens. Thanks for the many fond memories, and I look forward to seeing many of
you at EEI.
Okay. So, Lynn, let's talk about the quarter.
Lynn J. Good
Good morning, everyone, and thanks, Bob. Before I get into my remarks, I also want to recognize Bob. I've had the
pleasure of working with him over the last year and a half. And as a company, we've benefited not only from his
industry experience and leadership in IR but also his leadership in the company. So, Bob, thank you for a great
contribution to the company, and we all wish you and Liv the very best in the future.
Let me also welcome to the call, Steve Young. As you know, Steve assumed his role as Chief Financial Officer in
August, and I know a number of you have had an opportunity to meet with Steve. Steve brings a deep understanding of
our business and is committed to the company and to achieving our financial objectives.
So before turning the call over to Steve, let me begin with a brief highlight of our accomplishments for the quarter. We
achieved adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.46 compared with $1.47 for the same quarter a year ago. Our third
quarter results were consistent with our plan for the year. Our results were impacted by unusually mild summer
weather, $0.11 below the third quarter of 2012. At the same time, we benefited from updated customer rates and load
growth.
As we have previously highlighted, we expected our 2013 earnings to be shaped more toward the back end of the year
due to the timing of regulatory outcomes. In late September, we received approval of our two rate cases for Duke
Energy Carolinas, including approval for nuclear levelization. As a result, we expect to recognize significant benefits
from these regulatory proceedings in the fourth quarter.
As a result of the resolution of a number of important regulatory matters, we have raised the lower end of our earnings
guidance range by $0.05 to $4.25. As a result, our expected range for 2013 is now $4.25 to $4.45 per share. This range
considers various outcomes in our Ohio cost-based capacity request, which is still pending with the Ohio Commission.
Based upon the fourth quarter drivers that Steve will discuss shortly, we are confident in our ability to deliver earnings
in this range for 2013.
Additionally, during the quarter we announced a definitive agreement to sell our remaining 50% interest in Duke Net
for approximately $210 million in cash. This regional fiber optic network company is a non-core business. We expect
the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2014.
Next, let me highlight a few operational and regulatory items for the quarter. From an operational perspective, we had
strong performance across our generation fleets. Nuclear fleet improvements remain a high priority. Dhiaa and his team
have made great strides in the fleet's performance, and let me give you a few highlights.
The combined capacity factor for our nuclear plants in the third quarter was 97%. During the critical summer months of
June through August, the fleet capacity factor was 99.7%. We remain on track for 2013 to be the 15th consecutive year
with a nuclear fleet capacity factor above 90%
Our Robinson Station completed a record continuous run of 531 days before it began its refueling outage in September.
The Oconee Station set a record by continuously operating all three units for 315 days before the start of the scheduled

outage in October.
Moving to Indiana, we placed the Edwardsport IGCC plant into service in early June. Since that time, we have focused
on optimizing plant performance, including ongoing performance testing, progressing through GE's new product
introduction testing protocol and resolving the remaining punchlist items from construction.
All major technology systems have been validated and are working as designed. In fact, the amount of generation
fueled by syngas has increased over the past several months. Since the plant's in-service date, we have operated each of
the two gasifiers more than 1,500 hours. We are pleased with our overall progress, and will continue to focus on
increasing the plant's availability and reliability over the next 12 months.
Moving to regulatory matters, 2013 is an important year with a number of significant regulatory proceedings. In
September, Duke Energy Carolinas received approval of constructive rate case agreements in both North Carolina and
South Carolina. The new rates went into effect in late September and will be key drivers for fourth-quarter 2013 and
full-year 2014 results.
In late October, the North Carolina Utilities Commission issued an order which upheld its 2012 approval of a Duke
Energy Carolinas rate settlement. The rate increase had been appealed by the Attorney General to the State Supreme
Court which then directed the commission to review the evidence regarding the appropriate rate of return. Although the
Attorney General has announced his intention to appeal this most recent order from the commission, we believe this
affirmation satisfies all of the requirements in this case set out by the Supreme Court.
Last month, Duke Energy Florida received regulatory approval of the comprehensive settlement agreement reached in
August. The approved settlement moderates rate impacts to customers, provides clarity on cost recovery, and creates a
framework for meeting future capacity needs.
In Ohio, we continue to wait for an order on the cost base capacity filing and resolution of the manufactured gas plant
recovery request from our gas distribution case. We anticipate both matters will be resolved by the end of the year.
I'm very pleased with all we've accomplished so far in 2013. Our operational performance is strong and improving. We
have received constructive outcomes in our regulatory proceedings, resulting in approximately $600 million of total
annualized revenue increases.
Let me now turn the call over to Steve, who will provide more details on our quarterly financial performance and our
short-term and long-term financial objectives. After that, I'll speak about our near-term priorities and how we are
positioning the company for the future.
Steven K. Young
Thanks, Lynn. Since taking over as CFO in early August, I have visited with many of you and described my
background. During my 33 years with the company, I've had the pleasure of getting to know many people at Duke
Energy and the fine work that they do. I've held various roles in the finance group and worked closely with state and
federal regulators. I look forward to continuing the company's relationship with the investment community.
Today, I will begin with an overview of Duke Energy's third quarter earnings results for each of its business segments,
and will also update you on retail consumer volume trends and economic conditions in our regulated jurisdictions, key
earnings drivers to consider for the fourth quarter of 2013 and full year of 2014, the status of our merger integration and
cost control efforts, and our overall financial objectives.
As Lynn highlighted, today we announced third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.46, compared to prior
year quarterly results of $1.47. On slide five, you will see a summary of the primary drivers of quarterly adjusted
earnings for each of our segments. Note that beginning this quarter, we are reporting Progress Energy's results within
each of the respective drivers on this slide. The Progress Energy contribution will no longer be presented as a single
line item.

Let me start with the results at U.S. Franchised Electric & Gas, our largest segment, which recognized an increase in
quarterly earnings of $0.02 per share. You will see that the implementation of updated customer rates added $0.16,
hoping to offset the impact of unfavorable weather. Additionally, a 1.7% increase in weather-normalized customer
volumes and growth in our wholesale business added $0.07. I will provide more details on our customer volume and
economic trends in a moment.
Weather this quarter was $0.09 below normal, a quarter-over-quarter negative variance of $0.11. Cooling degree days
in the Carolinas were 18% below normal. In the Midwest, was 11% below normal. In Charlotte, this was the mildest
third quarter since 2004.
Other negative impacts to USFE&G's quarterly results included a $0.04 per share reduction of cost of renewable
amortization in Florida. During the quarter, we recognized $22 million of cost of removal. We plan to utilize the
remaining balance of $19 million in the fourth quarter. Lower AFUDC equity, due to the completion of several large
projects across our service territories, also negatively impacted the quarter. However, keep in mind that these
completed projects were incorporated into the rate increases described earlier.
Next, International Energy recognized an increase of $0.02 per share for the quarter. The segment was positively
impacted by higher pricing in Brazil, as well as results from the Chilean acquisition in December, 2012. Hydro
conditions in Brazil continued to stabilize during the third quarter, recovering from the delay in the rainy season
experienced earlier in the year. Additionally, our run-of-river hydro facilities in Chile benefited from significant
rainfall. Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates driven by a weaker Brazilian real partially offset those results.
As an update, operations at National Methanol returned to normal this quarter after the extended outage in the second
quarter. As such, results at National Methanol were fairly consistent with the prior-year quarter.
Next, let's move to Commercial Power where results were $0.02 lower than the prior-year quarter. The non-regulated
Midwest generation fleet experienced mixed results due to changes in commodity prices. The Midwest coal fleet
recognized higher margins due to lower costs, while generation volumes for the Midwest gas fleet were 15% lower due
to a tighter spark spread and an unplanned outage.
Our Renewables business recognized a decrease of $0.02 per share compared with the prior year. This was primarily
due to a prior-year joint venture development fee that did not recur in the current quarter. Finally, the full quarter
impact of the prior year issuance of shares in connection with the merger negatively impacted third-quarter earnings by
$0.02.
Our adjusted effective tax rate for the quarter was approximately 32%, consistent with the prior-year quarter. We
remain on track for a full-year 2013 adjusted effective tax rate of around 34%, at the lower end of our previously
announced range of 34% to 35%.
Turning to slide six, let's talk about what we are experiencing with customer volume trends. For 2013, we projected
retail sales growth at about one-half of 1% over the prior year; and through the third quarter, this is what we have
experienced. In the third quarter, however, total normalized customer load was 1.7% higher, supported by growth in all
customer classes. We experienced strong growth in all of our jurisdictions with the exception of Florida which
continues to face unfavorable trends in household income, resulting in soft retail and entertainment spending.
Let me briefly discuss the primary drivers in each of our customer classes for the quarter. Residential demand was
1.1% higher. The average number of customers increased 0.8% from the prior-year quarter. Average usage per
residential customer was essentially flat for the quarter. Florida's usage rates remain particularly weak due to the high
number of low-usage customers, high vacancy rates and weak household income.
Commercial demand was 1.6% higher on a weather-normalized basis, driven by lower unemployment and improved
office and retail vacancy rates. Industrial demand was around 3% higher. This is a level we have not experienced since
2010. Key drivers of this increase include strong performance in the automotive, paper and construction-related
industries. One quarter of strong results, however, does not cause us to change our long-term views. It is more
meaningful to look at longer-term trends. Based on the rolling 12 months, we have experienced average annual load

growth for all customer classes of around 0.5%, consistent with our forecast.
The U.S. economic recovery remains soft relative to historical standards and expectations. U.S. household income has
improved, although consumer confidence remains low. Specific to our service territories, we continue to believe the
Southeast is positioned well for future economic development activity, supported by affordable energy and housing, as
well as sufficient sources of labor. The Midwest has been supported by strength in manufacturing, while Florida is
poised for a housing market recovery.
While we are pleased with the recent trends, we continue to remain cautiously optimistic on the overall economic
recovery. We continue to track overall trends, and we'll provide any updates to our load forecasts in February. As we
stated on the second-quarter call, we expected 2013 earnings to be more back-end loaded than usual. This is due to the
timing of regulatory approvals, including the approval of our request to levelize nuclear outage costs. We began to see
the benefits of these regulatory outcomes in the third quarter, but these results were masked by unfavorable weather.
Based upon our results today and the finalization of significant regulatory activity, we are confident in our ability to
deliver 2013 adjusted earnings within the range of $4.25 to $4.45 per share. In the fourth quarter, we are well
positioned to deliver adjusted diluted earnings per share of between $0.90 and $1.10. This is significantly higher than
the $0.70 we recognized in the fourth quarter of 2012.
Let me discuss a few of the primary drivers expected to impact our fourth quarter results as outlined on slide seven.
First of all, Duke Energy Carolinas will recognize a full quarter of the customer rate increases approved in late
September. These increases, along with those implemented early in 2013, will be significant drivers of our fourth
quarter results compared to last year.
Additionally, our Carolinas rate settlements included the approval of nuclear outage cost levelization. As a result, the
cost related to our four fall refueling outages will be deferred and amortized over the refueling cycle rather than
expensed when the outage occurs. This will benefit our fourth-quarter results. We expect to see retail customer load
growth, as well as increased contributions from our regulated wholesale business. Further, we expect continued merger
synergies and other cost-control efforts to contribute to the fourth quarter results. I will provide further information on
merger cost savings in a moment.
We also project normal weather for the quarter. As you may recall, our fourth quarter 2012 results included
below-normal weather of around $0.04. In all, these drivers, most of which are known, give us confidence in our ability
to achieve our updated 2013 adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance range. This range considers various outcomes
in our Ohio cost-based capacity request which is still pending with the Ohio Commission. As Lynn mentioned in her
opening remarks, we anticipate a decision on this matter before the end of the year.
Now, let's turn our attention to merger integration efforts. We have two broad categories of merger savings
opportunities. First, fuel and joint dispatch savings, which immediately benefit our Carolinas customers; and second,
the more traditional O&M synergies resulting from the elimination of duplicative functions, processes and systems. We
continue to make progress on our commitment to deliver fuel and joint dispatch savings to our customers in the
Carolinas.
To-date, we are ahead of our target and have generated $145 million of cumulative fuel and joint dispatch savings since
the inception of the merger. We have contractually locked in or generated approximately 50% of the guaranteed fuel
and joint dispatch savings. As a result, we are on track to deliver the guaranteed savings of $687 million.
Our merger integration savings and continuous improvement initiatives are also on track. A significant amount of our
savings to-date have been related to corporate-center costs. We expect those costs to decrease by approximately 20%
on a pro forma combined basis from 2011 to 2014.
Let me provide some highlights from this effort. First, we have completed the organizational staffing process, and we'll
release the last of approximately 1,100 employees to our Voluntary Severance Program by early 2014. Second, efforts
to consolidate IT systems and operational processes are on track, with essentially all financial and human resources
systems expected in place in January 2014.

Finally, our supply chain function is also achieving savings due through the consolidation and renegotiation of
procurement contracts. In addition to savings from the corporate functions, our efforts to consolidate operational
departments such as nuclear, fossil generation, transmission and distribution are well underway and are on track to be
completed in 2014 and 2015 providing further benefits.
As a result of our efforts to-date, between 2011 and 2014, we project our total non-fuel O&M cost will remain flat. The
cost-saving efforts I have described will help to reduce the impact of modest inflationary pressures, as well as cost
increases resulting from nuclear and our new generation investments. We expect to exceed the high end of our original
estimate of 5% to 7% in non-fuel O&M savings, creating total cost savings of approximately $550 million or 9% of our
pro forma consolidated O&M expense of $6 billion by 2014.
We previously targeted a longer-term annual O&M growth rate of 1% to 2%, net of merger savings and other
cost-control efforts. Based upon our success to-date, as well as continued aggressive focus on costs, we believe we
could exceed these expectations.
In addition to the cost-control efforts which I just described, let me turn to slide nine and provide you with our
preliminary thoughts on other 2014 earnings drivers. We will provide our 2014 earnings guidance in February. On the
right-hand side of this slide, you will see the key year-over-year segment earnings drivers for 2014. At USFE&G,
earnings will get a full-year benefit from this year's approved rate settlements. We also expect an uplift from a return to
normal weather, along with modest retail load growth of around one-half of 1%.
We expect continued growth in our regulated wholesale business due primarily to new long-term contracted sales.
Headwinds will include the elimination of cost of removal amortization in Florida and lower nuclear outage cost
levelization benefits in the Carolinas.
In Commercial Power, we anticipate improved results from higher PJM capacity revenues. Additionally, the outcome
of the Ohio cost base capacity request may also impact next year's segment results.
Finally, the weakness experienced in the first half of 2013 at International is not expected to recur in 2014. The
unfavorable rainfall conditions experienced earlier this year in Brazil have stabilized, and operations have returned to
normal. At the same time, our International earnings will continue to be sensitive to changes in foreign exchange and
commodity prices at National Methanol.
Slide 10 reaffirms our financial objectives. Duke Energy is well positioned due to the constructive rate case outcomes
we achieved during the year and the success of our efforts to resolve uncertainty during the past 16 months. We
continue to target 4% to 6% adjusted earnings per share growth through 2015. This is based on the midpoint of our
original 2013 earnings-per-share guidance range. We will update our earnings growth objectives through 2016 during
our year-end call in February.
Our balance sheet and credit metrics remain strong. Moody's recently recognized our efforts to reduce business risk by
upgrading the ratings of our utilities in the Carolinas and Indiana, as well as the ratings of the Duke Energy holding
company. Our current business plans do not include any new equity issuances through the end of 2015.
We are focused on optimizing the use of cash previously generated by our international businesses. As of September
30, we had $1.8 billion of cash offshore, of which $1.2 billion is held outside our operating companies and is generally
available for reinvestment in the international business or return to the United States. In December of this year, we
expect to bring back approximately $700 million of cash, using a one-time tax-efficient financing structure.
In the near term, this cash will be used to refund holding company level debt that matures in the first quarter of 2014.
These funds will provide us balance sheet flexibility as we evaluate longer-term growth investment opportunities.
The dividend remains central to our investor value proposition. Over the past several years, we have been growing the
dividend annually at about 2%, which is a rate slower than our overall earnings growth. We continue to target a payout
ratio of 65% to 70% based upon adjusted diluted earnings per share. Ultimately, the dividend is at the discretion of the
board. We believe we have flexibility to grow the dividend at a pace more consistent with earnings growth once we're
within this targeted payout ratio.

In closing, we have a platform unmatched in the industry due to our scale and highly regulated business mix. We
remain committed to our financial objectives, and will use our strengths to deliver significant benefits to our customers
and investors.
Now, I will turn the call back over to Lynn.
Lynn J. Good
Thank you, Steve. Let me close with a discussion of our strategic priorities. As a company, we've accomplished a great
deal since we closed the merger with Progress in July of last year. We created the largest utility in the industry with a
diverse set of customers, jurisdictions and generation sources. We resolved the near-term priorities we established after
the merger, as outlined on slide 11.
Our regulatory proceedings are essentially complete, with five rate cases approved and updated customer rates
implemented. Clarity on the cost-base capacity filing in Ohio will help inform our long-term strategic plans for the
Midwest generation fleet.
As Steve detailed, we've made significant progress in achieving the savings we anticipated from the merger, both fuel
and joint dispatch, as well as non-fuel O&M savings. We also remain focused on ensuring consistently exceptional
performance from our valuable nuclear fleet in the Carolinas.
By resolving these issues, we've positioned Duke Energy as a low-risk, highly regulated utility operating in
constructive regulatory environments. We have the financial strength and flexibility to consistently deliver on our
commitments and grow the business.
Let me spend a few minutes discussing our future growth opportunities, as outlined on slide 12. In Florida, the
comprehensive settlement approved by the Florida Commission in October allows us to evaluate new generation
investments to replace lost capacity due to plant retirements such as Crystal River 3 and the potential retirement of the
Crystal River 1 and 2 coal units. In early October, we issued an RFP for approximately 1,640 megawatts of combined
cycle generation capacity needs. We expect to finalize the RFP in late summer next year. If the company's self-build
option is selected as the most cost-effective alternative, we will file for a need certificate with the Commission.
Construction could begin in early 2015 with an in-service date of 2018.
In the Carolinas, last month, we filed an application for a need certificate with the Public Service Commission of South
Carolina, seeking approval to construct and operate a 750-megawatt combined cycle plant at the existing Lee Steam
Station site in South Carolina. N.C. EMC will be a minority owner of 100 megawatts of the project, if constructed. If
approved, this plant could come on line in the 2017 timeframe. Additionally, we have the potential to invest in the V.C.
Summer nuclear plant being built in South Carolina. We continue to evaluate an ownership interest in this facility of up
to 10%. We also expect growth from new wholesale contracts in the Carolinas.
In Indiana, Senate Bill 560 provides the opportunity to move forward with transmission and distribution modernization
in the state. We are evaluating filing a seven-year infrastructure plan with the Commission outlining proposed
investments. We also anticipate making several billion dollars of environmental compliance investments, principally in
the Carolinas and Indiana. The ultimate level of such investments will depend on the finalization of rules which are
currently pending with the EPA. Further, we will evaluate targeted growth opportunities in our renewables and
international businesses that complement our 4% to 6% growth objectives while meeting our risk-adjusted return
expectations.
For Duke Energy as a whole, our scale and diversity position us to deploy capital based on the needs of our customers
in each jurisdiction. In total, these investments will help drive growth in the back half of the decade while maintaining
our low-risk value proposition and highly regulated business mix.
In closing, as I step back and view our company 16 months after the merger, I see a company that has successfully
addressed post-merger uncertainties, achieved significant regulatory clarity and lowered business risk. We will excel in

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Shar Pourreza with Citigroup.
<Q - Shar Pourreza>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Good morning, Shar.
<A - Steven K. Young>: Morning.
<Q - Shar Pourreza>: Bob, first, congrats on the retirement. You've been a good friend and a great resource for us for
several years. So, congratulations.
<A - Bob Drennan>: Thank you.
<Q - Shar Pourreza>: Let me ask you a question. With the approximate $700 million coming back to the U.S., any
guidance on where you think you'll redeploy it? And, I guess, with the rest of the cash in Latin America, curious if you
see any further value-creating opportunities in the U.S. like maybe solar that could potentially offset the tack leakage.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: And, Shar, in the short term, we will bring the $700 million back and use it to delay additional
financing at the holding company, which effectively creates balance sheet flexibility for us to identify growth
opportunities and invest in longer-term growth opportunities. Solar could certainly be a part of that as we look at
renewables in our jurisdictions. And I also – as I went through slide 12, gave you some perspective of other capital
investment opportunities that exist in our jurisdictions.
<Q - Shar Pourreza>: Okay. Terrific. And then just one question on the Ohio capacity case. Given what's left with the
procedural schedule and PUCO, at least for November, are we thinking more we'll get an order in the cost-based
approach sometime in December or there still a potential for a November order?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: At this point, I don't have any specifics on it, Shar. We believe, expect or anticipate it by the end
of the year. With the holiday schedule, I think we'll just have to evaluate as the dockets and schedules are produced
whether it's November or December.
<Q - Shar Pourreza>: Okay. Thanks very much. Congrats.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Thank you.

And we'll take our next question from Greg Gordon with ISI Group.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Good morning, Greg.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Hi, Lynn, you'll be missed. My question is on the commentary you just made with regard to your
O&M growth or aspirations/your ability to control O&M growth. As we look into 2014, I guess, you've indicated you
feel like it's possible that you'll outperform the 1% to 2% O&M growth baseline that you've targeted. Can you – you
pointed to some things that are driving that. Is pension and the increase in expected discount rates a big factor in that?

And are there other things on the list that certainly didn't call out earlier?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: You know, Greg, I think it's a combination of a number of things. What we tried to emphasize
with the merger synergies is we've effectively exceeded the 5% to 7% targeted savings and expect to deliver about
$550 million of savings in 2014. That puts us in a position to maintain O&M flat from 2011 to 2014. So, it's a
combination of merger integration. Certainly, we believe that pension benefits will trend down as we're looking at
discount rates and other factors, but we'll need to finalize the specifics on the pension when we set the discount rate at
the end of the year.
<A - Steven K. Young>: And I would say that the pension expense is not the big driver of the $550 million by any
means. It is primarily O&M savings within our corporate and functional areas.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. Thank you, guys.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Thanks, Greg.

And we'll take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Yeah. Good morning.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Morning.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: I'd like to, Bob, pass my good wishes as well. Thank you. Just on that – the last question
around – you're saying flat into 2014 for O&M, but everything else in the prior-guidance slides was talking about into
2015. Do you feel – are you just not quite ready to commit to flat into 2015? Or should we be thinking about that –
back to that 1% to 2% growth trajectory on the extra year?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Jonathan, we haven't given specific guidance into 2015. What we did indicate in our remarks
here today is based on where we're positioned and the aggressive cost-control measures we have in place. We could
exceed the 1% to 2%, meaning a lesser growth in CAGR on O&M. But we haven't given any specific guidance on that.
We'll continue to finalize our plans, and you should know, we're aggressively working on costs, to continue to drive
costs out of the business. And all of those factors are considered in our growth expectation of 4% to 6% through 2015.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay. Thank you. And I just also noticed that you'd sort of ticked down your long-term
sales number to 0.5% to 1% now versus – it was 1% before. So, could you just put that in context of what you said
about 2013 and one quarter not being a trend? Are you looking at 2013 really as an anomaly at this point, or is there
something else that's kind of driving that additional caution further out?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Jonathan, I think we're right on track with where we expected to be. Our guidance for the full
year of 2013 was 0.5%, and that's where we see the growth. The third quarter was a bit stronger than what we
anticipated coming in at 1.7%, but there's some imprecision in those volume numbers, particularly in a soft-weather
quarter. Long term, we've been planning for 0.5% to 1%. And we're actually challenging our team to think about an
environment of that kind of load growth even trending to flat over time potentially as we think about sizing our
spending, O&M spending.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay. Got it. And if I might, on one other topic, should we view the $700 million
repatriation as what you consider to be the current excess, or is this an initial pass at something that could be more
substantial? And then maybe just could you clarify the structure you're using and what the tax implications are?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Jonathan, this is a one-time opportunity to take advantage of a tax structure, to bring home cash
without substantial a tax liability. And it effectively strips basis out of the structure, the international structure. And so
that $700 million will come home. You could consider that to be a one-time opportunity for us to take advantage of that
tax structure.

On an ongoing basis, we continue to evaluate the use of international cash. We have not made a final decision to
repatriate on an ongoing basis, but that represents an opportunity for us in the future.

And we'll take our next question from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: Hey. Good morning. First of all, Bob, congratulations. We'll see you next week, so we can do it
more personally and formally. But I guess just to the quarter or to the outlook, can you talk a little bit more what you
guys see as the big CapEx buckets, maybe in a little more detail beyond kind of the near-term plan? If you think about
their infrastructure spending in Indiana, if you think about the next wave of environmental CapEx, what kind of rate
base and growth do you still see out there?
<A - Steven K. Young>: Looking at our CapEx over the next several years, we see that we're in the roughly $6 billion
range, slightly down from the combined levels we've seen in the past. We have had a lot of major projects complete
recently, but going forward, we've got a lot of maintenance CapEx in those numbers. And there is nuclear
infrastructure. Additionally, when you get out into 2015, 2016 and 2017, you'll start to see the next cycle of build in the
CapEx with potentially a Florida self-build combined cycle and a self-build in the Carolinas, as well. So that's kind of
the broad picture of our CapEx.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: And I guess Southern, on their earnings call last week, they talked about the idea that toward the
end of the decade, there should be a reacceleration in environmental CapEx for their coal fleet. Where do you guys see
that affecting your generation, just thinking about coal ash and water rules coming?
<A - Steven K. Young>: We're projecting over the next 10-year period $5 billion to $6 billion of environmental spend.
In the near term over the next – through 2015, we'll be spending over $1 billion, primarily on air and primarily in
Indiana and in the Carolinas. As you move beyond that, towards the back end of the 10-year period, you'll start to pick
up some of the water and ash expenditures. It's difficult to predict exactly what the level of CapEx will be given that the
rules are not finalized at this particular point in time.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: But that range of $5 billion to $6 billion, Dan, is what we're estimating based on a range of
scenarios that could impact – could result from this rule, so that's a good rule of thumb for you to think about.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: Okay. And I guess just on – there's been some good success with the wholesale contracts. What
are you guys seeing as far as maybe picking up some more of that kind of business? And is that going to have any
bearing on how you guys lay out the
2015-2016 newbuild decisions for incremental generation capacity?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: I think wholesale opportunities can exist from time to time, Dan. They're opportunistic generally.
And we'll provide more specifics if we see clarity around those as we move forward.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: Got it. Thank you, guys.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Thanks so much.

<A - Lynn J. Good>: Good morning.
<A - Steven K. Young>: Morning.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: I just wanted to follow up on the cash that's outside the U.S. As you look at redeploying that
actually outside of the U.S., can you just speak to the degree of opportunity you see there or do you see fairly limited
opportunities there, and the overall objective remains and try to continue to look for ways to bring as much of that cash
back to the U.S. as you can?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Steve, I think it's a balance. We have continued to look for generation development opportunities
and have made a number of investments over the last three to four years consistent with generation in countries that we
– are consistent with our risk profile. So you may recall in 2012, we made investments in Chile. So, we do continue to
look for opportunities to grow the business consistent with a 4% to 6% growth rate. But that business also produces a
lot of cash and finding ways to optimally use the cash is a key objective.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Okay. So, it does sound like perhaps, on an overall basis, the cash flow is exceeding the
opportunities sort of systematically as you look out?
<A - Steven K. Young>: Well, the opportunities are a bit lumpy. So, it's hard to track it to annual cash flows that close.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Okay. Understood, understood. Shifting gears over to – as you assess new nuclear options, I
know it's something you've been looking at. Any further updates as you think about new nuclear?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Steve, we continue to look at the V.C. Summer plant which is under construction in South
Carolina. We believe in regional nuclear. We certainly have a very supportive regulatory environment in South
Carolina, but we have not made a final decision to move forward. We continue to evaluate the opportunity, and we'll
provide updates as our decision making progresses.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Okay. Understood. So there's no specific timeline we should be thinking about for that.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Not at this point.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Thank you.

And we'll take our next question from Hugh Wynne with Stanford and Bernstein (sic) Sanford Bernstein (44:02).
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: Morning. Thank you.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Morning.
<A - Steven K. Young>: Morning.
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: You mentioned that you were going to bring back something on the order of $700
million in cash from your overseas operation to pay a maturing – debt maturity at the holding company. What are your
plans for holding-company debt over a sort of a three-year horizon? Will that be reduced further in those years, or do
you think that we're basically in a steady state?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Hugh, we're not trying to delever the company. Our credit ratings and financial profile are very
strong and well positioned within our ratings category. We just have this opportunity to provide some flexibility to the
balance sheet by taking advantage of this tax structure. And then over time, as growth investments materialized, we'll
reinvest and the holding company becomes an opportunity to fund those investments. At this point, we do not see a
need for equity through 2015.

<A - Steven K. Young>: And the use of this $700 million to take care of these holdco maturities will give us an uplift
here in terms of [ph] displacing (45:16) interest.
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: Just one quick follow-on question. You had mentioned that you're expecting
longer-term sales growth of 0.5% to 1% per year. Can you break that down roughly into what your longer-term
expectations are for customer growth and usage per customer?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Hugh, I don't have underlying specifics on that. What I would say is, in 2013, our customer
count has grown almost 1%, a bit stronger in the Southeast, but actually pretty strong in the Midwest as well. So, I
think with housing markets improving, with continued traction with the U.S. economy, we believe that the Southeast,
and Florida, in particular, are well positioned for customer growth. But I don't have any further breakdown for you on
that guidance.
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: Is there a potential for meaningful volume sales growth on the wholesale side? You
mentioned that as a potential driver of growth in the Carolinas and Florida.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: I think it's something that is opportunistic, Hugh, so we were able to sign up and extend
contracts back in 2010, 2012. We will continue to evaluate those opportunities, but don't have anything specific to
share with you at this point.
<Q - Hugh de Neufville Wynne>: Great. All right. Thank you very much.

And we'll take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Good morning.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: So, first, perhaps following up a little bit on the last question, with regards to the
Summer site, is it more around the need and projected demand that holds you back from pulling the trigger or was it
more around structuring a transaction and concerns around, I suppose, site-specific issues, if you could just give us a
sense? And maybe going back to it, with regards to the Carolinas, do you have any sense initially as to what their
reaction would be and the structure would be under which you would acquire any nuclear generation?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: So Julien, if you look in our integrated resource plans for both Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke
Energy Progress, we do show a need that could be filled by nuclear in the back part of the decade. And I'm not going to
comment specifically on negotiations. It's an important asset for the region. We're continuing to evaluate it but have not
reached a point of terms that we're ready to move forward at this point.
As you know, the asset is strongly supported by South Carolina. If we were to acquire up to 10%, somewhere around
70% of that investment would be dedicated to North Carolina, so it'll be important to receive appropriate regulatory
recovery in North Carolina as well.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Excellent. And then going back to Ohio quickly, if you could just give us an update on
your thoughts around timing for a potential reevaluation of that business or specifically the generation side of that
business. And secondly, what are the switching trends you've seen particularly of very late, if you will?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: So, we are, at this point, waiting for the Ohio Commission's order, Julien, and are anticipating it
by the end of the year but don't have any specifics on the exact timeframe between now and then.
We are agnostic as to switching because we are fully decoupled. The generation is fully merchant. All of the load is
served under auction for Duke Energy Ohio. So the switching is not relevant to us any longer.

<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Fair enough. And then lastly, just with regards to Indiana, if you would. I know you
provided some good detail on Edwardsport but just from a regulatory perspective, all is okay on that front? The
regulators are kind of seeing this as appropriate just the gradual ramp-up?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: We're certainly keeping the regulator informed, Julien, of the progress at Edwardsport. You may
recall that the recovery of Edwardsport costs is in accordance with a tracker, or under the terms of a tracker, that we file
twice a year, giving us an opportunity to fully update the Commission on our results, our cost structure, et cetera. So we
are continuing to maintain those updates and providing the Commission with the status of the project.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Gotcha. Excellent. Well, thank you very much.

And we'll take our next question from Brian Chin with Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Hello, Brian.
<A - Steven K. Young>: Morning.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: On the improved O&M containment efforts, is there a way you can break down between whether
most of those incremental savings are coming from the USFE&G segment or Commercial Power?
<A - Steven K. Young>: The majority of these savings, given the size of the segment, will inure to the FE&G segment.
Right now, we're recognizing a lot of benefits in the corporate areas, and those corporate areas get allocated to all
segments, including the International and Commercial, but the lion's share of that would inure to the FE&G segment.
As you go forward, efforts such as nuclear generation, fossil generation, T&D, those are more focused on the regulated
businesses because that's primarily what Progress was, so that's what we're integrating and finding benefit to. So, the
majority of merger integration will inure to the FE&G segment logically there. But a lot of these corporate benefits will
pass through to other segments as well.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Understood, understood. And then going over to slide nine, just to be clear, I know that you're
going to give more color on this in February, but for those data points that are the blue boxes, Ohio cost-based capacity,
energy margins in Midwest Generation, is the point that year-over-year, we should be thinking about 2013 to 2014, that
those are going to be relatively flat and that's why there's no down [indiscernible] (51:36) just to be clear on that?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Brian, what I would say on Ohio cost-based capacity, because we don't have an order yet, it's
difficult for us to project implications to 2014. Energy margins will be dictated by commodity prices, similarly the FX
and the NMC. So those, we'll be able to give you some specific guidance as these trends develop between now and
February.
<A - Steven K. Young>: So, it's more uncertainty at this point.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Got it, got it. And then lastly, you had said that your load growth long-term assumptions were
generally still in the 0.5% to 1% range. Would you say that that's probably appropriate for thinking about 2014?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: I think that's a reasonable range, Brian, 0.5% to 1%, yes, through 2015, right.
<Q - Brian J. Chin>: Great. Thank you very much

And we'll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: A few things. First of all, thank you for taking my call. Second, Bob, I hope you don't
mind, but I'm going to show up on your doorstep in the mountains of Western North Carolina and look forward to
going fishing one day. Want to ask – I want to make sure we understand two things. So, the $6 billion number, you
reference it in the footnote on O&M, that's kind of the starting point and then you basically assume you'll be in or
around that same level in 2014, but I think it talks about excluding recoverable items. Can you just kind of quantify
how much those recoverable items are? Or is that kind of a GAAP-expected O&M number?
<A - Steven K. Young>: No. I can give you a flavor for that, Michael. The net of recoverables, you might be looking
at $5.5 billion. And you've got some recoverables on Edwardsport, you've got some recoverables with energy
efficiency, smart grid. We got some riders like that, but $5.5 billion is a number net of recoverables.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: And the GAAP number, I'm sorry, and I want to make sure I follow this. So, that $5.5
billion is the expected 2014 number, and then that's after accounting for the recoverables, or is that the 2011 base to
start from?
<A - Steven K. Young>: Well, that's both actually. We're starting from that base and even with inflation and emergent
work, particularly in nuclear around Fukushima and cyber security, we think we'll be able to offset all of that and in
2014 be at a level of $5.5 billion.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay. And then the recoverables are about $500 million, so that's how you get to the $6
billion number?
<A - Steven K. Young>: Roughly, that's correct.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay. On the nuclear levelization, can you just kind of walk us through how that flows to
the income statement? Meaning, is that an offset to O&M? Is it an offset to D&A? Does it have an unusual impact in
the third and fourth quarter of this year and first and second quarter of next year but then kind of normalizes after that?
<A - Steven K. Young>: Yes. The way the accounting will work, it'll be an offset in O&M costs. It will be in that line
item. It will, with its initiation, result in lower O&M in the fourth quarter of 2013 and that's a big driver that we are
pointing to for the fourth quarter. We will see some benefits in 2014 as you continue to defer costs, but there'll be less
benefits in 2014 than there were in 2013. And then after 2014, the amortization of the deferrals will have caught up, if
you will, to the actual expenses and there won't be much difference there.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay. When did this go into effect? And is there a way to just kind of quantify what we're
talking about, about the dollar-millions impact on O&M?
<A - Steven K. Young>: We began this in the third quarter, actually, in terms of levelizing out nuclear outage costs, I
believe, for the most part. And we've got four refueling outages; and an outage will run roughly $20 million, $30
million per outage. We can get you more details on the specifics in terms of the costs incurred.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: You know, Michael, for the full year, nuclear levelization is about $0.10 to $0.12, and the
majority of that will sit in the fourth quarter because of the refueling outages Steve just spoke about.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Meaning the full-year impact in 2013 is $0.10 to $0.12, but if I were to annualize – if I
were to use it on an annualized basis, it's double that because it only started in September?
<A - Steven K. Young>: No.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: No.

<A - Steven K. Young>: No. The full-year impact's about the $0.10 to $0.12. Most of that'll be in the fourth quarter.
And then when you look prospectively, in 2014, you'll have new outages being deferred, but you'll have amortizations
of previous outages catching up to it, if you will. So the impact in 2014 will be a net reduction of O&M but not as
significant as what we saw in 2013.

And we'll take our next question from Kit Konolige with BGC.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Good morning.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Morning, Kit.
<A - Steven K. Young>: Morning.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Bob, I don't know what your retirement says about my career, but we've been doing this together
for a long time. So...
<A - Bob Drennan>: Time flies, [indiscernible] (57:20).
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Just a couple of details to follow up. A lot of my questions have been answered. But can you
review – I guess, this would be for Steve. Can you review why the decision in the Ohio capacity case would have an
impact on O&M in the fourth quarter – just on earnings in the fourth quarter?
<A - Steven K. Young>: Well, the decision on Ohio, it could have an impact if we get a decision in the calendar year.
And it depends on what the decision is. We may have to book some effectively cost deferrals or revenues based on
whatever the order says. So it could impact the 2013 earnings. It depends on what the order says and what calendar
year we get it in. So we've taken that into account when we've updated our guidance in the range. We still think,
regardless of outcomes in Ohio, we can be within our range.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: So, you're anticipating that whatever the decision is, it potentially could affect the adjusted
earnings, not just GAAP earnings?
<A - Steven K. Young>: It could. We'd have to look at what the order said and so forth. But it could affect adjusted
earnings, that's correct.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: And then, so once that's received, I think, in the past, Lynn, you've said that [audio gap] (58:55 –
59:14) the order in the fourth quarter.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Kit, I'm not going to comment on strategic decisions at this point until we see the order and
understand the implications to the business. And so, if we receive the order by the end of the year, we'll have an
opportunity to evaluate that and understand next steps, and we'll share that with you when it's appropriate.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: And how about on International? Do you consider that a non-core business like DukeNet?
Obviously it's different in size, but is that under review for possible different relationship with Duke Energy or do you
consider that part of the business on a permanent basis?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: You know, Kit, the international business is an important part of Duke. It contributes about 10%
– up to 15% of our earnings. It's been a strong contributor to the company, certainly strong cash flow. Our strategic
focus over the last 16 months has really been on the regulated business, working through these regulatory proceedings,
focus on merger integration. We'll focus on Midwest Generation over the next year or so as we evaluate the impact of

the cost-based capacity filing. And we'll continue to look for opportunities to optimize the value of the International
business. But we don't have any specific strategic review that I would share with you at this point.

And we'll take our last question from Ali Agha with SunTrust.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Good morning.
<A - Steven K. Young>: Morning.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Morning. Lynn or Steve, just wanted to clarify a couple of quick things. One is, you've kept a pretty
wide range for your 2013 guidance. All of that will come up in the fourth quarter. Is it fair to say that that wide range is
primarily driven by the Ohio capacity ruling? That would be the string factor, is that the way to think about it?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: I think that's the best way to think about it, Ali.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. Yeah. And then second, you've shared with us, based on your CapEx program, you're looking
at rate-based growth 2012 through 2015 on a 4% CAGR. When you look at these opportunities that you highlighted on
that slide about beyond 2015, is 4% roughly still the CAGR we should think about beyond 2015 given the opportunities
you're seeing out there?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: We haven't given guidance beyond 2015, Ali, but that'll certainly be a focus as we come to the
Street in February. Some of the items we have talked about, though, could impact capital through 2015. For example, if
we pursue the self-build option in Florida, et cetera. So we will also be refining CapEx through 2015 when we provide
guidance early next year.
<Q - Ali Agha>: I see. And last question, just to be clear on your plans on Ohio. Regardless of whatever decision
comes out from the Commission, do you still see the merchant business as core to Duke, given, as you mentioned a few
times, the low risk profile portfolio that you currently own? Does it really fit in with your overall business outlook?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Ali, that's certainly a strategic question that we'll need to answer as we move forward. Our focus
at this point is on securing the order from the Ohio Commission. We're also focused on cost-effective operation of
those assets. We're engaged in the discussions with PJM on the structuring of the market. So, for the – our focus over
this near term is on those specific items.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Fair enough. Thank you.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: All right. Thank you.
Lynn J. Good
Well, I'd like to thank all of you for questions and for your interest in Duke Energy. We look forward to talking with
