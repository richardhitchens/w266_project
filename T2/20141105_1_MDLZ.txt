Irene B. Rosenfeld
Thanks, Dexter, and good morning. I'm pleased to report that we had a strong third quarter. In an environment that
continues to be challenging, we delivered top-tier earnings growth and margin expansion, as well as solid revenue
growth. Specifically, organic revenue was up 2.7%, adjusted operating income margin increased 140 basis points to
13.6%, and adjusted EPS was $0.50, up 33% on a constant-currency basis, fueled largely by strong operating gains.
This is the third consecutive quarter that we've expanded margins by at least 100 basis points and posted double-digit
EPS growth.
We delivered this by successfully executing our productivity and supply chain initiatives, and through early wins from
our zero-based budgeting program. The primary revenue driver in Q3 was pricing to offset higher input costs, which
contributed 5.8 percentage points to our growth. Our pricing actions were broad-based, spanning all categories and
regions, though they were most significant in chocolate and coffee, given the steep rise in both cocoa and green coffee
cost.
As expected, increased pricing and the wider price graphs that resulted, pressured overall volume mix, which was down
3.1 percentage points. Volume mix was also affected by the pricing-related customer disputes in France that we
mentioned last quarter. We priced to fully recover commodity and currency impacts, and we took action earlier than
our competition.
As we discussed in our last earnings call, in the short-term, this will temper revenue growth, until gaps narrow and
customers and consumers adapt to the higher prices. Fortunately, toward the end of the quarter, conditions started to
improve. Most of the customer disputes have now been resolved, and price gaps have begun to narrow, especially in
emerging markets.
Overall, organic revenue grew 2.7%, driven by an increase of 9% in emerging markets. Some of that growth was due to
China, which grew high single-digits behind stepped-up innovation and marketing as we lapped last year's inventory
destock.
Another factor was the impact of hyperinflationary markets, and we're very pleased that Brazil, Russia and India each
posted double-digit increases, including solid contributions from vol/mix and innovation. For instance, in Brazil, Oreo
and belVita continue to perform well.
In Russia, our Marvellous Creations platform captured a 1% share of the chocolate tablet market within its first month,
while new [ph] gear-all (4:20) flavors and innovative packaging drove share gains in gum.
And in India, new pack sizes and formats for Cadbury Dairy Milk fueled double-digit growth and strong share gains.
In developed markets, organic revenue declined 1.3% as we continue to deal with an increasingly tough operating
environment. That included temporary dislocations associated with pricing-related customer disputes, especially in
Europe, and increased promotions by competitors, particularly in North America. In both cases, we chose to stand our
ground to maintain the investments necessary to support our brands over the long-term.
Let's look more closely at our Q3 revenue by region. In Europe, which accounts for about 40% of our business, organic
revenue was down 2.4%. The commercial disputes accounted for more than 100 basis points of the decline. In Q4, we
expect less of a headwind from these disputes. As I mentioned earlier, over the past month, we've reached agreements
with most of our customers, though we did lose some distribution with a few of them.
In addition, and as expected, the elasticity impact of higher pricing significantly tempered our volumes. This was
especially true in coffee where, for the first time in two years, we increased prices. As expected, consumers and
customers reduced pantry and trade stocks after the price increase, which affected our Q3 volumes, so coffee revenue
was a 50 basis point headwind in Europe.

In North America, organic revenue was essentially flat for the quarter. U.S. biscuits were up low single-digits, a bit
slower than last quarter, but in line with the category as we cycled strong prior-year growth. This was offset by a
decline in confections.
In EEMEA, organic revenue grew 5.6%. Russia led the way with mid-teens growth, including double-digit gains in
coffee, chocolate and biscuits. I recently visited our team in Russia, and in the face of significant macroeconomic
headwinds, they're doing an exceptional job of defying gravity and growing well in excess of GDP. Russia's
performance more than offset weakness in other markets in the region that are experiencing political and economic
instability.
Latin America grew 18.5%, the fifth straight quarter of double-digit growth. Brazil delivered another strong quarter, up
mid-teens, with positive vol/mix, despite significant pricing. Growth in Brazil was broad-based. Biscuits, chocolate,
powdered beverages and gum and candy all posted strong gains. The inflationary economies of Argentina and
Venezuela continue to drive the sharp rise in pricing for the region overall.
And finally, Asia-Pacific returned to growth this quarter, with organic revenue up 1.3%. China grew nearly 10%, as we
cycled last year's inventory destocking and began to see the impact of our turnaround plan. Although, the macro
environment remains soft, we're seeing early signs of success with our reinvigorated marketing and innovation
programs.
For example, we recently introduced innovations such as Oreo Thins and Mini Oreos, as well as new packaging
formats to broaden usage occasions. We also adapted some proven marketing programs from our global playbook, such
as the Oreo Wonderfilled campaign.
In response, biscuit category growth in China has kicked up recently, and our share trends have also improved. Beyond
China, India delivered another quarter of double-digit growth behind strong gains in chocolate. And Australia and New
Zealand grew low single-digits as the retail environment stabilized.
Now let's have a look at category growth. Overall, global category growth remained below long-term trends.
Year-to-date, growth for our snacks categories was around 4% and stood at about 3.5% for all of our categories;
including beverages, cheese and grocery.
Our organic revenue grew 2.2% over that same period, in line with our annual guidance, but a little more than a point
below category growth. This difference is primarily due to three things: the elasticity impact of significant chocolate
pricing; the impact of the customer disputes in France across a number of our categories; and recycling of the
investments we made in China biscuits last year.
In Q4, we expect the impact of chocolate pricing and the residual effect of the French trade dispute to continue. These
factors are built into our full-year revenue guidance.
Turning to market share, overall year-to-date performance remains solid with 54% of our revenues gaining or holding
share. Given that we increased pricing in all of our categories, shares softened a bit in Q3 to about 49%, as we had
expected. As we exit the year, we expect our shares to stabilize as consumers adjust to new price points and gaps begin
to narrow.
So to summarize, we delivered solid top line growth in a challenging consumer and customer environment. In the face
of this temporary period of weaker category growth, we've made a conscious decision to increase prices to recover
higher input costs, even if we have to accept some near-term share loss.
At the same time, we're continuing to invest in high-return, route-to-market and capacity expansion projects, while
driving productivity and cost reduction to increase earnings, expand margins and fuel further growth.
Near-term, leveraging this approach through 2015 will deliver value to our shareholders regardless of the macro
environment. And over the long-term, this will enable us to deliver sustainable top-tier performance on both the top and
bottom lines.

With that, let me turn it over to Dave.
David Brearton
Thanks, Irene, and good morning. Over the next few slides, I'll walk you through our bottom line results and our
updated outlook.
Adjusted gross profit dollars were up 3.1%, and adjusted gross profit margin increased 40 basis points. We continue to
deliver productivity at record levels. Year-to-date, we've generated net productivity of more than 2.5%. Costs increased
high single-digits in the quarter, due primarily to coffee, cocoa and currency.
Forex actually drove about half of that increase, primarily in emerging markets. We priced to recover these costs on a
dollar basis, with pricing contributing nearly six percentage points in the quarter. Of course, with this level of pricing,
the percentage margin was negatively affected by what we call the denominator effect, but our strong productivity
programs and a modest mark-to-market benefit allowed us to expand gross margins in the quarter.
Now, let's take a closer look at operating income. As Irene mentioned earlier, we've now posted our third consecutive
quarter of significant adjusted OI margin expansion, since we outlined the supply chain and cost reduction initiatives.
Specifically, adjusted OI dollars increased 16.5% in the third quarter and were up 14.7% year-to-date on a constant
currency basis. Adjusted OI margin was 13.6%, up 140 basis points in Q3. Year-to-date, adjusted OI margin has
increased 130 basis points to 12.8%.
Our margin expansion was mainly driven by lower overheads, as we're beginning to see the benefits of our ZBB
program play through the P&L. Changes in our spending policies are already making a difference in overheads, and we
expect these savings to continue to build as we enter 2015.
In addition, we're continuing to drive A&C efficiencies by reducing non-working costs, like advertising production,
and the consolidation of our agency and media providers especially in emerging markets like EEMEA and Asia-Pacific
is providing real savings to our bottom line.
Importantly, our working media investments and the level of consumer engagement remains in line with prior-year, as
we continue to invest in our brands at a healthy rate. And within our working media, we're continuing to shift more of
our global media spending to digital, which delivers about twice the ROI of traditional media.
Taking a closer look at margins, it's encouraging to see the breadths of our margin expansion. Through September, all
five of our regions delivered higher margins versus the prior-year. North America and Europe each delivered
approximately 200 basis points of margin improvement. Not surprisingly, these two regions are delivering the lion's
share of our margin expansion as they are the primary focus of our supply chain work and overhead cost programs. But
Latin America, EEMEA and Asia-Pacific, also delivered higher margins for the first nine months.
Turning to EPS; our margin improvement is also driving strong EPS growth. Through the first nine months, our
adjusted EPS was $1.29, up 22% on a constant currency basis. Operating gains are the key driver accounting for $0.19
of the $0.25 of improvement on a constant currency basis year-to-date.
Lower interest expense and the impact of share buybacks provided another $0.12 of upside, more than offsetting a
$0.06 headwind as we lapped last year's exceptionally low tax rate. Let me now quickly update you on where we stand
on capital allocation and cash flow.
With regard to free cash flow, we remain on track to deliver our two-year target of $3.7 billion. Our growth and
earnings coupled with our continued focus on improving working capital are the primary drivers. Through September,
our cash conversion cycle improved approximately 21 days, consistent with June year-to-date performance.
We've also returned over $1.9 billion to our shareholders including repurchasing $1.2 billion of stock, or about 34
million shares. Based on this, we now expect our total share repurchases for 2014 to be between $1.5 billion and $2

billion. Additionally, we paid out a little over $700 million in dividends.
Turning to our outlook; although Q3 revenue came in better than expected, we're maintaining our top line outlook.
Global economic conditions and our category growth remain challenging, and while we've reached agreements to
resolve most of our customer disputes, we remain cautious about the residual impact on Q4.
However, we are raising our guidance on adjusted operating income and margin, based on our strong performance
through the first nine months. Adjusted operating income at constant currency is now expected to grow approximately
10%, up from high single-digits previously. And adjusted OI margin is now projected at approximately 13% versus the
high-12%s we guided to earlier this year.
Our confidence in delivering the higher OI margin target is rooted in our strong margin expansion year-to-date, as well
as our visibility to the pipeline of cost and productivity savings for the balance of the year.
We're also increasing our adjusted EPS range by $0.09 to $1.82 to $1.87 on a constant currency basis, up from the
previous range of $1.73 to $1.78. This includes about $0.06 from a lower-than-expected effective tax rate, reflecting a
number of favorable discrete tax events. For the year, we estimate an effective tax rate in the high-teens versus our
prior expectation of around 20%.
Our strong operating performance added $0.01 to $0.02. The remaining $0.01 to $0.02 comes from favorable interest
expense. In our revised guidance, we've included a similar benefit in the fourth quarter.
At this point, I wanted to pause for a moment to thank Irene, the board, and the leadership team, and especially all of
the people in my finance team based around the world for the opportunity to serve as CFO and for the tremendous
support over the years.
As you know, this is my last earnings call as CFO. On December 1, I'll assume a new role that focuses primarily on the
establishment and launch of our coffee joint venture with D.E Master Blenders.
I'd also like to take this opportunity to welcome Brian Gladden as our Incoming CFO, who's joining us at an exciting
time as we accelerate our growth and cost agendas. Brian is a seasoned financial leader who knows how to create
shareholder value. His background, together with extensive experience operating in emerging markets and developing
talent will greatly benefit our global organization and our shareholders.
With that, let me hand it over to Brian for a few words.
Brian Gladden
Thanks, Dave. It's really great to be here. I'm really excited to join the team and I look forward to helping our company
reach its potential. We have an aggressive transformation agenda underway and I'm thrilled to help lead that effort
going forward. Dave and I have already been working together very closely to ensure a smooth transition and I look
forward to meeting many of you in the near future.
With that, let me turn it back to Irene for a quick update on our strategic initiatives.
Irene B. Rosenfeld
Thanks, Brian. Let me add my welcome to you and also to extend my heartfelt thanks to Dave, who's been a terrific
partner over the years. But, of course, Dave is not off the hook, which is a good segue to a review of our strategic
initiatives, which remain firmly on track.
First, our planned coffee joint venture is moving ahead and we continue to expect the deal to close in 2015. We're
making progress in securing regulatory approvals as well as engaging with our works councils. As you can imagine,
there's still a lot to do to stage this business for continued success, so I'm very pleased that Dave will be able to focus

on this project at this critical juncture.
Second, we continue to advance our goal to deliver best-in-class costs in both our supply chain and in overheads. On
the supply chain reinvention front, in the next few weeks, we'll open our newest greenfield biscuit plant in Salinas,
Mexico right on schedule.
As we've said in the past, this plant will provide 1,000 basis points of margin improvement for products made there,
compared to our existing network. And we recently announced a $90 million investment in a new biscuit plant in
Bahrain to support regional growth.
We're in the midst of our first annual budget process, leveraging our new ZBB toolkit and revised cost policies. I can
tell you that ZBB is having the desired impact on our culture. We're pushing our teams to make the trade-offs, to
budget at a very granular level, and challenge old ways of thinking. This sets the stage for a best-in-class cost structure
and further margin improvement over the next few years.
Finally, as you know this past May, we announced the adoption of a category-led model in all of our regions starting
January 1, 2015. This operating model will deliver improvement in both our top and bottom lines, by accelerating
launches of proven innovations around the world, by clarifying and streamlining decision-making, by reducing costs
through simplification, standardization and scale, and by building world-class capabilities and operating discipline.
This is a significant change in how we'll run the business, especially in our emerging markets.
Right now, we're staging the new organization for launch. We've announced all the leaders of the region category
structure and their staffs. And in the coming weeks, we'll be working to ensure that the new organization is in place to
deliver our 2015 plan.
As you can imagine, all of this transformation work is quite an undertaking, but big change is something we do very
well here. I'm quite confident in our ability to successfully implement these initiatives, to get this company fit to win
regardless of the macro environment, and to deliver sustainable profitable growth over the long-term.
With that, let me open it up now for your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar of Barclays.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Good morning, everyone. And welcome, Brian.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hi, Andrew.
<A - Brian Gladden>: Thanks.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Two questions from me. First, on last quarter's call, it sort of seemed like organic sales growth
in the third quarter would be probably more similar to 2Q, given all the issues that you had discussed on the call. It
came in better and you did hold your full-year organic sales target range kind of steady. And I'm just trying to get a
sense of, does this suggest you potentially feel better about the upper end of that 2% to 2.5% range or not? The reason I
ask is, you have an easier comp in 4Q, and if you were to hit the lower end of the range, that would imply a sequential
deceleration in organic sales in the fourth quarter. I'm just trying to get a sense if there'd be any reason we should
expect that?
<A - David Brearton>: Andrew, it's Dave.

Page 7 of 16
<A - David Brearton>: I think, year-to-date organic growth is 2.2%, so it's about middle of that range year-to-date. As
we look at quarter four, I think a lot of the stuff we've talked about on this call for quarter three, we would expect to
continue. Global category growth is probably not going to change, especially in Europe, where the consumers are under
a bit more pressure.
Competition has priced, particularly on chocolate in our emerging markets, but in Europe they haven't yet priced, and it
doesn't look like they will through quarter four. And while, as Irene said, we resolved the French disputes in Europe, in
the process we lost a little bit of distribution and a few customers, and some of those disputes were only resolved in
October. So, you're going to see all of those factors carry forward into Q4, so we just felt it was prudent to keep our
full-year guidance at the 2% to 2.5% range.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Thanks for that. And then, secondly, I certainly understand the impact around the math of
higher pricing on the gross margin percentage and such. But I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of, such a big part of
the story going forward is really, as organic sales growth accelerates, it should happen on an even more compelling cost
structure, and then the earnings leverage that comes from that.
And I guess I would have thought, with all the productivity that you're generating, we would have still seen more
underlying gross margin improvement. So, I'm trying to get a sense if there's anything else at work there that was a
headwind or was it really, as you see it, purely the math of the pricing?
<A - David Brearton>: Yeah, the simple answer is the math of the pricing. Our commodity costs and ForEx impacts in
the quarter were up in the high single-digits, so a very big number. We priced to fully recover that in dollar terms, and
that's why you saw the 6% pricing come through. And we were able to get that in the market while maintaining good
performance on our shares. But, the simple math – if we're maintaining a dollar margin on a 6% price increase, is that
you end up with this denominator effect, and it was quite material in the quarter.
Our net productivity, as you pointed out, was at record levels. We've never had better than net productivity of 2.5%,
and that did drop through. That provided gross margin dollar growth and it allowed us to fully offset that denominator
impact and drive a little bit of gross margin gain. So, I understand the question, but we're actually quite happy that we
grew gross margins in the face of high single-digit commodity and ForEx impacts in the quarter.
As we go forward, I don't think we'll see those kind of cost and price increases every year. I think that equation of
pricing to recover dollars and using productivity to cover the percentage impact and still drive – give us fuel to drive
growth – will result in gross margins increasing over time. And you're right, it's a key part of why we believe we can
get to a 15% to 16% OI margin by 2016.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Great. Thanks very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman of JPMorgan.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: Hey. Good morning, everybody.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Hi, Ken.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: Dave, best of luck going forward. Brian, I don't know if you're available for questions, but I
am curious how you would describe your style in general. What do you think your strengths are as a CFO? What do
you think you bring to the company in your new role?
And then also, when you left Dell, you were quoted as saying that you do have a desire to run a company, so I'm
curious how that corresponds with your new role. It's a huge responsibility, but it's not running the whole shebang, so to
speak. So I'm just trying to understand your personal goals and how that corresponds with that quote a little better.

<A - Brian Gladden>: Ken, thanks. I would start by saying, obviously, great to be here, just getting started, enjoying
the transition and the time with Dave to really learn the business.
For me, this is a terrific opportunity to be part of building something great here. And I would just say I'm very excited.
I expect I'll have a chance to spend some time with you guys over the next quarter or two; and at that point, I'll be able
to share some early thoughts on sort of how I think about the business and how you'll see my role playing out, but I'm
extremely excited to be the CFO and partner with Irene here to drive the company going forward.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: You're good at answering questions politically. I like that. And Irene, part of the margin –
and maybe this is a better question for Dave, but part of the margin growth story depends on plants around the world
closing and opening in line with your schedule. Can you update us on progress here? Have there been any delays or is
everything on pace with what you anticipated?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: No, actually, we're feeling quite good about the pace, obviously, the most important next
up, big investment was in Salinas, and as I mentioned, we're very pleased with the progress and we're about to have that
plant up and running.
As we look around the rest of the world, everything is pretty much on schedule, the one place that we're continuing to
keep a watch on is that we have a plant in Siberia that's about to come on stream in the next year-and-a-half and we'll
continue to keep our eyes on that as we watch the political situation there.
But, net-net, we're very much on track with all of the supply chain reinvention initiatives that we laid out. And as you
know, that's going to be a big part of our gross margin improvement going forward.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: Great. Thanks so much.

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Good morning, everybody. Dave, best of luck.
<A - David Brearton>: Thanks, Eric.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. A couple of questions. How much was total advertising and promotion down in the
quarter?
<A - David Brearton>: I think, it was down 100% due to the productivity efforts we mentioned, our working media
was actually dead flat versus a year-ago. So, we continue to spend the same amount as on air.
In terms of the productivity impacts, I'm not sure, I want to give you that number right now, but I can tell you, it is
below the 9% rate that we've quoted in the past, but it's all been based on the agency consolidations and the ZBB
approach, we took to the non-working media. So, we're pretty confident that we've kept the investment at the level it
needs to be.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: But it looked like – if your product – I'm kind of wondering how much came out of Europe,
because your product's not on the shelf or a small percentage of what was. Why would you advertise there if you don't
have product on shelf? Was that a material factor in the quarter?
<A - David Brearton>: No, not really. That was really a French issue, so one country in Europe. One of the most
important things as you go through these pricing periods is that you continue to support the brands, because you got to
make sure you've got the consumer pull to help drive that pricing through both the customers and get the consumers
over the price shock. So, we very much focused on maintaining our working media investments in Europe and frankly,
globally.

<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. And then, Irene, most companies have been reporting very – slower growth in Brazil,
Russia is a big question mark, China is slowing down. And yet, you're reporting very strong growth in those markets;
almost no elasticity in Latin America, despite close to 20% pricing. The company has a history of over-shipping
consumption. Why should we be comfortable that these volume performances are okay?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: What, I'll tell you, Eric. There's no question we are doing better than our categories in a
number of these markets. We're very pleased with the impact that our marketing support has had, that our innovation
programs are having and that's been a key driver of our ability to outgrow the markets.
We continue to watch the performance of the macro economy in key markets like Russia to make sure that our
inventories are properly balanced. And as I've shared with you in the past, we've got very good visibility into that to
make sure that our sell-out and sell-in, are properly balanced.
So, we're very pleased with the performance of our businesses in some of these markets where the macro economies
have suffered, but I think it's partly because we're taking a number of steps to control our own destiny in those markets
with respect to the marketing support and the inputs that we're providing.
<A - David Brearton>: And, I think, Eric, just to follow-on that, the categories in our BRIC markets are holding up
surprisingly well. The GDP is pretty dismal in a lot of those markets, but surprisingly our categories remain strong
growing roughly in the mid single-digits and we've gained share in most of the categories that we compete in the BRIC
market.
So, we got to watch it very carefully. A couple of years ago, we did have some examples of over-shipping in China; but
I think, as we look at it today, we've got pretty tight control on the trade side situation. We're very aware that the
categories are sort of defying gravity at this point and we're watching it very closely, but I think we're probably a key
part of that with the innovation and investments, as Irene mentioned.
<Q - Eric R. Katzman>: Okay. And then, if I could – sorry, just one more, Dave, before you go. Something I always
ask about, but nine-month – using your own press release, nine-month free cash flow is only $40 million, yet you've
reported $2.2 billion of adjusted net income and you're saying that you're still going to get to $3.7 billion over the two
years. It looked like working capital was a massive use in the quarter. How do you bridge that gap and deliver? I don't
see how fourth quarter can be such a big positive swing versus almost no cash flow year-to-date – or free cash flow, I
should say.
<A - David Brearton>: Well, the $3.7 billion was a number that excluded a couple of key items, it excluded the
Starbucks gain last year of $1.7 billion after-tax, it excluded the actual tax payment on that Starbucks gain, and it
excluded the debt tender cost that we used that gain to be able to execute, given the tax situation that gave us.
So, it included restructuring, it included all the other noise, but I think specifically around those items tied to the
Starbucks gain, it was not part of that. I think if you included all those things, our $3.7 billion would actually be higher.
But within that, Starbucks gain obviously came last year and roughly $800 million of the tax payment on Starbucks
gain and the debt tender costs in the first quarter hit this year. So, if you take all that out, we would be up about $800
million on the quarter and that is well on track for the $1.4 billion we need to hit the two-year $3.7 billion target.
If you want to throw all that back in, we would have had a much higher cash flow target than what we've talked about
in the past last year and it would balance out a bit with some of those spending this year, but we're well on track.
I mean our cash flow, we're quite happy with where we are. The working capital is up versus December 31, but that's
normal. December due to the seasonality of our business is always our lowest working capital quarter and it always has
been. And September actually is leading into the heavy quarter four seasons.
So, we have higher inventories and we're starting to see higher receivables come through in September. So, that's a
fairly normal situation. When you look at it on a days basis; we're down as I said earlier about 20 days on our cash
conversion cycle. So, the working capital performance has been quite good, but when you compare to December, you'll
always see working capital increase, particularly third quarter it ends to be the peak.

Next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse.
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: Hi. Thank you very much. And David, best wishes to you. I guess, when I look at how this
year is progressing, gross profit dollars will actually be down for the year, but David, you said that there has been a lot
of productivity gains and that you're on track in your supply chain reinvention. So, I guess, I wanted to know if you
could help us quantify what those productivity benefits are and maybe explain why they're not improving gross profit
dollars just yet.
And then, secondly, on the SG&A, it's very encouraging to see so much productivity on the SG&A line. I just want to
get a sense of what we can expect for next year on that line, because some of these advertising efficiency
improvements, it's hard to see how you can do that two years in a row, but would love to see how ZBB is going to help.
Thanks.
<A - David Brearton>: Okay. I guess on the first one, gross margin is down on a reported basis due to currency really.
So, currency obviously impacts the entire P&L and it does result in gross margin dollars being down on a dollar basis.
But, I think if you strip out currency on a constant currency basis, as we said earlier, we're up about 3% on a dollar
basis and that is a reflection of fully pricing to recover those commodity and ForEx impacts, which was a big number,
and net productivity coming through at 2.5% of cost of goods sold, which is a record number and that really is the
reason we are able to grow our gross margins and it's the reason we're fairly confident that we can continue to drive
margin growth going forward and offset the pricing impacts. So, we actually feel very good about the gross margin. I
think you're looking at a reported ForEx basis. when you say it's down.
On the SG&A, I think the ZBB process as Irene said, is really – it started this year around mostly just making people
aware and trying to take a new approach to looking at things. We're in our first cycle of building budgets that way, so I
think we'd expect to see those savings continue and build into 2015. Specifically on the A&C line, you're right, I think
most of the low-hanging fruit would've come this year, but there'll be a carryover benefit to some of that carrying over
to next year when we get the full-year benefit, but I think you'll see more of the ZBB savings on the overhead line and
less in A&C next year, but I think it will build as we go through the year as well.
<Q - Robert B. Moskow>: David, do you have a top line or a top-down target for ZBB savings for next year, kind of
like something that you're thinking of?
<A - David Brearton>: We do. But we're not going to give you any 2015 guidance today.

Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: Thanks. Good morning. I know the year is not over yet, but it feels like the majority of the
EBIT margin growth this year has been and will be SG&A productivity. Wondering, heading into this next year, will
those changes internally, which may have been distracting, are you getting past what perhaps might have been
traumatic or at least a period of change in internal review for your marketing and selling functions, as well as general
overhead functions, and perhaps getting more on your front foot as you head into 2015? Any comments on that would
be helpful? Thanks.
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Well, again, there's no question, we are starting to see the result of all of our transformation
initiatives coming together, and I think we're feeling very good about the progress that we've made year-to-date.

And as I said in my remarks, we don't expect a dramatic change in the macro environment as we look ahead, so that we
anticipate continuing to leverage this approach. So, I think it's – clearly, we are beginning to make cost consciousness,
cost reduction, productivity a part of the DNA. We're starting to see it play through. It's a critical piece and critical
driver of our margins as we look ahead.
And I have every confidence that that will continue to play through as we look to the future. The facts are, though, we
haven't begun yet to implement the new organization model, which I mentioned will happen as of January 1, 2015, and
I think that will be a further help to our overall ability to deliver the targets that we've laid out.
<Q - David S. Palmer>: And then, separately, in the United States, how would you explain the slowing that we're
seeing in the U.S. biscuit category, in cookies and crackers? Is there any thought there?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Well, we've had a really strong run in our biscuit business, and I'm very pleased with the
performance that they've delivered. Our revenues have been growing about 4% to 5% for the past couple of years, and
it's been driven by some fabulous marketing execution as well as a very strong DSD selling organization.
We are seeing the category growth slowing from about 2% to 3%, so we've been outgrowing the category for quite
some time. It's now down about 1% to 2%, and we think that that's probably likely to be a factor in the near-term as the
consumer, particularly in North America, wrestles with the tough economy. Some of these are discretionary purchases,
and we think it has some impact on our categories.
Our focus is going to be continuing to innovate and drive our share within that larger macro economy, as well as very –
continuing to make very significant progress on the margin front.

Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Hey. Good morning, everyone. And Dave, congratulations. Wish you well going forward. I
had a question sort of following up on some of the items that people have focused on this morning, on just gross profits
and gross margins. So, I guess, couple things I'd like to get some comments on. First, just how much of your
commodity exposure is currently locked in for this year, and is there anything that's kind of locked in for next year?
Just trying to get a sense on visibility on commodity costs?
<A - David Brearton>: Yeah, I don't think we'll give you our hedging policy, because that would cross the line, but I
think it's fair to say that for this year, we're 100% locked in. There's really not much exposure.
I think on our commodity coverage, our strategy is to cover until we believe we can price. That tends to be how we do
our commodity and ForEx coverage decisions, and the only caveat to that is, in many emerging markets, it's quite
difficult to get some of the currency hedges you'd like to get in place. But that's our overall strategy, is to try to hedge
until we can price.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay. And then, I guess, looking at just the foreign currency transaction impact, it really
wasn't very much of a factor in Q3. Is that a potential headwind for 2015 or even for 4Q and 2015 going forward?
<A - David Brearton>: Actually, the foreign currency transaction impact is what we talk about when we say our
commodity – we're going to price away commodities and ForEx impacts. That is ForEx transaction, and that was about
half of the high single-digits cost increase I referred to. So it was material, primarily in emerging markets. Obviously,
with some of the latest moves over the last month, that'll become more of a factor in Europe. But it already has been a
significant factor in the cost movement this year.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay. And then, in terms of pricing, have you basically taken all the pricing you need so far,
based on what you know in terms of commodity costs and FX transaction? Obviously, not knowing what's going to

happen down the road, but just trying to make a sense is, you've been putting pricing in for the second quarter or the
third quarter. For now, are you primarily done with that, or is there still more new pricing that has to be instituted?
<A - David Brearton>: It varies a lot by market and category, but I guess two parts to it, we have announced more
price increases in some markets, but none of that is required to hit the quarter four. So, that's more about making sure
we continue to stay on the cost curve as we go into next year. So, there is more pricing coming through, but it's not
necessary to hit the quarter four guidance we just gave you.
<Q - Bryan D. Spillane>: Okay. Great. Thank you, Dave.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll of Citi Research.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: Great. Thank you and good morning, everyone. Dave, I'd like to add my
congratulations and best of luck on the new role, and appreciate all the assistance over the years. What I'd like to ask is,
Irene, on the margin front – and I think you've said this before, but I get this question all the time, is the weak volume
environment, does it concern you to a degree of being able to achieve your long-term margin targets?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: David, I feel quite confident, as we think about our long-term strategy, we are confident
that we will be able to deliver top tier revenue and earnings growth. We have very strong categories, even when they've
slowed down, they're still growing faster than most other food categories. Our brands are strong, we have strong market
positions in our key markets, and we've got a very good geographic footprint, particularly with respect to emerging
markets.
So I think the fundamental elements that we have that comprise our portfolio will still suggest that we have the
potential to grow at a very healthy rate over the long-term. In this challenging environment, though, we have chosen to
focus on what we can control, and that is driving productivity and aggressive cost reduction, and that's what's fueling
our earnings growth in the short-term.
So, over the long-term, I feel quite confident that we've got the right elements to be able to deliver top-tier growth on
both the top and bottom lines. But in the near-term, while we see the macro economy in its current condition, we are
choosing to focus on what we can control, which is primarily the cost.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: Maybe if I could – you said a lot right there, so maybe if I could just clarify as best
I can. Is that – the 15% to 16% margin target is predominantly based upon things that you can control internally, and
that, with year-to-date volumes down, I think it's 1.8%, that's not a killer in being able to achieve those targets. Is that
just a fair statement?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: That is a fair statement. As I said in my remarks, we do not expect a dramatic change in the
macro environment or in our trends, and therefore, we anticipate continuing to leverage the approach that is working so
well for us right now as we head into 2015.
That said, we're continuing to make the necessary and high-return foundational investments, so that as our markets
recover, particularly in the emerging markets, we're able to benefit from that, but I would suggest, obviously, we're not
giving you 2015 guidance today, but I would say that the algorithm and the approach that we're taking here is serving
us well and will serve us well for the foreseeable future.
<Q - David Cristopher Driscoll>: One last one for me, just a little one. I think you said that China, you saw mid
single-digit growth there. Those numbers have been very volatile, because of last year's Golden Oreo launch. The
quarterly numbers have been very volatile. Is the right way to think about China at this point kind of a mid single-digit
grower going forward, or at least next handful of quarters? Is that a reasonable way to think about China now?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: No, I'm not going to give market-by-market guidance, but I would say that this is an
unusual quarter, because of the year-ago comp in terms of the inventory destock. So, as I said, we're starting to see

Your next question comes from the line of Jason English of Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Hey. Good morning, folks.
<A - David Brearton>: Good morning.
<Q - Jason M. English>: First, quick housekeeping item. Can you give us some of the puts and takes that are going to
weigh on EPS for the fourth quarter? Your guidance sort of suggests that it's going to be down a couple cents
year-on-year?
<A - David Brearton>: Yeah, I think essentially what we're projecting for the fourth quarter would be interest roughly
in line with what you saw in the third quarter, the tax rate probably around the low-20%s range, because we don't see a
lot of discrete items coming in the fourth quarter, and operating income margins, mathematically to get to around 13%
on the year, we need to be in the high-13%s. So, that's kind of the composition of the quarter four.
<Q - Jason M. English>: That's helpful. I want to turn to productivity. I know there's been a lot of questions on this,
but your Mexican facility coming online. Can you give us a sense of how much volume or what percentage of your
volume out of North America and LATAM is going to be flowing through this facility? And then, once this comes
online, what are the next steps in terms of attacking your legacy North American infrastructure?
<A - David Brearton>: I think we've done a fair bit there. What we said about the Salinas facility, it's all about growth
volume. So, what is going into that facility is growth on our core Oreo, belVita and Ritz lines, and that's really how
we're going to fill up those five lines. Three of them are coming up this quarter. So, that's really what that is about, so
the vast majority of the volume will still come out of the legacy facilities.
Beyond that, though, we also announced earlier this year that we would be closing the Philadelphia facility and
investing money in both our Richmond and Fairmont facilities to upgrade those legacy facilities. So, I think our margin
improvement program in North America is both Salinas, but also making sure we have the right network here in the
U.S.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Okay. And real quick, last one, gum. It's been a while since you guys talked about the
category, how it's doing, and how you're doing in the category. Can you give us an update?
<A - Irene B. Rosenfeld>: Gum is about 8% of our revenue today and about half of it today is now in emerging
markets. And the good news is that the category continues to be generally quite robust in the emerging markets. If you
look at our year-to-date trends, they're not as strong just because of the impact of the Mexican VAT on the gum
category.
If you recall, it's about a 16% VAT, which obviously in the short-term is having a profound impact on the Mexican
gum category; but in aggregate, ex-Mexico, our emerging markets are growing over 5%. So, we feel quite good about
the profile in the emerging markets and we are starting to see the impact of a number of our near-term programs on our
share performance.
Over a half of our shares are growing or holding and particularly, in China, which is basically the number two gum
market in the world, we continue to see very strong performance. That's going to be about $150 million business for us
this year, so net-net, we haven't solved the longer-term macro trends in developed markets, but as our business shifts
increasingly to the emerging markets, we feel quite confident that will continue to benefit from the growth there.
<Q - Jason M. English>: Great. Thanks a lot, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Hi, everyone. Thanks. And just echo what everyone else said and good luck to Dave.
First question, just on the regions, on Asia specifically, organic sales growth was up 1.3%, but China was up high
single. Australia and New Zealand was positive. India was quite strong. So, just trying to reconcile the importance of
those markets and curious what other markets or factors weighed on the overall region and how sustainable those issues
might be?
<A - David Brearton>: Yeah. I think the other two areas of the region would be Japan, which is primarily a gum
market, and I think the category, we did very well on share there, but the category is in decline and probably will
continue to decline, because of the ageing population demographics.
And the other one is in Southeast Asia and I think the news in the quarter there was around Malaysia and there was a
report that was inaccurate that said our chocolate wasn't Halal and that caused our volumes to go down in the third
quarter in Malaysia. We're in the process of working through that and clarifying with our consumers that nothing really
has changed, but it had an impact on the third quarter shipments. So, those would be the two other items in Asia.
<Q - Matthew C. Grainger>: Okay. Thanks, Dave. And Brian, if I could ask you one other quick question, if it's one
you can answer. Even though, you're not formally in the CFO role yet, now that you've been named to the post, are you
actively involved in the 2015 budget process and the ongoing process of assessing the business outlook and setting
guidance?
<A - Brian Gladden>: Absolutely. I mean, we've spent the last couple of weeks in a lot of deep reviews really focused
on 2015. So, that's been a primary focus and where Dave and I've spent a lot of time together.

Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard of Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - David Brearton>: Hi, Alexia.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Can I ask about the impact of SKU rationalization? I know I guess this time last year,
there was a comment that you were starting with 74,000 SKUs globally and an expectation that that would be reduced
quite significantly over the next two years or three years. Is that hitting your top line today? Will it continue to hit
somewhat over the next year or so? Can you give us any idea, now that you're a year into this rationalization, just how
much those numbers might come down over time? Thank you.
<A - David Brearton>: Yeah. I think the rationalization we talked about is probably most advanced in Europe. And
yes, it is included in both the results as well as the guidance we gave going forward. I would expect us to continue to do
that. At any good company, it's just good housekeeping to continue cleaning up the SKUs. And so, I think you'll
continue to see those things and any guidance that we give you will include the impact of that SKU rationalization.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: But given that – I think there was a conversation about meaningful 20%, 30% reductions,
in some cases. Do you have an idea about what the endpoint here is or what the number could go down to over the
longer-term?
<A - David Brearton>: I think our comment on the 20% to 30% was specifically around a couple of programs we had
in Europe, and we're on track to deliver that. I don't think we've given any total SKU number, but I think you can

expect us to take the kind of European program and apply that logic elsewhere.
Importantly, an SKU reduction can result in a top line impact. It can also actually just clean up the shelf and help us
drive growth going forward. So, it isn't necessarily a revenue hit. It can be, and it was to some degree this year in
Europe, but it doesn't necessarily have to be.
So, we'll continue to apply those principles, they're actually tied quite tightly to the supply chain reinvention program

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Hey. Good morning, everyone. I just had two quick follow-up questions. One is, last
quarter, you guys reduced the OI growth rate. Now, you're actually going and actually raising it. Can you isolate one to
three reasons of what are the major changes of going from one quarter to another quarter in terms of the outlook on
that?
<A - David Brearton>: Yeah, I think last quarter what we did is we called down our revenue guidance, and we kept
our margin guidance. So mathematically, that means we had to reduce our OI growth rate.
This quarter, we've kept our revenue guidance. We had very good margin performance in quarter three, and we
essentially said, we think we can keep that and carry that forward into quarter four, and we've increased our margin
guidance.
So, I think, we're just, frankly, keeping you up-to-date as the world unfolds. Our guidance today is really around
sticking with the 2% to 2.5% revenue growth rate on the top line and taking our margins up to around 13% on the OI
level. And that results in the higher OI growth rates.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Let me ask it another way. Did you accelerate the ZBB? Is there something that came in
earlier than expected? Was there a little bit less elasticity? Was there certain rebound in emerging markets or something
that's happened at all during the quarter that's kind of changed your view, particularly on the ZBB side?
<A - David Brearton>: I think ZBB is probably the thing I would single out as saying we've had a good performance
on overheads all year, but I think we're making better progress year-to-date than we'd originally expected. So, if you
had to single out one thing that caused us to raise our margin guidance this year that would be it.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: And then my final question is, can you give us an update on the size of the gaps, where
they were – or of some key markets, and where they stand now and where you hope them to be? What are the actual
progress of the price gaps, because you said that has actually come in, in emerging markets, and I was just curious to
see what the progression has been and are you at the state where you need to be?
<A - David Brearton>: Two answers for that. In emerging markets, we priced when commodities and ForEx impacts
hit. Many of our competitors either didn't price or priced significant later than we did. That's mostly trued up by now.
The price gaps in emerging markets are largely back in line. Competition either priced or downsized to reflect the cost
increases. Where it's still out of line would be in European chocolates, where we have priced to reflect the commodity
and ForEx impacts and most of the competition has not.
And so, we're still out of line in Europe. On those, we would expect over time the competition will need to reflect the
realities of the new cost levels, but as we sit here today, there's still price gaps in European chocolate. That's the one
outlier. I think the rest of the business feels pretty good.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Great. Thank you.

Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions and answers. I'll now return the call to Dexter
Congbalay for any additional or closing remarks.
Dexter Congbalay
Thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning – or afternoon, if you're in Europe. Nick and I will be around for the rest
of the day to take any calls or, frankly, for the rest of the week. But then, again, have a good day.
