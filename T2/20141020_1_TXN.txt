MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, and welcome to the Texas Instruments' third quarter 2014 earnings call. At this time I would like to turn the
conference over to Dave Pahl. Please go ahead, sir.
David Pahl
Thank you. Good afternoon and thank you for joining our third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. As usual, Kevin
March, TI's Chief Financial Officer, is with me today.
For any of you who missed the release, you can find it in relevant non-GAAP reconciliations on our website at

This call will include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could cause TI's results to
differ materially from management's current expectations. We encourage you to review the Safe Harbor Statement
contained in the earnings release published today, as well as TI's most recent SEC filings for a more complete
description.
The third quarter was another quarter that marked strong progress. Our core businesses of Analog and Embedded
Processing grew again with combined revenue up 10% from a year ago. Revenue of $3.5 billion came in solidly in the

upper half of our expected range we had communicated to you in July. Earnings per share of $0.76 was at the top of our
range as profitability was strong in the quarter.
Our cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion. We continue to believe that free cash flow growth is most important to
maximizing shareholder value in the long-term, especially on a per share basis.
Free cash flow for the trailing 12 month period was almost $3.5 billion or 27% of revenue consistent with our targeted
range of 20% to 30% of revenue. This is a 300 basis point improvement from a year ago period. We believe this
reflects our improved product portfolio and the efficiencies of our manufacturing strategy, which includes our growing
300-millimeter output and purchasing assets ahead of demand at distressed prices.
We also continue to believe that free cash flow will be valued only if it's returned to shareholders, or productively
invested in the business. Over the past 12 months, we've returned $4.2 billion of cash to investors through a
combination of stock repurchases and dividends paid.
In the third quarter, TI revenue grew 8% from a year ago with growth in both Analog and Embedded Processing.
Analog revenue grew 11% from a year ago, led by Power Management. High Volume Analog and Logic, High
Performance Analog, and Silicon Valley Analog also grew. Embedded Processing grew 6% from a year ago due to
microcontrollers, connectivity and processors, each of which grew by about the same amount. Embedded Processing
delivered its eighth quarter in a row of year-on-year growth. In our Other segment, revenue was about even from a year
ago, as a decline in Legacy Wireless products was mostly offset by growth in DLP products.
Turning to distribution, resales increased 10% from a year ago consistent with our combined revenue growth in Analog
and Embedded Processing. Weeks of inventory were unchanged at a historically low level of just over four and a half
weeks. This level is low because we've structurally changed how inventory is managed in the distribution channel with
our consignment program.
This quarter, we continued to convert more of our distribution sales to consignment and now support about 55% of our
distribution revenue on consignment, up about 10 percentage points from a year ago. With this program, inventory sits
on TI's balance sheet and revenue is recognized when distributors pull products from our consignment inventory that is
stored at distributors' locations. This program minimizes changes in demand due to distribution channel inventory, and
most importantly allows us greater flexibility to meet customer demand.
From an end market perspective, TI revenue growth from a year ago was due to communications equipment, industrial
and automotive, each of which grew by about the same amount. Enterprise systems was also up, while revenue in
personal electronics declined due to Legacy Wireless products.
Now Kevin will review profitability, capital management and our outlook. Kevin.
Kevin P. March
Thanks, Dave, and good afternoon, everyone.
Gross profit in the quarter was $2.04 billion or 58.4% of revenue. Gross profit increased 15% from the year ago quarter
and gross profit margin hit another new record. This gross profit reflects higher revenue and an improved product
portfolio focused on Analog and Embedded Processing that benefits from our efficient manufacturing strategy.
Moving to operating expenses, combined R&D and SG&A expense of $795 million was down $38 million from a year
ago. The decline primarily reflects the targeted reductions in Embedded Processing in Japan that were previously
announced, as well as continued cost discipline across TI.
Acquisition charges were $83 million, almost all of which were the ongoing amortization of intangibles, a non-cash
expense. Restructuring and other charges were a $9 million benefit, primarily due to the gains from sales of assets.

Operating profit was $1.18 billion, or 33.6% of revenue. Operating profit was up 39% from the year ago quarter. Net
income in the third quarter was $826 million, or $0.76 per share.
Let me now comment on our capital management starting with our cash generation. Cash flow from operations was
$1.38 billion in the quarter. Inventory days were 108, consistent with our model of 105 to 115 days. Capital
expenditures were $103 million in the quarter. On a trailing 12 month basis, cash flow from operations was $3.82
billion, up 17% from the same period a year ago. Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $367 million, or 3% of
revenue. As a reminder, our long-term expectations for capital expenditure is to be about 4% of revenue.
Besides inexpensively adding capacity ahead of demand, we have focused on delivering higher levels of customer
service. By combining this capacity with continued improvements in how we manage inventory, we're able to keep our
lead times consistently low while continuing to deliver on time.
Free cash flow for the past 12 months was $3.45 billion, or 27% of revenue. As we've said, we believe strong cash flow
growth, particularly free cash flow growth, is most important to maximizing shareholder value in the long-term and
would be valued only if it's returned to shareholders or productively reinvested in the business.
In the third quarter TI paid $319 million in dividends, and repurchased $670 million of our stock for a total return of
$989 million. As we've noted, our intention is to return all of our free cash flow, plus any proceeds that we receive from
the exercises of equity compensation, minus net debt retirement.
Total cash returned in the past 12 months was $4.16 billion, which was 9% higher than a year ago. In the quarter we
announced a 13% dividend increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.30 to $0.34 per share, or $1.36 annualized.
This marked our 11th consecutive year of increasing dividends, and our 52nd year of continuous dividend payments.
Outstanding share count has reduced by 3.5% over the past 12 months and by 39% since the beginning of 2005. These
returns demonstrate our confidence in TI's business model, and our commitment to return excess cash to our
shareholders.
Fundamental to our commitment to return cash, are our cash management and tax practices. We ended the third quarter
with $3.19 billion of cash and short term investments up from $2.80 billion at the beginning of the quarter.
TI's U.S. entities own 81% of our cash. Because our cash is largely onshore it is readily available for a variety of uses
including, paying dividends and repurchasing our stock. TI's orders in the quarter were $3.34 billion, up 6% from a
year ago. And our book-to-bill ratio was 0.95. This ratio would have been a bit higher except for the impact of the
conversion to consignment of some products sold to distribution. While book-to-bill still would have been below one,
this is consistent with the pattern that we have seen for the past four years.
Turning to our outlook, we expect TI revenue in the range of $3.13 billion to $3.39 billion in the fourth quarter. At the
middle of this range, revenue would increase 8% from a year ago.
We expect fourth quarter earnings per share to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.74. Restructuring charges will be
essentially nil. Acquisition charges, which are non-cash amortization charges, will remain about even and hold at about
$80 million to $85 million per quarter for the next five years. Our expectation for our effective tax rate in 2014 remains
about 28%. This is the tax rate you should use for the fourth quarter.
In summary, the third quarter demonstrates the growing strength of TI's business model. Our strategy is anchored in
Analog and Embedded Processing, and is bolstered by an efficient manufacturing operation, and a broad sales channel.
The result is diverse, and long lived positions in many markets. We remain intent on excellence in execution,
disciplined in allocating our capital, and firm believers that free cash flow per share is the best long-term indicator of
shareholder value.
With that, let me turn it back to Dave.

Thanks, Kevin. Operator, you can now open the lines up for questions. In order to provide as many of you as possible
an opportunity to ask your questions, please limit yourself to a single question. After our response, we'll provide you an
opportunity for additional follow up. Danny?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead,
sir.
<Q - John W. Pitzer>: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Kevin, I guess my first question
will be on OpEx. Clearly you're well ahead of your expected annualized savings of $130 million with the restructuring
actions. How do you think OpEx will trend sequentially into the December quarter? And if you look at R&D as a
percent of rev now below 10%, is that just a structural change in the model? And how worried should I be at what scale
level you should be investing on R&D for future growth? I understand that you're still spending absolutely a lot more
money than most of your peers, but tough to see someone with your gross margins and R&D as a percent of revenue
below 10%.
<A - Kevin P. March>: Okay. John, I think there were a couple in there. Let me see if I can remember them all.
Starting with OpEx and trends, the – clearly OpEx was down quarter-over-quarter largely as a result of some of the
restructuring actions we previously announced, as well as just ongoing cost discipline in all the various businesses
across TI.
As you look into the fourth quarter, if you just go back and take a look at the year ago that's probably your best gauge
to take a look at, fourth quarter and even the first quarter for that matter. We typically see that OpEx is lower in the
fourth quarter due to holidays and vacations. In addition, this fourth quarter we expect a further benefit of another $15
million of costs to come out as a result of the restructuring that we announced in Embedded Processing. That's part of
that $130 million of annualized savings that you were mentioning, John, and in fact, we're probably running ahead of
that $130 million of annualized savings right now. We probably are going to come out beyond that.
From the total R&D spend as a percent of revenue, again, I think what's more important is not how much you spend,
but how well you spend it. And I think the best indicator of how well you're spending it is what's happening to your
market share as a result of the products you're introducing into the market.
In our case, if you take a look at 2006 through 2013, the last full year periods that we've reported on, our total R&D
spend is up 77% over that period. But most importantly, that R&D has resulted in products where we have continually
gained share. Again, I think, John, it's less a question of how much you spend it, and a lot more how well you spend it.
And spend it on things that customers really care about.
<A - David Pahl>: That's good. John, do you have a follow up?
<Q - John W. Pitzer>: Yeah, guys, quickly, just, I know you don't give segment guidance for revenue, but when I look
at the Embedded business in the September quarter, it was up only about 1.1% sequentially, which is a little bit weaker
than I had been modeling and I'm kind of curious as to what you think might have driven that and given that some of
your peers have talked about sort of a slowdown in the second half of September from a macro perspective, did any of
that play into the Embedded business in the September quarter? Thank you.
<A - David Pahl>: Okay. So let me take that, John. I think if you look at the growth rates between Analog and
Embedded Processing you can see a lot of quarters they won't grow the same. And I think if you look at both of those
businesses, they have different end market exposures and really it's those end market exposures that will explain most
of the differences in those numbers.

So and the second part of your question was? Yeah, just basically is the overall environment impacting the growth that
we've seen there? And I'd just say no, that really isn't in those numbers. Basically that forecast is given off of the orders
that we received from our customers.
So thank you, John. Can we go to the next caller, please?
Operator
Yes, sir. Our next caller is Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Ambrish Srivastava>: Hi. Thank you very much. Just on the overall demand environment, there is a lot of
confusion out there but it seems like things have slowed down. So just wanted your perspective, in the past you guys
have given us certain things as you look at such as cancellations and so on and so forth. So and also within that frame
of reference, Dave, if you could please just walk us through your disti consignment versus non-consignment and then
how would you compare it to somebody who claims that they are sell-through so they see a slowdown before – a
quarter or so before others. And then I had a very quick follow-up.
<A - David Pahl>: Okay. So a couple of points in there, Ambrish. The first is, is that I'd just point out that all of our
distributors provide us with a point-of-sale reporting. And we get that information on a very regular basis. So regardless
of how the revenue is recognized, we see what's going on from a distributor resell standpoint.
The second thing is, you touched on the current environment and we really want to be guarded on trying to take a
position for the industry on where that's going. But we can really point to just what we see.
So if I kind of step through those, our inventory on our books is at 108 days, it's within our target model. If you look at
our channel inventories, those were essentially unchanged from last quarter. They're at a very lean level at just over
four and a half weeks. Our lead times have been consistent and I'd say low. Our cancellations and reschedules remain
very low, so nothing changing on that front. And then probably as we have grown over these last few quarters we've
been able to support that growth and keep delivering our products on time at very, very high service levels. So
operations continue to execute at that high level.
So and then I'll get to the last part of your question was what percentage of our revenue goes through distribution and
what percentage is supported by consignment. So the first one is about 55% of our revenues go through the distribution
channel and about 55% of that is supported on consignment and as we pointed out in our prepared remarks, that has
increased by about 10% from a year ago as we've had a couple of conversions go on this year. And I would say that
we're not done with that. We actually expect that additional conversions will happen over the next year or so, so we
expect that percentage will actually increase.
So, Ambrish, do you have a follow up?
<Q - Ambrish Srivastava>: Yeah, quick follow up, Dave. On the Embedded operating margins you guys have had a
steady increase. What's the right way to think about how do you get to north of 20%? Is it just a matter on focusing on
the right product mix and getting that ramped-up or is it something beyond that? Thank you, Dave.
<A - David Pahl>: Sure.
<A - Kevin P. March>: Ambrish, I'll take that one. On Embedded Processing, clearly the margins have been
continuously improving over these last few quarters and we'd expect further improvement. Recall I just mentioned
earlier in the call that we expect another $15 million or so of cost to come out of the fourth quarter, and most of that
will come out of Embedded Processing.
I would add that from this point going forward, and we've talked about this the last couple quarters, the amount of
spend inside Embedded Processing is sufficient. It doesn't need to increase anymore. What really the focus is, is
revenue growth, and that's what it's really all about. That entire team has been very focused on that. I believe they just
recorded their eighth quarter in a row of year-over-year revenue growth, so they clearly are working on the right

metrics to really make that business start to deliver profitability at the levels we expect it to at TI.
<A - David Pahl>: Okay. Thank you, Ambrish. We'll go to next caller, please.
Operator
Our next question is from Stacy Rasgon with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First I want to dig into the Embedded
Processing margins again just a little bit. You had about $26 million in OpEx come out from Q2 to Q3. You had
revenue in the group up a little bit, but mostly flat. Margins were only up a little bit. Given all of that cost in theory I
would have expected to come out of Embedded Processing, why weren't the Embedded Processing margins up more? It
doesn't seem like all of those cost savings actually flowed through to margins this quarter.
<A - Kevin P. March>: Actually, they all flowed through to margins, Stacy, but not through Embedded Processing.
Recall those actions incorporate both Embedded Processing as well as actions in Japan...
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Ah.
<A - Kevin P. March>: ...which flowed through our margins as well. Even with that, at the EP level, you did see about
a 72% fall-thorough on that delta revenue. So you're seeing it come through. But do keep in mind the Japan stuff is
spread around some of the other businesses as well.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Got it. Got it. That's helpful. For my follow up, if I can dig into the gross margins a little
bit, I think both for this quarter and next quarter, so for this quarter you came in a little bit high. I guess was that only
the revenue upside or was there something else in terms of mix or other cost savings that pushed it up? And then for
next quarter, depending on how far you're guiding OpEx down, it feels to me like you're guiding gross margins
implicitly flat to up in Q4 in a quarter where revenues are down and typically your gross margins would be down in Q4
as well. So, if you can give us a sort of feeling for what the gross margin drivers for next quarter ought to be in terms of
mix offsetting revenue declines that would be very helpful.
<A - Kevin P. March>: Sure, Stacy. I think that clearly the extra revenue came through and it was quite rich. We also
had a slightly better mix of overall products that were shipped in the quarter. So that combined gave us that new record
gross profit margin of 58.4%.
As we look into fourth quarter, I would not characterize our guidance as suggesting that margins go up. We will be
reducing loadings some in the fourth quarter on a seasonal basis, and so you can expect that margins will be down a bit.
Not very much, but down just a little bit. So depending how you're building your model there, I wouldn't assume
margins increasing in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Got it.
<A - David Pahl>: Yep, thank you, Stacy. And we'll go to the next caller.
Operator
Our next caller is Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
<Q - Harlan L. Sur>: Thank you for taking my question and congrats on the solid quarterly execution. The markets
have been focused on Europe and China as sources of potential weakness. At the same time, the team has done a solid
job on diversification, and maybe that's what it is. The diversity affords you a more stable revenue profile. But at the
margin, can you just talk about the overall health by geographies? Have you seen any signs of weakening above the
normal seasonal trends that you would normally expect here in Q3 or Q4?

<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, sure, Harlan. I'd say if you just look at what happened regionally, year-over-year, Asia and
Europe were both up while the U.S. was even and Japan was down a little bit. And sequentially all the regions were up
with Asia and Europe up the most. And if you look specifically inside of China and how resales had done there, we had
looked into that and I'd just say that resales really just continued to be solid as we closed out the quarter. So that's
basically what we saw.
Do you have a follow up?
<Q - Harlan L. Sur>: Yes, absolutely. Thank you for that. You gave us some trends in OpEx into the fourth quarter.
How should we think about OpEx as we move into the first half of next year?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Harlan, I won't comment on first half but I will give you some thoughts on first quarter. Your
best way to analyze that is just go take a look at what happened from fourth quarter to first quarter of the most recent
year coming out of 2013, 2012. We do have seasonal increases in OpEx as we go from fourth to first, typically because
of an absence of vacations that we have in fourth and the partial implementation of our annual pay and benefit increases
that occur in first. So they will, you should expect those to be up, and you can take a look at, again, this past year to get
a rough idea as to about how much that increases by in percentage terms.
<A - David Pahl>: Yes. I'd just add, Harlan, that as we indicated before, Kevin pointed out that we're expecting about
$15 million more of savings in fourth quarter. At that point, we'll be essentially complete on those announced actions.
So we'll basically be, just have those seasonal impacts that Kevin had mentioned.
All right. Thank you. We'll go to the next caller please.
Operator
Next caller is Craig Ellis with B. Riley.
<Q - Craig A. Ellis>: Thanks for taking the question. I'll start off with a bigger picture question, Kevin. The company's
done a very good job of looking forward and being proactive. Taking action to either prune lower margin revenue
streams such as wireless or identifying opportunities for cost savings such as the optimization program this year. As
you look ahead, how much further room is there for a similar such optimization efforts? Are we really at a point where
the TI model is getting very close to being optimized?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Yes, Craig. I think that as we look forward from an optimization standpoint, I think the ones
you've talked about so far have been more about where we might have trimmed in areas that had opportunities perhaps
not quite as attractive as other areas. I think perhaps one of the areas least appreciated, as people look at TI on a
go-forward basis, is the impact that continued delta revenue on 300-millimeter Analog is going to have for us. The cost
structure to build on 300-millimeter is very attractive. And so incremental revenue going forward on 300-millimeter we
expect to produce not only higher margins but also higher levels of total cash on that delta revenue.
<A - David Pahl>: Do you have a follow on, Craig?
<Q - Craig A. Ellis>: Yeah, I do thank you. Dave, you mentioned the strength in Analog Power Management on a
year-on-year basis. Was it similarly strong sequentially, and what specifically is driving that strength?
<A - David Pahl>: Yes. So on a sequential basis, if you look at our Analog business, it was up primarily due to High
Volume Analog, and Logic, as well as Power Management. Though we did see growth really from all four businesses,
High-Performance Analog and Silicon Valley, also grew. So you see a little bit of difference there sequentially, but
again Power continued to be strong in both comparisons.
Okay. Thank you, Craig. We'll go to the next caller, please.

Our next question comes from Stephen Chin with UBS.
<Q - Stephen Chin>: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to drill down a little deeper on the Embedded
Processing segment, in particular between microcontrollers, and I guess DSPs and application processors, could you
talk about some of the trends that you saw in Q3, especially from any, I guess, communications equipment exposure
that you have?
<A - David Pahl>: Okay. So Embedded Processing as you know, grew 6% from a year ago. That was driven by
microcontrollers, connectivity, and processors each growing by about the same amount. And again, as Kevin pointed
out, that was the eighth quarter in a row of year-over-year growth. Sequentially revenue was a little better than even.
Connectivity was up, and processors and microcontrollers were about even sequentially.
Do you have a follow-on Stephen?
<Q - Stephen Chin>: Yes. In terms of gross margins, I'm just wondering if this year there's an opportunity for you to
take advantage of building any strategic inventory for certain products that you know have good turnover, and hence
maybe further optimize gross margins a little bit in the seasonally slower quarter? Thanks.
<A - Kevin P. March>: Yes, Stephen. We do that on an ongoing basis. That's one of the ways that we're able to keep
the lead time for the overwhelming majority of our parts to six weeks or less. Is that in fact we build to stock, not
necessarily build to order. Meaning we maintain a stock of inventory such that we can always have short lead times for
our customers. So from a strategic standpoint that is done. It does have a little ebb and flow as you point out. When we
have lower loading in certain quarters, it gives us a chance to build up on a few extra parts on that. But I don't think
there's a whole lot of opportunity to do that just to impact the gross margins. I think we're really doing that to impact
customer service.
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, and I'd also add, Stephen, that if you take the combined way that we're managing inventory
now and we're being very intentional with specific targeted programs, depending on how quickly that inventory turns,
but you take that plus the open capacity that we've got and the combination of those two things and we've really been
able to execute at very high levels and deliver our products on time to customers. And so we think not only having low
lead times but also delivering products when you make a commitment to a customer, the combination of those things
are what customers would like to have.
Okay. Thank you. We'll move on to the next caller, please.

Next we have Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Joseph Moore>: Great. Thank you. Can you talk about where your fab utilizations are now just qualitatively?
And if there's still an underutilization charge as part of these numbers?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Joe, on the underutilization charges the answer is yes, there are but we're not really talking
about those anymore and the reason is really kind of straightforward. We've found that analysts and some investors
were drawing the conclusion that because we had underutilization that increasing our utilization would be the
maximum amount by which we could increase our overall profitability if we put revenue into those factories and that's
really an incomplete answer.
I'll remind you that our stated strategy is to invest in our capacity ahead of demand. By definition that means we will
have open capacity and underutilization costs. Our purpose though for buying ahead of demand is to purchase that
capacity with as little cash as possible. So the underutilization charge is mostly a non-cash charge and it tends to miss
the point that our objective is to be maximizing free cash flow.
So for that reason you haven't really heard us commenting on or quantifying underutilization charges these past few
quarters and unlikely to in the future unless there's some material change that causes a better understanding of what's

<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, and, Joe, I'll just add the last time we had stated our end to end capacity it was in the $18
billion range, so if you want to get a qualitative feel of where capacity is, you could annualize our quarterly revenues
and put it against that number and it will get you into the ZIP Code.
So do you have a follow on, Joe?
<Q - Joseph Moore>: Yeah, thank you for that. In terms – could you give us an update on the base station market? I
know you had said last quarter that continued to be strong. Just anything that you're seeing from that end market?
<A - David Pahl>: Well, yeah, if I just look at the communications market overall, and I would – from a year-on-year
standpoint it was up primarily due to wireless infrastructure while sequentially it was down. And basically we just saw
that in – as a seasonal pause in the fourth quarter.

Our next caller is Vivek Arya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<A - David Pahl>: Hi, Vivek.
<Q - Vivek Arya>: Hello. Thank you for taking my question. You mentioned a very interesting thing on the improving
output from your 300-millimeter fab and I was wondering if you could give us some more color around what
percentage of your starts are moving to that fab, and more importantly what that implies for gross margins? For
example in the past you have mentioned about 75% fall-through on gross margins. So as you increase the loading on
300-millimeter, what does that do to that number over the next several quarters or years?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Yeah, Vivek, I don't know that I'm prepared to give you a detailed quantification of that
nature. What I would just say is as we've talked in the past about, just from the geometries alone, that the chip cost
itself was about 30% lower on 300-millimeter than it is on 200. Not to mention that you also get better yield results and
so on, so you get a number of different benefits.
So what we're seeing happening is proportionately more and more new products that we're releasing are being released
onto 300-millimeter which means as we look over the next year, two or three or four years, more and more of our
revenue will be sourced off of 300-millimeter which inherently means it's got lower cost which should allow us to
incrementally increase our gross margins as well as importantly our free cash flow.
Beyond that, I don't have any specifics I'll give you at this point in time, but I do want to introduce that concept to
people because I think it's being underestimated as to how important that is to TI's continued progress.
<A - David Pahl>: Do you have a follow on, Vivek?
<Q - Vivek Arya>: Yes. Dave, the question is on the end market mix. I believe you mentioned comms was strong on a
year-on-year basis. Was wondering if you could just give us your end market mix overall for Q3 and how do you see
those trends playing out in Q4? Thank you.
<A - David Pahl>: Sure. Yeah, so on a year-on-year basis, our revenue growth was due to comms equipment,
industrial, and automotive, as I mentioned before, each of which grew and contributed to that growth by about the same
amount. Our Enterprise Systems was also up while revenue in personal electronics declined due to legacy wireless
products.
So if you kind of go down one step on each side, inside each one of those, industrial we've got about a dozen sectors
inside of industrial. And as we've talked to different investors over the last few months and as we're traveling around, it
becomes clear to us that our definition of industrial probably isn't as well understood.

And we've got – years ago we used to define it as what it wasn't, meaning it wasn't comms equipment, or it wasn't
automotive, or it wasn't other things. But now we've got very intentional definitions. We've got about a dozen different
sectors that make that up. So things like appliances, and building automation, and displays, and point-of-sale products,
factory automation, industrial transportation, medical healthcare, fitness, lighting, motor drives, power infrastructure,
things like that, so very, very broad but very specific.
So when you look on a year-on-year basis, we had growth in nearly all of those sectors with most of the sectors actually
providing double-digit growth. It was actually led by medical and healthcare fitness and factory automation, but again
we saw that growth very broad based.
Automotive we've got five sectors inside of that. And I'll also just point that those sectors are actually out on our
website if people interested. But we've got double-digit growth in all the sectors but led by passive safety and
infotainment.
Comms equipment, as I mentioned, was up due to wireless infrastructure. Personal electronics was down due to legacy
wireless products. And if you take that out, we did see growth in PC and notebooks and mobile phones and that was
partially offset by some weakness that we saw in gaming. And then the Enterprise Systems, part of that is where our
DLP products will sit. And that was up due to projectors. So, I'll stop there.
So thank you, Vivek. Do we have a follow-up question?
<Q - Vivek Arya>: No. That was my...
<A - David Pahl>: Yep. Thank you very much. We'll go to the next caller. Thanks so much, Vivek.

Our next caller is Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.
<Q - Mark J. Lipacis>: Thanks for taking my question. The first question is, historically when you saw lead times
stretch for some of your competitors, not only, even if your own times stayed stable, you would see not only double
ordering at your competitors but also double ordering at Texas Instruments as well. And I'm wondering if you think
something has changed structurally with how you guys are running the business or how the industry operates that might
have changed that dynamic?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Yeah, Mark, I don't know that I'll speak for the industry but I'll speak for TI and kind of go
back to the comments we made earlier. As a result of us taking an approach whereby we intentionally invest in capacity
before we need it, and therefore always have more capacity than what's needed for that quarter's business, it allows us
to be able to build inventory in a much more thoughtful fashion than we have in the past. The consequence of that has
been that not only have we been able to maintain lead times for the preponderance of our products at six weeks or less
for several years now, we've also been able to maintain a very high level of on time delivery to our customers against
those lead times.
So when you put that together, what you've really got for TI is just a different way whereby we are managing our
manufacturing footprint and how we utilize that manufacturing footprint for purposes of managing inventory.
As it relates to double ordering, again one of the biggest things that tends to be evident when double ordering begins to
pop up, is you start seeing cancellations or reschedulings beginning to ramp up. We do not see that and we have not
seen that for some time now. So I think the strategy whereby we have capacity ahead of demand and we use that
thoughtfully to make sure that we can maintain relatively low lead times is serving well to satisfy our customers at least
as it relates to demand for our products.
<A - David Pahl>: Do you have a follow up, Mark?

<Q - Mark J. Lipacis>: Yes, I do. And that's helpful, Kevin. And the follow up is actually on that topic about the lead
times. I think earlier in the script you said you're delivering – you're focused on delivering higher levels of customer
service. And then I think you followed that up with saying we're keeping lead times consistently low. So I guess I'm
trying to reconcile when you say delivering higher levels of customer service do you think your lead times over maybe
a longer period of time have come in? That they're just structurally shorter? Or are you just delivering them more
consistently at a shorter time? So I'm just trying to reconcile when you said what is the higher level of customer
service? What has the improvement been? Thank you.
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, thanks for that clarification. I think it's a real good question. So when we refer to that, we
look at a bunch of different customer service metrics. One is just how many line items are we shipping on time. And
we've had some very intentional initiatives that have been set up to be able to ensure that that is a good solid number
and we're taking advantage of both the capacity and our inventory to ensure that we're consistently delivering on time.
And so that's one of the metrics that we look at and that's what we mean by customer service. It's not really changing
those lead times but keeping them stable and then delivering products when we say that we'll deliver them. It's really
the combination of those two things.
So thanks, Mark, and we'll go to the next caller please.

Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.
<Q - Blayne Curtis>: Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just going back, Kevin, on gross margin if
you can go through what drove the upside versus your guidance then you're obviously sustaining that going forward? Is
there anything that doesn't repeat in such that – it sounds like you can grow it off this base. I just wanted to make sure I
heard that right.
<A - Kevin P. March>: Yeah, Blayne, the guidance actually we're up a little bit from guidance, not a huge amount.
But really what we had was a little bit more revenue come through but importantly we also had a slightly better mix of
product that we shipped to our customer. So combined that gave us a slightly higher gross margin than previously
expected. And then on a go-forward basis, again, that mix continues to be in our favor as we go forward. And so
consequently as we look into fourth quarter our margins will continue to be quite strong. And importantly, because of
the rather unique situation that we have with 300-millimeter analog manufacturing capacity, we have significant
opportunity to continue to drive, not just improve margins, but importantly, improved cash flow.
Again, I'll remind you of some of the things that we're doing. We've got 300-millimeter Analog. I do want to make that
point if I haven't yet. We've got a lot more of our revenue coming from catalog parts, which inherently tend to have
more attractive margin characteristics. We have increasing portions of our revenue coming from industrial and
automotive spaces, and those three concepts are pretty important. Catalog parts, industrial, automotive, tend to have
very nice long revenue streams which means we have plenty of time to figure out and maximize our cost efficiency
from a production standpoint and maximize our revenue and cash flow off that.
We've got increasing customer diversity. So our dependence on any one customer and therefore the risk to our loadings
or our cash flow generation are diminished. And perhaps also very importantly, we have a sales force that we estimate
to be three to four times larger than our nearest competitors and those folks are becoming increasingly productive. And
so we're beginning to get a lot more revenue per salesperson, which means we can grow revenue without having to
grow OpEx as fast as revenue is growing. So those things combined not only will help our margins but also definitely
help our cash flow.
<A - David Pahl>: Okay. Blayne, do you have a follow-up question?
<Q - Blayne Curtis>: Yeah, thanks. Just from a big picture level, I think you already answered this but I wanted to
make sure I didn't miss anything. I mean we have seen some companies reference pockets of weakness. I mean I would
say your results are normal if not even better than normal. Are you seeing any areas that are weak and you're offsetting

that with share gains or strength elsewhere? I'm just curious your perspective or are you not seeing any weakness at all
anywhere?
<A - David Pahl>: Well, yeah, I'll let you draw the conclusions from the numbers. I think that obviously the results are
solid. I think that the outlook is consistent with the orders and our visibility into what customers are telling us they want
from a consignment standpoint. And, yeah, so from a share gain standpoint, I think that we've had multiple years now
where we have gained share. I think it's always hard to tell in any one particular quarter that you're picking up share but
I think when you look back over a year, you can see that trend. So we believe in our numbers there's share gains, but I'd
be careful on any one quarter to be able to point that out.
So thank you, Blayne. We'll go to the next caller please.

Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess the one segment nobody's asked about
thus far is Other. It did a bit better than I had expected. Dave, you broke down what was the year-over-year and
sequentials with the sub buckets in the other two segments. Can you do that for the Other segment as well and if it is
DLP, give us a little description on is there some seasonality in that that we need to appreciate going forward? Thanks.
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, sure. Thanks, Ross. So on a year-on-year basis again, Other was even. We saw a decline in
legacy wireless products and that was mostly offset by the growth in DLP products. On a sequential basis, well, let me
just finish year-on-year. If you look beyond that, calculators as well as the custom ASIC business were up and royalties
were down just slightly.
So sequentially, revenue was up due to growth in calculators and DLPs. Royalties were flat and custom ASIC was
down a little bit. So I'd say that all those businesses are performing well. And if you look at DLP, they're typically
stronger in the back half of the year, in third quarter. But I would say that that business is just executing well. When we
look at that business longer term, I'd describe that it's got several wild card growth opportunities. If you look at most of
the business today, it will be centered up in the front projectors that you'll typically see in offices and schools and
government buildings. But, and it also has a solid cinema business. But from a broader standpoint it's got some
opportunities inside of automotive as well as some Embedded opportunities there as well.
<A - Kevin P. March>: Mention the Pico as well.
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, the Pico Projectors as well. So thanks, Ross. Do you have a follow up?
<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: I do. Kevin, you were helpful in giving us some bounds around the OpEx in looking at prior
years and how things have dropped seasonally due to vacations, et cetera, in both the fourth and then the first quarter
doing the other direction. Can you give us a little bit of a harder number on what that typical percentage change is
quarter-to-quarter? Looking back in the past you guys have had a number of restructuring programs that make it a little
bit difficult to parse out what's seasonality and what is restructuring driven in both the fourth and the first quarter.
Thank you.
<A - Kevin P. March>: Yeah, Ross, that's – I actually pointed to the last fourth to first transition with the idea that
that's a good one for you to look at. Because in fact, the timing of the announcement for the Embedded Processing and
Japan restructuring, you may remember we announced that in January this past year, so we hadn't even begun activities
yet inside the first quarter. So the underlying cost in there is fairly clean from a comparative standpoint between fourth
and first. And so I'd use that as your figure of merit for trying to figure out where we're going in 2015.
<A - David Pahl>: Okay. Thanks, Ross. That was helpful clarification. And we'll go to the next caller please.

Our next caller is Doug Freedman with RBC Capital.
<Q - Doug Freedman>: Great. Thanks for taking my...
<A - David Pahl>: Hi, Doug.
<Q - Doug Freedman>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the real strong results here. If I could,
Kevin, maybe attack a really high level one. You guys have been in the past very acquisitive, so much so that you
really rebuilt your whole business model through acquisitions. Can you maybe talk about your appetite to maybe add
some debt onto your already leveraged balance sheet? And what it would take for you to look at another significant
deal?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Okay, Doug. It sounds like maybe there's two ideas in your question there, one on M&A and
one on debt. Clearly on the M&A front, as you point out, we have been quite willing to take on M&A activities when it
makes sense. And our definition of what makes sense is first it has to be a strategic fit. Meaning that it really has to
make sense for where we want to take the company. As we look at potential M&A in the future it's most likely to be
biased towards Analog and probably towards items with catalog parts or that service the industrial or automotive
spaces. There may be others but those are the most likely areas that we would look at.
If it turns out that it checks off from that strategic fit standpoint, then of course we have to take a look at the numbers
and make sure that the price that we would pay, what I mean by that is not necessarily what its market cap is, but the
markup we probably have to pay on top of that, that that total cost would be accretive to our WACC, our weighted
average cost of capital, in a two to four timeframe. So there's several tests that we go through when we make a
determination on an acquisition.
As it relates to debt, as you know we have taken on debt to support acquisitions in the past. We think having the
balance sheet available to support those kind of strategic initiatives are important, and a worthwhile thing for us to
maintain for maximum flexibility as we move forward. And so as we look out in time, even if you look at the last
couple of years, while we have been issuing new debt we've also been retiring older debt, and retiring a little bit faster
than we've been issuing so that we're taking our total debt levels down. And that's having the result of generally slowly
opening the balance sheet back up to make itself available for any other opportunity that might present itself at some
point in the future.
So that's how we're looking at M&A and that's how debt rolls inside that look.
<Q - Doug Freedman>: Great. Thanks for all that color.
<A - David Pahl>: Do you have a follow up?
<Q - Doug Freedman>: Yes. I guess if I could, can you guys – pretty much along the same ideas on the balance sheet
and how you look at cash return, I might have missed it. Did you happen to give out the share price at which you
bought back shares this quarter? And would you moderate going forward given the share price pullback that we just
saw, how we should think about share count going forward?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Let's see. We bought back $670 million worth of shares this quarter, a total of 14.1 million
shares, so that's an average price of about $47.62. I would point out that over the last – since the end of 2004, beginning
of 2005 we've reduced our total share count by 39%. That the average price of those shares that we bought over that
time I believe were about $30.62, give or take. When we look to buy-back shares, as we've talked about in the past,
when the intrinsic value, we believe, is higher than what the market value is, then it makes sense to buy back on a
steady, if you will, dollar cost averaging kind of basis. That's what we've done for many years and that's what you've
seen us do here recently. In fact, the recent pullback in price is just allowing us to buy back a few more shares with the
same number of dollars. So that's kind of an around the world look at share repurchase, if you will. I hope I answered
your question on that, Doug.

Following Doug, we have Will Stein with SunTrust.
<Q - William Stein>: Great. Thank you for squeezing me in. I'm hoping you can quantify a comment that you made
earlier about the portion of sales on 300-millimeter today, and that, that could increase over time. Kevin, could you talk
a little bit about where that number is now, and where you'd see it going over the next couple of years?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Will, I think we're going to try to just hold back, and say it is proportionately more than it has
been, each period that goes by, it's proportionately more. But I think that we'll hold a little while longer until we can
give more comprehensive look and a better understanding for everybody on how to think about that 300-millimeter
going forward. I just do think it's at the highest level, it's a fairly straightforward computation. 30% lower die cost,
which means about 15% lower total IC cost. And as we get proportionately more revenue going on there, that will
incrementally benefit our margins and our cash flows as we go forward in time. And that is something I've become
aware of in talking to investors in the last couple quarters, that is under-appreciated on what's going on inside the
portfolio itself.
<Q - William Stein>: That's helpful. I appreciate it. As my follow-up, another comment that was made earlier was
about, I think, the relative strength of Analog versus the Embedded segment this quarter. And I think there was a
comment about end markets, the end market mix helping. I'm wondering if you can clarify that. Maybe help us
understand a little bit better. I know Analog is very diversified relative to Embedded. Maybe talk about if there were
maybe some end markets that were a bit more challenging that affected the Embedded segment a bit more?
<A - David Pahl>: Yes. I think if you look at Embedded, it will have a high exposure to really three different markets.
It's communications equipment, industrial, and automotive. And like you said, our Analog business has a much broader
exposure including exposure to personal electronics. It has obviously a good exposure to industrial and automotive as
well. But it's really those types of differences that will explain that performance.
If you look at Embedded Processing, and you look back at the growth rates between the two businesses, you'll note that
oftentimes they will grow at different rates but if you look over an eight quarter period, that Embedded Processing has
been growing year-over-year, the growth rate for both of those businesses are essentially exactly the same. So it kind of
works out that way over a longer period of time.
So thank you, Will, and we'll go to the next caller, please.

The next question comes from Tore Svanberg.
<Q - Tore E. Svanberg>: Yes. Good afternoon, Dave and Kevin. My first question is on sort of the general
environment. You know, Q4 is obviously a seasonally down quarter anyway. It's hard to get a read on what's going on.
As we sort of – as you talk to your customers and we compare – now let's say versus 12 months ago, would you
classify the forecast and the environment as better, weaker or about the same?
<A - Kevin P. March>: Tore, I guess I'd probably say that it's about the same. I wouldn't classify it as better or weaker.
I say it's about the same in that, again, we have had the same lead times for several years and customers are ordering
consistent with that, generally speaking. You get some that need to expedite from time to time because they've
under-ordered or had surprise demand on their end but that was true a year ago and it's probably true today. And we
continue to see customers manage their inventories of our products, I'd say very lean. As was mentioned earlier, in the
distribution channel, we're at all-time lows of four and a half weeks of inventory. That's the same last quarter and this
quarter. That's very low.

From a customer standpoint we see them, again, ordering lead time and consistent ordering patterns so that tells us
they're keeping their inventories very low. So I think overall I'd probably characterize it as relatively the same kind of
customer demeanor today as what we saw a year ago.
<Q - Tore E. Svanberg>: Yes, thanks, Kevin. That's very helpful. My follow-up question, Dave, if I have one...?
<A - David Pahl>: Sure. Sure. Please.
<Q - Tore E. Svanberg>: Yeah, so your Analog growth 10% year-over-year, is that sort of the goal internally to
continue to grow the Analog business 10% every year? Or was there anything unusual here in the last 12 months that
kept that growth rate so high?
<A - David Pahl>: Well, I would say that internally we have very aggressive goals to grow the businesses. And I'd just
describe it as we want to outgrow the market significantly in Analog. So we've got all of the business units that are
focused up on that.
We do look at the performance of the product lines at every quarter and we really look at a three-year compounded
annual growth rate and stack that up against all the other businesses both inside of TI as well as competitors externally.
And that's how we measure it. So again, as I said earlier, that 10% we believe would represent some share gains but be
real cautious to look at any one quarter and draw the conclusion or try to dice out what percentage of that growth would
be from share gains.
So okay, thank you, Tore, and we'll – operator, I think we've got time for one more caller.
Operator
Yes, sir. And we have C.J. Muse with ISI Group.
<Q - C.J. Muse>: Yeah, hi. Thank you for taking my questions, fitting me in. I guess first question is a point of
clarification. On the OpEx outlook for Q4 down $15 million, is that all restructuring and then there's gravy on top of
that in terms of seasonal savings or does that $15 million include the seasonal savings?
<A - Kevin P. March>: C.J., the thing to do is take a look at a year ago. Third quarter to fourth quarter there was a
seasonal decrease. On top of that will be another $15 million as the last of the EP restructuring is completed.
<Q - C.J. Muse>: Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess second question, was hoping you could talk about inventories
downstream. Clearly relatively healthy on your books, but would love to hear what your thoughts are in terms of, in
particular, at the disti level.
<A - David Pahl>: Yeah, our inventories really from a days standpoint, have remained unchanged at what I would just
describe historically low levels at just a little over four, four and a half weeks. Again, that number is low because of the
consignment programs that we've put in place.
Beyond our distributors and then to our customers, we do have a good percentage of our revenues on consignment
overall and, in fact, if you combine what we ship through distribution as well as what we ship to OEMs on
consignment, that represents about 50% or about half of our revenues where we actually, there is no inventory sitting in
front of us in that manufacturing line for those inventories. So we know that inventory number and it is at zero. So we
have very good visibility into that portion.
And we do have a balance of the business that's kind of the classic, I'll describe it as a book-ship type business, where
they give us an order, it goes onto a backlog, and we ship it at lead time. So, and there we haven't seen any reports of
large inventory pockets from customers. We're going through and racking up this quarter's results and we'll see what
happens on that front. But we're not aware of any big pockets that are downstream.
