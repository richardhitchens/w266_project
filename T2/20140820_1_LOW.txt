Robert A. Niblock
Good morning and thanks for your interest in Lowe's. We delivered solid results for the second quarter. Comparable
sales were 4.4%, with an increase in comp transactions of 3.1% and an increase in comp average ticket of 1.3%. As
expected, we recovered most of the outdoor product sales missed in the first quarter due to unfavorable weather
conditions, but discretionary interior projects did not perform as well as expected. Outdoor product sales were strong

with a roughly 6.5% comp for the quarter while indoor comps were roughly 3%.
All 14 regions had positive comps for the quarter. Likewise, all 12 product categories had positive comps. We saw
particular strength in lawn and garden during the quarter, and the outdoor living experience we discussed on our first
quarter earnings call drove success in patio furniture and accessories. While seasonal categories were strong, we also
saw strength in millwork, paint, and tools and hardware, which were all above the company average. And we saw solid
performance in line with the company average in fashion fixtures, flooring, and lumber and building materials.
We continue to see strength in our ProServices business, which outperformed the company average during the quarter.
And I'm pleased to share that our team in Canada delivered double-digit comps in local currency for the fifth
consecutive quarter.
We remain focused on improving our profitability even while investing in key capabilities to drive sales growth. For
the quarter, gross margin expanded 20 basis points, and we effectively controlled expenses, delivering 67 basis points
of operating margin expansion, and earnings per share of $1.04, an 18.2% increase over last year's second quarter.
Delivering on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, in the quarter, we repurchased $1.1 billion of
stock and paid $183 million in dividends.
As we look at the backdrop for the second half of 2014, economic forecasts suggest continued strength in the home
improvement market as employment, income, and consumer spending levels continue to improve. At the same time,
signals from the housing market appear mixed, as home values have increased moderately while existing home sales in
total have declined this year. However, when distressed sales are omitted from the data, which we believe is a more
appropriate indicator of the long-term health of our industry, existing home sales have seen a slight increase through
the first half of the year, revealing a more positive and sustainable trend.
In light of the positive trajectory of these factors, we believe home improvement spending will continue to progress in
tandem with strengthening job and income growth. This also aligns with recent consumer confidence readings in our
second quarter Consumer Sentiment Survey, which revealed that homeowners' views around personal finances and
home values continues to improve. Consumers are indicating stronger intentions to complete a home improvement
project, with most of them planning a specific project in the next three months. And while most of these planned
projects are still small-ticket, we are seeing a rise in homeowners planning big-ticket projects.
Plans we have in place to support our continued top line growth. Our enhanced sales and operations planning process
will help us capture seasonal opportunities in the second half of the year. We also remain focused on improving our
product and service offerings for the pro in order to drive sales to this important customer. And we will continue to
build Customer Experience Design capabilities that differentiate Lowe's from other home improvement retailers.
Continued improvement in macroeconomic landscape together with our strengthening execution, strategic priorities,
and keen focus on productivity and flow-through give us confidence in our business outlook for 2014.
Before I close, I would like to thank our employees for their hard work in achieving this quarter's solid results and for
their continued dedication to serving customers while we further transform our business.
Thanks again for your interest, and with that, let me turn the call over to Rick.
Rick D. Damron
Thanks, Robert, and good morning, everyone.
As Robert shared with you, we generated positive comps across all regions and product categories as we continue to
capitalize on an improving macro backdrop through our enhanced sales and operations planning process, improved
relevance with the pro, and develop Customer Experience Design capabilities.
Our lawn and garden category experienced the strongest growth among our seasonal categories, even over strong
growth in the second quarter of last year. Customers shopped our compelling offering of live goods as they took

advantage of improved weather to spruce up their yards.
Likewise, we drove growth in outdoor power equipment, over double-digit growth in the second quarter of last year,
with great national brands like Husqvarna, John Deere, and Troy-Bilt, supplemented with the launch of our Kobalt line
of battery-powered handheld outdoor power equipment.
Within our seasonal living category, patio and outdoor fashion products topped their solid first quarter results,
generating double-digit positive comps and better than anticipated sell-through. This strong performance offset softness
in the window air conditioners in the North, which has experienced a cooler than normal summer.
The strength in patio and outdoor fashion is a testament to the outdoor living experience we rolled out in over
two-thirds of our stores in advance of the spring selling season. We removed 15 bays of steel racking to create a
showroom feel with about 35% more open space, which was made possible by our larger store format. To help
customers envision and create their outdoor space, the experience in product private purchasing, we displayed patio sets
with coordinating rugs, umbrellas, and accessories like pillows, lanterns, and planters, along with grills and other
outdoor products, just as you would expect in your own backyard. The outdoor living experience is one example of
how dedicated Customer Experience Design team is working with customers to better understand their purchase
drivers, and based on these insights is designing an entire experience just from inspiration to purchase and enjoyment.
Other categories showing particular strength in the quarter included millwork, paint and tools, and hardware. In
addition, fashion fixtures, flooring, and lumber building materials had solid performance, in line with the company
average. Fashion fixtures, flooring, lumber and building materials, and millwork benefited from customers' increasing
interest in refreshing both the interior and exterior of their homes. And our in-home project specialists are simplifying
the process by guiding customers through inspiration, design, and installation.
While we already have project specialists that focus on the exterior of the home available across all U.S. stores, we
continued to expand our interior project specialist program. Customers have responded very positively to these
programs, and we are pleased with their performance.
The paint category, particularly deck stains and exterior paints, including newly launched Valspar Reserve, performed
well as customers took advantage of better weather to refresh the outside of their homes. We introduced Valspar
Reserve exterior and interior paints at the end of the first quarter to appeal to both DIY and pro customers, and our
sales to both customers have exceeded our expectations.
Within tools and hardware, our enhanced sales and operations planning process helped us drive strong power tools
performance with great holiday values, and we're improving our attachment of fastening and repair products to sales of
lumber and building materials.
As Robert mentioned, our Pro business continued to perform well. In fact, ProServices comps outpaced the company
average for the 12th consecutive quarter. Increasing customer willingness to complete refresh projects coupled with our
strong product offering led to notable Pro sales strength.
We will continue to invest in our core product and service offering for pros, a segment that is growing faster than the
rest of the home improvement market. We are working to ensure we have the right products and brands pros demand
and the inventory depth required to help pros complete their jobs.
We also strive to provide pros with great service that makes doing business with us as quick and as convenient as
possible. So we continue to reach out to them through multiple channels, whether in-store, where we have dedicated
specialists to answer questions and dedicated loaders to help them get back to the job quickly; or at the pro's place of
business, where our account executives help regional maintenance, repair, and operations customers order and
replenish products across multiple stores; or through our national account representatives, who assist customers doing
business with Lowe's across the country; or online where we are also committed to providing great service to pros.
During the quarter we began the relaunch of LowesForPros.com, a dedicated platform for pros to purchase online from
Lowe's. This site will provide pros useful functionality such as tools to develop requisition lists, and views of their
purchase history as well as customized product catalogs. And the site can be integrated with purchasing systems pros

use to manage their business to further streamline their day-to-day operations. This site is currently being tested with a
select group of pro customers, and we received positive feedback on the site's flexibility and ease of use. We will
expand our test group and continue refining the site with the goal of a broad-based release by year-end.
In addition to our efforts to drive top-line growth, we are focused on driving productivity and profitability, and we
made good progress in the second quarter as we leveraged payroll and inventory.
Just over a year ago, we added an average of 150 stores per week to the staffing model for nearly two-thirds of our
stores in order to improve closed rate by increasing the proportion of selling hours during high-traffic weekday times.
This year, we are optimizing this investment by better aligning hours with customer traffic. This allowed us to meet
second quarter customer demand with only a slight increase in payroll hours relative to the second quarter of last year,
resulting in roughly 10 basis points of payroll expense leverage.
Similarly, last year, as part of our value improvement initiative, we reinvested our inventory to provide greater depth of
high velocity items and job-lot quantities. This year, we have held inventory per store roughly constant in the second
quarter even while increasing comp sales. We are pleased with the progress we're making this year on productivity and
operating profitability, and we will continue to look for ways to make further progress.
As we have shared with you previously, our enhanced sales and operations planning process has enabled us to improve
seasonal planning, including the cadence of inventory allocation, staffing, associate training and marketing. This year,
the process helped us stay connected on the inventory and staffing needed to recover sales, while ensuring we address
key summer holidays, including Memorial Day and July 4, and home improvement occasions, such as maintaining
lawns and gardens and refreshing patios.
Entering the second half of the year, we will use the same process to ensure we are prepared to address a new set of
customer needs for the fall, such as planting, home winterization and exterior maintenance. Then, as winter arrives,
we'll help customers refresh their homes for holiday guests, decorate and organize their home after the holidays.
Over the next few months, as appropriate by climate zone, you'll see us repurpose this space used for outdoor living
experience to focus on products used for fall cleanup outdoor power equipment, such as leaf blowers to clear yards,
seeding, fertilizer, and ultimately holiday decor. Our focus will be on using this space to provide the inspiration,
guidance, products, and service that customers need to tackle the projects that are relevant for each micro-season.
Thank you for your interest in Lowe's and I will now turn the call over to Bob.
Robert F. Hull
Thanks, Rick, and good morning, everyone.
Sales for the second quarter were $16.6 billion, an increase of 5.7%, driven by comp sales and Orchard Supply
Hardware. Total customer transactions increased 5.6% and total average ticket increased 0.1% to $65.65.
As previously discussed, the Orchard stores have more transactions per foot, but fewer per store, and a lower average
ticket than a traditional Lowe's store. So while Orchard aided total sales by approximately 100 basis points and added
roughly 220 basis points to our total transaction growth, it negatively impacted total average ticket growth by
approximately 115 basis points. The Orchard stores are considered non-comp, but will be included in our comp sales
calculation after the anniversary of the acquisition in Q3 2014.
Comp sales were 4.4% for the quarter. Looking at monthly trends, comps were 4.7% in May, 4.6% in June, and 3.7%
in July. As a reminder, in last year's second quarter, July had the highest comp at 11.3%.
For the quarter, comp transactions increased 3.1%, and the comp average ticket increased 1.3%. As you've heard
discussed, we recovered most of the outdoor product sales missed in the first quarter due to unfavorable weather
conditions, as evidenced by our roughly 6.5% comp in exterior products categories. However, interior categories at
approximately 3% comp performed lower than the company average.

Year-to-date sales of $30 billion were up 4.2% versus the first half of 2013, driven by a 2.8% increase in comp sales,
the addition of Orchard and new stores. Gross margin for the second quarter was 34.55% of sales, which increased 20
basis points over Q2 last year, and is up 62 basis points on a two-year basis. The increase was driven primarily by value
improvement. Year-to-date gross margin of 34.98% of sales, an increase of 42 basis points over the first half of 2013.
SG&A for Q2 was 21.33% of sales, which leveraged 40 basis points. Bonus expense leveraged 28 basis points due to
lower expected attainment levels relative to last year. Also in the quarter, we experienced leverage in store payroll and
advertising, largely as a result of the sales increase. These items were somewhat offset by employee insurance, which
deleveraged 17 basis points, primarily a result of the Affordable Care Act, which drove a 10% increase in enrollment.
Year-to-date SG&A was 22.87% of sales, which leveraged 17 basis points from the first half of 2013. Depreciation for
the quarter was $375 million, which is 2.26% of sales, leveraged 7 basis points when compared to last year's second
quarter as a result of the sales growth.
In Q2, earnings before interest and taxes, or EBIT, increased 67 basis points to 10.96% of sales. For the first half of
2014, EBIT was 9.62% of sales, which was 60 basis points higher than the same period last year.
For the quarter, interest expense was $126 million and deleveraged 6 basis points to last year as a percentage of sales.
The effective tax rate for the quarter was 38.6%, which was higher than last year's 37.5%. The higher rate, which was
consistent with our expectations, was the result of tax programs that expired at the end of last year.
Net earnings were just over $1 billion for the quarter, an increase of 10.4% over Q2 2013. Earnings per share of $1.04
for the second quarter were up 18.2% to last year. For the first six months of 2014, earnings per share of $1.64
represented a 20.6% increase over the first half of 2013.
Now to a few items on the balance sheet starting with assets; our cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of the
quarter was just over $1 billion. Our inventory balance of $9.3 billion increased $209 million, or 2% versus Q2 last
year. The majority of the increase was driven by the addition of the Orchard stores. Inventory turnover was 3.74, up
slightly over last year. Asset turnover increased 10 basis points to 1.63.
Moving on to the liabilities section of the balance sheet, accounts payable of $6.2 billion represented a 9% increase
over Q2 last year, caused by the timing of purchases year-over-year. At the end of the second quarter, least adjusted
debt to EBITDAR was 2.07 times. Return on invested capital increased 199 basis points for the quarter to 12.61%.
Now looking at the statement of cash flows, cash flow from operations was $3.9 billion, an increase of $567 million
over last year, largely due to working capital as well as growth in net earnings. Capital expenditures were $384 million,
a 2% increase over last year. Year-to-date free cash flow of $3.5 billion was 19% higher than the first half of 2013. In
May, we entered a $750 million accelerated share repurchase agreement. At this point, we expect to receive
approximately 15.9 million shares, but the ultimate number of shares will be determined upon the completion of the
program in the third quarter.
We also repurchased approximately 8.1 million shares for $380 billion through the open market. In total, we
repurchased a little more than $1.1 billion in the quarter. We have approximately $4.3 billion remaining under share
repurchase authorization.
Looking ahead, let me share our business outlook. We expect a total sales increase of approximately 4.5%, driven by a
comp sales increase of 3.5% and the opening of 10 home improvement stores and five Orchard locations. Our sales
outlook is modestly lower as a result of our year-to-date performance. However, our improved flow-through
assumptions allow us to maintain our prior EBIT expectations. We're anticipating an EBIT increase of approximately
65 basis points, and expect that the improvement will come from both gross margin and expense leverage.
The effective tax rate is expected to be 37.2% for the year. We expect earnings per share of approximately $2.63 for the
year, which represents an increase of 22.9% over 2013. We are forecasting cash flow from operations to be
approximately $4.1 billion. Our capital plan for 2014 is approximately $1.2 billion. This results in an estimated free
cash flow of $2.9 billion for the year.

We expect to issue incremental debt during the year as we manage to the 2.25 times least adjusted debt to EBITDAR
target. Our guidance assumes approximately $3.4 billion in share repurchases for 2014.
Kim, we are now ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research Company.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Good morning.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Good morning, Eric.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: I'm curious on your thoughts on market share performance. Obviously, a lot of things going on
in merchandising and leadership changes within that. I'm curious on how you're seeing the progress there and how you
expect that to play out as we move forward.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: I'll start and talk about it, Eric. And then we've got Mike Jones in the room and he can jump
in as well. Certainly, there have been a lot of changes in the organization, but I really feel really good about the
transition. Greg retired earlier in the year, a long-tenured employee, done a phenomenal job for the organization. Mike
has jumped right in without missing a beat. I think that Mike and Mike McDermott, who's now our Chief Merchant,
both working hard to try and dissect on a category-by-category basis where we have opportunity, where we see,
particularly with where our stores are located, with the way we go to market, our ability to try and develop better
customer experiences. And also, as we've mentioned several times, strength that we're trying to grab an opportunity
with the pro customer, opportunity to get the brands we need, obviously, depth of inventory, the things we've talked
about that we've improved in the past.
So we see a significant amount of opportunity. As we said, pro continues to lead the overall comp. We see that
continuing in the back half of the year, as we continue to work with our sales and ops planning process and dive into
some of the categories we're dissecting on a category-by-category basis, where some of that opportunity is and we've
got plans in place to go after it. We won't fix it all within the next quarter or two. But over the balance of the next few
quarters, I think we've got a lot of things that will help drive sales. Mike, do you want to?
<A - Michael A. Jones>: Good morning, Eric. I'd add to that. At a high level, we feel real good about continuing to
drive the top line and drive growth for the company. We feel real good about the engagement of our merchandising
team. We love the merchandising tools that have been deployed. We feel very good about our vendor partnerships.
When we look at market share, it is category by category, as Robert mentioned. We do see some choppiness in the way
the industry continues to give forecasts, so we watch it very closely. And again, we look category by category to ensure
that we feel comfortable that our plans are delivering growth.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: I guess to follow up, when you think about the changes that you're making, and I appreciate,
Robert, that it's not the next quarter or two. But when do you think you do have your best and brightest merchandising
strategies in place implemented? When can we start to look for that to really be in place and gaining traction with the
customer?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Actually, we've done a lot of foundational work over the past couple years with the depth of
inventory, the job lot quantities, those type of things for the pros. We threw that whole massive value improvement
process, which was the original line of resets where we cleaned up inventory. We've got some key things we're working
on from a website standpoint to improve the functionality of our website that will be delivered in the next 12 months.
And then, things like our outdoor living experience that we rolled out this year, that's where you start to really see the
organization come together to deliver something different and better in store than the way we went to market

previously. And they're continuing to go through and figure out, based on working with Mike and his team, where are
the opportunities where we can put our resources to place that will resonate in the greatest way with the customer.
Obviously, for competitive reasons, we're not going to talk about what's coming along those lines. But I think when you
look at what we're doing with the pro customer, what we're doing with the brand side, the fact that we're through the
line review process, I think over the next – and what we're doing from the website, I think what you're going to see over
the next 12 months, you'll see some pretty significant improvements in our execution above and beyond what we've
already been working on.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Great, thank you.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Thanks, Eric.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Alan Rifkin with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Alan M. Rifkin>: Thank you very much. So you've kept your earnings guidance the same despite taking down
revenues slightly both on a comp basis and total for the year. Bob, could you just provide a little bit more clarity as to
where, on both the gross margin and SG&A line, you're anticipating seeing the incremental leverage that you can
maintain the earnings guidance?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Sure, Alan. So as we think about the outlook for the year, we maintained it at 65 basis points.
But we do expect roughly the same level of gross margin improvement that we've previously expected. We'll get a little
bit better performance on expense leverage. As you've heard us talk about in prior years, we're really focused on
productivity and profitability on a number of fronts. And that's showing up in 40 basis points of SG&A leverage in Q2,
even with the 17 basis points of headwind due to the Affordable Care Act. As we think about the second half, we'll
drive further expense leverage going into the year, so we feel good about that. So really, the change is more on the
expense leverage side than the margin side for the second half of the year.
<Q - Alan M. Rifkin>: Okay, thank you, and one follow-up, if I may. Is there any discernible difference between the
performance of your stores by class of year with respect to the comp? Are more recently opened stores comping above
the corporate average, or where do we stand there? Thank you.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So, Alan, generally speaking, we don't see a material difference in comp performance based on
year of opening. What we do see is stores within markets performing roughly similar, so it's local market economics.
The local economy and the state of local housing are more impactful to a store's performance versus the year they
opened.
<Q - Alan M. Rifkin>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Thank you, Alan.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Aram Rubinson with Wolfe Research.
<Q - Aram H. Rubinson>: Thanks, a couple things. One, I'm hoping you can give us a little bit of clarity on the
Australia business, where you are strategically with that, and how that impacts the P&L because I'm pretty sure there
are some losses that are incurred there.
And then, the second question is on the distribution side. Most companies that we talk to have changes going on, on the
distribution side, whether it's for e-commerce or for something else. You guys have always had a very established and
very advanced distribution network, but I don't think we've heard a lot about it. So would you mind giving us an update

to see how that's going to stay a competitive advantage for you as your peers make progress there too? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Aram, it's Robert. I'll start on the Australia question and let Rick and Bob follow up on the
distribution. On the Australia question, we've got 49 Masters stores open as of the end of their fiscal year, which was
the end of June. As you know, that's 49 stores I think that have been open a little less than three years, so we're getting
a great foothold there.
We also, as you know, we also bought another business there called Danks that now trains in the home timber and
hardware group that was bought about the time we started the joint venture, and it really does distribute to a lot of the
independents in the area. There's about 400 or so independent stores they distribute to, but they also have 28
company-owned stores. So we've gotten a good foothold. I think the initial receptivity of the business has been good.
Obviously, as is the case, any time you open up a new concept in a market, there's the competitive response that
normally takes place.
And we've taken a business from Greenfield growing up, growing the business, making sure that you are being able to
staff and grow that business. So, what the joint venture decided to do is, they're slowing down slightly the new store
growth to allow a little bit more maturity, and being more targeted and strategic in where those new stores will go, so
that we'll have a little less cannibalization on the existing stores and more in the markets that are underserved. So
they're pulling back to about a 10 to 15 stores per year over the next few years.
Previously, it was closer to about 20 stores a year. So we're still excited about the opportunity there. There's a lot that
we bring to it with our global sourcing and high level brand capabilities. And as from a financial standpoint, the losses
from that, obviously, it's an equity investment, so it runs through the P&L as a separate line item. Operations aren't
consolidated because we only have 1/3 of the operations.
<Q - Aram H. Rubinson>: And the dollar amounts that are run through each quarter for that?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: I don't think we speak for...
<A - Robert F. Hull>: We haven't spoken directly to that, Aram. You can take what masters reports. Since we are a
minority participant, we'll let our majority partner speak for the business, but you can take what they report on the
home improvement business and infer what the impact to us is. It is a couple cents per share this year.
<Q - Aram H. Rubinson>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Rick D. Damron>: Aram, this is Rick. I'll give you an update on the distribution teams. First, let me say,
extremely proud of what both our supply chain and stores were able to accomplish in the movement of goods and
making sure that we had the products available for the customer during Q2. During our most volatile time of the year
from a seasonal standpoint, the teams did a phenomenal job in making sure that we had products for the customer.
Second, I would say, Aram, as you've mentioned, we have a world class distribution center that is – and was stood up
to supply our brick and mortar stores and we have been, over the last several years, continue to look for ways to
optimize that channel to really be able to deliver our omni-channel experiences.
So a couple of the changes that we have made over the past year, one being our ability to offer flexible fulfillment to
our customers and through our stores. Flexible fulfillment allows us the capability to ship from 54 of our stores, as well
as all of our distribution hubs and nodes, direct to consumer on parcel product that allows us to better leverage that
inventory and drive better flexibility there.
The teams continue to work on driving productivity, both in the distribution center itself, as well as in trends,
particularly in cube throughput. So as we look at Q2, the teams were able to really offset a lot of the incremental costs
in fuel, with greater productivity and greater cube movement through the distribution center.
We continue to look for ways to optimize what we stock and maintain in our network versus what we use to cross-stock
and what we flow through as a cross-stocking channel, and we feel comfortable that we've optimized that spend in the
way that those products are flowed through the alternate channels. And then, we continue to look for new ways to meet

the customers' demand in the future through supply chain strategy improvement. So we have a lot going on, but we feel

Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Brian Nagel with Oppenheimer and Company.
<Q - Brian W. Nagel>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Good morning, Brian.
<Q - Brian W. Nagel>: So I wanted to maybe dive a little deeper into the comment you made regarding the
discretionary interior projects, which have somewhat weighed upon your sales here in Q2. First, maybe describe more
specifically what that is. Is it a specific product category that caters to interior? Did you see any differences
geographically? And do you think it was more a function of just the overall environment competitively or something
Lowe's did?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Oh, yes. As we said, overall, we had a lot of interior categories that performed well during
the quarter, but we did see some weakness in a couple areas. One of them, as you know, we give comps for kitchen and
appliances area. When you dive down within appliances, we were going up against an incredibly strong comp last year.
We were high teens comps last year in the second quarter.
So when you look at our performance over two years, we were still average double-digit comp over that two-year
period. So that was obviously something that was a little bit of a challenge in the second quarter. It was a competitive
environment out there for major appliances and tough numbers we were going up against.
We also saw air conditioners, with the summers, Rick mentioned in his comments, not being as warm as what we had
expected. Air conditioner sales were a little weak in July. And then, a couple parts of flooring were a little weak in the
quarter. So those were some areas that we saw some weakness in from the consumer, all of which we're looking at and
trying to determine how do we get better performance in those and our share of the opportunity as we head into the
back half of the year.
<Q - Brian W. Nagel>: But on the flooring specifically, the three you mentioned, is there something – again, do you
think that's more of a competitive issue, or was it more a function of the environment?
<A - Rick D. Damron>: Hi. If I could jump in, just a couple things just to put a finer point on the appliances question,
we saw certainly high teens comps in major appliances, specifically second quarter of last year. And if you take a look
at our two-year performance on major appliance, we see double digits. So it's actually performing very well. That said,
we had profiled a little more strength in appliances, as well as A/C certainly, and I'd add flooring to that, as well.
To answer your question on flooring, we see very good performance in tile. We see very good performance in carpet.
We see a little pressure in wood and laminate, and we think part of it is industry. We think part of it is that the
competition has caught up with some of the first to market innovations that we launched last year. And our
merchandising team continues to look at new first to market innovations that we can launch going forward.
<Q - Brian W. Nagel>: Got it, thank you, and then maybe just one follow-up. On the guidance, you modestly lowered
the guidance for the year. Just to be clear, the way the press release reads and I think your comments in your prepared
remarks, there too that's really a function of sales in Q1 and Q2. Your internal sales plan for Q3 and Q4 remains the
same.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: That is correct, Brian.

Thank you, and our next question comes from Chris Horvers with JPMorgan.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: Thanks, good morning. I also wanted to follow up on the guidance. So in the first half of the
year, you comped just under 3%. And then in 2Q, you comped 4.4%, with the seasonal business up 6.5%, and bringing
that number up. So two related questions: What do you think the seasonal recapture was in 2Q? And as we try to think
about what the underlying comp trend is, to give us some light to that, and then, what gives you the confidence that you
can hit that 4% to 4.5% implied comp in the back half? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: I'll start. This is Robert. Then I'll have Bob jump in with any additional color. The pickup
from Q1 impact was probably about 150 basis points going into Q2. But as we did say, Q2 was our strongest comp
performance last year, particularly strong, as we just talked about, in major appliances, and the performance we had
with high teen comps for the quarter in major appliances last year.
We also talked about the weakness that hit the second quarter with regard to A/Cs and that was a little bit of a drag on
second quarter, particularly in July's performance. As we look to the back half of the year and we normalize all of that,
as we look at easier comparisons over the back half of the year, as we look at, as I said in my comments, a continued
acceleration that we see in growth over the back half of the year and employment income growing, home price
appreciation hanging in the FHFA forecast for home price appreciation is pretty much the same this year as it was last
year.
And as I mentioned, once you normalize for distressed sales, a continued slight improvement in the housing turnover
rate. In everything we're doing that we've been talking about so far on the call, we're trying to continue to strengthen
our execution. We look to the macro landscape. Pull that together, we think that our back half forecast is still
reasonable from a top line standpoint.
So to the point, yes, we adjusted for where we're at for the first half of the year, but we still feel confident on what we
think we can deliver on the back half of the year. So, Bob?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: The only thing I would add is, so as Rick mentioned in his comments, we've seen great progress
with pros for 12 consecutive quarters. But as you've heard us describe, there's still a lot of focus in that area. And we
expect continued traction and momentum in the second half of the year, which gives us confidence in our second half
outlook.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: Is there something, particularly on the pro, a certain initiative perhaps that you can point to,
or is it just the continued improvement across the store in terms of close rates and more focus gaining traction?
<A - Michael A. Jones>: Sure, this is Mike Jones, a couple things. First, if you look at our three business areas, our
building and maintenance business area was above the average, so that's very encouraging. We are continuing to see
better traction.
We are seeing improvements in brands, and we've returned some brands back to Lowe's, Henry Coatings being an
example, the expanded lineup of Lenox and Irwin. Certainly, our Bosch brand continues to do well. DEWALT does
very well, so that feels very encouraging. The team continues to work there very hard. Our depth of inventory continues
to improve, and we've made the necessary inventory tradeoff decisions so that, as we become more relevant with pros,
you don't see the pressure on the balance sheet. So we are making those tradeoffs so that we can better serve the pros
and still protect our operating performance.
And then the last piece I'd say is that our pro selling team is doing an excellent job, excellent job, of engaging our pros
and helping us build those relationships we need to continue to grow that business. Rick spoke about LowesForPros,

which is our portal designed specifically for pros to help us transact with them, help us make doing business with us
easy for them, and frankly help them drive productivity in their own businesses. So we're very encouraged by the work
that we see with pros, and we continue to build on it.
<A - Rick D. Damron>: Chris, this is Rick. I'd just like to reiterate a point that Mike made. I think what we're
continuing to see and feel comfortable with is the initiatives that we've put in place over the last 18 months regarding
both the organizational design to enable our stores, our field teams, as well as our national teams to really meet the
needs of the customer in the way that they need service.
And then you look at the value statements that we've made, whether it be through inventory or whether it be through
our Contractor Pack programs the merchants are driving, or proprietary value prop initiatives, continue to respond very
well with the pro. As a matter of fact, when you look at Q2, our pro applications grew 23% over last year, so we
continue to see the pros respond very well to the initiatives that we've got in place. As Mike said, we continue to work
on brands and inventory depth where needed to continue to maximize that opportunity. But we feel good with where
we are, and we feel very good with the way the pro is responding to the actions we've taken.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: And then just related to that, so can you talk about close rates in the store? I know you
added the value improvement resets are done and fully reset, and labor hours are now in there. So can you talk about
close rates as well? Thanks very much.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: So, Chris, we have done all the above to focus on our improved close rates. What we've seen
through the first half is roughly 100 basis point improvement in close rates. So we feel good about the progress we're
making, but we know there's still work ahead of us.
<A - Rick D. Damron>: And, Chris, I'll just add. This is Rick again. I think as a testament to what we've done there,
you look at the fact that we were able to leverage our payroll costs during the quarter, increasing our sales per hour by
4%. And even when you look at the first half in totality, even with the soft Q1, we were still able to increase our sales
per hour worked by 3.5%. So we feel the initiatives that we've put in place are working. As Bob said, we're seeing
roughly 100 basis points of close rate improvement, and we'll continue to refine how we schedule, how we staff our
stores, to make sure that we're meeting our traffic patterns and the needs of the customers as they enter.
<Q - Chris M. Horvers>: Thank you.
<A - Rick D. Damron>: Thanks, Chris.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Fassler with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks a lot and good morning to you. I'd like to try to connect the dots a bit between,
Robert, some comments you made about doing some work on the online piece and talking about your interior projects.
Where do you think you sit in terms of customers researching projects and leading in through online? Are you where
you want to be, or do you see that as an opportunity for the business?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Certainly, like I said, from the interior projects we talked about, part of that being the tough
comp compare we had for major appliances, specifically if how I remember of interior areas that are doing well. I think
from an overall online standpoint, we continue to make progress with the website. There are things like the way we're
scheduling and those type of things that we need to get worked on so it makes it a better, easier experience for the
customer.
But we are seeing great transaction growth online on the website. We're still seeing the overall majority, obviously, of
what is transacted online translating to either pick up in store or the store deliveries of these. So the kind of
omni-channel aspect of it is working together really well, and certainly with the customers online. In many cases, they
maybe buy it online, pick it up in store, or they maybe they want to ensure that that product is available when they get
to the store. And then in many cases they're also shopping the store and getting add-on sales on top of that.

So I think there's still – we know that there's still a significant amount of influence sales coming from what's happening
online. But the world's changing at a fast pace. Technology is changing and we know that we've got to continue to
improve our online experience, and that's what Mike and his team are working on.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Got it. And then secondly, I'm not sure if you touched on this in your comments. You
spoke a lot in thinking about your sales outlook about the macro factors and the way they're evolving through the
second half of the year. I guess you exited the quarter, looking at July, in kind of a subdued one year comp but on a
two-year basis pretty consistent with where you were through the quarter, which was pretty good relative to trend.
How's your quarter-to-date experience impacting your sales thinking, and is it consistent with the numbers that you
have out there?
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Yeah, we feel good about our start to August, and particularly in light of the fact that when
we looked at, once again, it's from a two-year compare standpoint. August last year is our toughest comp comparison
we're going up against, so we feel good about the way we started the quarter, in light of what our guidance is for the
back half of the year now.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thank you so much, guys.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: One other point I'd make. As we think about the impact of air conditioners, it had about a 30
basis point negative impact for the quarter, had about a 60 basis points negative impact for July. So that's a headwind in
July that won't carry towards the back half of the year.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Understood. Thank you so much.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you and our next question comes from Peter Benedict with Robert Baird.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Oh, hey, guys, thanks, just a quick question. Bob, you spoke about all the progress you're
making on the expense front. How about gross margin? Just an update here on the long-term view. Do you still think
that kind of tops out around 35%? Or do you think you can maybe find ways to push it past that?
<A - Robert F. Hull>: We haven't set any arbitrary limit on what gross margin could be. I think we know we've got
some work to do as a result of the value improvement, and we're seeing that play out in both in terms of gross margin
improvement experienced in 2013 and 2014. As we've talked about, we created the process to bring more formality and
rigor to the process. We've always done line reviews, we're always going to do line reviews, so that's not to suggest that
wave 2 or wave 3 there's no benefit there. However, we also recognize that there's competitive pressures in the
marketplace, movement in sales by channel.
So we do expect to continue to make progress with value improvement. Our long-term outlook beyond value
improvement didn't suggest material increase beyond maybe 5 basis points to 10 basis points per year. So we haven't
set any arbitrary cap, and we know there's still work to be done with value improvement and with other areas.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay, thanks. That's helpful. Fair enough. And then, just a clarification, the interior project
specialists, I guess they're not available nationwide, now? I guess, when do you think you guys could have that
capability rolled out nationally?
<A - Rick D. Damron>: Okay, this is Rick. As of this year, we originally started this process and this program a
couple years ago. We had it test in really 3, 2 1/2 regions this past year, completed in Q1 of this year. We rolled it to
another 582 stores. We're looking at the rollout campaign into 2016. We see another 3 to 4 regions possibly being
rolled out then, and then the remainder in 2016.
<Q - Peter S. Benedict>: Okay, great. Thanks very much.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jaime Katz with Morningstar.
<Q - Jaime M. Katz>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is on some of the
medium-term goals that you have, which is EPS next year, and EBIT and RIC goals. Do you still feel confident that
you can achieve them this far into 2014? And then, if you are willing to comment on any of the rumors about Brazil
that came out last week, I'd be glad to hear what you say.
<A - Robert F. Hull>: Sure, Jaime, I'll take the long-term outlook. So we still stand by the 2015 outlook that we
provided at our Analyst Conference a couple years ago. As we've talked about, we're making good progress, this year
specifically, improvements in flow-through on the incremental point of comp to the bottom line.
Other efforts in place to further those efforts, as you heard the team talk, regarding product categories, continue to
understand opportunities to take share pro/DIY across the merchant categories. So we feel good about the outlook we
provided for 2015.
<A - Robert A. Niblock>: Jaime, this is Robert. With regard to the rumors on Brazil, obviously, we don't comment on
specific rumors of a nature like that. I would now just reiterate what we've said in the past. Our continued focus is on
improving our existing operations in the U.S. and other international markets where we're at today. And in that light,
we continue in both things to look at opportunities. But with regard to commenting on specific rumors, no, we won't
comment on that.
