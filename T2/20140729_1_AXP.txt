Richard Petrino
Thank you, and welcome, everybody. Thanks for joining us for today's call. Today's discussion contains certain
forward-looking statements about the company's future financial performance and business prospects, which are based
on management's current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause actual results
to differ materially from these forward-looking statements are set forth within today's earnings press release and
earnings supplement, which were filed in an 8k report, and in the company's other reports already on file with the SEC.
The discussion today also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. Information relating to comparable GAAP
financial measures may be found in the second quarter 2014 earnings release, earnings supplement, and presentation
slides, as well as the earnings materials for prior periods that may be discussed. All of which are posted on our website,
at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.
Today's discussion will begin with Jeff Campbell, Executive Vice President and CFO, who will review some key points
related to the quarter's earnings through the series of slides included with the earnings documents distributed. Once Jeff
completes his remarks, we will move to a Q&A session. With that, let me turn the discussion over to Jeff.

Jeffrey C. Campbell
Well, thanks, Rick and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to be on the call this afternoon to discuss another good
quarterly performance by American Express. As you know, we are holding this call a little later than usual this quarter,
due to the complexity of the business travel joint venture transaction which closed on the last day of the second quarter.
The gain resulting from the creation of the Joint Venture and the related incremental investments impacted our reported
results across a number of P&L lines this quarter. We'll walk you through these impacts in just a few minutes to
provide a better understanding of our underlying performance.
Overall, we are pleased with this quarter's performance, as the momentum seen at the end of the first quarter continued
into Q2. We believe that our underlying operating performance continues to demonstrate the strength and flexibility of
our business model, and you will recognize some familiar themes in the quarter, including higher spending by our Card
Members, modest growth in the loan portfolio, credit indicators at or near historical lows, disciplined control of
operating expenses, and a strong balance sheet that enabled us to return a substantial amount of capital to shareholders
in the form of share repurchases and dividends over the past year.
You will also see some significant and largely offsetting items related to our business travel joint venture. I'll come
back to each of the moving pieces in a moment, but our bottom line came to $1.43 earnings per share on a fully diluted
basis.
To begin now with the financial results for Q2, as you can see on slide two, Card Member spending drove billed
business growth up 9% on both a reported and FX adjusted basis year-over-year. These growth rates represent a modest
acceleration versus Q1 with the improvements seen predominantly in the US. While volume growth improved three
points overall versus last quarter, we saw a smaller increase in reported revenue growth, which increased to 5% during
the current quarter from 4% in Q1. I'll discuss the drivers of revenue growth in a few minutes.
Pre-tax income rose 16% during the quarter, while net income grew 9%. This net income growth rate was lower than
the 16% growth in pre-tax income due to the unusually low tax rate we benefited from during the second quarter of last
year. Over the last four quarters, we have repurchased $3.9 billion of common shares. That translated into a 4%
decrease in average shares outstanding versus the prior year. This then helped to drive diluted EPS to the $1.43 I
mentioned a moment ago, which was 13% higher than the prior year on a reported basis. These results also brought our
ROE for the period ending June 30 to 29%, above our on average and over time target of 25%.
So now to provide context for these overall results, let's review the gain from the creation of the business travel joint
venture, and the related incremental investments. As a reminder, American Express and an outside investor group each
have a 50% ownership interest in the new joint venture. Our partners invested $900 million of cash into the joint
venture, while we contributed the assets of our business travel operations. We will continue to have a close working
relationship with the joint venture. We believe that the additional resources provided by the new investor group will
support efforts to develop products, create capabilities, and attract new customers.
On slide three, you can see that the closing of the joint venture resulted in a pre-tax gain of $626 million, in line with
the estimates we provided you earlier this year. We incurred associated transaction-related costs of $79 million, and I
would note that we will also incur a modest amount of transaction related costs in the next several quarters. As we first
began to discuss at the beginning of this year, we used a substantial portion of the gain to fund incremental initiatives to
better position the company for the future.
First, the gain gave us the flexibility to absorb $133 million in restructuring costs, as we continue to focus on further
increasing the overall efficiency of our organization, in line with the evolving nature of our customer and business
needs. Second, we made an incremental contribution of $40 million to the AXP Foundation to support our future
philanthropic activities.
Last and most significantly, we stepped up our investments in support of many growth initiatives. While there's
obviously some subjectivity involved in determining just what was incremental, as you can see on the slide, it was a
significant amount. These investments were primarily in marketing and promotion, although there were smaller

amounts in a number of other P&L lines, including operating expenses. These investments primarily consisted of media
spending to support some of our newer products such as Amex EveryDay and Serve in the U.S., as well as incremental
customer acquisition activities around the world. I'll provide more detail when we review our quarterly expense
performance in a few minutes.
Overall, we estimate that the total impact of the business travel joint venture this quarter, after netting out all of these
items, was a small net benefit of approximately $0.05 to quarterly EPS.
Let's turn now to a more detailed look at several trends that will give you a better sense of the quarter starting with
billed business on slide four. Total company billings growth increased from 6% in Q1 to 9% in Q2 on a reported basis
and from 7% to 9% on an FX adjusted basis.
Moving to slide 5, which shows the billing trends by region, you can see that the accelerated growth was seen
predominantly in the US, for our consumer, small business and corporate volumes, all accelerated from the lower levels
we saw in the first quarter. As you might remember, we mentioned that U.S. billings growth improved during the
second half of Q1, and we saw that momentum continue during the second quarter. Overall, international billings
growth was relatively consistent with the prior quarter, declining slightly to 9% in Q2, versus 10% in Q1, on an FX
adjusted basis.
We did see a decline in growth rates in the GAA PA region, driven primarily by slower growth in China as we lap the
roll out of new partners and products by our GNS partners during the prior year. We also saw slower growth in
Australia, consistent with an overall slowdown in industry credit card volumes seen in the country during Q2.
Turning to billed business by segment, on slide six, you can see that the moderation in volume growth in China and
Australia also had an impact on GNS performance during quarter; however, GNS remained our fastest growth segment
in terms of billings up 13% year-over-year on an FX adjusted basis.
Moving on to Loans, the second key revenue driver. We see on slide seven that loan balances grew 5% globally. U.S.
loans were up 6% from a year ago, and continue to outpace the industry. Both of these growth rates improved by 200
basis points versus the prior quarter. It's probably worth noting that our loan growth continues to come primarily from
greater spending by our Card Members and is not due to any significant change in our underwriting strategy.
I'll also note that the new EveryDay product has performed well relative to our expectation since its launch a few
months ago, but it is, of course, far too early for the product to have any meaningful impact on our overall levels of
loan growth.
Putting it all together then, our billings and loan performance helped drive total revenue growth of 5% on both a
reported and FX-adjusted basis as you can see on slide eight. Consistent with prior periods, this growth was primarily
driven by greater discount revenue from higher build business volumes. During the quarter, discount revenue growth
did not accelerate as fast as billings growth, due primarily to a 4 basis point year-over-year decline in the reported
discount rate. Now on this point, I would remind you that in any given quarter, the year-over-year discount rate
variance can be influenced in part by the timing of certain items. This can lead to some volatility in the variance from
quarter to quarter. For example, as you will recall, our discount rate was flat year-over-year during Q1, before being
down 4 basis points this quarter. On a year-to-date basis, therefore, the discount rate is down 2 basis points, which is
roughly in line with our expectations. Moving on from discount revenue, the other primary driver of revenue growth
was a 9% increase in net interest income, as we continued to benefit year-over-year from both lower funding costs and
an increase in average loan balances.
Turning now to provision, you can see on slide nine that our credit metrics are near or at historical low levels.
Worldwide, lending write-off and delinquency rates decreased in the quarter with our delinquency rate reaching an
all-time low at 1%. As we've said previously, our goal is not to have the lowest possible write-off rate, but is instead to
achieve the best returns on our portfolio. Therefore, we would continue to expect that lending write-off rates will
increase somewhat from these low levels at some point.

Slide 10 shows the trend in our lending reserve coverage levels. Overall, our coverage levels remain relatively
consistent with the prior quarter, and we believe are appropriate given the risk level inherent in the portfolio.
Finally, as you can see on slide 11, provision was down 6% versus the prior year, reflecting lower lending write-offs in
the current period. Charge card provision increased by 14%, driven by a larger reserve release in the prior year. While
the charge card delinquency rate declined versus Q1 during both years, we saw a larger sequential decline last year.
Turning now to expenses on slide 12. Total reported expenses increased by 2%. In understanding this increase, it's
important to note that both marketing and promotion and operating expenses were significantly impacted by the
business travel joint venture gain and related incremental initiatives.
Turning to marketing and promotion first, the vast majority of the incremental costs incurred to support our growth
initiatives were within marketing and promotion, driving a 25% year-over-year increase in this line, though there were
some incremental costs that hit other lines.
Second, as you can see, operating expenses were down 8% on a reported basis, primarily as a result of the gain from
the business travel joint venture, which was recognized as an expense reduction. On the operating expense line, this
gain was partially offset by transaction-related costs, the restructuring charge, and the incremental contribution to the
AXP Foundation.
Turning to rewards expense, we saw an 11% increase, relatively in line with reported billings growth.
Finally, the tax rate in the quarter was 33.9%, which was significantly higher than the unusually low 29.6% tax rate that
we experienced during the second quarter of 2013. This quarter's 33.9% was in line with our prior expectations though
that our tax rate could be closer to the mid-30%s.
To provide more context now, on marketing and promotion expenses, which include the majority of the investments to
grow our business, slide 13 shows that these expenses were at $985 million this quarter. We continue to believe that we
have a number of attractive investment opportunities across both our core businesses and from newer initiatives. The
gain from the business travel joint venture transaction this quarter provided the opportunity to increase our investments
in some of our growth initiatives and better position the company for the future. The incremental investments included
some media spending you may have seen in the U.S., to support the launch of the Amex EveryDay card and the
relaunch of Serve. It also included some less visible investments, including incremental card acquisition activities
across the U.S. and international markets.
During Q2, we also made progress on other important strategic initiatives, including our OptBlue program, small
merchant coverage. During the current quarter, we announced that four new merchant acquirers were added up to
OptBlue, including First Data, and we continue to add new partners to the program.
We also continued to be at the forefront of connecting consumers and merchants in new and innovative ways through
digital capabilities. Our recent partnership with Uber, which creates an elegant, seamless experience for U.S. Card
Members to earn or redeem membership rewards points within the Uber mobile app is the latest example of how we are
leveraging unique technology to create value for merchants and consumers.
While it's still early days for many of the digital initiatives, we are excited about the new capabilities we are developing
in this space.
Moving to operating expenses now on slide 14, let me provide a bit more detail about the impact of the business travel
joint venture. On a reported basis, total operating expenses decreased by 8% versus the prior year during the quarter.
They were heavily impacted by the business travel joint venture transaction and related items, including the gain, which
was recorded in other, net expense, the restructuring charge, and the incremental charitable contribution.
After taking into account these impacts, adjusted operating expenses increased by 4% versus the prior year. The higher
adjusted growth rate compared to earlier this year is due to a number of smaller items. I'd also remind you that we are
now growing over the second quarter of last year, which did experience the lowest levels of operating expenses of any
quarter during 2013.

Let's turn now to the efficiency initiatives, which drove the $133 million restructuring charge this quarter. The actions
we are taking here are primarily related to positions that do not directly impact revenue, including some actions that
will be taking place over the next year. These initiatives are designed to improve our efficiency, better align us with
changing customer preferences and behaviors, and contain operating expenses moving forward.
More broadly, I would also remind you that going forward, business travel revenues and costs will no longer be
embedded in our financial results. We will report only our share of the joint venture's earnings, as we will account for it
using the equity method. To help you with modeling this, business travel costs constituted approximately 11% of our
total operating expenses during full year 2013. On the revenue side, business travel revenues constituted approximately
80% of our total travel commissions and fees during full year 2013.
To conclude now with operating expenses on slide 15, on a year-to-date basis, operating expenses remain well
controlled. After taking into account the specific items this quarter, adjusted operating expenses were flat versus the
prior year. We remain committed to our annual target to have operating expenses grow by less than 3% during 2014.
We will adjust our target for the balance of the year to account for the business travel operating expenses that will no
longer be reflected in our P&L.
Now, let's turn to capital. The substantial amount of new capital we generate provides us with significant degrees of
flexibility, as shown on slide 16. This quarter, we were able to return 87% of capital to shareholders, while also
maintaining our strong capital ratios. As you can see on slide 17, we have also improved the diversity of our funding
sources by building a significantly larger deposit base over the last several years. Our funding mix during Q2 was
consistent with the prior year, and we believe that the mix should be relatively stable going forward.
Let me now turn to one more topic before I conclude and take your questions. As you are aware, our trial with the DOJ
began earlier this month. The government is currently presenting their case. We will then present our defense and call
witnesses on behalf of American Express. The trial is expected to end later this quarter and will be followed by the
issuance of a decision, which could take several months or longer to complete. There will then likely be a lengthy
appeals process.
As much as we might like to, I don't think it's appropriate or beneficial for us to offer color commentary on any of the
specific testimony. We will make our arguments where it matters, in the courtroom. We believe that our legal defense
is strong, but ultimately, it will be up to the courts to decide. To remind everyone of the context, we decided to fight for
three key reasons: First, it is unfair to allow merchants who have agreed to honor our cards to then discriminate against
American Express and our Card Members. Second, it is fundamentally unfair to interfere with the consumers' right to
choose how they want to pay at the checkout counter. And third, the result the Justice Department seeks would provide
no benefit to consumers. Instead it would weaken competition.
So to summarize now on the quarter. While there was some complexity on our reported results this quarter, from the
gain related to the business travel joint venture transaction and our incremental initiatives, we feel good about our
underlying performance during the quarter. Reported EPS was up 13% versus the prior year, driven by accelerated
billings and loan growth, write-off rates that remained at historical lows, disciplined control of our operating expenses,
and our strong capital position. Looking forward, we continue to believe that the flexibility of our business model
enables us to deliver significant value to our shareholders.
With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator for your questions. I would ask that you limit yourself to one question,
with one follow-up so that we can ensure we give as many people as possible the chance to participate. Operator?

<Q - Donald Fandetti>: Hi, good evening. Jeff, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your thoughts on
loan growth. Obviously a little bit of an uptick this quarter. We're seeing a similar trend with some of the other issuers.
Can you put that into some context? Are you seeing little bit better demand or is this something that's more one
time-ish?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, that's a good and important question. Certainly, we have been pleased over the last
number of quarters to see loan growth in the 3% to 4% range at a time when the industry numbers were flattish to in
some quarters down a little bit. And when you look at that growth over the last year or so, it really has been driven by
spending of our Card Members, and as we look at the sequential acceleration from 4% last quarter to 6% this quarter,
we still see it pretty much just driven by spend levels of our Card Members that certainly one could speculate goes
along with just continued levels or growth in levels of confidence about the economy. So there's certainly nothing
unusual in terms of timing or accounting or any of those items. I mean, we think that the sequential pickup in growth
rates is very solid and assuming the economic environment stays the same, we would hope that it continues at that
trend.
I think the other thing I really do want to emphasize that I mentioned in the earlier remarks, is it is just increased spend
that has driven the loan growth. We are very focused and very comfortable with our current risk profile, and so you
haven't seen us make any significant changes in the various decisions we're making around risk.
<Q - Donald Fandetti>: Okay.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. And the next question is from the line of Eric Wasserstrom of SunTrust Robinson. Please go ahead.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks. I just wanted to follow up on some of the spending trends, understanding
everything that you've gone through in great detail about how the sale of the – or the formation of the JV influencing
the spending trends in the period. How should we contemplate some of these line items going forward, particularly, of
course, the marketing and promotion line, and as well as the salaries and employee benefits line as a consequence of
some of the restructuring actions you've undertaken.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: So, I'd probably break that into two parts, Eric. On things like marketing and promotion,
as we have said for a couple of quarters now, we clearly saw the opportunity with the business travel gain to increase
spending levels this quarter, but I would expect to see them go back towards what I would call more normal or
normalized levels beginning next quarter. There's some seasonality in that, and you see that seasonality quite clearly in
the chart on slide 13, but that's what I would expect to see next quarter on the marketing and promotion side.
In terms of the restructuring charge that we took, you are quite correct in that will drive some economies for us in the
coming quarters. However, you can imagine that given the size of the charge, there is some complexity to the changes
that we will be making. And so it will take us into 2015 before you will see the economic benefits on the operating
expense side of the restructuring charge we took and the changes that it will facilitate us making to our operation over
the course of the next year or so.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Great. And just if I could also just follow up. I think in the footnotes, it mentions that you
took a charge for a change in the Membership Rewards ultimate redemption rate. Is that distinct from the restructuring
charges that you called out? And if so, can you give us a sense of the magnitude of that figure?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Yes, it's completely distinct from anything we called out. And the way I would think
about this, Eric, is you have seen us over the last couple of years make a couple of all related incremental
improvements in the methodology we use for estimating this liability. This was one of the last remaining pieces of that
change. We made earlier changes in the more material markets, and so that's why this was a smaller charge, but it was
still significant enough to call out for you that I believe now brings us globally to where we have adopted a new and we
believe better methodology for how we calculate URR around the globe. But that is all completely separate from the

discussion we had around the incremental investments we chose to affirmatively make in the quarter to help grow the
business.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: And the magnitude?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: The magnitude is probably worth a couple of pennies.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: All right. Thanks very much.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. Next question is from the line of Vincent Caintic of Macquarie. Please go ahead.
<Q - Vincent Albert Caintic>: Yes, thank you. Just one quick question and one more follow-up question. On the
spend growth this quarter, it was very, very strong. I was wondering if you could kind of guide us whether to expect
that spend growth for the rest of 2014 or if we should be kind of thinking about the first half of 2014 as loan growth?
And then kind of on the incremental growth initiative investments made this quarter, and understanding it's early days,
but when should we be thinking about, say, the revenue opportunities that come from those investments? Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, on spend growth going forward, boy, we are always really cautious about trying to
project forward, because as you know, it's in our – results are tied to a number of things but including what happens
economically. And I would say as we look at the June quarter 9% billings growth rate, we are reasonably pleased with
that number, given the fact that the economy because of the very, very big slowdown that we saw in Q1, when you look
at Q2, and you look at year-over-year growth in the economy, and I'd remind everyone, that's really what our
year-over-year billings growth is more correlated to not, necessarily the sequential trend in GDP, but the year-over-year
trend.
The latest forecast that I look at for the June quarter and we'll all see the numbers in coming weeks make an estimate
that the year-over-year growth in GDP is probably down in the 1.5% to 2% range. So when it's – given If that, in fact
turns out to be the case, they have 9% billings growth, it's actually something we're fairly pleased with.
Obviously what happens going forward is going to be heavily impacted by what happens to that year-over-year
economic growth number, particularly in the U.S. economy, which is still the largest chunk of our billings. So we'll
have to see where that plays out. I would just make the observation that as we look at our June quarter results and
billings trends, there's nothing particularly unusual or one-time orientated to throw those numbers. I think they're
reflective of the core or underlying run rate of the business in that quarter, in the economic environment.
In terms of when the incremental investments pay off, as we always do when we think about investments, we invest in
a range of things that have payoffs from very short to medium term, to a few things that have very long term payoffs.
When you look at the restructuring charges, there is very detailed set of plans for the changes we will make and when
we will get the benefits and they will be mostly fully played out or mostly in place by the time you get out 12 months
from now. If you look at the spend on growth initiatives, when you think about things like the EveryDay card launch
and our card acquisition efforts, those will begin to show more of an impact as we get into the second, third, fourth
quarters from when we make those investments.
And one long-term thing we did is as we've said for quite some time on Serve, that is a long-term proposition for us
that we believe in, and this is the first time we've ever really done any media spend on Serve and I'd remind you that
that is an area where we really are trying to in some ways create a new category, and we have to help our customers
understand how to use that product and how it can really help make their financial life better. That's a longer term
prospect. So that's how I would think about the range of investments from close in to medium term to longer term.
<Q - Vincent Albert Caintic>: Great. Thanks very much.

Okay, thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Bill Carcache of Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Thank you. Good evening. I don't want to ask about anything relating specifically to the DOJ
case, but I had a broad question surrounding the notion of market power. One of the key points in prior cases involving
Amex is that I don't believe you guys have ever been found to have market power, and that's been a key reason why
you've been able to avoid direct regulation in places like Australia. But as we look ahead at the investments that you
continue to make in the business, the share gains that you've enjoyed since the great recession, and the anticipated
continued growth that should continue as we look ahead, how do you think about the risk that it could just be a matter
of time before you're viewed as having market power?
And I guess, is market power simply an outcome and you'll deal with it if and when the time comes that you are found
to have it? Or is it something that you don't anticipate becoming an issue any time soon because your two biggest
network competitors have so much share than you? Maybe if you could just speak broadly to that notion of market
power that'd be great.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Bill, I will make just a few very brief comments. One, just to be clear, as you stated,
there's no finding anywhere that we have market power around the globe. Two, we work really hard every day because
of the unique nature of our closed loop network to demonstrate the value we provide to the merchants and the value we
provide to our Card Members, none of whom has to have our product or have acceptance of our product, and we work
hard at that every single day. Third, I would just make the factual statement that once you leave the U.S. market, our
market shares are very, very small in other countries around the globe. So I think given, as you prefaced your question
with the pendency of the DOJ trial, though, I probably should probably limit my comments to those, but these are all
issues we, of course, feel very strongly about.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: I appreciate that. Completely understand. Maybe as a follow-up, unrelated, can you discuss the
rationale underlying the Serve Initiative at Walmart? I guess I was a little bit confused by it just from a high level. I
thought that the strategy was that the Bluebird product was going to be kind of the primary platform used at Walmart,
but that Serve would kind of be used elsewhere. But it sounds like Serve and Bluebird are both available at Walmart.
Maybe you could speak to that.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, I guess I'd make a couple of comments. If you draw an analogy to our card – or
credit business, we have many different products in all of the countries around the globe in which we do business,
because they all serve different target segments. And we think there is tremendous value in having the right card for the
right customer.
And, so, I think Walmart, as they think about what they want to offer to their customers, similarly believes that there
should be a range of choices and that different products will provide sets of capabilities and features to customers and
that choice is a good thing. And so where both our philosophy and Walmart's philosophy are quite aligned on this, to
us, it seems very natural to put in the end the consumer in the driver's seat so that they can make a choice.
<Q - Bill Carcache>: Thanks very much. I appreciate it.

Okay, thank you. And the next question is from the line of Mark DeVries of Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mark C. DeVries>: Yes, thanks. My main question is around expenses. There's a lot of moving parts here. And
the first part of it relates to the salaries expense. And I think Eric asked about this, but I didn't hear a response to it.
I think you indicated in the supplement that salaries were increased 7% year-over-year, predominantly due to
restructuring charges. Were those kind of non-recurring severance-related expenses or are those investments that'll lead
to a continued kind of year-over-year increase in salaries? And then just the second part of that is your broader sub 3%

annual year-over-year growth target. I think you indicated, Jeff, that you're now kind of lapping some of the best
quarters from expense reductions and you're now kind of growing off of that. Should we expect some operating
expense growth in the back half of the year?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: So let me take those one at a time. Mark, your question makes me think perhaps we
weren't as clear as we should have been. So when you think about the $133 million restructuring charge that we took,
that amount will appear in the salaries and benefits line predominantly. There's a very small piece that relates to some
facilities, but most of that charge is for a number of cases around the globe where we will be making changes to our
operation. And it is for severance for several thousand people as we make those changes and get the right people with
the right skill sets in the right places to provide great service for our customers. So that's what drove the salaries and
benefits lineup this quarter. And that's where as you go out over the course of the next four quarters and we execute on
these plans, you will see the savings or benefits, if you will, of those restructurings in the salaries and benefit line. So
hopefully that clarifies that point.
In terms of operating expense, you did see a particular low point in last year's second quarter, and so that's the only
point I was making when I noted that I think in the first quarter, our operating expenses were actually down a little bit
year-over-year, whereas this quarter they were up 4%. We are very committed and I think have demonstrated a really
good track record of controlling operating expenses. So there's no particular plan in place to sequentially begin to grow
operating expenses again as we go into the back half of the year. We remain very committed to hitting that less than 3%
target for the full year.
<Q - Mark C. DeVries>: Okay, that's great and just one other question if I could. Could you give us some color on
where your pipeline is for potential new GNS partnership? Is there enough there to – where you think you might be
able to sustain the low to mid-teens year-over-year growth in billings that you've had there?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, I think I certainly don't want to comment on specifics of partnership discussions we
may be involved in, but I think the more important point is that when you look at the growth that we have consistently
shown in GNS, that growth is not necessarily driven by the steady addition of new partners. It's driven by the fact that
we have a lot of great existing partners who, in fact, operate in some of the higher growth markets around the globe,
and/or operate in certain markets like China, where our presence is still in, I would call it, its earlier stages and
therefore much higher growth.
And so the sustainability of that higher growth level, while one element that helps support it is signing new partners, far
more important, really, is the performance of the partners we have around the globe, and we feel very good about that
performance and about the continued opportunities for growth.
<Q - Mark C. DeVries>: Got it. Thank you.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Ken Bruce of Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kenneth M. Bruce>: Thank you. Good evening. My question really relates to the incremental growth initiatives.
And thank you for providing a little bit of color in terms of how you're using those investments or how you're making
those investments. I think one of the challenges that investors have in terms of some of these gains historically that
have been used to support growth is that it's very difficult to really understand where the tangible benefits ultimately
are going to come from. And maybe there's a way to help us dimensionalize how we should be thinking about where
this is going to materialize, whether it be in terms of just average spending growth or if you think that ultimately it's
going to drive cards-in-force growth first and ultimately will begin to work its way into the billings patterns? And what
the real kind of timeline we should be expecting these initiatives to ultimately pay us back. And then I recognize that
you make a series of investments and I kind of understand that from historical discussions. But anything given this
large nature of spend in this quarter would be very helpful.

<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: So that's, Ken, a fair and very important question. I'd make a couple of comments.
Certainly we have detailed work and analysis we do here to determine how to prioritize the spending we do on growth
initiatives. Let me talk about the efficiency initiatives separately in just a second. So on those growth initiatives, we
continue to believe, even in the quarter we just finished, that as we look at our acquisition efforts, we actually still have
more ROI positive opportunities than we're able to fund while still meeting our earnings targets. We clearly could go
further this quarter, but all of those initiatives are closely tracked. We have a quite analytical understanding of what
happens as we do various kinds of acquisition activities around the globe and feel very good about the payoff that will
come on those investments.
I would note, however, that the incremental spend in the context of the overall size of our company and the overall size
of spending we do is fairly modest. So this did not double our spending for the quarter or the year. If you think about
this on an annual basis, this is adding 5% or 10% to our spend. So you will clearly see it in growth in revenues over
time. Practically, it is hard to break that out of the consolidated level. At a very detailed level, we will be tracking it
very closely. When you look at the media spend on the EveryDay card, which is the largest chunk of media spend,
which should be fairly obvious if you watch TV hopefully, that is harder to measure. On the other hand, we have a very
clear way to measure the success and growth of the EveryDay card, and we'll see that, we believe and hope, grow to be
a very sizable and profitable product for us in the coming quarters and years.
So that's the revenue side of the equation. On the efficiency initiatives, there's a very clear pathway to getting far more
benefit than what you would need to justify the restructuring charge. And then we will begin to see those benefits fully
phased in as you get into 2015. Again, the challenge in your seeing them from the outside of the P&L is one of scale.
When you think about the overall magnitude of our expense base, we do lots and lots of things everyday to continually
find ways to be more efficient so that we can achieve the kind of control of our operating expenses that you've seen us
achieve over the last couple of years. This is a piece of that. And you should see it in continued strong performance on
the operating expense line. So I realize that may not be as specific to these initiatives, and I will make a note here and
we should think a little bit about how we in future quarters, try to take some of our own ability at more of a micro level
to think about how these initiatives are doing and give you a little bit of color into them.
<Q - Kenneth M. Bruce>: Thanks that would be appreciated. One follow-up, fine tune inquiry, maybe two fine tuning
questions, there was a reference to a Community Reinvestment Act portfolio, fair value adjustment or valuation
adjustment. I assume that was an impairment. Can you give us what the size of that was, if it was material? And then
secondarily, if there's any way to give us some sense as to how the Wells Fargo roll out is going?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, let me take those maybe in reverse order. So on Wells Fargo, we're certainly very
pleased with our broader relationship with Wells Fargo and it's a growing relationship, but it's very early days in terms
of the GNS launch. What I would say is we certainly are pleased, though, to see some of the comments that John
Stumpf made, just a few weeks ago about the partnership. And, gosh, rather than me comment on it, I love the fact that
John came out and said they are very pleased and see the partnership with us as being off to a very, very good start. So
I suppose he's a better judge in some ways than we are, and so we are thrilled to see that.
On the Community Reinvestment Act, as with many accounting issues, we are constantly ensuring that we have the
best methodologies for estimation and this is one where we have a revised approach to how we estimate what we
should be booking and that's what we switched to this quarter, and it did drive an incremental expense amount that you
see called out in the releases we made today.
<Q - Kenneth M. Bruce>: Great. Thank you for your comments.

Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sanjay Harkishin Sakhrani>: Thank you. I got a couple of questions. One on the revenue yields. When we think
about the net interest yield going forward, that dropped pretty significantly sequentially. I'm not sure if that was

seasonal or something, but how should we think about its progression going forward? Same thing with the discount
rate, I know you addressed it. But maybe you could just talk about the migration going forward. Will there be stability
in that discount rate going forward? And then second question is around the $0.05 gain that you guys recognized this
quarter. When we think about how you guys assess yourselves relative to your targets, I assume that will be inclusive of
that $0.05. Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: So a couple of comments. Let me take those one at a time. First, on the net-interest yield,
you are actually correct, Sanjay, in one of your comments, which is there is some seasonality and when if you could go
back and look at the slides we have, you actually see that year-over-year, the net interest yield is up a little bit and that,
of course, is predominantly driven by the continued steady averaging down of our interest expense rates, given the rate
environment. And so there's no – in terms of the sequential trend, I wouldn't focus on that. I'd stay more focused on the
year-over-year trends.
On the discount rate, as I said in my remarks, we had a number of timing items that actually impacted both the first
quarter, making first quarter essentially flat year-over-year, making essence some things that would have caused it to
go down a little bit in the first quarter slipped into the second quarter and you saw a 4 basis point decline.
More broadly, we've said for a number of years that you should expect to see discount rate decline 2 basis points to 3
basis points a year, and that's because of our continued focus on driving more EveryDay spend. It's a function of
location. It's a function of our merchants growing and hitting volume-based triggers steadily over time. It's a function of
a very competitive environment. And it's a function of evolving mix. So all of those things, those are the long-term
trends that have been in place for many, many years, and you can look at the trend over the last 5 years, 6 years, and
see how we've done historically, base of all of those trends and managing the discount rate.
So when you look at the year-to-date numbers, we're pretty much in line with the trend. You just have to take that noise
out of having the first quarter look unusually good year-over-year and the second quarter look unusually bad.
That's first and the second comment. I think your third question was how we think about the $0.05 of EPS, is that...-
<Q - Sanjay Harkishin Sakhrani>: Yeah, that's right. When we talk about the targets that you guys have outlined in
terms of long term targets, will that $0.05 be included in that?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, of course, we never provide guidance. We are very public about our long-term
targets being out there at 12% to 15%. And our goal, Sanjay is to drive our earnings in the second half as much as we
can. What I would say is that you heard me mention in my earlier remarks that there are some transaction-related costs
that are going to lag into the third and fourth quarter. And so as we think about the full year, the incremental costs that
are going to lag into the back half of the year are going to offset some portion still to be determined precisely of that
$0.05. So, yeah, I guess as we think about the full year, we are likely to think about the $1.43, because the full year
impact of all of the elements of the JV are likely to be more of a wash.
<Q - Sanjay Harkishin Sakhrani>: All right. I got it. Thank you.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Great. Thanks. I guess the first question I had was the -it seems like if you take the gain
and you ex out the kind of one-time items, you have about $300 million left that you reinvested, and it also seems like,
starting in Q3, you'll have roughly $200 million less in revenue from the travel joint venture from the accounting for
the travel joint venture. So how long do you think it would take before those $300 million of extra investments we're
able to replace kind of that $200 million revenue?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Well, remember, Moshe, we also lose $200 million of expense related to the travel
business.

<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Right, but we were just thinking about the revenue growth here for a second.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Yeah, yeah, right. So, when you think about the kind of things we're investing in, as you
get into it, as I said earlier, quarters two through six is when you should really see the card-related spend on every day
and the other acquisition efforts begin to have a material impact. Now, of course, our bottom line goal here is to drive
earnings for the company, not necessarily to dollar for dollar replace the revenue of the travel business, but that's
probably the framework I would use for thinking about it.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Right. And the second – kind of the follow-up, a couple of people have talked about the
discount rate. You mentioned just some of the components. I thought that also cashback rewards is netted out of the
discount – merchant discount. Has that been a factor? Because that's been an area in which cashback rewards has kind
of grown as an industry issue. Could you talk about that a little bit?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Yeah, so it's probably worth clarifying Moshe, exactly what's in what numbers. So the
discount rate that we provide is a calculated discount rate meant to represent what we get for economics from
merchants where we are the acquirer. And so that calculation, which we do and then report out on every quarter, is the
one that went down 4 basis points this quarter.
There are other people who do a very simple calculation, they look at our GAAP financial statement and they divide
discount revenue into billings and that gives you a discount rate that is significantly lower. And there are two main
reasons that it's lower. Number one, the GNS partners billings are included in the billings number, but they, of course,
don't generate discount revenue. We have other arrangements with them, and so we pull that out, as we do the
calculated rate.
The other big difference is around to your point, the cash-back cards, which show up as a contra-revenue as well as
certain incentives that we pay to corporate clients. Neither of those things is reflective of the economics we're getting at
the merchants, which is why we pull them out of our calculated number. But it is why you see growth in the difference
between our calculated discount rate that we report and the simple calculation that you get when you divide off the
GAAP income statement discount revenue into billings.
All that said, you are correct, the cash-back products have been very strong products for us and that's a very good thing.
It does drive up cash-back rewards cost at a little higher rate than revenue growth, and since it's a contra-revenue, it has
the effect I just described. So hopefully that clarifies for you the way these pieces fit together.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Mostly though, because you said that the – I thought that you had said that your discount
rate included some of the payments to merchants for the contract signings, and now you just said that some of those are
not included?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: No. I didn't mean to say that. So what's not included in our calculated discount rate to
come back to it is the economics we have with GNS partners, which we pull out, and the cashback rewards costs and
the client incentives. There's a few other very, very small things, but those are the large timings. With merchant
signings an example would be that, we're constantly, every day out there competing for the business of our merchants,
and as with – particularly with some of the larger merchants and any B2B negotiations, sometimes you might have a
contract that expires in one quarter, but you don't get around to actually finishing the renegotiation until the next
quarter, you'll make the contract retroactive to the prior quarter when the prior contract expired. That would be an
example of where you're going to get a timing impact as you look at the discount rate quarter to quarter that's not
reflective of the ongoing rate.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Got it. Thanks.

Page 13 of 14
<Q - Robert P. Napoli>: Thank you. And I'd hate to beat a dead horse I guess on the incremental growth initiatives.
It's a little confusing as to, you have so many opportunities, why would you spend it all in the incremental cost in one
quarter? I mean why – I mean are you under investing versus your opportunities overall, and so therefore you should be
driving more expense through the year and forget about this year's earnings growth target to drive long-term value for
investors. Or should that investment – why wouldn't you have spread that out over a couple of different quarters to
support growth? So I'm just a little confused by why all of those incremental investments are in this quarter, and if you
have so many additional positive ROI growth initiatives why you're not spending more longer – not only this quarter
but the next several quarters.
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Oh, boy, those are great questions, Bob. Let me maybe take it in two parts. If you think
about over the medium to long-term how we manage the company, we're trying to balance lots of different things.
We're trying to balance achieving the steady, consistent financial performance that I think all of our shareholders have
come to expect from us, with the reality of the competitive world we live in that makes it challenging to get to our
near-term financial targets with the need to invest for the medium and the long-term and make sure we're positioning
this company to be as successful five years from now as it will be next quarter.
So, as we try to balance all of those things, you are correct, that one of the things we are trying to maximize is making
sure we achieve that steady financial performance, and that does force us to prioritize how we make investment choices
and when we make those investments, and it does cause us at times to defer going down the path on certain growth
initiatives to a future date because we think that's the right balance between that steady financial performance
short-term investments and longer-term investments.
That's the longer-term view. If you think about this quarter, I guess what I would point out in many ways you had a
confluence here of the reality that we have been on a re-engineering journey for several years, and it was very logical
for us to take the moves that drove the restructuring charge this quarter, we'll actually enact those over the course of the
next year, but we think it just made sense to pair it up with the gain. Similarly, it just was a nice coincidence that we
launched the EveryDay card at the end of March and early April, so it coincided very nicely to do a big blitz of spend
on EveryDay right at the time of the second quarter. Again, somewhat similarly, we just relaunched Serve late last year
and felt this was a good time to do the first ever really media blitz we've done.
Lastly, I'd just remind you that the business travel transaction is one we have been working on for a very long time. We
knew well in advance the timing of when it was likely to happen, and that really allowed us to be thoughtful and
planful in all of our marketing and operational plans this year to take advantage of the timing. So we don't think we
sub-optimized how we used that gain. We actually think that it allows us to, in a very planful way, do a lot things that
we have had on our plate for a while, and it will pay off for our shareholders in the coming quarters.
<Q - Robert P. Napoli>: Great and just a follow up question – thank you for that, is on the travel joint venture, is there
a new strategy that's being embarked upon? I mean, you still have nearly $1 billion of value in that business and it is
still, I think, important to American Express, is there a new acceleration of growth strategy? I mean, is it looking to
compete in a different area of travel? I mean is the idea here to accelerate growth? And then how does American
Express still benefit from that business?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Boy, to be very clear, we created this joint venture because we are excited about the
projects for it to grow and to use the capital that is now in the business and the focus that is now in the business to
create better products, to grow faster, to create better technology, to improve customer service, and, of course, we will
continue to work very closely from a business perspective with the joint venture to serve our mutual customers in a
coordinated and combined way. I would remind you, it will be called American Express Travel still, so we are all in
and very excited about the fact that we think this is not just a good transaction in the short term for our shareholders,
but is actually a transaction that will lead to a much stronger travel company in the coming years. And we will benefit
in many ways from that.
<Q - Robert P. Napoli>: Great thank you.

Okay. And the final question then comes from the line of Chris Donat of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher R. Donat>: All right, thanks for taking my question, Jeff. Just one quick clarification on the
accelerated spend and marketing. With the recognition of that, is it the case that, say for something like the production
of television ads or radio ads that you might be recognizing expenses in the second quarter but then the ads might not
air for subsequent quarter, so you've frontloaded this spending as much as those of us who watch television actually see
the ads?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: No. I think the reality of how we do our accrual accounting is we have put into our second
quarter P&L what we ran during the second quarter P&L. And going forward, you will see running through our P&L
whatever we run going forward. So, we think we were able to get a really strong start for the EveryDay Card and give a
strong boost to Serve. And our job going forward will be to build upon that.
<Q - Christopher R. Donat>: Okay. And then just quick clarification on your comments about the revenue and
expenses for the joint venture. You did say that was using operating expenses, not total expenses, right? I think the 11%
number?
<A - Jeffrey C. Campbell>: Yes, absolutely. So if you take – and then we're using 2013 as a baseline to help you with
modeling, about 11% of operating expenses and about 80% of the travel commissions and fees line.
<Q - Christopher R. Donat>: Got it. Okay. Thanks very much.
