Thank you, Nancy.
We're pleased to report the results of our third fiscal quarter. We established a new June quarter record for iPhone sales,
driving Apple's strongest June quarter revenue ever. Revenue for the quarter was $35.3 billion, up $300 million or 1%
from the year-ago quarter and at the high end of our guidance range. Gross margin was 36.9%, also at the high end of
our guidance range, and operating margin was $9.2 billion, representing 26% of revenue. Net income was $6.9 billion,
translating to diluted earnings per share of $7.47.
Channel inventories declined sequentially by $1 billion during the June quarter this year, meaning that sell-through was
$36.3 billion. In contrast, channel inventory increased $700 million from the beginning to the end of the June quarter
last year, meaning that sell-through was $34.3 billion in that quarter. As such, our June quarter sell-through increased
by $2 billion or 6% year-over-year, ahead of our 1% sell-in revenue growth.
As for the details of the quarter, I'd like to begin with iPhone. We sold 31.2 million iPhones compared to 26 million in
the year-ago quarter, an increase of 5.2 million or 20%. We had a sequential decrease of about 600,000 iPhones in
channel inventory in the June quarter, translating to iPhone sell-through of about 31.8 million units. iPhone sales were
ahead of our expectations and we were particularly pleased with very strong year-over-year growth in iPhone sales in a
number of both developed and emerging markets, including the U.S., the U.K., Japan, Brazil, Russia, India, Thailand
and Singapore. iPhone 5 remains by far the most popular iPhone, but we were also very happy with sales of iPhone 4
and 4S.
We exited the quarter with about 11 million units of total iPhones in channel inventory and ended within our target
range of four to six weeks of iPhone channel inventory. iPhone unit sales in the U.S. increased 51% compared to the
year-ago quarter and based on research recently published by comScore, iPhone once again achieved the number one
spot in U.S. smartphone market for the three-month period ending in May with over 39% share.
iPhone sales were also very strong in Japan, growing 66% year-over-year. iPhone is the top selling smartphone in Japan
based on the latest published quarterly data from IDC and Apple is the number one or number two selling smartphone
manufacturer in most markets IDC tracks, including North America, Western Europe, Russia, Turkey, Australia, Hong
Kong, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore. The most recently published study by Kantar measured a 93% loyalty rate
among iPhone owners, significantly higher than our competitors and iPhone continues to lead in terms of customer
experience.
Not only has iPhone earned the top spot in customer satisfaction from J.D. Power and Associates an unprecedented
nine consecutive times; it has also received the top customer satisfaction ranking in a number of surveys, including the
recent Quality Insights survey of smartphone customers in South Korea.
iPhone also continues to be the smartphone of choice for business. Given the security and stability of iOS, enterprise
and government customers around the world continue to deploy iPhone on their networks in ways that go far beyond
personal productivity. Companies have built tens of thousands of custom apps to improve every aspect of their
business.
Global companies, including American Airlines, Cisco, General Electric, Roche and SAP have deployed more than
25,000 iPhones each across their organizations. U.S. government organizations, such as NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab,
the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration, the ATF and the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency are
supporting and managing thousands of iPhones on their networks and continue to create both customer-facing and
internal iOS apps. And just this past quarter, iOS 6 was granted FIPS 140-2 validation by the U.S. federal government
and approval by the U.S. Department of Defense to connect to their networks.
Combining sales to business, government and education customers, iPhone holds a 62.5% share of the U.S. commercial
market based on the latest quarterly data published by IDC.
Turning to iPad, we sold 14.6 million iPads during the quarter, compared to 17 million in the year-ago quarter. The
tough year-over-year comparison was driven by both a significant channel inventory increase and the first full quarter
of the availability of the third-generation iPad in the year-ago quarter. We built 1.2 million units of iPad channel

inventory in the June quarter last year, whereas we reduced channel inventory by 700,000 units in the June quarter this
year. Factoring in this 1.9 million unit channel inventory swing, iPad unit sell-through was down 3% year-over-year.
We exited the quarter with about 4.1 million units of iPad channel inventory, within our target range of four to six
weeks.
Customers continue to love their iPads. For the second consecutive time in the two-year history of the survey, iPad
ranked number one in the 2013 U.S. Tablet Satisfaction Survey by J.D. Power & Associates. And again in its latest
study published today, Chitika reported that iPad accounted for 84.3% share of tablet web usage by customers in the
U.S. and Canada, its highest level this year.
In every major industry around the world, companies are developing, deploying and supporting apps for iPad.
Government organizations, as well as global enterprise companies across diverse fields, including automotive,
insurance, energy services and healthcare are using iPad and custom apps to create unique, meaningful experiences for
their employees, partners and customers.
The USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service has deployed thousands of iPads to in-person interviewers
resulting in higher response rates and decreased costs. And companies, including Eli Lilly, Novartis, Cathay Life,
Roche and SAP have developed over 20,000 – have deployed over 20,000 iPads each across their organizations.
Turning to Mac, we are pleased with sales of 3.8 million Macs which is a 7% decline from the year-ago quarter, but
higher than our expectations. IDC estimates that the global personal computer market contracted by 11% during the
June quarter indicating that Macs gained share.
In June, we introduced two new versions of MacBook Air and customer response has been great. Wired Magazine
described the new 13-inch MacBook Air as nearly flawless citing its phenomenal battery life, processing performance,
feather-light chassis and super-fast Wi-Fi.
Additionally last month, we provided a sneak peek at a next-generation Mac Pro engineered around workstation
graphics with dual GPUs, PCI Express-based flash storage, high-performance Thunderbolt 2, next-generation Xeon
processors, ultrafast memory and support for 4k video. The new state-of-the-art Mac Pro will be assembled in the U.S.
and will be available later this year.
We were excited to release a developer preview of OS X Mavericks last month. More than 200 new features – OS –
with more than 200 new features, OS X Mavericks brings maps and iBooks to the Mac, introduces finder tags and tabs,
enhances multi-display support for power users, delivers new core technologies for breakthrough power efficiency and
performance and includes an all new version of Safari. OS X Mavericks will be available to customers in the fall. We
ended the quarter with just below our four to five week target range of Mac channel inventory.
Our U.S. Education Institution business had a great quarter generating its highest quarterly revenue ever. The results
were fueled by all-time record quarterly iPad sales of 1.1 million units, in addition to strong June quarter Mac sales.
The State of Maine's Learning Technology Initiative, which provides the state's middle school and high school students
and teachers with personal computing solutions, allows individual school districts to choose which products to purchase
rather than standardize on a single state-wide solution. We're very proud that an estimated 94% of the 69,000 total units
selected this year were Apple products and we're extremely pleased to have received the Los Angeles School Board of
Education's unanimous approval to begin the first phase of a massive rollout of iPads to students across the district
starting this fall. The district is the second largest in the United States and plans to equip every one of its 660,000
students with a tablet by 2014.
We continue to be very pleased with the growth and strength of the Apple ecosystem. With the broadest geographic
reach and depth of content in the industry, our iTunes store has generated record billings of $4.3 billion in the June
quarter, culminating in our best month and best week ever for app store billings at the very end of the quarter. The
quarter's iTunes billings translated to quarterly revenue of $2.4 billion, up 29% from the year-ago quarter with strong
growth in revenue from both content and apps. The continued strong iTunes sales, combined with other software and
service revenue, resulted in total quarterly revenue of $4 billion from iTunes software and services.

We added some great new video content to iTunes and Apple TV. Last month, we announced HBO GO and
WatchESPN are now available directly on Apple TV joining programming from Hulu Plus, Netflix's streaming catalog,
live sports from MLB, NBA and NHL, as well as internet content from Vivo, YouTube and Flickr. Sky News,
Crunchyroll and Quello are offering live news, sports and current TV programming. Apple TV users can now choose
from a broad selection of programming, including over 60,000 movies and over 230,000 TV episodes, as well as the
world's largest collection of music on the iTunes store.
iTunes users have downloaded more than 1 billion TV episodes and 390 million movies from iTunes to date and they
are purchasing over 800,000 TV episodes and over 350,000 movies per day. We recently celebrated the five-year
anniversary of our amazing App Store. Our developers have now created more than 900,000 iOS apps, including
375,000 apps made for iPad. The popularity of these apps remains incredibly strong. Cumulative app downloads have
surpassed 50 billion and app developers have made over $11 billion from their sales through the App Store, half of
which was earned in the last four quarters.
Our vibrant ecosystem continues to drive tremendous user engagement with our devices and services. We now have
over 320 million iCloud accounts and 240 million Game Center accounts and our customers have sent almost 900
billion iMessages, uploaded over 125 billion photos and received over 8 trillion Push notifications. And thanks to the
stability and security and popularity of the iOS platform, the iOS devices continue to have a strong lead over Android
in the enterprise.
In its most recently published Quarterly Enterprise Device Activations Report, Good Technologies found that among
its corporate clients, iPhone 5 was by far the most frequently activated device of any kind and iPads represented 88% of
all tablet activations.
We're continuing to invest in software and services to make the ecosystem and user experience even richer. This fall,
we release a beta version of iWork for iCloud, bringing Pages, Numbers and Keynotes to the web. With iWork for
iCloud, users will be able to create great looking letters, reports and flyers, generate complex, yet beautiful
spreadsheets and develop and deliver beautiful presentations with powerful graphics and special effects, all from within
a web browser. And we're extremely excited about the fall launch of iOS 7 with its stunning new user interface and
many great new features, including Control Center, AirDrop and iTunes Radio, smarter multitasking and enhancements
to Notification Center, Photos, Safari and Siri.
I'd now like to turn to the Apple retail stores. Revenue for the quarter was $4.1 billion, approximately equal to the
year-ago quarter. The stores experienced strong growth in iPhone sales and had their most successful MacBook Air
launch to date.
We opened six new stores across five countries during the quarter and ended the quarter with a total of 408 stores
including 156 outside the United States. We expect to open 9 new stores in the September quarter bringing us to a total
of 27 new store openings in fiscal 2013. We also relocated 4 stores in the June quarter that had outgrown their former
space and we expect to complete a total of 23 such relocations in fiscal 2013.
With an average of 405 stores open in the June quarter, average revenue per store was $10.1 million compared to $11.1
million in the year-ago quarter. Retail segment income was $667 million. We hosted 84 million visitors to our stores
during the quarter which translates to 16,000 visitors per store per week. Operating expenses were $3.8 billion and
included $488 million in stock-based compensation expense. OI&E was $234 million and the tax rate for the quarter
26.9%.
And turning to our cash, we ended the quarter with $146.6 billion in cash, plus short-term and long-term marketable
securities compared to $144.7 billion at the end of the March quarter, a sequential increase of $1.9 billion. $106 billion
of our total cash was offshore at the end of the June quarter and cash flow from operations was $7.8 billion.
In early April, we concluded the $1.95 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we initiated in the December
quarter resulting in cumulative retirement of over 4 million shares of Apple stock under that program. In late April, we
executed a very successful debt offering issuing $17 billion of debt across 3, 5, 10 and 30-year maturities. We paid $2.8
billion in dividends in the quarter and we also utilized a total of $16 billion in cash on share repurchase activity through

a combination of a new accelerated share repurchase program and open market purchases.
$12 billion of the $16 billion was utilized under a new ASR program initiated with two financial institutions in April.
An initial delivery of 23.5 million shares was made under this program with the final number of shares delivered and
average price per share to be determined at the conclusion of the program based on the volume weighted-average
purchase price of Apple stock over the program period which will conclude in fiscal 2014.
In addition to the new ASR, we executed $4 billion of open market share repurchases resulting in the retirement of 9
million additional shares. Our Board of Directors has declared a dividend of $3.05 per common share payable on
August 15, 2013, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on August 12, 2013.
Now as we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook which includes the types of
forward-looking information that Nancy referred to at the beginning of the call. We expect revenue to be between $34
billion and $37 billion compared to $36 billion in the year-ago quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 36% and
37% reflecting approximately $90 million related to stock-based compensation expense. We expect OpEx to be
between $3.9 billion and $3.95 billion including about $495 million related to stock-based compensation. We expect
OI&E to be about $200 million and we expect the tax rate to be about 26.5%.
In closing, we're pleased with our record June quarter iPhone sales, the strong growth in revenue from iTunes software
and services, and the continued enhancement and popularity of our tremendously vibrant ecosystem. We are very
excited about the upcoming releases of the stunning new iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks and we are very hard at work on
some amazing new products that we will introduce in the fall and across 2014.
And with that, I'd like to open the call to questions.
Nancy Paxton
Thank you, Peter. And we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, may we have the
first question, please.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Yes. Thanks. Peter, as you mentioned in the press release today, new products will ship this fall
and historically gross margins do come down in a product transition quarter, but that's not reflected in your outlook. So
can you talk about why this product cycle might be different?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Katy, as I said in my prepared remarks, we expect our gross margins to be between 36%
and 37%, which is consistent with what we expected in the June quarter. And on a sequential basis, that would mean
that gross margin would be largely flat to slightly down. We are on track to have a very busy fall. I'd like to leave it
there and go into more detail in October.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Okay. As a follow-up, can you talk about why you think channel inventory came down more
than seasonally this quarter and also inventory on your balance sheet was up significantly? Is that a direct result of the
channel wanting to hold less inventory?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Katy, I'll take the balance sheet part of your question and Tim, can talk about the channel.
The inventory on the balance sheet was really up for two reasons. First, we've got more stores this year than we had
last, so our finished goods inventory was a part of the inventory increase. And then our components inventory was up
as well.

<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Katy, it's Tim. From an iPad point of view or iPad and iPhone, we reduced inventory and
reduced it fairly significantly. iPad was down over 700,000 units from the beginning of the quarter and iPhone was
down over 600. As you know from working with us over several quarters, we typically don't like to have any more
inventory then we need, and so if we can find a way to reduce, we do so, and we've done that in both of these cases. We
also had slight decreases in the Macintosh area and on iPod.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks, Katy. Can we have the next question, please?
Operator
From Goldman Sachs, we'll go to Bill Shope.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay, great. Thanks. I have a bit of a longer-term question. Despite the fairly substantial iPhone
upside this quarter, there's been increasing concerns that the high end of the smartphone market is reaching saturation
point and that growth may be harder to come by for really for all vendors. What's your perspective on that and the
current industry dynamics? And Tim, do you think there are new innovations and services in the pipeline that can
reinvigorate the premium segment of the market, after what's obviously been a bit of a tough 2013 for that segment for
the industry?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: From a growth point of view for Apple, our key catalyst will always will be new products
and new services. And these are both in existing categories that we're in and in new categories. In addition to this, we
have opportunities in distribution from carrier relationships to expanding our retail stores, expanding our online store
and continuing to expand the indirect channel. And we also have a market expansion opportunity.
Peter mentioned enterprise in his comments and the share positions that we have there, over 60% in both iPad and
iPhone and I think we're at the very front-end of that, and so I think we have lots of growth opportunities. And I don't
subscribe to the common view that the higher-end, if you will, the smartphone market has hit its peak. I don't believe
that, but we'll see and we'll report our results as we go along.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay, great. And then on the iPad side of the equation, looking at the sell-through decline this
quarter, obviously ex-the channel inventory dynamics, should we think of this as more of a pause within your customer
base ahead of your next refresh as we've seen in the past? Or is there a broader industry dynamic at play within tablets
that could contribute to that?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: For us, if you look year-over-year, we had a 2.4 million unit decline, but 80% of that or 1.9
million units were just due to changes in channel inventory. As I think Peter referenced earlier, we reduced by over 700
in the current quarter and the year-ago quarter had an increase of 1.2, and so the underlying sell-through declined by
just 3%. If you look at the situation that we were in, in the year-ago quarter, we had just announced the third-generation
iPad which was our first iPad with a Retina display. We'd announced in March and so that was our first full quarter.
And so from what Peter and I expected 90 days ago, we hit within the midpoint of the range that we expected to hit in
on iPad unit sales and so it was not a surprise to us.
In terms of how other people are doing? I don't know. What I can tell you is the most recent data I've gotten, which
actually just came out I believe this morning, is that the iPad web share data shows that through the quarter, we
accelerated further and are now – iPad accounts for 84% of the web traffic from tablets, which is absolutely incredible.
And so if there are lots of other tablets selling, I don't know what they're being used for because that's a pretty basic
function is web browsing.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: We feel good about where we are. We had – as Peter had mentioned earlier, we had an
incredible quarter in U.S. education setting a new record for iPad. We're really happy to be selected for the first phase
of the 660,000-unit rollout at LA Unified and a really bold move that they're making to change teaching and learning.

And we had double-digit unit growth in China for iPad, in Japan, in Canada, in Latin America, in Russia, in the Middle
East and in India, and so we're really happy with what we saw.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay. Thanks, Tim.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yeah.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks, Bill. Could we have the next question, please.
Operator
From Sanford Bernstein, we'll go to Toni Sacconaghi.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Yes. Thank you. I was wondering if you could provide some kind of gross margin bridge
sequentially? I think last quarter you had about a 90 basis point one-time impact from the China warranty accrual, so if
we adjust for that, gross margins were down about 150 basis points sequentially and the mix of products was relatively
similar to last quarter. Given that you're also riding the experience curve in these products, I was surprised given the
mix that gross margins were as down as much sequentially as they were. Can you provide a bridge on a sequential basis
on what happened with gross margins?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Sure. First of all let me say, we're very pleased with gross margin in the quarter at 36.9%
it was at really the high end of the range that we provided of 36% to 37%. And the sequential decline was not a surprise
to us. We understood the warranty effects in March, and as I said on last quarter's call, we expected our margins to be
down sequentially, primarily for two reasons. The first is a lower sequential revenue, so we lost leverage going from
March to June, and we expected a different product mix, and as you can see, we reported very near the top end of it and
feel good.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: All right, but Peter the mix ultimately was not that different. I think iPhones were 52.5%,
last quarter they were 51.5%. So it actually seems like your mix was perhaps better than you had anticipated, so I
appreciate the volume revenue mix, but was your mix exactly in line with what you expected?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: We had some puts and takes within the quarter, but it was ultimately ended up within the
range that we thought it would be, and we hit the high end.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: The second one I was wondering whether you could comment on was, just iPhone ASPs.
They were down about 5% sequentially or down about 10% over the last two quarters. I presume that's principally due
to a higher mix of 4s and 4Ss but I was wondering if you could comment on what's driving that change in ASP, and
whether it's more pronounced in certain geographies versus others.
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: We were down 4% year-over-year on the iPhone ASP, about the $27. And that was
primarily due to the mix of the product that we're selling, and FX headwinds. As we anticipated iPhone 4 sales
accelerated as we offered more affordable pricing in emerging and other markets. So that's on a year-over-year basis.
And then sequentially it was down about $32, and again, that was driven by mix as well, in part iPhone 4.
Tim, do you want to make comments about what we may have seen in the regions?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yeah, sure. From an iPhone point of view, Toni, with the moves that we made on 4 and with
iPhones 5 continuing to be the most popular model, we saw very strong sales in several of the emerging markets or
prepaid markets. India was up over 400%, Turkey and Poland were both up over 60%, Philippines were up about
140%. And these were, in addition, we saw very strong iPhone sales in several of the developed markets. For example,
U.S. was up over 50%, Japan up over 60%, the U.K. about 50%. So we had several regions where iPhone growth
actually accelerated from the previous quarter, which is an unusual pattern for us. We were very, very happy with this.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: And notably absent from that list was China. Was your pricing how you treated to change
pricing this quarter relative to previous quarters any different in China than the rest of the world?

<A - Timothy D. Cook>: China was weaker in the quarter, although the data sheet that obviously focuses on revenue
doesn't really tell the complete story here. If you look at sell-through, as we mentioned earlier with the inventory
changes, it's important to do that. And so our sell-through in China was only down 4% from the year-ago quarter when
you normalize for channel inventory. Hong Kong was actually down more significantly than that. Mainland China was
actually up year-over-year. It was up 5%. But that is a lower growth rate than we have been seeing, and I attribute it to
many things, including the economy there clearly doesn't help us nor others.
In Hong Kong, Hong Kong is an international shopping haven, as you know, for not only tourists, but also some
resellers and we saw a more dramatic downturn there. It's not totally clear exactly why that occurred, but it was down
on a sell-through basis by about 20%, and so that weighed greater China down as you can see on your datasheet.

Ben Reitzes with Barclays.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Okay. I've got four too. Kidding. The question that I wanted to ask was with regard to – there's
been a lot of talk about a trade-in program that you guys are going to start even doing on your own with regard to
iPhones. Is there any update on that? And if so, is that something that could help margins and help expand your
emerging market sales? And how's that going to work? Thanks.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Ben, we haven't announced anything relative to a trade-in program, so what you've seen is
rumor oriented. There are a number of channels that do trade-in programs now, not only in the U.S., but in different
regions. And the reason that it's so attractive around iPhones is that the residual value of an iPhone stays so high and
there's so much demand for it. And so that makes the trade-in programs more lucrative to – or win-win from many
points of view. But we haven't announced anything that we're – about us or anything.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Are you opposed to it?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: I – no, I'm not opposed to it. I see channels doing it and I like the environmental aspects of it,
and so that part of it really is encouraging to me.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Oh, okay. And then really quick on China, you answered some of it in the question before, but
how do we turn it around here? China and other APAC, what can we do to make it turn? And there's been some press in
China that obviously you had to deal with and when do we see that market turning? And you know that investors are
very worried about it from a secular point of view as well, as well as the economy there?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: I think it's important to put it in perspective. If you combine the results that we have in
greater China, our revenues, they were $4.9 billion for the quarter, and so that's about 14% of the company which is
very significant. And a few years ago, that was in the hundreds of millions, and so we've grown our business there
significantly. We have a very strong market there and in the last 12 months, we've done $27 billion on a trailing basis,
so it's a huge business for us.
Under the – underlying the results are – if you look at iPad, sell-through in greater China was up 8%, but sell-through
in Mainland China was up 37%, and so iPad's doing remarkably well. The latest share numbers we've seen for iPad for
the tablet market is over 50%. And year-to-date, iPad units are up 48% year-over-year, so there've been great growth
there.
From an ecosystem point of view, we continue to attract a lot of developers from China. We now have about 0.5
million developers in China that are working on iOS apps and that's up almost 70% year-over-year and so I think that's
fantastic, not only for China, but for outside of China as many offer their apps through – in different stores around the
world.

We're obviously paying developers quite a bit, and so that's furthering the advance of the ecosystem of developers.
We're continuing to invest in distribution. We're going to double the number of retail stores there over the next two
years and we're continuing to list iPhone point-of-sales and iPads unit sales, both of which are currently lower than
where we would like them or need them to be. But we're doing that very cautiously because we want to do it with great
quality. And so I continue to believe that in the arc of time here, China is a huge opportunity for Apple. And I don't get
discouraged over a 90-day kind of cycle that can have economic factors and other things in it.

From Piper Jaffray, we'll hear from Gene Munster.
<Q - Gene E. Munster>: Hey. Good afternoon. You talked about more affordable pricing and, Peter, can you just
confirm that, that was just with the iPhone 4? And separately, as you think about the growth that you've had in some of
these emerging markets, it sounds like some more recently has come from affordable pricing, but also, you potentially
could address those markets with products that are more appropriate for those markets. And maybe can you just talk
from a very high level of just how you think about, are those both levers that you potentially could use or do feel that
pricing is the lever? Then a follow-up question.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Gene, it's Tim. The reference that Peter made earlier was to the iPhone 4, and what we've
seen is that the number of first-time smartphone buyers that the iPhone 4 is attracting is very, very impressive. And we
want to attract as many of these buyers as we can. And we saw that beginning to happen toward the end of the Q2
timeframe, as I referenced on last quarter's call, and we did that on a wider spread basis, offered more affordable
pricing on a wider scale basis this quarter and continued to be very happy with what we saw. And where iPhone 5
continues to be the most popular iPhone by far, we're really happy to provide an incredible, high-quality product with
iPhone 4 running iOS 6 to as many first-time smartphone buyers as we can. And I think it's proven to be exactly a great
product for that buyer.
<Q - Gene E. Munster>: Do you think there are more weapons that you could use in these markets to continue the
pace that you have?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: There's always more weapons. And we have more than one tool in the toolbox, but yeah, it's
a great way for a buyer to get into the iOS ecosystem, and the customer sat ratings that we have with iOS 6 and the
stickiness of the platform is huge. And so it's great for customers and we're very glad to offer it.
<Q - Gene E. Munster>: Okay. And then my final question is, just in terms of the growth question that some investors
have about how you keep such a high revenue growth number moving. Last quarter, you referred to new product
categories and this time, you referred to more products over the next few years. Are there product categories out there
that are big enough to move the needle for Apple?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: We'll see, Gene. We're working on some stuff that we're really proud of and we'll see how it
does. And we'll announce things when we're ready.
<Q - Gene E. Munster>: Thank you.

<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you. Tim, can you talk broadly about your discussions with both existing and
potential carrier partners? I would think the 66% growth in Japan might prod one in particular to be interested in some
of the coming products. And then also, there's been some comments about Russia and just concerns in general about
pricing in that. So sort of in general, how have your discussions with your carrier partners been?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: I would classify them as being good. The press I've seen on Russia probably needs some
color. The articles I've seen suggested that we are not selling iPhone through carrier-owned stores, if that's the one that
you're referencing. If you look at the Russian market, over 80% of smartphones are sold in retail. They're outside of
carrier-owned stores, and we sell through a number of national chains there, and in fact, our activations in Russia for
iPhone set a record last quarter. It was our highest quarter in Russia ever and so we're really happy with how we're
doing there.
We do continue to sell through some carrier-owned stores as well, but obviously the contribution is much less than the
retail organizations, and so forth. And so I think that's probably not well-understood there. We're continually looking
for other relationships to both add and enhance the ones we've got, and I do think there's some opportunities there for
us.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Okay, great. And then can you talk a bit about commodities, just in terms of pricing of some
of your key commodities, ability to procure them, and how some of, I guess your supply chain is working these days?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Yeah. Sure. We certainly have no problem procuring them. In terms of where we see pricing
headed, and this would have been factored into the gross margin guidance that Peter gave earlier. Despite the very, very
weak PC market, DRAM pricing has actually increased, and we see continued upward pressure in this area. NAND
pricing is fairly stable and it's following seasonal trends as we would expect. Both LCDs and HDDs, the prices have
fallen and we would expect further reductions in these areas. And if you look at other commodities, they appear to be in
a supply/demand balance so we would expect the pricing to decline on these at sort of historical levels.
<Q - Shannon S. Cross>: Thank you.
<A - Nancy Paxton>: Thanks, Shannon. Can we have the next question please?

From UBS we'll go to Steve Milunovich.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Thank you. Peter, first could you clarify whether in your fiscal fourth quarter guidance
you have any of these new products assumed shipping in the quarter?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Steve that's not something that I can comment on.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Okay. And then, Tim, kind of a philosophical question but whenever you talk about
what's important to the company it always comes back to great products, better being more important than more. Wall
Street's kind of in the more business. So I just wonder – kind of talk about your philosophy, and if you could come up
with a couple really great products, maybe they provide enough growth, maybe they don't. But you don't seem as
focused on financial metrics and growth projections as a lot of companies are. Maybe tie that a little bit into your
functional organization. Does that limit how many products you can actually take to market over time?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Steve, I think about it differently than that. The way I think about it is, we're here to make
great products, and we think that if we focus on that and do that really, really well, that the financial metrics will also
come and so we don't see those two things being mutually exclusive. We see them having great overlap. I think if you
look at how the company's executed over many years, it would suggest that, that's possible.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: But you don't go into it saying, we need to get x% growth, what do we need to do from
a product standpoint? It sounds like you go the opposite, what are some really great products we can do, and if we do
that, the metrics take care of themselves.

<A - Timothy D. Cook>: We start at the product, because we believe that the most important thing is that our
customers love the products and want them. If you don't start at that level you can wind up creating things that people
don't want. So we try very hard to focus on products and customers, enriching customers and making great products.

And we'll go to Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi. Thank you. I have two, also. Tim, I'm going to start with you, if I can. To Bill's earlier
question, Bill Shope's, on you don't think the high end is saturated, and yet ASPs have come down quite a bit on
iPhones. I was wondering if you could speak philosophically. Is the current mix what we should be thinking about for
iPhones? And more specifically, would you anticipate that ASPs would continue to trend lower in iPhones or stay
where they are at least directionally?
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: Keith, in terms of – we don't project ASPs. We do give guidance, so we have an assumption
on the ASP for the current quarter in our guidance obviously to come up with the numbers that Peter talked about
earlier. If you look underneath the iPhone numbers, as I think Peter alluded to earlier, we saw significant growth,
clearly, in the lower price point year-over-year, which for us is iPhone 4. Still a great product and that was one of the
things and the iPhone 5 doing well, that allowed us to significantly beat what I think was probably the vast majority of
expectations out there for iPhone sales.
And so honestly if we do a lot better at the low-end and we sell more of those and the mix changed. It has changed
across the last year. If you look at 3GS last year, which was in a comparable position as our entry product, we're selling
a lot more 4s than 3GS's. I think we both understand the market much better and have our fingers on the pulse of
distribution in different countries and so forth this year. I'm sure that we'll get better and better at that over time, and
how that will change mix, I don't know.
Typically for us, a product has the highest mix during its initial few months of sales. And so, you'd have a natural kind
of seasonal decline over time of the product cycle. That generally happens on iPhone, it generally happens on iPad,
we've seen that happen on the Mac over many years. And so, I don't see anything that fundamentally would change
that. But again, we're going to look at this thing quarter by quarter and tell you how we look at the quarter, and give
you guidance for it as we go.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay, all right. And then Peter, for you, there's been a few comments on gross margins and
I wanted to try to broad it out a bit. In the past, as you look at the one-quarter forward, which would be the September
quarter, you've given us some of the puts and takes to think about. There's been a couple specific questions asked about,
but I wanted to broad it out and see if you could just highlight what you think are the puts and takes in the September
quarter as you see them today, particularly with reference to the quarter you just reported. Thank you.
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Sure. I'm going to keep my comments limited, but I'll give you a put and a take.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay.
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: And I think – or I guess the tailwind we would expect are component costs to be favorable
in the quarter.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay.
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Adversely, we would expect some FX pressure in the quarter given the strengthening of
the dollar, particularly against the yen.

And from Raymond James, we'll hear from Tavis McCourt.
<Q - Tavis C. McCourt>: Thanks for taking my question. Peter, first, a clarification on the share buyback. Can you
tell us what the ending basic share count was in the third quarter?
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: Let me – well, the – all of that is on the income statement, so you've got the ending, basic
and diluted.
<Q - Tavis C. McCourt>: Okay.
<A - Peter Oppenheimer>: But let me give you a couple of points that I think could be helpful for you. During the
June quarter, we concluded the first $4 billion – or I'm sorry, $2 billion ASR program that we started in December, and
then we – so we got the final shares in on those. And we did our second ASR program of $12 billion. That started at the
end of April, and we received 23.5 million shares in initially on that. And as I went through in my prepared remarks, at
some point during fiscal 2014 that program will close and we'll get the final number of shares.
We also bought back $4 billion of stock in the open market during the June quarter, and received about 9 million
shares. So the impact of those in the June quarter lowered our diluted share count in the quarter by about 22.9 million
shares. And as you look forward into the September quarter, before any further buybacks or any issuance to employees,
we would expect to see an additional approximate 11 million-share benefit from the things that occurred during the
June quarter.
<Q - Tavis C. McCourt>: Great, thanks. And one for you, Tim. One of the comments out of the developers conference
was iOS will be, I guess, in 12 different car manufacturer models next year. I was wondering if you could talk a little
bit about that opportunity, whether it's a licensed opportunity, what's the strategic relevance of that, if you're willing to.
Thanks.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: I'm sorry, I couldn't hear that question.
<Q - Tavis C. McCourt>: I think at the developers conference, there was a comment about iOS being built into a
number of car manufacturer models for next year. And so, I wondered if you could talk about kind of the strategic
relevance for that, or what the business model might be for that for Apple.
<A - Timothy D. Cook>: It's – I see it as very important. It is a part of the ecosystem. And so, just like the App Store
is a key part of the ecosystem and iTunes and all of our content are key, and the services we provide from Messaging to
Siri and so forth, having something in the automobile is very, very important. It's something that people want, and I
think that Apple can do this in a unique way and better than anyone else. So it's a key focus for us.
<Q - Tavis C. McCourt>: Okay. Thank you.
