Lamberto Andreotti
Thank you, John. Good morning, everyone.
Our fourth quarter completing a year, a good year, it was very significant with respect to the evolution of Bristol-Myers
Squibb into a specialty care biopharma company. We transitioned away from Plavix and Avapro. We continue to grow
our key brands. We shifted our activity focus in early R&D while advancing nivolumab, the hep C portfolio, and the
rest of our late-stage pipelines. We enhanced our geographical balance, and we initiated the sale of our diabetes
business. Taken together, these developments and changes not only set the stage for 2014; importantly, they also
represent the foundation upon which we continue to build our future as a specialty care leader.
I know well that everybody's attention is understandably on our immuno-oncology assets and programs. And so
Charlie, Francis, and I will talk about them, and together with Giovanni we will answer your questions. But I would
like first to take a few minutes to speak about the rest, starting with some of our foundational products, all of which are
growing in importance and growing in terms of global reach.
Sprycel and Orencia both had a spectacular year. Last quarter they grew by 30% and 22% respectively, despite very
competitive markets. For the full year, Sprycel sales increased 26% as well as Orencia increased 23%. And for Sprycel,
we presented important Phase III data in December at the American Society of Hematology.
Also, Baraclude had strong performance, with 10% growth for the year and 14% during the fourth quarter. As we move
into 2014, we will continue to invest behind these three assets, Sprycel, Orencia, and Baraclude.
We also remain firmly committed, very committed to Eliquis and, together with Pfizer, have decided to increase our
resources behind it. We have been seeing encouraging trends for Eliquis in the U.S. and internationally, with strong
growth in the last quarter, and we are confident in its potential. And we are also hoping to expand the label of Eliquis.
In Europe, VTE prevention has already been approved, and we are expecting approval for DTE treatment as well. In
the U.S., we are expecting approval for both indications this year.
And finally, to complete my comments on key market brands, our immuno-oncology product, Yervoy, had a strong
year, with 36% growth. Based on this strong performance, as well as the long-term survival data we presented last year,
we increasingly believe in the transformational potential of immunotherapy and Yervoy as a cornerstone of that
approach.
On the regulatory and clinical development front, I've already mentioned the development for Eliquis in the hepatitis C
area. In Japan we filed late last year our dual-regimen containing daclatasvir and our protease inhibitor, asunaprevir. I
hope we will soon get trade names here. It isn't easy to pronounce these generic names, which really gives us the
opportunity to bring the first all-oral hepatitis C regimen to market in Japan.
We also recently announced the filing of daclatasvir in Europe and we expect to file in the U.S. by midyear. Francis
will talk soon about our good achievements and exciting plans in immuno-oncology, where we want to achieve and
maintain a leadership position.
Taken as a whole, I'm optimistic about our business and the opportunity we have. We will manage the diabetes
transition and all the other many changes we are implementing, while executing against a number of operational
priorities, namely: building on the launch of Eliquis and on the double-digit growth of Yervoy, Orencia, Sprycel, and
Baraclude; continuing the good performance of our other inline brands such as Reyataz and Sustiva; investing to
deliver our late-stage immuno-oncology, oncology, and hep C pipeline and launching new products; and continuing to
take a disciplined approach to capital allocation. In so doing, we will continue to pursue the balanced approach that is at
the center of Bristol-Myers Squibb's success, a balanced approach of delivering today while setting the stage for

tomorrow.
So with that, let me turn it over to Francis to talk about immuno-oncology.
Francis M. Cuss
Thank you, Lamberto, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide an update on immuno-oncology.
During the fourth quarter, we presented some early but encouraging data in lung cancer at the World Conference on
Lung Cancer. Long-term follow-up results in the lung cancer cohort of the expanded Phase I dose-ranging
monotherapy study – that's 003 – showed sustained activity in heavily pretreated patients in non-small cell lung cancer,
with one-year and two-year survival rates of 42% and 24% respectively across the dose cohorts. These early data
support our approach and belief that durability of response and long-term survival are important measures for patients
and are key in characterizing the benefits of immuno-oncology agents. We expect to present updated data for lung
cancer and other tumor types at ASCO this year.
Let me broadly review our strategy in lung cancer. Our approach in lung cancer is to include multiple lines of therapy,
different histologies, the use of biomarkers, and potentially, therapy with monotherapy and combinations, all of which
together result in a very comprehensive development program. We expect to have data in the first part of 2014 from our
third-line Phase II study in squamous non-small cell lung cancer, for which there is no defined standard of care. As we
have said before, if the results of the study demonstrate a favorable benefit/risk profile, we plan to discuss the data with
the FDA and other health authorities.
We expect to have data later in 2014 from two ongoing second-line Phase III trials in non-small cell lung cancer, one in
squamous and one in non-squamous. And finally, as many of you have seen, we recently posted on ClinicalTrials.gov a
first-line Phase III trial with nivolumab monotherapy in lung cancer that will start soon.
With regard to the Phase I combination trial of nivolumab and ipilimumab, it's worth noting that this is a Phase I trial
that's still ongoing in multiple cohorts of patients and with several dose combinations being evaluated to determine how
we could move forward with a combination regimen for lung cancer. Based on our assessment of the preliminary data
that we now have in-house, we will continue the cohorts of patients with lung cancer treated with ipilimumab and
nivolumab combinations before beginning a registrational study. Our next steps include awaiting more mature data
from additional cohorts in the study and potentially exploring different doses and regimens and specific patient
populations.
In summary in lung cancer, we continue to progress a very comprehensive program that will generate important data
from three potentially registrational trials during 2014. In addition, we continue to explore combinations as well as
initiating the first-line Phase III monotherapy study that I mentioned earlier.
Our melanoma program is ongoing, with three potentially registrational trials currently underway, one in Yervoy
failures and the other two in previously untreated patients as monotherapy and in combination with Yervoy, with a
focus on demonstrating value through survival benefits.
In renal cell cancer, our Phase III trial is focused on metastatic disease comparing nivolumab to everolimus in patients
who have received prior therapy. Earlier trials are exploring the potential role of biomarkers in this tumor type as well
as nivolumab combinations in first-line renal cell cancer. We have some initial data from the Phase I study of
nivolumab and Yervoy. We're encouraged by the results, which we plan to present at ASCO. And we believe that we
are close to determining a dose and schedule to use in registrational trials.
In addition to nivolumab programs I've already highlighted, we continue to explore its use in additional solid tumor
types and in hematological malignancies. As you may have seen in ClinicalTrials.gov, we are initiating large Phase II
trials in glioblastoma and in both follicular and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. We also have a broad portfolio of
exploratory immunotherapeutic agents with varying immune mechanisms of action that allow us to explore multiple
combinations, including our anti-LAG-3 antibody, which entered the clinic in the last quarter.

So in closing, let me reiterate our excitement about the possibilities in immuno-oncology. I believe that we are well
positioned with a broad and comprehensive program. I'm looking forward to seeing more data as the year progresses.
We'll certainly know a lot more about nivolumab a year from now. At the same time, we will continue to invest
significantly in the multiple opportunities we see across our broader immuno-oncology portfolio.
Now let me turn it over to Charlie.
Charles A. Bancroft
Thank you, Francis, and good morning, everyone.
Overall, we had a solid fourth quarter, which gives us the strong foundation for our future as a specialty care biopharma
company. Let me provide a few highlights.
Yervoy sales grew 23% to $260 million. In the U.S., quarterly demand reached its highest level since launch, and we
are seeing encouraging weekly trends as well. Despite the multiple clinical trials enrolling melanoma patients, U.S.
sales rose 14% from the previous quarter to $148 million. We are seeing particularly strong growth in the community
setting, which represents about 60% of Yervoy sales in the U.S., as a growing number of physicians appreciate
Yervoy's long-term survival benefit.
In Europe, we are seeing strong uptake, particularly in France, Italy, and Germany. We expect a November EU
approval for the first-line use in advanced melanoma to allow a broader set of patients to benefit from this innovative
medicine.
Eliquis sales were $71 million. We continue to make significant progress among cardiologists. Overall in the U.S,
access is in a much better position as we enter 2014 for both commercial and Medicare Part D plans. Eliquis also
performed well outside the U.S., with international sales reaching $23 million in the quarter. Following several key
reimbursement decisions in Q4, Eliquis is now available and reimbursed in every major market in Europe. Our
increased medical education activities and DTC advertising, which will continue in 2014, are helping us educate
physicians about Eliquis's differentiated profile. We will be making additional investments this year as we prepare for
potential expanded indications in VTE prevention and treatment.
Orencia sales grew 22% to $397 million. Orencia continues to perform well in the U.S. and Europe, even as the RA
market becomes increasingly crowded. Growth of the sub-Q [subcutaneous] formulation has been strong for several
quarters, and we are also investing appropriately to continue driving the IV business. Orencia sub-Q is now the third
most widely prescribed sub-Q agent in the U.S., with sales up 51% versus the prior year's quarter. Sales growth in
Europe was also strong as we continue to build on the sub-Q launch.
Baraclude sales grew 14% to $412 million. Sales were strong across the globe. Despite growing competition, Baraclude
remains the standard of care in naive patients in chronic hepatitis B and is of particular importance in Asia due to the
epidemiology. Our success with Baraclude demonstrates our ability to leverage our expertise in virology to develop and
commercialize innovative medicines at a global level, a capability that is important in establishing our hepatitis C
portfolio.
Sprycel sales rose 30% to $365 million. We continue to see sales growth being driven by sustained adoption in the
first-line setting as well as by our leading share in the second-line segment.
In addition to the solid sales performance of our key brands, revenues benefited from several one-time items, including
a $38 million adjustment to our managed Medicaid accrual, mostly for Plavix, as well as a $30 million year-end true-up
of our share of Atripla revenues.
To wrap up sales, you are all aware that we expect this will be the last time we report a full quarter of sales for the
diabetes franchise due to the expected closing of the diabetes divestiture to AstraZeneca later this quarter. Moving
forward, we expect that substantially all royalties we receive will be included on the other income and expense line.

Now, let me highlight a few items from the rest of our non-GAAP P&L. Gross margin was 73.6% during the quarter,
which is down 280 basis points compared to the same period last year. This is mostly due to the change in our
contracted share of Abilify revenues in the U.S., and to a lesser extent product mix. Gross margin also benefited from
some of the one-time items that impacted revenues as well.
Marketing, selling, and admin expenses were about $1.1 billion, down 7%, as our increased investments in Eliquis, the
diabetes franchise, and prelaunch assets in immuno-oncology and hep C were offset by steeper declines in the
pharmacy, our share of expenses for Abilify, and lower spending on more mature brands. Our non-GAAP tax rate was
17.9% during the quarter.
Moving to guidance, we are confirming our non-GAAP EPS guidance range of $1.65 to $1.80. Both our GAAP and
non-GAAP guidance assume that the sale of the diabetes business to AstraZeneca closes during the first quarter. We
are not able to provide line item guidance at this time but expect to be able to do so once the diabetes transaction has
closed. This will happen during our Q1 call in April. Qualitatively, as I've indicated previously, while total commercial
costs in 2014 are expected to decrease compared to 2013 due to the diabetes transaction, we will be making significant
incremental investments behind our key and future growth opportunities, including immuno-oncology, Eliquis, and hep
C.
Now we'd be happy to address your questions.
John E. Elicker
Thanks, Charlie, Francis, and Lamberto. Shannon, I think we're ready to go to Q&A now. I'd just remind everybody
that in addition to Lamberto, Francis, and Charlie, Giovanni is here as well. Shannon?

[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Tony Butler with Barclays.
<Q - C. Anthony Butler>: Thanks very much. I'll leave immuno-oncology to others and ask about elotuzumab,
Francis. And would we anticipate the Phase III readout in relapsing patients in multiple myeloma to occur at ASCO?
Second question is actually around – and I apologize for the second question but [audio gap] (18:45) op margins,
Charlie, is there anything that you could say about that in the post-diabetes world? Thank you.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: So there will be an update at ASCO, I believe, on the Phase II study on relapsing – sorry, on
the multiple myeloma at ASCO. But we're expecting data on the Phase III study later, of course.
<A - Charles A. Bancroft>: I think I understood your question, Tony, regarding gross margin moving forward. Gross
margin is always dependent upon product mix. And you recall that the diabetes business was a relatively low gross
margin business because we paid the share of margin through the cost of goods line to AstraZeneca. So we therefore
expect our 2014 gross margin rate to benefit going forward. Again, depending upon the timing of the close, that may
impact it, but I would imagine it's going to be in the neighborhood of slightly above 75%.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, Tony, for the questions. Can we go to the next question, Shannon?

We'll move next to Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Tim Minton Anderson>: Thank you very much. In the past, you've described PD-L1 expression as maybe not

meaningful. And at the same time in October at World Lung, your data showed no real difference based on biomarker
expression. Yet here you are now starting CHECKMATE 026. I'm trying to square why you're initiating this new trial.
And then can you tell us what percent of non-small cell patients are high expressers of PD-L1 using your cutoff
criteria? If I look at the Merck and Roche data, it suggests maybe it's 25%. And building onto that, if PD-L1 expression
ends up being a predictive biomarker, wouldn't it be reasonable to assume that this could end up limiting the number of
patients that would be deemed eligible for therapy?
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Thank you, Tim. So let me – first of all to say that us starting a first-line study of non-small
cell lung biomarker-rich is very consistent with our overall very broad lung strategy, as I just articulated. In addition, I
think we've always said in terms of a biomarker strategy that we would look very carefully at all patients, and we
collect tumors from all patients and we do PD-L1 expression on that. And our goal is to better understand the impact of
PD-L1 expression, not just on the overall response rate, but on overall survival.
And while I think there has been this directional data that shows that PD-L1 expression tends to be related to high
response rates, it's certainly by no means clear to all of us all the time because we just don't have the data about whether
that will hold for all lines of therapy and all different tumors. But I think in the case of this first-line, it's very important
for us in this study to enrich the patient population for this particular study. So as you are well aware, we have
second-line studies ongoing where we were also collecting PD-L1 expression data, and it's very important for us to try
and offer opportunities for patients who aren't just PD-L1 positive. So of course, that will provide the data for that also.
I'm not going to comment on our particular percentages. Obviously, different biomarker immuno-histochemistry may
be slightly different between different companies. But again, I want to reiterate that our long-term aim in our lung
cancer program is to offer, if the data supports it, the opportunity for all patients, whether they're PD-L1 positive or
negative, to have the opportunity of immuno-oncology treatment, whether it's monotherapy or combination. Thank you.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, Tim, next question please, Shannon.
Operator
We'll move next to David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Thanks very much. So I have a question on PD-1 for Francis. I'm just hoping to better
understand the assessment process you'll go through with CHECKMATE 012, and so I guess two specific questions on
that. First, can you talk about the addition of the lower dose nivo-plus-ipi one milligram-plus-one milligram cohort last
fall and whether you really need to see those results before you can start nivo-plus-ipi Phase III combo in lung at some
point down the line? And then second, what data should we expect at ASCO from CHECKMATE 012 and also in other
cancers beyond lung?
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: So, David, let me say that we added the additional one milligram-and-one milligram cohort
back in September to ensure that we would have the full complement of safety and activity data across multiple doses.
And as I said, we will be assessing that dose together with the potentially other regimens and patient populations before
we determine how to proceed into registrational studies with the combination.
Regarding the data at ASCO, there will be data on CHECKMATE 012, which is on this combination of the different
cohorts, depending on how it's matured. And just to remind you, of course, that this is an ongoing Phase I trial where
we're going to continue the cohorts to collect data, so it would be updated at ASCO. And there will also be data at
ASCO on the 003 study, the update on that. There will also be an update on 004, which is the combination in
melanoma, as well as data on the renal cell carcinoma, both our Phase II study and the data on the combination that I
just talked about. So it will be a considerable amount of information at ASCO across many of our ongoing trials and
some that you'll be hearing for the first time.

We'll move next to Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. Francis, is there any question in your mind as to whether or not you move the combo
lung into a Phase III trial, or is it just you're still assessing what you have, the multiple cohorts in that trial, and at some
point you'll make the decision? I'm just curious to know. Is there a risk that you don't move forward at all with that?
And then secondly on the hematological indications, I noticed you just started two Phase II studies. Can you give us
some sense as to your confidence level on that new indication? I suppose that's based on the Phase I trials that you
started last year. And when do you think we will see data in hematological indications? Will it be sometime this year?
And maybe if you could comment too on – the market has been very focused on renal, lung, and melanoma. What other
tumor types are you guys most excited about? Thanks.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Let me see to make sure I get to all those. So just to be clear, I don't think the data – we are
indeed assessing the data before we can decide how to proceed into registration studies. I don't think the data to date
changes our belief of the potential for combinations somewhere in a broad lung program. I don't think we have the data
to be sure exactly where that is at the moment, but that's evolving.
As far as the hematological studies, we will be presenting data at ASH later in the year on those exploratory
hematological studies. And I think ...
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: Other tumors.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Yes, so beyond those other tumors, as you know, we have a lot of exploratory studies at the
moment. I think I would say that we are very encouraged by the hematological. The fact that we are studying some
larger Phase II studies reflects I think our interest in that area and, of course, the unmet need around glioblastoma
multiforme again is reflected going forward with a study both looking at seeing if monotherapy or a combination there.
Thank you.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, Jami. Can we go to the next question please, Shannon?
Operator
We'll move next to Seamus Fernandez with Leerink.
<Q - Seamus C. Fernandez>: Thanks for the questions. Not to continue on immuno-oncology, but it is pretty
important. As we think about the kidney cancer opportunity, particularly in combination, the bar in the front-line setting
seems to be relatively high, at least in terms of response rates and even the duration of effect. So given the fact that
your communication on the combination in kidney cancer appears to be a little bit better formed than your conclusion
in lung cancer, can you just update us and maybe give us a little bit of your thoughts on the kind of benefit that you
would hope to see from a front-line kidney cancer combination given the current standard of care?
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: So I think let me say that you'll have the opportunity to see the data when we share it at
ASCO. Clearly, the bar is high for first-line treatments, but we are encouraged by the data that we've seen. And in due
course, we'll be initiating a trial, a potentially registrational trial in renal cell. And obviously, we're going to be very
thoughtful about which line of therapy that will be applicable to. So I'd suggest you wait and see what we show at
ASCO, and I think that will be very informative.

<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys, thanks a lot for taking the question and thanks for tolerating all of us pounding
on immunotherapy. I think I might do the same, I appreciate it. Are you able to tell us in any qualitative sense, Francis,
whether or not you saw enhanced efficacy in one or more of the Yervoy-plus-nivo arms in the CHECKMATE 012 trial,
just any kind of qualitative sense? I interpreted your remarks that you're continuing those arms as a remark reflecting
some optimism. But I was just wondering if you could just confirm that there was to some degree enhanced efficacy,
and obviously we'll wait to get the details.
And then on the World Lung data, this will be the last question for me. On the World Lung data, I know it was a while
ago now. I'm not sure if I've ever gotten your perspective on this. But the one-year 42% survival, but especially the
two-year 24% overall survival, what is your view on that 24% number in particular versus what one would expect
typically? Thanks a lot, I really appreciate it.

tell you that this morning John and others have asked me to keep quiet during this call and be very understanding of the
importance of immuno-oncology and the number of questions that are going to be asked today. So it is important; we
understand the value of immuno-oncology and the value of immuno-oncology to Bristol-Myers Squibb. So we are very
open to answer questions, but obviously we cannot always go into many, many details. But you would be interested in
knowing that it is probably premature for us to disclose. But again, we will continue to make available as many
comments as possible, but we will try to try to stay away from commenting on different pieces of information. And we
remain very, very proud of the breadth of our program and the importance of what we are doing here; and now, Francis,
back to you.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: So I won't comment anymore on the ipi-nivo combination in CHECKMATE 012. But just to
your point about the World Lung data, I think we said at the time and I'll say it again. We're encouraged about that
survival data, the landmark survival data at two years, particularly because it was across all doses. I missed the end of
your question, but I think what you were asking was how that might relate to other studies we have ongoing. And I
think it's fair to say that it's very difficult to extrapolate simply because the patient populations are quite different. Let
me stop there.
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: This is Giovanni. The only thing I would add is clearly lung, if you compare it with
melanoma, is a much larger population of patients, very diverse population of patients. The unmet medical need is very
high, and you know all of the therapies and combination approaches that have failed over the last many years. So we
see that as a very significant opportunity. And given the size and complexity of the disease, there is a significant
commercial opportunity when looking differentially at different segments in lung, not only first-line but also later lines
of therapy, different oncology – different histologies and different patient groups. They're all very meaningful
commercial opportunities, even when you look at them independently.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, Mark. Can we go to the next question, please?

We'll move next to Andrew Baum with Citi.
<Q - Andrew S. Baum>: Yes, good morning, a couple questions. To what extent do the emergent immunodiagnostics
enable you to select out a group of patients for whom the combination makes sense, both from a safety point of view as
well as from an efficacy point of view? Second question is, perhaps you could give us some timelines on when you
think you may be able to initiate a Phase III trial for the combination.
And then finally, with regard to the choice of a PD-L1 population for your Phase III, to what extent does PD-L1
expression increase after subsequent lines of therapy; i.e., do you need to enrich in the front-line because
treatment-naive patients may have lower levels of PD-L1 expression compared to patients who have got
chemoradiotherapy? Is there any evidence for that in lung?

<A - Francis M. Cuss>: So just to go back to your first question about how we selected the combination based on the
diagnostic, I think as I mentioned, we are collecting information in both PD-L1 positive and PD-L1 negative patients.
And of course, that's part of the assessment, at least in these preliminary studies, to try and understand where the safety
and efficacy goes as far as that's concerned. I'm not going to talk about the timelines of the potential progression in the
combination of the lung simply because, as I said, the trial is still ongoing. We're still assessing the data. And of course,
it will depend on that data as to what we do next.
I think it's a good question about what does line of therapy do to the PD-L1 expression. And certainly, we are collecting
that data to try and understand that better. I don't think we have that information laid out at the moment, but I do think
it will be important to see. And of course, we do have the opportunity because we are looking very broadly, first of all,
across lung, but actually against many other tumors as well to try to begin to understand some of the kinetics of PD-L1
expression, both with other non-IO therapies and with IO therapies. Thank you.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, Andrew. Could we go to the next question please, Shannon?

We'll go next to Marc Goodman with UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Good morning. First on Eliquis in the U.S., obviously a big jump from last quarter to this
quarter; I was just curious. Is that all demand or was there anything else going on in the quarter? Second on Sprycel,
obviously very strong growth there; can you give us a sense of what's going on behind the scenes with market share? Is
that where the growth is coming from, or what would you attribute it to? And then on hep C in Japan, you had
mentioned, obviously, and we know that you filed already. What is your expectation for when that will be approved in
Japan and start to have sales? Do you assume sales in your guidance for this year?
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: Actually, Giovanni, why don't you take over the question?
<A - Giovanni Caforio>: Yes, let me start from the performance of Eliquis. We had a strong quarter in Q4. That was
clearly true in the U.S. We had good developments outside the U.S. as well. With respect to the U.S., what you saw in
terms of the numbers broadly reflects an improvement in performance and demand. And when you look at TRx growth
in the U.S., in Q4 our TRx volume grew by 66%. Our NBRx volume grew by 50% versus the previous quarter. And we
saw a good increase in shares, particularly in the cardiology setting.
.
So I would say that the performance is really related to demand. And it is the result of the acceleration plan that we had
put in place beginning in August, which we discussed before, which was really centered on strengthening and focusing
our strategy and messages, significantly increasing our investment in medical education, and third, initiating in
September a very broad DTC campaign in the U.S. All of those things seem to have had an impact on performance, and
Q4 was a good quarter.
With respect to Sprycel, we do have very strong performance and good trends across the world, in the U.S., in Europe.
We had a very, very good quarter in Japan as well, and that is coming from two things. First of all, from a total market
perspective, we continue to see a decline in the use the Gleevec and the growth of the second-generation TKIs. Among
second-generation TKIs, particularly in the U.S., in the last quarter Sprycel was the fastest growing agent. And we
continue to have a leadership position in first-line and the second-line among the second-generation TKIs. We have a
strong presence in second-line, but a lot of our growth is really coming from increased penetration and increased
market share in first-line.
With respect to Japan and hepatitis C, we communicated where we are from a regulatory perspective. All I can say
from a commercial perspective is that we are working as a priority to be ready for launch when we get approval.
Obviously, we will be executing very rapidly the launch in Japan.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, Marc. Can we go to the next question, please, Shannon?

We'll take our next question from Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Great, thanks very much, just two ones coming back on nivo. First, on the lung combo,
should we think about additional cohorts being added to CHECKMATE 012 based on this data that you have recently
received, or at this point are we just really waiting for data from the existing cohorts before making a decision on
potentially moving that forward? And the second question was on nivo with Avastin. Is that something that you've seen
at this point, and how are you thinking about the potential of the use of Avastin with nivo in lung? Thanks very much.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: So as far as the lung combo cohorts, it is possible we may add more cohorts, Chris, but that's
under consideration. And I think I would say just a general comment about combinations. While obviously we focus
very much on immuno-oncology combinations, we haven't certainly ruled out having combinations where we feel it's
appropriate and there could be some benefit.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, Chris. Could we go to the next question, please, Shannon?

We'll go next to Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: Yes, thank you for taking the question. Just to clarify one thing for me in terms of the
CHECKMATE 063 data, is that something you have in-house at this point? And I think you mentioned before because
it may be registrational that we get a top line press release on that. Would you do a top line whether you do or do not
decide to file that? I'm just trying to get a sense of expectations on that. Thanks.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: So yes, just to clarify, you're talking about the third-line Phase II study in non-small cell lung
squamous, right?
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: I think that's it.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Okay, you caught on. So as I said but let me reiterate because it's important, we are in regular
contact with the FDA. We are expecting the data in the first part of this year. And depending on the data, we will
obviously be having further discussions with the FDA. But the hope would be for a submission, assuming the data is
appropriate.
<A - John E. Elicker>: And I think from a disclosure standpoint, Vamil, we have to wait and see what the data looks
like. There's a materiality discussion certainly with our general counsel and legal group. There's the need to preserve
the ability to present at ASCO, so there's coordination with ASCO. And then there are competitive dynamics as well.
So I think it's premature to commit to any kind of disclosure one way or the other.
Could we go to the next question, please, Shannon?

We'll go next to Gregg Gilbert with Bank of America.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Yes, thanks. I have two. First for Lamberto, clearly immuno-oncology is really exciting for your
company. But I think it's also fair to say your market cap assumes pretty significant success in future years already. So
my question is, do you see, as CEO, an opportunity to use your significant market cap to diversify into other exciting
areas if the right opportunities come along?

And my follow-up for Charlie is about your mature and other products line, obviously a pretty big chunk of business.
Any key variables we should think about that within that over the next year or so? Thanks.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: Let me see. We have been saying that business development is a top priority for our
capital allocation. Soon we will receive at the closing with the deal with AstraZeneca, we will receive a significant
amount of money here in the U.S. from AstraZeneca. There is an upfront payment plus the milestone related to the
approval of Farxiga in the U.S. So we will have additional cash available for business development.
As you correctly said, we have shares that are valued I'd say nicely, and therefore we could use those shares also for
BD. We will continue to – we continue – this is not the future. We continue today looking at the various opportunities.
And those opportunities are in both immuno-oncology and outside of immuno-oncology. So when you think about our
priorities, the priorities in business development are in the same areas where we are developing our own programs or
areas that are very close to those areas. Charlie, on the mature brands?
<A - Charles A. Bancroft>: So, Gregg, on mature brands, it is a catch-all for all of our non-core promoted brands, and
we have the normal older off-patent as well as some OTC brands, particularly in Europe and the market there is France.
But we also have some growth products, like metformin in China, for example. We record Symlin sales there, which
will go away with the diabetes business. And we also record things like our Medarex royalties that we get from that
acquisition. And then also we have a couple of collaborations with Reckitt for some OTC brands in Latin America, and
Medicines Company, which was our old Recothrom business. They have their own life cycle. And some go as those
deals come to a close, that will have a more significant impact on the mature brands, but generally this is a declining
business.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, Gregg. Can we go to the next question, please, Shannon?
Operator
We'll move next to Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Good morning, hi, and congratulations on a great 2013. Francis, on CHECKMATE 026, many
experts think that PD-L1 expression is dynamic. So the question is have there been any advances in being able to
reliably identify PD-L1 positive patients? And to follow up, if I may, can you please give us some more clarity on the
timeline for the LAG-3 data? You had mentioned it entered the clinic last quarter, and perhaps more clarity on the
timeline for the other immunotherapies to enter the clinic. Thank you.
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: Thank you, Alex. So talking about the first-line lung, I think the goal of making it PD-L1
positive is to enrich the population. And of course, obviously if it changes subsequently, that will be taken into account
in terms of what the data is at the end. But I think we have the opportunity here to, as I said when I go back, there's a
very broad strategy around biomarkers here. There's a lot we don't know about biomarkers. We're learning all the time.
I think we have a great opportunity over the next year or two, as our data matures, to have a much better idea of the
kinetics of the PD-L1 expression and how it might relate to overall survival, not just response rate. And I want to
reiterate again, I think it's important; that our aim is to be able to provide, if we have the data to support it, a treatment
for patients who are PD-L1 negative also, whether in lung, melanoma, or any other tumor. So it's a very broad program.
We're generating the data, and I think it's rather early yet to speculate too much about what might happen. We want to
get the data.
Now, as far as our other IO combinations, many trials ongoing; as I mentioned, LAG-3 entered the clinic last quarter. I
think it's very early to make any predictions yet, but obviously it's very exciting. And perhaps more importantly, we
have combinations of nivo with IL-21 and our anti-KIR monoclonal antibody. So I think you will be seeing data over
the next year or two on those, but it's too early to give you an exact timing.
<A - John E. Elicker>: Thanks, Shannon. I think we have time for one more question.

We'll go next to Steve Scala with Cowen & Company.
<Q - Stephen M. Scala>: Thank you and I have two questions. So, Francis, in your prepared comments, you referred
to Yervoy as the cornerstone of your immuno-oncology franchise, and I'm focusing now on the word cornerstone. I
think most immune oncologists view PD-1 as necessary and fundamental to modulate and therefore the cornerstone. So
it seems to me that Bristol is not absolutely convinced that PD-1 is a key component and a cornerstone. Am I correctly
characterizing the Bristol view?
And the second question is on the settlement with Apotex for Sprycel. Can you be more specific on when generics can
launch? Thank you.
<A - Lamberto Andreotti>: Steve, this is Lamberto. My Italian accent should be recognized when I use the expression
"cornerstone" for Yervoy. It was probably not appropriate to say "the cornerstone". I don't know if I said that. It should
be "a cornerstone". So now to answer your question more directly, PD-1 is a cornerstone for immunotherapy. And we
are very committed to it and we are very convinced that we can deliver important data with PD-1 in the various tumors
that we assign. Do you want to add anything, Francis?
<A - Francis M. Cuss>: I would just add that I fully agree with Lamberto's characterization of the promise of PD-1,
and so you shouldn't misunderstand how excited we are. But on the other hand, Yervoy is approved, and I think I've
been in this business long enough to know that a bird in the hand is always worth a lot to me. So it's a very good bird to
have in the hand and it gives us a lot of opportunity to build on that I think in terms of a broader IO benefit for patients.
<A - John E. Elicker>: And, Steve, on Sprycel, I think we have at least 10 more years of market exclusivity related to
that case for Sprycel in the U.S. So with that, I'm going to turn it back over to Lamberto. Thanks, everybody, for all
your questions, and I'm really glad that Francis was able to join us this morning.
Lamberto Andreotti
Yes, Francis will need now a couple hours of rest. Let me close this call by saying that, again, 2013 was an important
year for us because we are evolving into this new leading specialty care biopharma company. I think the solid
performance of last year and the development and changes that we have delivered put us in a strong position. We have
talked a lot about immuno-oncology this morning. We are very excited about what we have in immuno-oncology. And
as I said before, we intend to maintain our leadership position in that area. But we also want to continue to evolve the
other important assets that we have in cardiovascular and hepatitis C, in biology in general, and the other areas where
we are operating. So thank you for being with us this morning and have a good day.
