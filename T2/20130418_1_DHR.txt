H. Lawrence Culp
Matt, thanks, and good morning, everyone. Before we start, I'd like to take a moment to let our associates, our friends
and the people of Boston know that they are in our thoughts in the wake of this week's most tragic and unfortunate
news.
We entered the quarter with modest expectations regarding global growth and that played out largely as we anticipated
with our core revenue growth coming in at 1%. From a geographic perspective, high-growth markets, which represent
24% of our business, grew at a high-single digit rate in the quarter. China was up low-double digits led again by our
Dental and Life Sciences & Diagnostics businesses which grew in excess of 20%. Also encouraging was the
double-digit growth we saw in our Water Quality and Product Identification businesses in China. In contrast, sales in
the U.S. were flat which was slightly below our outlook, while Western Europe, as expected, was down low-single
digits.
Despite this low-growth environment, the Danaher Business System continues to help us drive share gains, margin and
cash flow. In the quarter, DBS growth tools helped accelerate new product introductions across many of our businesses
and coupled with our go-to-market initiatives, we believe drove share gains at Kerr, Videojet, ChemTreat, Tektronix
Communications, ESCO and Radiometer. We were encouraged by our strong gross margin performance, up 50 basis
points or $90 million year-over-year to 52.3%, which allowed us to sustain our core growth investments in both new
product development and sales and marketing.
We remain active and optimistic on the M&A front. We announced the signing of over $300 million of new
acquisitions during the quarter. With our strong free cash flow, ample balance sheet capacity and the proceeds from the
recent sale of the Apex Tool's JV, we now expect to have about $8 billion available for capital deployment over the
next two years.
So with that as a backdrop, let me move to the details of the quarter. Today we reported first quarter adjusted diluted
net earnings per share of $0.75, up 2.5% relative to the comparable amount in the first quarter of last year and
representing another record first quarter for Danaher. Excluding the impact on prior-year earnings of the Apex JV, net
earnings per share increased 6%.
Revenues for the quarter increased 3% to $4.4 billion with core revenues up 1%. Acquisitions increased revenues by
3% which was partially offset by negative currency translation of 1%. Our gross margin for the first quarter increased
50 basis points year-over-year to 52.3%.
Our reported operating margin in the first quarter was 16.4% with core margins up 20 basis points. First quarter
operating cash flow was $637 million with free cash flow from continuing operations of $520 million. We expect
full-year free cash flow to exceed $3 billion. Our free cash flow to net income conversion ratio, excluding the gain on
the sale of the Apex JV and the impact from $40 million of cash payments related to our fourth quarter restructuring,
was greater than 100%.

Turning to our five operating segments. Test & Measurement revenues increased 1% for the quarter while core
revenues were flat. While core margins were down 25 basis points year-on-year, segment margins saw a significant
sequential improvement over the prior two quarters.
Fluke core revenues grew at a low-single digit rate, their first quarter of positive core growth since the fourth quarter
2011. Mid-single digit growth in North American industrial end markets and high-single digit growth in high growth
markets was partially offset by softness in Europe and in other North American markets.
Last quarter we highlighted Fluke's launch of the VT02 visual thermometer, which you may have heard about as it was
featured in March in a broad, nationwide Grainger radio campaign. Using DBS growth tools Fluke identified a white
space opportunity in an adjacent product category and developed this innovative entry price point temperature
measurement tool with an integrated visual heat map to meet customer needs. We've been encouraged by the sales
ramp of the VT02 in both the U.S. and Europe.
At Tektronix, core revenues declined at a low double digit rate with continued weakness across many end markets.
Despite difficult market conditions we continue to innovate and increase the breadth of our product portfolio at
Tektronix. During the quarter we launched the multi-phase PA4000 power analyzer which will be used by engineers on
the bench for the development of high efficiency electrical products such as motors for hybrid vehicles, electric
vehicles and household appliances. This innovative new product is Tektronix' initial entry into this adjacent high
growth segment.
Core revenues from our Communications businesses grew at a low-double digits rate in the quarter driven by demand
for both our enterprise tools and network security solutions globally. Tektronix Communications' low-teens growth was
driven by demand for its mobile carrier network management solutions in North American and China. Arbor Networks
network security solutions remain in very high demand as DDoS attacks have increased in both frequency and size.
Both sales and orders increased greater than 25% in the quarter, as we won several new service provider accounts in
high-growth markets and saw strong growth in our U.S. Enterprise business.
Environmental segment revenues increased 4.5% in the quarter, with core revenues up 1%. Core operating margins
expanded 45 basis points, with reported operating margin flat at 18.6%. Water Quality core revenues grew at a
low-single digit rate in the quarter. Hach Lange core revenues grew low-single digits, with double-digit growth in
China and the Middle East offsetting flat demand in the developed markets. Healthy North American industrial activity,
particularly in beverage and power, was partially offset by weaker U.S. municipal demand.
ChemTreat marked their eleventh straight quarter of double-digit core revenue growth. Latin American core revenues
were up mid-teens in the quarter, as expansion efforts into the Mexican market continued to gain traction, including
several large wins in the quarter with Industrial accounts. Over the last four years, the Mexican business has grown
over 300% driven by their best-in-class go-to-market initiatives.
Gilbarco Veeder-Root's first quarter core revenues were essentially flat in both the developed and high-growth markets
with strong growth in Russia and India offset by a difficult comparison from prior-year regulatory changes.
We saw solid growth in our Payment business in the quarter, with shipments on several large-scale rollouts throughout
Asia. New payment technologies and innovations at retail service stations and convenience stores is an attractive
growth driver for GVR. Highlighting this during the quarter, GVR announced a partnership with PayPal to develop
digital payment and other mobile solutions for customers worldwide. Using GVR's Passport POS, customers will be
able to pay using their PayPal account with their mobile devices, eliminating the need to carry cash or credit cards.
Moving to Life Sciences & Diagnostics. Revenues for the quarter increased 1.5% with core revenues up 2.5%. Segment
core operating margins increased slightly, while our reported operating margin decreased 60 basis points from the
prior-year period to 12.7%. Our Diagnostics businesses saw a good start to the year with mid-single digit core growth.
At Beckman Coulter, core sales increased at a low-single digit rate, despite the impact of one less day in the quarter,
with growth in all major product categories. This marks the fourth straight quarter of low-single digit or better core
growth at Beckman, with high-growth markets continuing to drive this performance. Beckman's best-in-class

automation capabilities, an increase in the cadence of new product development and the significant quality and service
improvements we've seen over the last 18 months position them well for continued growth. We anticipate low-single
digit growth for the rest of this year and expect to be on track for mid-single digit growth in 2014.
During the quarter we launched two new products, the DxH 600 hematology system and the Power Express total lab
automation system. The DxH 600 extends the hematology portfolio to better address the needs of larger volume clinical
labs. Power Express continues to enhance Beckman's leadership in clinical automation by enabling labs to connect
multiple analyzers easily to improve workflow, increase efficiency and reduce cost.
Radiometer's core sales increased at a high-single digit rate in the quarter with growth in most major geographies and
particular strength in China and the Middle East which were both up over 30% in the quarter. Our HUT line was up
40% in the quarter and we hit a milestone with our one-thousandth instrument placement since launch. Last week we
closed the previously announced acquisition of HemoCue, a leader in hemoglobin and glucose point-of-care testing.
Leica Biosystems sales increased at a low-single digit rate in the quarter led by double digit core histology growth.
Advanced staining revenues decreased mid-single digits as solid demand in North America and China was more than
offset by a decline in Western Europe where we are transitioning from a distribution to a direct sales model in parts of
that region.
Our Life Sciences business's core revenues increased low-single digits in the quarter. AB SCIEX core sales grew
mid-single digits led by the applied and pharma markets. We've been pleased with the very strong uptake of our new
6500 Triple Quad and QTRAP systems since their launch late last year.
During the quarter, AB SCIEX announced a multi-year collaboration agreement with the Institute for Systems Biology
in Seattle for the development of new methods in technologies in proteomics research using mass spectrometry. This
research, led by 2012 National Medal of Science Award Winner, Dr. Leroy Hood, will help develop a new approach to
medical care by redefining biomarker research and complementary genomics through qualitative SWATH proteomics
analysis using the AB SCIEX 5600 TripleTOF. We're pleased to support both the ISB and Dr. Hood in this
groundbreaking research.
Leica Microsystems' core sales declined low-single digits with strong sales in Life Sciences offset by weakness in
Industrial and Medical markets. The recently launched SP8, our modular confocal laser scanning microscope, continues
to be well received globally and was a strong contributor to growth in the Life Science market during the quarter.
Turning now to Dental. Our segment revenues grew 3% in the quarter, with core revenues up 2.5%. Core operating
margin increased 20 basis points while reported operating margin expanded 40 basis points to 13.1%. Dental
consumables core revenues grew low-single digits in the quarter led by our sales for general dentistry consumables and
infection prevention products across most major geographies. In addition, our Implant business was up mid-teens.
During the quarter, Ormco launched the Lythos digital impression system. Lythos allows an orthodontist to have a
complete digital orthodontic workflow beginning with the scanning of the patient's mouth, through the creation of a 3D
treatment plan, to the custom design and manufacture of the orthodontic appliance.
KaVo core revenues increased mid-single digits with robust demand for instruments and imaging products. KaVo
launched six new products in the quarter at two of the largest trade shows in the industry, at the Chicago Midwinter
Dental Meeting and the International Dental Show in Germany.
New products include the i-CAT FLX, which allows for a full 3D scan at a lower radiation dose than a panoramic
x-ray. In addition, Instrumentarium launched a CR reader, an easy-to-use, cost effective phosphor-plate imaging reader.
We also introduced an innovative twisted file adaptive endodontic product which self-adjusts between a rotary and
reciprocating motion providing the clinician with exceptional control during root canals.
Moving to our Industrial Technology segment. Revenues increased 7% for the quarter, while core revenues declined
1.5%. Our core operating margins expanded 105 basis points in the first quarter, while our reported operating margin
increased 30 basis points to 20.9%. Our Motion businesses core revenues declined at a high-single digit rate in the
quarter with sustained weakness in most major geographies. Our sales into U.S. distribution were particularly soft.

Product Identification core revenues were up mid-single digits with growth across all major geographies. Videojet
enjoyed high-single digit growth in service and mid-single digit growth in both equipment and consumables in the first
quarter. During the quarter, we began shipping both the 1550 and the 1650 next generation CIJ printers which are
targeted primarily at customers in the food and beverage markets where predictability of uptime and avoidance of
errors is critical. Initial customer feedback has been extremely positive on these new products and we expect that
placements will continue to increase through the balance of the year.
At ESCO, core revenue increased more than 10% in the quarter led by exceptional performance in high-growth
markets, including Latin America and China. DBS continues to have a significant impact in driving growth at ESCO.
Using dynamic resource allocation to fund internally go-to-market investments in high growth markets, ESCO has
more than doubled the feet on the street in Latin America and China since our acquisition in 2011. Over the same
period, sales in those geographies have grown in excess of 35%.
Revenues at X-Rite grew at a mid-single digit rate in the first quarter compared to a year ago when it was a standalone
company. X-Rite becomes part of our reported core number later this quarter. While it's still early, we're excited about
X-Rite's contribution to the PID platform and the new collaboration and go-to-market opportunities they bring.
An example of this collaboration is the PantoneLIVE where we recently launched two illustrator plug-ins that were
co-developed with ESCO. These plug-ins provide brand owners with instant access to essential brand color standards
as well as the PantoneLIVE color libraries directly from within their development software. Reception of PantoneLIVE
in the marketplace has exceeded our expectations, with orders tripling sequentially from the fourth quarter.
So to wrap up, the year started largely as we expected. DBS has helped drive share gains, margins and cash flow in this
low growth environment. We believe our solid recurring revenue base, the structural cost actions executed in 2012 and
the significant amount of capital available to deploy position us well for the balance of this year and beyond. We are
initiating second quarter adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $0.80 to $0.85 which assumes 1% to 2%
core growth. We are also re-affirming our full-year 2013 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance of $3.32 to
$3.47.

Thanks, Larry. That concludes the formal comments. Lisa, we're ready for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Hey. Good morning.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Just starting off with the Life Sciences & Diagnostics margin was about 100 bps lighter than I
guess we were expecting. Can you just talk about a) kind of what the margin was like at Beckman and then if there was
anything else that drove that weakness?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Yeah, I think with respect to the – what you're seeing there, Steve, is we knew given some
of the investments in the segment that we were making, particularly on the sales and marketing and R&D side that
margins were going to be tight in LS&D. That said, I – and I say that both with respect to the Life Sciences &
Diagnostics businesses, as well as at Dental. We had a couple of big trade shows in Dental, for example, that we had to
work though. But that said, clearly the revenue picture in LS&D, particularly in LS, was softer in the end than we
anticipated. That certainly put some of the pressure on the margins that you see.

But also in addition to the revenue, I think it's important to point out that we had a couple of not necessarily one-time,
but I think special situations in the quarter on the expense side that we think mitigate as we go forward. One was this
conversion at Leica Bio with respect to the distribution to direct sales model. We had an opportunity to move forward
in that regard. I think that makes sense strategically. That didn't help us from a cost perspective, and frankly from a
volume perspective, as we worked through that late in the quarter. In addition, as the regulatory front evolved over the
quarter with a number of the Diagnostics businesses, we had an opportunity to accelerate some of our spending ahead
of submissions and we thought again, positioning ourselves to get those new products approved made sense, so we
went ahead and did that.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: So can you – I mean I guess R&D for the company was up 40 basis points year-over-year.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Right.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: I mean 6.7% is a really big number. What – can you let us know – I know you disclose it in your
Ks, but maybe in LS&D, what was – I would assume it was up a little bit more than the 40 basis points?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: It was. And also given the – some of this distribution transition we're going through, some of
the sales and marketing was also higher. We think that will begin to even out here in Q2, so you'll see I think more
normalized margins in LS&D in Q2.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: And can you give any kind of magnitude, Dan, around what the R&D was up as a percentage of
sales in LS&D?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: We were up combined over 100 basis points between R&D and sales and marketing as a
percent of revenue year-on-year.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. That makes – and then when you talk about these regulatory filings, I mean is this just
greater than expected spending that you – than you would have initially thought as you fixed the business? Or is this
like – are these like – is this more proactive with new products?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Steve, it's probably somewhere in between. It really is about what we do and when we do it.
So some of it's strictly timing and at the same time, as we work through the plans for those submissions with regulatory
bodies, sometimes we'll – as time marches on you get a better sense of the scope and the work required. So we thought
accelerating some of that spend was frankly an opportunity despite the pressure that you allude to here. And again, I
think the stronger those submissions are, the sooner they're in, the better off we are relative to getting those products
out and launched in time.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Great. Just one last question. It's probably a pretty stupid question but I'll ask it anyway. I
guessed with the days sales, with a comp on the – a tougher comp on the weather, a lot of noise going on out there and
some pretty terrible reports coming out so far, on a scale of one to ten, if one is 2009 and kind of ten is the ideal
operating environment, what do you think, how would you describe kind of the current environment you're operating
in? It's just hard to kind of tell how bad the trend is here. I'm just curious as to your high level take on that?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Yeah, Steve. I would say that we came into the quarter knowing that we were going to be
missing a day. I think we came into the quarter knowing that Good Friday would be the last day of the quarter, so all of
that was knowable. What we saw through the quarter was frankly that our consumables business, which as you know
represents about 40% of our overall sales, was very much in line with our expectations and if you adjust for the day that
we missed and put aside all the end-of-March noise I think we were good. I think where – when we fell a little bit short
here with respect to the quarter – was really in equipment, right? I mean that 60%, we thought we'd be up a couple
hundred basis points and that's where we got squeezed, particularly in the U.S. as we saw some business soften in
March when we thought we would finish more strongly.
I wouldn't say it's bad. I think we saw the normal uptick in March, just wasn't pronounced in equipment, again in the
U.S. principally, around some of the higher ticket products; we mentioned Tek, I think we mentioned Motion as well
and the distribution. So in the grand scheme of things I don't think we're – we're not necessarily excited about the

macro numbers that came out here the last three or four weeks but that said, we missed the top end of the core range by
about what, $30 million. If we'd hit that I don't think we would be talking about some of the OP and EPS shortfalls here
but that's the way it played out. I think at this point our sense is while it's early and we don't have everything that we'll
have in time, the shortfall's, again, largely a macro dynamic. March didn't finish as strongly as we would have
anticipated. But on a relative basis, business-by-business we think we're doing pretty well.
I think as we look at April, things have come back in a couple of pockets in the wake of some of that end of March
softness, but again probably too early to read too much into that. Certainly too early to read much into first couple
weeks of April relative to the equipment side of the business because while things get pushed to the right at times, it
may just be a couple of weeks. Sometimes those customer decisions may take longer.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Scott Davis with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Good morning, Scott.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: A couple things. I mean first the big pullback you saw in Motion was a little bit of a surprise
when you had that big of a negative. I mean were the timing issues there that customers just wanted to de-stock? I mean
I think you mentioned some weakness in distribution U.S. technology, is that something that's going to restart here in
2Q? Or we have some greater underlying weakness here that's more sustainable?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Well, I think that's – it's a bit of a mixed bag, Scott, as we read it today. I mean you
mentioned distribution and tech, I mean I think those are two different markets for us clearly where we go to market
through distribution. We saw soft-sell out, as well as our own sell-in. Certainly the [ph] tech (27:37) going in that we
deal with tend to be customers we deal with directly and we certainly saw pockets in [ph] tech (27:44) that were soft. I
think our view is that as we look at the second quarter, if you wanted to pick a segment that's likely to be down, it will
be Industrial Technologies and it'll be down largely on the back of Motion softness, certainly not softness in Product
Identification, which we think will continue to be one of our better performing businesses here in the near term.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. Want to move to two other quick things. I mean the Medical businesses have been strong
a couple quarters in a row here in China. Are you seeing any of that broadening out at all to the other businesses, like
Fluke for example? And the more shorter-cycle businesses?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Yeah, we certainly saw I think a broadening of the strength in China. Again the first quarter
is a little hard to read sequentially given the timing of the New Year there. But that said, I think we were pleased with
the overall print in China, both its depth and its breadth. And as we have worked through our reviews of late with our
teams there, I think by and large there are few exceptions where guys aren't feeling good about the year. It's really more
a matter at this point of calibrating what sort of growth to expect there so definitely, I think -- be one of our better high
growth markets here in the rest of the way.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: I'd say, Scott, on the Industrial side it was, instead of all being down or flat it was mixed. So I
guess that's a little bit encouraging. PID and water had real good starts to the year in China but I contrast that and so
that's a little bit of a positive sign but I would say that T&M and Motion didn't, their numbers were down and
sequentially did not feel any better.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay...
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: So what I mean then, you've got a couple pockets a little better.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Sure. And then just last question on price. When we have this type of a slow macro environment
– and it's been largely probably seven of the last ten years it's been a pretty good price environment – now we're seeing
some weakness in commodities. I mean, what's the outlook for price from here?

<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Well, I think the price outlook in and around a point of price as we move forward ought to
be something that we should achieve. I think on the price/cost equation, Scott, in general, we're pretty pleased. I mean,
clearly having the gross margin up 50 basis points here, $90 million in dollar terms year-on-year would suggest we're
executing pretty well, not only on the price/cost side but also in terms of productivity, our Danaher-wide procurement
activities as well as, frankly, bringing new products to market with higher gross margins which give us the benefit of
the mix up. So if there's one thing I think we're particularly comfortable with it's that effect and clearly we'll get, I
think, additional impact from the 2012 restructuring in the gross margin mix as we move through the year.

We'll take our next question from Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Thanks and good morning.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Just you mentioned $8 billion of capital available for deployment over the next two years; I
think that's up from $5 billion plus that you used to discuss. Can you maybe talk about, given the current environment,
how – where you're thinking about deploying the additional capital? And you obviously mentioned one positive
comment in the release but give us maybe more of a flavor for how this might transpire?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Steve, the $8 billion figure in contrast to the prior frame is really a function, I think, of
being on the other side of Apex. Certainly a look here at our cash position which is strong. And our view of our cash
flow now being $3 billion plus on an annual basis. And it's really, it's just that simple. I think strategically as we think
about capital deployment, our strategy is in no way changed. I think our view certainly continues to have a bias toward
inorganic growth to supplement what we do organically. And we'd like to do that across the entire Danaher portfolio.
So as you look today at the way Dan and I and the teams are working together, we're working I think funnels that are
active across all of our growth platforms. Clearly, we're keen to put that capital to work in that fashion.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: And the acquisition that you just – the $300 million one that you announced in, I guess,
February was in Life Sciences, I mean, how is the Industrial pipeline looking? Or the non-Life Sciences pipeline
looking?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Steve, I would say we're, one, encouraged by the number of discussions we're having. And I
would say it's noticeably better than it was in the second half of 2012. Probably a little bit of a challenge maybe up to
the last couple weeks given equity markets. I do think some of this more choppy economic data of late, maybe
including our own, on the margins could be helpful here in getting maybe some things across the finish line.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay. And then on the top line or the implications for the second half, I think EPS implied,
given your guide, is somewhere north of 10%, 11%. So – and top line, given your 1% to 2% in the second quarter, and
this quarter at 1% implies a very significant acceleration in the second half. How much are you thinking of, and that's
obviously despite deceleration on many, many fronts across the portfolio. How are you thinking about that being, as
opposed to just comp-based versus meaningful, material, underlying acceleration? All of these major growth
investments that you've been making for some time now. Give us maybe some flavor for how you're thinking and
talking about it and what's giving you that perspective?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Well, I don't think, Steve, that as we look into the second quarter, let alone the second half,
that we're here pounding the table that things are going to get better in a hurry. I think what we're trying to do here with
the second quarter outlook is give you a sense of our view out the window as to our operating environment and the way
that we're going to perform. If you look at the first quarter, clearly we came in the midpoint of the range on the bottom,

a little short of the range on the top.
I think that midpoint mindset, if you will, probably is what's most relevant as you think about the second quarter, let
alone the full year. I think to come in at the high end of this range would require the U.S. to get a little bit better, than at
least some of the most recent data points would suggest. And probably the strength in China would have to pick up a
bit, more so than the encouraging news that we've seen. And we probably would need to have Europe at least stabilized
rather than being down a couple ticks as it has been of late. I'm not suggesting that is our scenario. But as we look
forward in this lower growth environment, I think that mid-point mind set is probably what is most useful right now.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: And I guess on that I'm just looking for, given the many investments that you've been
making in the top – to drive the top line, if you – to what extent internally can you look at the payoff you're getting on
those top line investments? And I know it's very hard to separate it from a tough macro. But what evidence are you
seeing?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Well, I think in terms – we look at those investments one by one by one, right, at the
operating company level. So when we see the Dental team in China rapidly accelerating their growth and profitably so,
it's an easy calculation to see those feet on the street investments. When you see an uptick in R&D at Videojet, and in
turn, the flood of new products that have come out of there the last couple years. And in turn the profitable growth of
returns and the market share gains at VJ, you know you're getting a return there. So not that every investment that you
make is going to pay off, but I think by and large, where we're investing we see that return, not only in terms of the top
line and the attendant share gains, but frankly, also in the gross margins.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Thanks, Steve.

We'll take our next question from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Good morning, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Just on Life Sciences in general. First, just as you think about what next, I mean, one of the
things that strikes me, and certainly not being an expert in the area, is perhaps the moves of Thermo and others are kind
of fortifying kind of a distribution footprint that maybe you can't replicate. Do you view that as a kind of a strategic
issue to contend with? And just what is your view on kind of how maybe the channels are evolving?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Well, Jeff, that's probably a longer conversation than we might do justice to this morning.
But I think in Life Sciences in particular, we have a number of distributor partnerships around the world, including
Thermo. But that said, the vast majority of what we sell in Life Sciences – and I'm specifically talking to the research
side and the applied side of that segment, not the diagnostics – we sell on a direct basis. These are not gloves and
beakers that sell for two or three digits at a pop. I mean, we're talking about high end, highly engineered, customized
equipment that researchers, scientists, spec out and really push us on with respect to innovation. So those tend not to be
distribution oriented, hence any moves or consolidation that you see there I don't think have a direct bearing on our
competitiveness going forward.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Okay. Great. And I was just wondering, what you just said to Steve on the outlook was helpful
but just thinking about the second quarter you are basically guiding the second quarter flat year-over-year but a little bit
better revenue growth in Q2 than Q1, maybe some of this LS&D spending normalizes, perhaps some restructuring
savings come through. What is working kind of against maybe those positives that hold us at a roughly flat EPS result
in Q2?

<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Jeff, part of it was in the quarter last year. We reported $0.84 last year but we did call out
$0.03 of kind of one-time items. In addition, we had the Apex earnings, so absent those one-time items and absent
Apex, the equivalent was probably more like $0.79. So again, not talking a lot of increase but obviously $0.80, $0.85
on a normalized basis is up a little bit versus what we really, operationally we had last year.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Right. Okay, great. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yeah, thanks. Good morning.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Good morning, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yeah. So Larry, you mentioned a mid-point mindset, I believe, and I just wanted to clarify, is that
more a core growth mindset or should we apply that to EPS as well?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: I think with respect to the quarter, perhaps the year, both.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. And then just taking a step back. You've given some good color on the trading positions in 1Q
but take a step back to 4Q, obviously we had that unusual strength and I'm just wondering how much pull-forward do
you think there was from 1Q into 4Q?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Yeah. I'm not sure that our view would be materially different today than it was back in the
fourth quarter. Again, some of what we saw might have been a push out from the third into the fourth so I think what
we're trying to do, Nigel, business-by-business is really take stock of the trends through that, if you will, that three
quarter period. But undoubtedly, we did see some softness in the quarter I think because of, at least in Life Sciences
and in Dental, some of the pull forward. Was that 50 basis points? Was it a full point? Frankly, we haven't spent a ton
of time there, let alone trying to figure out how much a day plus the Good Friday spring break dynamics at quarter end
cost us in consumables. It is what it is.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Right. Right. I know it's kind of tough to try [ph] and criticize (41:30).
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Well, yeah.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: And then just you mentioned $8 billion of [ph] set (41:35) capital to redeploy and if I go over the last
six years, and you obviously back out Beckman, which is an unusual size, I think you've deployed about $9 billion over
the last six years and I'm just wondering to deploy that sort of quantity of capital, do we need to take a big swing on the
acquisition front?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: I don't think we see that $8 billion opportunity to deploy capital as something that requires a
single check to be written. Again I think as we look at that capacity, we really think about that as a backstop for all of
these growth platforms that we have. So we've got seven or eight businesses here, all with their acquisition maps and
funnels, and they're working that accordingly. So I think our preference would be if you're looking at $8 billion, to
divvy that up $1 billion to $2 billion across those businesses. And I think they all have funnels that would represent or
present those sorts of opportunities. Now certainly if something of size came along that made sense for us, we would
look at it. But as you well know, if you look back over that time period, the bigger deals tend to come infrequently.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Right. Right. Okay. Thanks, Larry.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Thank you, Nigel.

We'll take our next question from Deane Dray with Citi Research.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Larry, on Beckman -
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Hey, Deane.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: – you talked about that you've got four consecutive quarters at low-single digit growth,
nice and steady, but there's an expectation now that it ramps to mid-single digits in 2014. So just talk a bit about what
the driver is there? Is that the – a new product cycle?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Well I think the view all along was that we'd have to pay off some of this inheritance tax,
but by 2014, we should be able to move into that mid-single digit growth range. Deane, I really think it's nothing more
than the cumulative effect of both the fixes to quality, to service, in addition to the implementation of DBS not only to
drive cost out, but really to lay in the daily management to help drive better execution, both in sales and marketing and
the new product development.
As we move forward, as you see in this quarter with the launch of the DxH 600, the Power Express, we're going to get
a better lift from those products certainly as we get behind – we put behind some of the regulatory issues that we've
had. That's going to be helpful. So I just think we've got momentum building at Beckman, momentum on a global basis
and that bodes well for that business.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Great. And then I guess it shouldn't be surprising that you called out Arbor because lots
of headline news about cyber-attacks and you – just refresh us Arbor's go-to-market strategy, how much of their
product and software is off the shelf? How much of it is a customized solution? And maybe the mix between
government customers versus enterprise?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Deane, we're well positioned certainly in cyber security with Arbor much as we are in
mobile around the mobile explosion that the carriers are enjoying. That's on the Tektronix Communications side. At
Arbor, I don't have the exact mix in front of us. We're – I think we're more weighted toward carriers than we are
enterprise, but the enterprise initiative has been a – clearly an important part of what we've done here the last two years
and that's where we're enjoying some of the outsized growth right now as financial institutions and others wrestle with
these DDoS attacks. That said, from a – in terms of government, I just don't have that number offhand. It's a – I think
it's a relatively modest portion of the business. But it is represented in the customer set.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Would this be a business that would be one of those looking for M&A opportunities?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Oh, I think all of the businesses out there have their aspirations. Clearly in security we need
to be smart both about the strategic fit of anything that we might do there, let alone valuations of course.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Great. Thank you.

We'll take our next question from Jon Groberg with Macquarie.
<Q - Jon P. Groberg>: Great. Thanks [ph] on the line (46:32) for the questions. So Larry, first on the Tektronix
business, the instruments, it sounded like it turned down again to down low double digits, if I heard you right, from I
think like it seemed maybe it was starting to improve a little bit last quarter. Can you maybe talk about what happened
there and what the outlook is? And also, maybe in the context of that business, I think that's a pretty high gross margin
business. So kind of how – what drove the gross margins sequentially given the weakness there?

<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Jon, you're right. We certainly saw continued softness at Tek. And I think as both Dan and I
have alluded to here, that was pretty broad-based, certainly in the first quarter here. I think we saw that particularly here
in the U.S. I think what we saw at Tek was really just a continued push right in our funnels in a whole host of areas,
certainly a number of the customers that we served on the development side in the Tek end markets are reworking their
capital budgets for this year. A little unclear as to how that plays out. As you know, this business tends to track PMI a
good bit on a couple quarter lag basis. I think we're optimistic that we get Tek stabilized later this year. But that said,
it's going to certainly be a headwind for us all-in in the first half. Fortunately we've got some offsets working for us in
[ph] Comm (48:06) and at Fluke on a segment basis.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: And Jon, on the margin side, the gross margin side, across the company, as Larry alluded to,
we saw a really good performance given Tek instruments as you know, is a very high gross margin business. Gross
margins were down year-on-year in Test & Measurement because of that. But in the other four segments, they were
each up 50 basis points to 75 basis points. Again that's a combination of some of the price-cost dynamics, the
restructuring, bringing out new products. We were really pleased at Dental we were up almost 100 basis points
year-on-year in terms of gross margin. And obviously, means good execution on the cost side, but as importantly, some
of these new products come in at much better gross margin.
<Q - Jon P. Groberg>: Okay, that's helpful. Yeah, very impressive gross margin. And then if I can, just one follow up
kind of on the Life Science side. In some of these more – some of these smaller businesses, I know you mentioned
advanced staining was down if I heard you correctly. Actually, Roche had a really tough quarter in advanced staining
too, so can you maybe, I know there's some reimbursement and other things going on there. Can you maybe talk about
your outlook for that business for the year? And then on some of these legacy Beckman Life Science businesses that
actually are more distribution related, to one of the previous questions, does it make sense to maybe look to divest some
of those businesses? I'm curious. Thanks.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Sure. Thanks, Jon. Let me take those in random order. I think we continue to have a very
buoyant outlook for Leica Biosystems. Unfortunately, cancer is an issue around the world and we're hopefully part of
the solution there. You referenced the negative control guidance in the U.S. We think that probably had a little bit of
impact for us in the quarter. But I think the major issue that we alluded to at Leica Biosystems was really this
distribution change. In parts of Europe we're going from a distribution model to a direct model; that creates near term
noise as you work through that. I think it's the right strategic move to make. It'll help us grow faster in Europe long
term but clearly we saw revenue and cost issues in the quarter as we work through that, but that will settle out. We'll be
in a better place.
With respect to the Beckman Coulter Life Sciences portfolio, they had a nice quarter. We have a business there that I
think is improving. I was with them during the quarter. We installed some new leadership, promoted [ph] Jennifer
Honeycutt (50:57) into the president's role there, one of our outstanding general managers. I think we're optimistic, Jon,
about that portfolio. It's clearly the, if you will, the forgotten part of Beckman Coulter. There are a number of synergies
with the rest of our group and while you're right, a number of those products go to market through distribution, they
don't go to market exclusively through distribution. I think to the extent that we innovate, we build that brand, we're
going to be able to certainly compete anywhere in the world either on a direct or a distributed basis.
<Q - Jon P. Groberg>: Great. Thanks a lot.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: You bet. Thank you.

<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Shannon.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Hey, so Larry, back in the third quarter, equipment disappointed and consumables hung
in. It was kind of a similar dynamic and it was also, I think, mainly U.S. based. And then that dynamic basically
reversed in the fourth quarter. So you guys ended up missing it in the third quarter on that and beating in the fourth
quarter on that. Is there a reason why you don't think we might have a similar just choppiness but shift quarter to
quarter this time. Is there a reason something keeps you more cautious about 2Q and not expecting that kind of a I
guess, catch-up that happened 3Q to 4Q?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Yeah. If you're reading anything in our language or tone in that regard, it may be a function
of the March macro data that came out. Let alone the fact that no fun being short even of a tight 1.5% to top line range.
I think that said, again, as we look at the second quarter, there'll be some things that certainly help us. Having the
benefit of that extra day, if you will. Being on the other side of the holidays, et cetera. But I think we're going to be as
we typically are, cautious, hopefully smartly so relative to the outlook here. I think we, again, we look at the quarter,
acknowledge some of the noise but don't want to point to that.
On a relative basis, we think we're doing well. And that's ultimately what's going to matter. As we move forward here,
we continue to do that and make sure that we've got our investment envelope properly tuned to the environment.
Clearly little numbers matter a lot when you're talking about a couple hundred basis points on the equipment side that
can move around as it clearly has here the last couple of quarters. But that said, I think again, we're going to move
forward here with a strong competitive position thinking that the range that we've offered up this morning, again the
mid-point perhaps being the most likely scenario, for the second quarter and the second half.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. Yeah. I mean it does seem like maybe it's a function of the overall gross
environment but this, your equipment sales are choppier than they used to be, I guess, right?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Well, again, I think a couple hundred basis points in growth is really the swing factor here.
And it's been a noisy operating environment, particularly as we've dealt with some of these external issues. But that
said, the environment is what it is, right. So we're going to move forward.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Yeah. No, I hear you. And then just quickly on China. So Med Tech remains strong.
The Industrial stuff I guess is mixed instead of all down. I mean is there anything that has kind of taken a leg down or
gotten notably worse in the quarter in China?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: I don't think so. We've been wrestling with these issues that Dan alluded to at T&M,
particularly Tek, more so than Fluke, and in Motion for some time. So it's continued to be soft, but I don't think we
would characterize it as legging down in any way.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.

<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: I think certainly part of the softness that we saw in the U.S., it was probably most
pronounced at Leica Micro, Ross, could be attributed to just some of the noise in and around the sequester. And again,
it wasn't as if budgets were being slashed, projects cancelled and the like, things were just getting pushed right because
of I think a degree of uncertainty that seemed to play out. I think we certainly saw at SCIEX some softness in the
academic realm as well and it's really with those businesses that we probably have most of our sequester exposure in
Life Science. We have pockets here and there of other government exposure which could play out, Tek and Motion, for
example, being areas where we have that exposure, but it would be principally in LS. And again I think it's a noise
factor for us right now as opposed to any part of a clear step down as we look out to the rest of the year, at least at this
point.
<Q - Ross J. Muken>: On the capital deployment front, it's been I think – I have to check the figures for Q1 – but I
think it's been a fairly quiet M&A period overall for the market, ex maybe in our – in my space the deal this week. But
I guess as you're thinking about that environment, it seems like from your characterization, it's pretty active behind the
scenes. And so I guess as you look at sort of what you've been involved in and what you've looked at that hasn't come
to market, is it price? Is it timing? Is it uncertainty? And then have you seen the mix of buyers you're competing against
change, e.g. is private equity a much bigger component of the process now versus where they were 12 months or 24
months ago? And how are you sort of thinking about that as a changing dynamic?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: I mean, clearly given the better leverage markets, again, what's happened the last couple
weeks probably dampening that a little bit. We're seeing private equity more in different situations. Where we have a
strong point of view about what we can do with the margins, which is, I said, three out of four times, say private
equity's probably not going to be able to displace someone like ourselves. In terms of the activity I think the way you
characterize it, and I would think that's something we hear from not only what we're seeing but we hear from kind of
bankers is the behind the scene discussion levels are definitely up versus where they were six months ago and I think
that's encouraging. Why things don't happen, it's all over the place. It's sometimes price, it's sometimes transition
issues, it's uncertainty, but normally when we tend to see an increase in the number of discussions we're having about
mid- to larger situations, at least historically that tends to roll out into some acquisitions.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Ross, I would just add to Dan's comments that if you think about situations that we've
looked at where we've ultimately decided to let things go, the strategic fit, the strategic rationale is really important for
us. It's got to make sense in terms of the broader strategy. And particularly, in this low rate environment, we're still, I
think, primarily focused on those returns on capital as opposed to accretion, and that really has been I think the frame
we've used over time to deploy capital. Sometimes it's led us to be quite busy and bunched up and other times maybe a
little quieter than folks would expect. But with our portfolio taking the long view through the cycle we've tended to, I
think by and large make good bets that have generated good returns for shareholders. I think we continue to hold that
view as we look forward.
<Q - Ross J. Muken>: Absolutely. And maybe just one quick last one on that. I mean to your point on return on
capital, et cetera, versus accretion makes total sense. And given your view on the year and stocks off another couple
percent today, how are you guys thinking about sort of share repurchases? I know you bought a bit at the end of last
year and then stopped and so I'm just trying to get a sense for sort of your sensitivity and feeling on sort of intrinsic
value and your sort of openness if we go through another soft patch to maybe reconsider, again, sort of re-entering the
market.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Well, I think you characterized it well. We're always looking at it. We look at it
opportunistically in terms of what sort of returns and sort of payback in buying back our own stock. Again, having said
that, given what we potentially see on the M&A side, it's right now a fair consideration but it's still something that's
part of our calculus.
<Q - Ross J. Muken>: Great. Thanks, guys.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Thanks, Ross.
