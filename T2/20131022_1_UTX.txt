everyone the opportunity to participate. You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue and we
will answer as time permits.
Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Okay. Thank you and good morning everyone. As you saw on the press release this morning, UTC recorded third
quarter earnings per share with $1.55, that's up 13% versus 2012. We also saw results of organic growth, albeit modest
and margins expanded to 16.6%. There are always few bumps in the road, such as the recent political impasse in the

Washington, that has threatened economic recovery. And our strategy to deliver double-digit earnings growth remains
in place.
Following solid year-to-date performance, we are now confident in our earnings per share range of $6.10 to $6.15, is
growth of 14% to 15% at the high-end of our previous expectation of $6 to $6.15, that's despite slower top line growth.
Majority of our end markets are gradually improving, but we defensed down more than expected, and based on where
we are year-to-date, we now expect full-year sales to be about 63 billion versus our prior estimate of 64 billion.
There are still a couple of puts and takes to the year, and as I said earlier this month, some headwinds at Otis and
Sikorsky, but upside the other segments. The absent of a significant external event, we see it at the high end of our
earnings per share range, based on our proactive and aggressive restructuring and cost reduction actions, as well as
improving end markets.
Now you see on slide two, organic sales grew 1% in the quarter with good growth across most of our end markets
tempered by relatively flat European markets and continued significant declines in defense. Our commercial businesses
grew a combined 3%; we saw a continued recovery in North America with sales up 3% led by residential HVAC and
Otis new equipment. Europe declined 1%, and China was up 11% and continues to be the bright spot in Asia, where
overall sales were only 3%.
Aerospace business continues to see good growth in commercial OEM and recovery in the commercial aftermarket.
Revenue passenger miles were up 6.8% in August, and are up 5% year-to-date. Oil prices have dampened profitability
a bit, but the airlines are still forecasted to earn $11.7 billion this year and $16.4 billion in 2014. So, a healthy industry
and we see this in our business, with our commercial aero sales up 7% in the third quarter. On the other hand, the
Military business remains a headwind with sales down 14%. You see this impact across our aero businesses, but most
acutely at Sikorsky. And given the continued impasse in Washington, we don't expect this trend will improve over the
next year.
Okay, take a look at orders on slide three. At Otis, new equipment orders were up 4%, a solid growth of a tough
compared to the third quarter of last year, which had a major contract award in the UK. North America and China both
saw double-digit increases, Climate, Controls and Securities global equipment orders grew 13% has strengthened
Transicold. And commercial spares orders were up 17% at Pratt & Whitney and 5% at UTC Aerospace on a pro forma
basis.
All right slide four; wholesales [ph] increased 3% in the third quarter. Net acquisitions including Goodrich closed on
July 26 last year, contributed two points, and the FX impact was negligible. Segment operating profit grew 14%, and
operating margins increased 160 basis points, that includes about 100 basis points from the absence of the inventory
step-up amortization at UTAS last year.
As you heard from Geraud at our recent Investor Day in Monterrey, Mexico, CCS continues to drive synergies and
leverage their global scale. Operating profit grew 10% leading to margin expansion of 170 basis points. Pratt &
Whitney also expanded margins 290 basis points, and higher commercial aftermarket and aggressive cost reduction. As
Sikorsky maintained double-digit margins as a face of significant headwinds from sequestration and reduced defense
spending. So, the third quarter earnings per share was 13% and we initiated a $103 million of restructuring actions.
Excluding restructuring gains from both periods, earnings per share grew 19%.
As previously noted, we expect to invest about 500 million of restructuring this year, including over 150 million in the
fourth quarter. For the year, we continue to expect restructuring to be offset by one-time items. Free cash flow in the
quarter was 82% of net income, this was unfavorably impacted by an increase in inventory over $500 million, primarily
at Pratt & Whitney and Sikorsky, as each ramps up for shipments in the fourth quarter. While we continue to see
progress on the CMHP for the commencement of pilot training, and we are maintaining our placeholder eight aircraft in
the fourth quarter.
In addition to the four aircraft at the training facility in Shearwater, Canada, we have six aircraft fully assembled and
flight tested at the Plattsburgh, New York storage facility. Seven are undergoing flight testing at our West Palm Beach
facility. The balance of the 20 aircraft are in production, but the program continues to advance. And we'll provide

updates as more progress is made.
In the quarter, capital expenditures were 383 million, a little more than $1 billion year-to-date as we invest through the
aero ramp up at both Pratt & Whitney and UTC Aerospace Systems. For the year, we expect CapEx to be in the range
of 1.6 billion to 1.7 billion as we noted before. Also in the third quarter, we bought back 330 million of stock, they're
expecting to buy back about 200 million in the fourth quarter. We are in confident that free cash flow will equal net
income in 2013, and we increased our dividend of $0.59 per share in the quarter, a 10.3% increase.
Going back to talk about 2014 in just a second, but let me stop there and turn it over to Jay, he will take you through the
business unit results.
Jay Malave, Director, IR
Thanks, Greg. Turning to page five, Otis sales improved 4% at constant currency in the quarter, led by solid high
single-digit growth in new equipment and continued growth in service sales. New equipment sales were up in all
regions, led by double-digit growth in China, Russia, and the Americas.
Operating profit was flat at constant currency, but operating margins remained solid at 22%. Continued growth in
China was largely offset by transition costs, associated with the factory transformation in North America. In developed
Europe, the rate of profit decline is slowing, the sequential growth in Northern and Central Europe offsetting continued
weakness in Southern Europe.
New equipment order growth was up 4% at constant currency, the mid-teens growth in Americas and Asia; and
continued double-digit expansion in China. Orders in Europe were down high single-digits as a prior year benefited
from a major contract award in the UK. Excluding this award, as well as a significant order this quarter, Europe new
equipment orders grew 12%. Given the headwind from the manufacturing and supply chain transition from the Gallos,
Mexico to South Carolina and continued weakness in Southern Europe. Otis now expects full-year profits to be up
around 25 million, from up 75 million to a 100 million, and mid-single digit sales growth.
On slide six, Climate, Controls and Security increased profits 10% in the quarter on flattish sales, resulting in another
sharp increase in margins, up 170 basis points from prior year to 17.1%. CCS is continuing to see slow but steady
improvement in organic growth, as Q1 was down 3%, Q2 was up 1%, and now Q3 is up 2%. As we've seen all year,
organic growth is mixed across geographies. Europe was down low single-digit, China was up mid single-digit, while
Asia overall was down about 1%, driven by a decline in Australia. Americas was up low single-digit, driven by a 9%
growth in the residential HVAC business. Transicold was up 22% on a robust recovery, and the container continued
market after exceptionally weak period last year.
On profit, CCS had another solid quarter of earnings growth, driven by strong conversion on organic sales,
restructuring and productivity, including continued savings from the consolidation of Carrier and Fire & Security and
lower commodity costs. Global commercial HVAC equipment orders were up high single-digit, the growth in Asia and
Europe more than offsetting flat orders in North America. Orders for Global Fire & Security products were up mid
single-digit, while the fuel businesses were down high single-digit.
Commercial refrigeration orders in Europe were up 2%, while Transicold was up 17%, driven by container on an easy
compare over last year. The continued solid results through three quarters, and steady sequential organic improvement,
we expect profit growth to be around 200 million, the high end of the prior guidance range of 175 million to 200
million, and 1% organic sales growth. All resulting in operating margin above 15%, two years ahead of target.
Turning to Aerospace on slide seven. Pratt & Whitney delivered solid results with 18% profit growth and 5% lower
sales, resulting in margin expansion of 290 basis points. Organically, sales were flat as 22% growth in commercial
spares was offset by lower military engine sales. Reported sales were down due to the power systems business
divestiture. Profit growth in the quarter was driven by higher commercial spares volume and restructuring benefits,
partially offset by pension headwinds and lower military volume.

As you will recall, last year had the benefit of a supplier settlement that was largely offset by the benefit from licensing
agreements this year. For the full-year, we now expect Pratt & Whitney operating profit grow 150 million on low
single-digit sales growth. We expect profit growth to be at the high end of the prior profit range, as large commercial
aftermarket has stabilized and the benefits of proactive cost actions are realized.
If you see Aerospace Systems, delivered another solid quarter with operating profit of 525 million, and sales of 3.3
billion. On a pro forma year-over-year basis, sales were up low single-digits, with mid single-digit growth in both
commercial OEM and aftermarket, partially offset by lower single-digit declines in both military OEM and aftermarket.
Year-on-year profit growth was driven by the absence of last year's inventory step-up costs. Additional market of
Goodrich and continued synergies realization. If you see Aerospace Systems expects to deliver around 250 million in
synergies for the year. And it's well on track towards achieving the 500 million synergies target by 2016.
Orders for commercial spares grew 5% on a pro forma year-over-year basis with improvement in both parts and
provisioning. With approximately 1.6 billion of operating profit generated year-to-date, we are confident in the
full-year operating profit outlook 2.1 billion and sales of around 13.5 billion.
Turning to Sikorsky, operating profit decreased by 21% and 7% lower sales. During the quarter, Sikorsky shipped a
total of 61 aircraft, including 42 based on military platforms and 19 commercial. The sales decline was driven by lower
military OEM and aftermarket volumes, partially offset by strong growth in commercial shipments. The lower overall
sales volumes as well as headwinds from higher pension and compliance costs, contributed to the operating profit
decline. Sikorsky continues to see robust demand for its commercial product line with orders this quarter of over 400
million, a strong backlog in excess of 2.5 billion, including approximately 350 million from customers in China as of
quarter end.
For the full-year based on continued pressure in military aftermarket, we now expect profit to be down around 150
million, the low end of our prior guidance range. And the low single-digit sales decline versus up low-single digits
previously.
With that let me turn it over to Greg for wrap up.
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Okay. Thanks, Jay. Before we take a look at 2014, there are some other key items to note in the quarter. In late
September, we announced the creation of our New Buildings and Industrial Systems Organization under the leadership
of Geraud Darnis. While they were will remain separate reporting segments, this was strategically unite Otis and
Climate, Controls and Security. This will create the leading commercial buildings organization in the industry, and will
allow us to accelerate growth by fully utilizing our unmatched capabilities and scale.
Building on the success of combining our HVAC and Fire & Security platforms under CCS two years ago, this new
organization creates opportunities to unlock further synergies and leverage each organization skilled network to service
customers in a wider geography. And with 30% of revenues in emerging markets, we will focus our innovation on next
generation buildings and integrated systems, where we see opportunities to create value for our customers.
Also in the quarter, Pratt & Whitney in UTC Aerospace Systems supported the main flight, the Bombardier CSeries
aircraft on September 16 in Mirabel, Canada. A PurePower Geared Turbofan engine performed flawlessly at its historic
flight of the first next generation narrow-body aircraft. We're confident that the flight test program will further validate
the performance characteristics; noise, lower emissions and significantly better fuel efficiency.
But we always like to focus on the improved fuel burn of the GTF designs. Just as importantly, the GTF's noise
footprint is up to 75% smaller than today's engine. And this creates opportunities to fly more direct routes into
congested noise control airports, smaller noise signature also allows for streamline in airport operations through
expanded runway usage, as well as expanding current operational curfews at airports in heavily populated areas. This
would give airlines the opportunity to work with airports and generate more revenue by opening additional takeoff and
landing slots. A good example of the value creation that our game-changing technologies bring to the table.

Pratt & Whitney's performance, its best-in-class technology readiness, and program execution is the reason why the
GTF has captured orders for more than 4,700 engines. We're also saw the first flight of the Boeing 787-9 in the quarter,
as UTC Aerospace Systems continued to support volume and the development of this next generation family of aircraft.
So, a busy quarter with several significant milestones at UTC. Let's change gear for a second here and take a look at
2014. Again, no surprises, that compared to what we talked about just a couple of weeks back. Our strategy remains in
place and we continue to target double-digit earnings growth in 2014. We expect solid growth in commercial aerospace
and the commercial construction markets in North America and Asia, to more than offset declines in our Military
Aerospace business.
As you all know, Europe remains a question mark. Let's take a cautious approach and we're not planning for growth in
Europe as we sit here today. Good news is that we'll finally see some tailwind from pension next year. There were
approximately 800 million of pension expense going through the P&L this year. And it'll be a welcome relief to see
some benefits from lower amortization charges and the higher discount rates.
On the other side of the ledger, we do have about $0.30 of headwinds from three significant items. We obviously
continued reduction in defense spending, both sequestration as well as the overseas contingency spending. There's also
pressure on the tax rate, primarily from the exploration of the tax extenders.
And lastly, we will see some headwind from the initial GTF engine deliveries. It will improve as the technology
matures, but Pratt & Whitney will face some negative engine margin on deliveries of each platform over the next
several years. These are great long-term programs of point sort of bright future for Pratt & Whitney, but we'll need to
work down the learning curve as these aircraft and our service.
So, there is always some pluses, some minuses and question marks as we look towards next year. Continue to leverage
our industry leading franchises in global scale, with the right strategy in place will remain committed to delivering
double-digit earnings growth once again next year.
So, with that, let's open up the call for questions.

Good morning, David.
David Strauss, Analyst
Greg, in terms of looking at your revenue guidance and what's implied for the fourth quarter, it looks like, we acquired
about 4% organic revenue growth, that comps a little bit tougher relative to the third quarter. So can you talk about how
you get there, what's the different in the fourth quarter versus your third quarter?

Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
I think David, you're right. I think we'll see organic revenue growth of about 3% to 4%, probably closer to 4 as we sit
here today. Again, you're going to see better deliveries at Sikorsky, I think Sikorsky takes up deliveries to about 80
aircraft in the fourth quarter, they delivered about 160 year-to-date, so you'll get a little bit of a bump there, that's both
commercial and the military. You see a little bit better performance at Pratt, especially on the military aero side; I think
we'll ship about 20 JSF engines in the fourth quarter. And you're going to see on the commercial side an acceleration of
organic growth, is because of the orders that we're seeing going into the year. We saw that here in the Q3 at Otis, I
think organic was up 4%, orders remain strong.
So we'll see that again, acceleration growth at Otis and acceleration of growth at CCS into the fourth quarter.
David Strauss, Analyst
And then on the order side, obviously the comps get a lot tougher as well in the quarters to look at Otis would expect
order growth still be positive in the fourth quarter at Otis?
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Well, absolutely. I think again there Pedro and team, we tell you that their order trends remain, bookings look very
strong, we are still seeing good strength in North America, we're seeing good strength in China and even Europe is
recovering. Again, I think as Jay noted before, if you take out that bit UK Crossrail's order for Q3 of last year, I think
orders actually grew about 12% there. So, the economies are recovering and again, commercial construction seems to
be at the leading edge of the recovery here.
But one caveat I would say is Asia outside of China has not been so great. India has been down Japan, Korea, Australia,
so that maybe the damper on the -- of the growth story in the fourth quarter. But we still expect solid orders growth.
Same at CCS again, Transicold had a huge quarter, orders were up 70% in the quarter at Transicold, and again that was
off of a very easy compared. Compares to get more difficult, but good momentum going into the fourth quarter.
David Strauss, Analyst
Okay. Thanks. I'll get back in queue.

Good morning.
Jay Malave, Director, IR
Good morning.
Carter Copeland, Analyst
Just a couple of quick ones. First on the commercial, the spares piece. I'm wondering if you might provide a little bit
more color around that growth rate and what you saw in the Vs versus PW4000s and some of the other engines?
Jay Malave, Director, IR
Sure. Carter, we saw growth in the PW4000, as well as the V2500, and they've more than offset, some declines in the
PW2000, both really sales and orders.
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
If you think about, I think on a legacy basis, Carter. Our legacy Pratt spares up about 10%, even the overall spares were
up 17%. So, really good strength in the V. Again, to young fleet, we're starting to see sharp business pick up, as we
expected, and a little bit of softness on the 2000. But again, legacy business is recovering.
Carter Copeland, Analyst
Okay, great. And on the Military side, you've talked about fewer engine shipments, obviously the weakness at Sikorsky
on the aftermarket side. But, and kind of look around against some of your peers, the size of the weakness at Sikorsky
certainly stands out as kind of anomalous, at least from what we can see so far today. So, are there any other elements
of weaker military spending that aren't captured in those two? And with respect to what you're seeing at Sikorsky, what
do you think it's making that stand out so much more versus what we're seeing elsewhere across the current space?
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, I guess there's a couple of pieces here to look at, I mean military aero was down across all three of the Aerospace
businesses. You've seen in Pratt, again, we stopped the 119 deliveries last year, so we've got some headwind from
F119s, the F117, that goes on the C-17, that's going down. And JSF is really ramping very, very slowly. So, that's not a
great story, although the aftermarket there is okay.
At UTAS, we actually saw a reduction in military that surprise us a little bit. And this is not sequestration, so much it's
just some of the government agencies just curtailing and coming back and some of their spending on our Sensors
business which was most impacted.
And then we go to Sikorsky. And Sikorsky is, there's a couple of things there, obviously, the aftermarket and we've
seen orders down 15% for the year, which is completely unexpected. And we expect it to be down, but not by 15%.
And then you've got again just the reduction, and the quantities for the Multi-Year 8 versus Multi-Year 7. And the
timing of some of the international military which is also getting pushed out of this year and into next. So, it's been
almost a perfect storm at Sikorsky this quarter. And as a result, they're going to be down at the high-end of their
earnings range down about 150 million for the year earnings.

Carter Copeland, Analyst
And as far as the Sikorsky spares, I mean, aftermarket side, how much visibility, how far out does that visibility go in
terms of, what you think about the impact on next year and how that rolls through? How much longer could this persist
or are you just assuming that we get down to this level and stay there, any color would be great?
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So, a couple of parts there. I think, part of this, again, the big hit ramp that we've seen over the last five years on
military spares at Sikorsky was really funded by the overseas contingencies spending or funding for the wars in Iraq
and Afghanistan, and that is coming down, and we expected that to come down.
The rest of the military spares piece, I would say there was just -- we didn't see the bump in the third quarter that we
had expected, typically at the end of the fiscal year for the government, you see a large influx of orders as everybody
tries to spend their budgets, we didn't see that this year because of the uncertainty I would say around military budgets,
and what was going to happen in the last quarter of the year. So, I would say, we should have about 50% of next year
booked and we don't have much visibility into next year as we sit here today.
I think that the good news for Sikorsky is the commercial businesses is taking off, it's been very, very well, ramping up
production and the aftermarkets picking up. But of course it's 20% of the business versus the 18%, which is military.
So, Sikorsky is going to have a tough year next year, I think that's the long and short of it, and it's not unexpected given
the next step down in sequestration which I think takes another 12 billion on our defense spending starting in January.
So it's a tough couple of years for Sikorsky.
Carter Copeland, Analyst
Great. Thanks for the color, Greg.

Thank you. Next question is from Nigel Coe of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Nigel Coe, Analyst
Yeah, thanks, good morning.
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Hi, good morning.
Nigel Coe, Analyst
So, just looking at the 2014 framework, obviously there is no changes since we published in Monterrey. Just looking at
the question mark column, and you got some of the price commodities and then, and there's no surprises in there. But
based on the ramp down in copper price, the copper hedge price for 2014. I'm assuming that price remains pretty solid,
what would you expect in terms of tailwind for next year, at current levels?

Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, there should be some modest tailwind from copper going into next year. Copper has come down, but I think it's
still trading around $3.50 or so a pound. Also we've taken down the amount of coppers, as we've talked about it. We
had a visit across all of the CCS, I think, six, seven years, you know, GBP120 million were down to GBP50 million or
GBP60 million. So, well, copper is an important element of the cost structure, it's not as big as it used to be.
We're also seeing a little bit of headwind on steel, which is going to impact both Otis as well as the CCS. But it's kind
of early, I think, generally speaking, I would hope that commodities pricing is going to move over into the positives as
we get towards the end of the year, when Louis stands up and gives guidance. But just had to wait and see, how this last
quarter plays out.
Nigel Coe, Analyst
Okay. I think, if there is about the pricing side of the equation, it sounds like spares pricing still pretty good, where do
you expect pricing looks pretty solid? Otis seems quite negative, so I'm just wondering, if you look at the backlog build
that we seen in Otis, what kind of margins you seen in that backlog?
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
The margin in backlog is actually started to improve a little bit in North America, we've got some new products out
there, we've been able to get a little bit of pricing. But again, not big numbers there we're talking about. And in China,
we continue to see pricing pressure at Otis on new equipment, not a surprise. I think, the beauty of Otis is, they
continue to be able to reduce cost of the factory, offset this pricing pressure and still deliver significant margin on new
equipment as a result of the scale of the factories and the relentless focus on cost reduction.
Nigel Coe, Analyst
Okay. And just a quick one on Pratt margins, obviously very impressive, you've run through some of the factors. But
the deconsolidation or rather the sale of Rocketdyne Power System, did that have a positive impact on mix?
Jay Malave, Director, IR
Power Systems are maybe a little bit there, Nigel. But again, by and large what we saw on that 290 was really the
benefit from the aftermarket mix for the spare parts as well as the restructuring benefit.
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, keep in mind, we took Rocketdyne, we reinstated the numbers for last year and this year. So the year-over-year
doesn't really have any impact from those discontinued ops.
Nigel Coe, Analyst
Good point. Yeah, thanks a lot guys.

Thank you. Next question is from Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.
Jeffrey Sprague, Analyst
Thank you. Just back to Otis, Greg, just thinking about the South Carolina factory disruption, can you quantify how
much of that kind of played into the Q3 margins? And as you look into Q4, obviously the guide kind of speaks for
itself. Do you think that fully encompasses kind of collecting issues and you have that behind you by the end of the
year?
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
It's not going to be completely behind us, Jeff by the end of the year. I would tell you in the quarter, the impact was less
than $15 million call it a penny of share from the disruption at Florence. At the same time, I think they are making
good progress, they took overdue from the 1,000 units at the end of the second quarter, down to about 350 units rather
at the end of Q3, hope to get the overdue all out the door by the end of the year. But some of the root cause issues,
some other systems issues and some of the other factory issues that we've seen today are still going to take some time
to work through.
Having said that, I think what we're not going to see is a repeat next year, all of the additional costs. We've kept in the
Gallos plant open for additional six months or so this year, that's close as of the end of September. So that's going to be
tailwind for next year.
I think the strategy is going to work. We want to have all of the CLC, all the engineering, all the manufacturing, all the
procurement, all at one place down in Florence. The workforce is coming up to speed, it's getting better. It's just going
to take some time. But I don't think you're going to see a full run rate savings that we'd expected until probably towards
the end of next year there.
Jeffrey Sprague, Analyst
But we should have a non-repeat of at least kind of 50 million of cost in --
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, I think that's probably the best way to think. We probably won't see big year-over-year savings ex that 50 million
of cost that won't repeat, as such that's pretty significant at Otis.
Jeffrey Sprague, Analyst
I just wondered on CapEx also an aggregate. I don't think you said 1.6 to 1.7, before I think it was 1.7, not to split here,
but you are finding ways the kind of bend, the curve a little bit on that CapEx bubble and what do you think about next
year?
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. So, year-to-date we spent a little over $1 billion on CapEx, I think, we spent 383 million in the quarter, that's up
65 million. We are trying to, as you say, bend over that curve, I think, we're trying to keep that number closer to 1.6 or
1.7. The 75% of that spend is at the Aero units, and it really goes to the ramp up that we're going to see in production,
you've get the five GTF engines, we got the big ramp up in UTAS and the consolidation of the Goodrich, Hamilton

businesses. So, there is pressure on CapEx, and I think, next year probably be the peak year, which could even be up
from what we're seeing this year.
So, we are doing we can to try and push this capital under the supply chain. We're looking at partners from much of this
work, we're doing a lot of things, I think, to try and address this. But the bottom line is, there's a lot of CapEx coming in
the fourth quarter of this year, you'll see even more next year.
Jeffrey Sprague, Analyst
And then finally, can you just give us little more color on the European building related businesses both Otis and CCS.
I think, Jay said, field weakness in the Fire & Security organization, but equipment orders, I guess, were better at Otis.
Just a little more color on the layer to land there and how things are playing?
Jay Malave, Director, IR
Sure, Jeff. Let me -- I'll look through sales and I'll do orders. I saw with CCS, commercial HVAC was down almost
single-digits. Fire & Security was down low single-digits, and the products were down slightly and the field was down
low single-digits. Commercial refrigeration was up slightly. And switching over the orders and FCCS [ph], commercial
HVAC was up mid-teens. And commercial refrigeration was up low single-digits.
As far as Otis, as we said, sales were actually up in the quarter, low single-digits, and orders were down high
single-digits, but for that big order last year. And again as, both Greg and I mentioned, excluding these big one-time
orders that would've been up 12%.
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
If you think about it, it really, I mean, it looks as if we're positioning to or improvement here is like into the fourth
quarter and into next year as we deliver on these. So, it's been a tough year, but we do see signs of stabilization there,
it's not getting worse, FCCS, I think they were down 2% a quarter. But again, the orders would indicate that there
should be recovery here in Europe, although I'm not going to count on a whole lot as we go into next year, at least we
don't think it's going to get worse.
Jeffrey Sprague, Analyst
Great. Thank you very much.

GTF, when would think you're getting closer to a peak from that?
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, so GTF actually did peak, I think, which you saw at Pratt was that E&D was actually flat in the quarter, we were
down 50 million year-to-date, you're going to see a further reduction in the fourth quarter, Pratt is engines get certified
and we complete much of the testing. The whole growth in third quarter E&D was at the legacy Goodrich, it's just the
fact that we had Goodrich, it was up $40 million year-over-year. So, I think we're right on the plan that we had
expected, in fact, Pratt we've said, down 75 to 100 probably closer to down 100, which will help fourth quarter
margins.
Howard Rubel, Analyst
Okay. I've never gotten the tax rate right this year.
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Me either.
Howard Rubel, Analyst
Now, but you'd find things that sort of help matters. So, how do you think about a normalized tax rate, I mean, I
recognized that some of that will be a function of repatriation and every other credit one can find.
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, I think, there is a normalized rate with the tax law as it stands today, I'll be very specific there, it should be
around 29%. The fear of course is the tax law changes next year, and when we lose some of the benefits from the tax
extenders like the R&D tax credit and the CFC look through rules and they wants to put upward pressure between a
point and a point and a half on the rate. So, if you think about next year, we're bookkeeping probably a 30.5% tax rate,
unless by some miracle the folks in Washington, they get this tax extenders pass, but I think that's unlikely that
anything is going to happen down there this year yet.
Howard Rubel, Analyst
And then finally, you talked about restructuring, I think, you said 150 million in the final quarter of the year. Can you
sort of -- can you outline a bit where you plan to target it? And how are you anticipating capturing some gains?
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Well, there is -- but there is obviously a few things out there in terms of the gains, there's probably a little bit on the tax
side, we'll probably get another couple of one-time items there, that'll help fund some of these restructuring, but I'm not
counting on a big. The fact is most of the restructuring in Q4 is actually going to go to Pratt, again preparing for the
ramp-up, at the same time, they're trying to adjust their cost structure to the reality of today.
UTAS, I think again, you're going to see further synergy plays there with head count and further restructuring. And the
same at Otis and CCS. So there is, again, their 150 is pretty well spread across the businesses. Sikorsky is going to be

teams and things up too I think and anything that number probably wants to go up, but if doesn't go up in the fourth
quarter, it'll go up in the first quarter.
Howard Rubel, Analyst
Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question is from Julian Mitchell of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
Julian Mitchell, Analyst
Hi, thanks a lot. Yeah, I was just curious about the expense of the expansion in your gross margin, that was sort of flat
to down in the first half up almost to 190 bps year-on-year in Q3. You mentioned lower commodity costs in CC&S
helping. I just wondered if there was anything exceptional in that gross margin in terms of input costs or mix or it really
does reflect kind of the benefits of restructuring that is something that should be sustainable?
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
There is a couple of pieces there, Julian, I think again, one of the biggest pieces is the absence of the inventory step up
amortization. Last year it was, I think, $100 million.
Jay Malave, Director, IR
150 million.
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
150 million in the third quarter, and again in the fourth quarter. So that really help the UTAS margins improve. As far
as Pratt, the big improvement in gross margin was really the recovery in the commercial aftermarket, as well as the
restructuring savings from all the actions that we took in the first nine months of the year.
Julian Mitchell, Analyst
Got it. Thanks. And then on, just following up on R&D, you didn't put in your sort of outlook for next year. Is the
assumption then that it will just track in line with the sales development, because you've still got lot of legacy Goodrich
stuff to catch up on?
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
No. I think there is -- if there is anything, E&D should start to trend down especially on the aero side here. We are
completing the 787-9, we are completing the GTF engines. And again, I'm not talking about the huge step down, but it
should generally trend down over the next couple of years which should be helpful.
Again, there is not a lot of newer platforms. So we do have to complete all the work that's out there from the Embraer
aircraft to CSeries and the Neo. So there is lot of work to do, but I think, it's generally going to trend down slightly.

Julian Mitchell, Analyst
Got it. Thanks. And then lastly, just within Otis, so I think your EMEA services revenues were down sort of low
single-digit in Q2. Is that still running at the same trend here in the second half?
Jay Malave, Director, IR
Yeah. It was down slightly in EMEA in this third quarter.
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Again, I think the pressure there is not surprisingly. Spain is down, Italy is down, but we are seeing a good traction. I
think France is up a little bit, Germany is up a little bit. So it's really the same story that we've been talking about for
the last year and a half. Southern Europe continues to be a headwind although much, much lesser than in the past 18
months.
Julian Mitchell, Analyst
Got it. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question is from Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Myles Walton, Analyst
Thanks. Good morning. The first one is clarification, just on the CMH. Eight deliveries are baked in so that dime
headwind is, is in the numbers for the fourth quarter at this point?
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
So to be clear the eight aircraft we have assumed that we're going to ship those in the fourth quarter. But year-over-year
it's actually tailwind, Myles, because you recall last year, we took $157 million charge. Those eight aircraft would go
out with negative margin around 120 million. So this is actually tailwind in Sikorsky's numbers in the fourth quarter
from CMH, strange as it seems.
Myles Walton, Analyst
Positive thinking, I was just saying versus your underlying EBIT guidance down to 150?
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. That's in there, the eight aircraft.

Page 15 of 21
Myles Walton, Analyst
Okay. Great. And then, Greg, can you talk about the other operating cash flow line item that figure 350 million
negative swing this year. I think in some of its the fleet management, some of its '12 revenue going in the opposite
direction. But can you talk about the trends for the rest of the year and also into 2014?
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. I think you saw there is a little bit of an anomaly here in the third quarter. What we saw is some higher costs and
some of the fleet management programs as you noted there at Pratt & Whitney where again we are incurring cost
upfront to get these engines up to kind of rebuild to a pristine condition before they go back in the field. So those costs
go on the balance sheet, it goes out of the cash flows. There was a couple of the minor things in there and Jay, could
you --
Jay Malave, Director, IR
Yeah. We just had some increases in long-term receivables particularly again in the Aero businesses and then just again
some payments in terms of -- on some of the longer term reserves like our restructuring-type reserves, where we are
liquidating those reserves throughout other payments.
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Nothing I would say structurally different going into the rest of the year or even to next year that I would have been
that concerned about.
Myles Walton, Analyst
Okay. So into '14, that becomes more of a historical trend?
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yes.

Joe Nadol, Analyst
Thanks. Good morning, Greg and Jay.
Jay Malave, Director, IR
Good morning.
Joe Nadol, Analyst
On UTAS, so your EBIT was -- adjusted EBIT was down here sequentially, and just -- yeah, thinking about this we
should have over time, sequentially, should be thinking about aftermarket getting, I think a bit better. And we should be
thinking about synergies from Goodrich getting better. So was the sense, the negative sequentially and if so, could you
help quantify that a little bit?
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. There was actually a couple of pieces of headwind there. And I think, you hit on the biggest piece, which was
defense and that began both at the legacy Hamilton business, as well as, there's Goodrich in the Sensors business, we
saw headwind there. And we also saw additional headwind as sales pick up on 787, there is still negative margin there.
We also booked some loss reserves associated with the CSeries aircraft, which again is a very long-term program, but
as you first start out, you're high on the learning curve, so there's a little bit of loss associated there. And again that gets
better over the next couple of years. But there's also really those three biggest pieces if you will.
Joe Nadol, Analyst
Okay. So as we think going forward into Q4, I mean your guidance implies kind of flattish EBIT again. But as we think
about that going into the next year, how do you think about those various pieces, particularly, are you worried more
that Goodrich defense business was just a home run for them in the last couple of years of their independence. Is that
somewhere where we could expect or fear more downside or --
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Again, the Sensors business is not really DOD business, it's a US government business. So we're not selling as much as
you might think, the DOD, although there is some there. But there is clearly going to be a little bit of headwind, but not,
I'd say this is not a huge, huge number for us next year. I think again, we come down the learning curve on the 787 next
year, so that's going to improve, we'll come down to learning curve on CSeries. Sequestration will be an impact at
UTAS, bigger impact than next year at Sikorsky. But I think it's all kind of captured in there, we talked about $0.12
headwind from sequestration and probably, a third of that's going to be at UTAS and two-thirds it will be a Sikorsky.
Joe Nadol, Analyst
Okay. And then just one more, I think you've tweaked down your cash flow guidance from better than or equal or better
than to earnings to just essentially in line with what were the changes there?

Again, we've always said, we target cash, free cash flow equal to net income and I didn't mean to imply that there was
anything significantly different. As we get towards the end of the year, we clearly have line of sight to free cash flow
equal to net income, I think we're 91% year-to-date. Our fourth quarter is typically big from a cash flow standpoint. So,
I can guarantee you one thing, it won't be exactly 100%, it might be a little lower, it might be a tiny, bit less, but we're
targeting in the range of net income. So no surprise there.
I think again, we're on track to deliver. And the same thing with the guidance here, we tighten the guidance range to
that (inaudible); you see a path to the high end, but I don't see a path above the high end. So, as you guys think about
the year, we're thinking about cash flow equal to net income and $6.15 and what we're really focused on right now is
2014.
Joe Nadol, Analyst
Right. I mean your guidance did change in -- from October 1 to today, I mean, in terms of what's in your slides. So, I
guess that's just -- it's just basically based on where you were?
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. It's just based on the reality, as we get towards the end of the year. We will be a little over net income maybe, but
we're not going to be at 115% of net income. And I didn't want imply, that's why we really tweaked the guidance to say
it's going to be essentially equal to net income.

Shannon O'Callaghan, Analyst
Hey, Greg, if you looked into this military aerospace weakness, I mean, have you been able to sort of get a feel for how
much of this could be inventory reductions and when those might sort of play themselves out?
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. And again, I think what we're really seeing is just a reluctance on the military services to spend on spares; what
that's most impacting, I think, is fleet readiness. We've seen the Black Hawk readiness declined significantly because
they're not working the hours, they're not doing the repairs. And right now, it seems to be comfortable that they can
take down fleet readiness, but that trend cannot go on forever. I think, we would expect to see a recovery to kind of
more normal aftermarket levels across all of the defense businesses next year, once we get this thing with sequestration
sorted out.
Shannon O'Callaghan, Analyst
Okay. And then, just, maybe a little more color on Europe in terms of the commercial businesses. I mean Otis and
commercial HVAC are seeing better European orders. What do you make of those, are you seeing sort of material
swing go on there or what color you have around? What are you seeing driving?
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Let's be careful there, Shannon, I think, again, we are seeing recovery, but we are still well below peak rates that we
saw in 2006, 2007. So orders are coming back, they offer really, really low level. So recovery is coming, it's very slow
and I am not expecting, again, orders are good, they are good in Northern Europe primarily, but it's -- there's still a lot
of uncertainty in Europe. So we are going to be cautious, but, again, I think it's all trending positively.

Greg, if I look at Pratt, you had a big drops sequentially and even year-over-year in the large commercial deliveries, I
mean, what was going on there? I mean, you had a strong second quarter, but what was actually happen in the third to
be that low?
Jay Malave, Director, IR
George, that really just normalized, I think you would expect in the fourth quarter, we expect that number to probably
jump a little bit to the 150 range in that ballpark. So the second quarter was just a high quarter.
George Shapiro, Analyst
Okay. And then the 14.4% margin, I mean, obviously, got helped by the lower deliveries in the higher aftermarket, was
there anything else in there or is that kind of a sustainable kind of new level margin for a while now?
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Well, no, you got, again, to the earlier point, commercial or commercial OEM is going to go back up in the fourth
quarter. The other piece you are missing is the restructuring savings Pratt has taken out close to 1,000 people this year,
in the first nine months, and most of that came in second quarter. So you're going to see that benefit continue. And
again, those spares should be better, so that will help. But you get a little bit of an offset this commercial OE picks back
up in the fourth quarter.
George Shapiro, Analyst
Okay. Thanks very much.
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
George, thanks.

Hey, on Fire & Security, could you just give us an update in terms of traction in the quarter, what it means non-resi
side? And any developments on the portfolio rationalization, sounds like there is still some divestitures that could
potentially be done on businesses you couldn't scale?
Jay Malave, Director, IR
Let's see, what I do, I just give you some data points, Deane, on Fire & Security globally. The products were up low
single-digits, and sales and orders were up mid single-digits. On the field businesses, those were down high
single-digits in both sales and orders in the quarter. So that's -- that's what we saw Fire & Security globally.
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah, I think this is not a new trend, Deane. Again, some of the field business, again, we have been mostly
deemphasizing, but we've been somewhat more selective as Geraud said, about not taking some of these installation,
which is just installing the pipes if you will for sprinkler system, so we're trying to buy higher margin, higher value
add, and that can pull some of our product along. So making good investments on the product side, and we're seeing
that traction and orders, but the service side continues to be a drag, especially in Europe.
Deane Dray, Analyst
Great. And I might have missed this, but on the Canadian maritime, are you -- you've made progress in the
renegotiation of the contract, any closer to that resolution?
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Yeah. We're very cautious here, a typical with me. But I would say that we're making progress, although it's slow. And
I think, again, we haven't really started formal contract negotiations. Good news is the aircraft are up in Shearwater,
they're flying. We're getting traction with the customer, I think, everybody recognizes they want to find a solution here
both at the Sikorsky and at the Canadian government level.
So, we're making progress, it's a great helicopter. We're just down at West Palm Beach, the other day I was talking to
the test pilots, it's a phenomenal aircraft. But it's just going to take a little bit of time. So, I hope when Louis stands up
in December that we'll have some really good news to report.
Deane Dray, Analyst
Great, thank you.
Greg Hayes, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer
Okay. So, thanks everyone for listening today. As I just said, we look forward to seeing you all at our Annual Investor
and Analyst Meeting on December 12 in New York. We'll do the same as last year, we'll be giving guidance on 2014
and look forward to seeing you all there. Thanks very much.
