Before turning to questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to
Safra.
Safra Ada Catz
Thanks, Ken. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q3. I'll then review the guidance for Q4 and turn the call
over to Mark and Larry for their comments. While our overall business remains very healthy and we saw excellent
pipeline growth, we're not at all pleased with our revenue growth this quarter. Though it didn't help that our quarter
ended on the same day as the sequester deadline, what we really saw is the lack of urgency we sometimes see in the
sales force as Q3 deals fall into Q4. Since we've been adding literally thousands of new sales reps around the world, the
problem was largely sales execution, especially with the new reps as they ran out of runway in Q3.
As expected, many of the pushed-out deals have already closed. Our product portfolio is as strong as it has ever been
and we won more than our fair share of deals. Our discussions with customers continue to be elevated to the most
strategic level. There is a lot of enthusiasm around our leadership in software, engineered systems and our real-world
approach to mixed public-private cloud deployments. Looking forward, we're encouraged by the tremendous pipeline
growth, but clearly we have work to do in training new reps on managing the sales process and the establish – and the
importance of establishing a quarterly rhythm with their deals. As such, I'll be conservative in my Q4 guidance even
though Q4 is the quarter the sales force is in fact geared to.
Now to the numbers in Q3. Currency movements reduced new license revenue growth by 2%, and total revenues by
1% and net income by 2% and earnings per share by approximately a penny, and I will focus on constant currency
growth rates unless I say otherwise. This quarter, new software license revenue was $2.3 billion, flat in constant
currency, down 2% in U.S. dollars. Cloud revenue was $238 million. On a GAAP basis, in constant currency, the
Americas were down 1%, APAC was up 1% and EMEA was up 1%. Software license update and product support
revenues were $4.3 billion, up 8% from last year and were nearly half of total revenue. Support attach and renewal
rates continue at their usual high levels, actually at the highest levels for Q3 in the last five years.
Hardware system products revenue was $671 million and while engineered systems again showed excellent growth, we
continue to work through a product transition with the high-end SPARC server line. Clearly, our customers know the
new products are coming out next week and have held off buying the older Ms. We expect that the launch next week of
new M line will help that. Total revenue for the quarter was $9 billion, flat in constant currency and down 1% in U.S.
dollars. Operating expenses were flat in constant currency and our non-GAAP operating margin expanded to a Q3
record of 47%, up from 46% last year even though we substantially increased head count.
As revenues grow and we continue to manage our business with discipline, we still believe that there remains a lot of
leverage in our business model. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 21% and the GAAP tax rate was 19%.
Both were favorably affected in this quarter by the retroactive extension of the R&D tax credit, though we did take a
$65 million write-down of our Venezuela cash balance as the bolivar's official rate changed. EPS for the quarter grew
5% in U.S. dollars to $0.65 on a non-GAAP basis and would have been approximately $0.01 higher but for the negative
impact of currency on revenues.
GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.52, up 6% in U.S. dollars. It would have been $0.53, up 8% but for the impact of
currency. Operating cash flow increased to $13.7 billion over the last four quarters, up from $13.5 billion last year and
free cash flow grew to $13 billion over the last four quarters. Both are record results for Q3. We now have nearly $33.4
billion in cash and marketable securities and as we've said before, we remain committed to returning that value to our
shareholders through technical innovation, acquisition, stock repurchases, dividends and the prudent use of debt. In this
quarter we repurchased 61.5 million shares for a total of $2.1 billion in the quarter. So over the last 12 months, we have
repurchased nearly 350 million shares for a total value of $10.6 billion.
Now to the guidance, so for Q4 new software license and cloud subscription revenue growth is expected to range from
1% to 11% in constant currency and in reported dollars. Hardware product revenue growth is expected to range from a
negative 22% to a negative 12% in constant dollars, negative 23% to negative 13% in reported dollars. As a result, total

revenue growth on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from negative 1% to positive 4% in constant
dollars and U.S. dollars.
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.85 and $0.91, both U.S. dollars and in constant dollars, up
from $0.82 last year. And GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.72 to $0.78 in both U.S. and constant
dollars. I've gone ahead and assumed a GAAP tax rate of 23% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 24%. Of course, it may end
up being different.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments.
Mark V. Hurd
Thanks, Safra. I'll just make a couple of quick comments before I turn it over to Larry. We've added over 4,000 people
to the Oracle sales force in the last 18 months. We've significantly expanded our customer coverage. We've seen
material growth in our pipeline. But Q3 conversion rates were below what we expected. While our actual win rate went
up moving to engineered systems, our record quarter for us with more than 800 units sold in Q3. That's the best unit
quarter ever. We've now sold more than 5,000 engineered systems to date. In the first full quarter for Exadata X3 we
sold over 400 systems. The pipe is up materially and conversion rates are up. The 1/8 Rack systems in particular sold
extremely well, causing the ASP to be down slightly but these entry-level systems are just the beginning as we expect
to grow our business with these customers over the long-term.
Better news our Exadata has carried over to the other engineered systems which were more than 800 engineered
systems sold this quarter. Exalogic, Big Data Appliance, the Oracle Database Appliance, all three saw 30% sequential
unit growth. We had another solid quarter in our verticals which have grown faster than software license in all of the
last four quarters.
We had great growth in cloud, CRM and ACM, wins at Travelocity, Walt Disney World, Kaiser Foundation, Office
Depot, Match.com, Deutsche Bahn, CGI Group, Southwest Airlines, Dow Chemical, Union Bank, Renault, National
Instruments and Lender Processing Services. That's a lot of names. It took me a long time to read it, but I wanted to
give you a flavor for the quality of names and the quantity of wins we had in the quarter that's driving our annual
recurring revenue up nicely.
In other hardware, as Safra mentioned, the T-Series continued to be our best performing server product but the
M-Series lagged. ZFS storage saw double-digit growth for the quarter which is the seventh straight quarter.
We've been able to materially grow our sales force and our R&D while overall operating expenses were essentially flat
from last year, and I think that's a testimony to our expense management and discipline.
Safra mentioned Software Support which grew 8% in CD renewal rates, as she mentioned, at a five-year high for Q3
and by the way virtually no expense growth in our Software Support business as we recorded those results.
With that, I'll turn it over to Larry.
Lawrence J. Ellison
Thank you, Mark. Next week we'll start deliveries of our next generation of servers built using our new SPARC T5
microprocessor, the world's fastest microprocessor. Next week we'll publish 17 world record benchmarks including a
TPC Benchmark showing that the SPARC T5 is the fastest processor in the world for database, and the
SPECjEnterprise benchmark showing the SPARC T5 is the fastest processor in the world for Java Middleware. Our
new T5 servers have up to eight processors and are more than twice as fast as the T4 systems they replace.
Even more important, our new M5 server, which has up to 32 processors and runs the Oracle database over 10 times
faster than the similarly priced old M9000 server it replaces. With the delivery of the M5 server next week Oracle will
finish upgrading every server in the SPARC product line dating from the time we acquired Sun.

Thank you, Larry. Operator, we're now ready for the questions, please.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from John DiFucci with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - John S. DiFucci>: Thank you. Mark and Safra, I'd like you to address sort of a high level question because I
know I'm going to be asked this a lot tomorrow. The softness this quarter was surprisingly broad-based across both
software and hardware and it looks like across all regions. We appreciate your willingness to kind of look internally for
the causes and answers here, but given the breadth of the relative weakness it really begs the question whether
something bigger is at work here. I mean, how much might macro forces have come into play here or even perhaps the
sales approach or strategy versus the execution of that strategy? I mean, in fairness you're still relatively early in the
sales count expansion but at this point are there any thoughts of perhaps looking at things a little differently?
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: I'll take it. No. I think we feel – again, let me just go through what I think Safra said and I'll sort
of elaborate a bit on that. We feel great about both our strategy and our product line. So point one and two, we have no
doubt, no question about that whatsoever.
Second, to your point, we have increased the sales force dramatically and we feel great about our coverage. And that
really shows up first in the pipeline performance that we've got. Our pipeline is up significantly. We don't give you a
number because frankly I don't want you to give me a comparison every quarter with the pipe, but it is up materially.
The issue for us is simply conversion. And listen, you can come up and anybody can come up with all kinds of factors.
There's always something going on around the world at any given time, and for us we feel good about our ability to
execute through it. In this case, as I said, it really was just the conversion rate against the context of a materially higher
pipeline.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Yes. So on covering sort of one through three of the issues, we don't think at all it's the
products because the pipeline's fantastic and our win rates are excellent, and so we feel very, very good about that
worldwide.
As far as being the economy, there's no really new news on the economy. As I mentioned, it doesn't help that the
sequester deadline is on the last day of our quarter, and so that has a little bit of an impact here in North America but
not necessarily anywhere else. The economy has been as it is in Europe for a while. So there's no real new news.
And then finally, on sales execution why we think that's it, it's frankly because it's playing out exactly that way as deals
kind of flop over right into Q4. And so especially with the newest folks, they're really geared to their annual target and
they're a little less urgency about Q3. For you who have covered Oracle for so, so long and for some of us who have
been here a long time, this was very Q3 and now it's extremely Q4 around here. And that is something we're kind of
used to, except when there are acquisitions sometimes you don't see it as much because of the new companies that –
what they bring and they change the seasonality a bit. But ultimately, Q3 is very similar to Q2 and then Q4 is the big
quarter; everybody's aimed at Q4, and it really feels like that around here right now.
<Q - John S. DiFucci>: Okay. Okay, thanks a lot.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please.

We'll take the next question from Brent Thill with UBS.
<Q - Brent Thill>: Thanks. Question for Larry on the hardware business; Q4 was set to be inflection point and it
appears that that has been pushed out. What's your sense on the turnaround? And if you could just contrast on the Axis
side versus the other side of the hardware business, maybe some more metrics of what you're seeing. Thank you.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Okay. Sure. Well, the oldest product in our product line was the M9000, the large-scale M
systems, which we hadn't refreshed for several years. And we saw very, very substantial and continuous decline in that
business. It wasn't helped by people who were aware that we're going go through a product transition in Q4. So that
didn't help us in Q3. And then now we've got to go through this product transition in Q4. We're announcing the new
M5, the new T5, and we think people might take a couple of months to evaluate these systems before they verify that
our claims are correct. The T5 is more than twice as fast as the T4 it replaces, much better price performance. And the –
amazingly, the M5 is more than 10 times faster than the M9000 it replaces.
So we think T4 will be better – excuse me, Q4 will be better than Q3 as far as hardware is concerned. But I think we
expect a turnaround really to begin in Q1, not in Q4, because we have this large introduction of new systems.
I think the other thing that Mark alluded to that was that we announced some lower-end Exadata systems in our
engineered space. And people have been beginning – have been beginning – new customers have been beginning with
the smaller systems as opposed to – now that they're available – so as opposed to – 1/8 Rack rather than 1/4 Rack. And
that's somewhat lowered our ASP this past Q3. I think we work our way through that over the next two quarters and
again, I think Q1 you're going see a big turnaround and next year will be a big growth year for our entire hardware
business, the SPARC line and all of the engineered business.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Brent, I'd just add a couple comments on the engineered systems line so you have more clarity.
On the 1/8 Rack, this is actually good news, even though it lowers ASP, because we delivered a lot more technology
and a lot more performance. And as I mentioned, our unit counts were at a record level in Q3. And we have the
opportunity to upgrade those machines over the long run. So the fact that we've seen our pipeline is up, our unit levels
are up, and so I think to Larry's point, this puts us in a really strong position as we get into Q1 next year on the
engineered systems side as well.
<Q - Brent Thill>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
We'll take the next question from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Philip A. Winslow>: Hi. Thanks, guys. I just have a question on the software business. I know you guys don't
break out database and middleware and tech versus applications anymore, but I'm wondering if you can just give us a
sense of what you saw this quarter in terms of the performance between those two old segments and then just what
you're seeing in the pipeline?
And then also, just one follow-up for Larry, specifically to Oracle Fusion applications. There's been some debate out
there about what your win rates are with Oracle Fusion apps versus some competitors and if the Oracle Fusion
applications, are they more modern, less modern, modern then competitors. Just provide us an update on where we
stand there, that would be great.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: So basically database and apps moved together in the quarter. So there's no special news there,
one way or the other. And I think the second question was for you.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: I think it was actually over to Larry on the Fusion stuff.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Yeah, I think one of the things we've done is we've become very, very focused on not just
Fusion applications, but all of our cloud applications. So we really – a lot of new head count, a lot of the changes in
organization, in the field have been based on focusing on the cloud, increasing our win rate in the cloud, having

specialization around HCM, having specialization around service with our RightNow product, specialization around
sales with our Fusion sales product as we go against our secular competitors, Workday and salesforce.com and the
others.
So I think as – in the third quarter, we saw very good growth. We saw very, very good growth in the cloud. That was
not the issue. Just that our cloud – when I talk about the cloud, I'm talking very specifically about the SaaS portion of
the cloud. We're in all aspects of the cloud. We're in infrastructure, we're in platform and we're in SaaS. So the number
– gave you a $1 billion number, that's a $1 billion pure SaaS number. That's growing very, very nicely. The problem is,
it's still a relatively small business with a very, very high growth rate. We are focusing on that. And we're getting a
good – a very good result there against the competition. Our win rates are going up versus Q2. The growth is excellent.
But we think – we've deployed a lot of resource on that to get those win rates and get that focused. But the business is
still relatively small compared to our overall $40 billion business.
<Q - Philip A. Winslow>: Got it. Thanks, guys.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please.
Operator
We'll go next to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Great. Thank you. This question is for Mark. Mark, you and Safra both highlighted sales
execution as the reason for the shortfall this quarter, after posting a strong Q2. I'm just wondering if you can give us a
sense of how long you think the transition looks like. Is it one quarter or two quarters? And as a follow-up, what does
the ramp look like as execution improves? Thank you.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Well, I'll just say we expect it to be within the context of Q4. So we saw many of the deals that
we've described are closed. So we expect it to be relatively quick. On the ramp – and I think, Heather, what you mean
is the ramp of the salespeople that turn into pipeline and turn into growth, if it's not, I'm sorry. But, that's the question
I'm going to answer.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Yeah, that's it. Exactly.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Okay, all right. So I think it really is just about the speed of getting our conversion continuing
to climb. So our pipeline is behaving – I wouldn't say linear to the hires but the way you would expect it to. You would
expect a timeframe for a new hire to come onboard, get trained, get assimilated, get engaged with their management.
And I would say the pipeline is behaving roughly as you would expect relative to the ramp of those sales resources.
When you hear Safra and I talk about the pipeline, we measure it very closely and we see it there. So it's just a question
of how we convert. I won't go into the role of predicting revenue growth rates out several quarters, other than to tell
you that we have a lot more coverage and we have a pipeline that's growing substantively.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Thank you.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please.

We'll go next to Kash Rangan with Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Kash Gopalan Rangan>: Hi. Thank you very much. Looking forward to the magic of May quarter. But as it
pertains to this quarter, Mark, I'm just curious when you ended up the November quarter, could there have been a
chance that we saw some business being pulled in potentially as people, customers, were somewhat leery of this fiscal
cliff, or a bunch of extraneous concerns that might have actually caused some deals to get done a little bit earlier than
expected, which obviously benefited your November quarter. I'm just curious to see if you think that could be an

attribution to what happened the February quarter? And also just wondering if you have any thoughts on how to think
about the growth rate of engineered systems? I think you've characterized it as being 70% to 80%, maybe even
potentially doubling. I just wanted to see how we're tracking towards that goal for this year? Thank you very much.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: I think the answer to your first question is sure. I mean there's potential of deals going that were
in Q2 was better. Some deals go to Q4. I mean I think there's all kinds of things you get to – what we do know is we've
got a lot of deals in the pipeline. And we're in good shape on those deals. I mentioned in the context of I think the better
way to look at it, Kash, is that we don't just measure the pipe. There are two different ways to measure a pipe when it
concludes. One is the conversion rate, meaning, the aggregate pipe and how it converts to orders.
The second way to look at it is the win rate in the context of the deals that do get decided intra-quarter and our run rate
went up in the context of the conversion rate going down. So it's an important thing to measure because some of it's our
activity and the time the decision gets made.
In Engineering Systems unit count was great. As you heard Larry and I both mention, we had an ASP decline. Not
because of unit count but because of the average selling price and the movement to conversions or to a one-eighth rack
which actually brings the average selling price down. Unit count, I think we're roughly in line with the numbers that
you described there.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Jason A. Maynard>: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. I want to tackle this maybe from a different angle. Can you
maybe talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of customer adoption of Fusion? What are you seeing in terms
of uptake at least within the install base? Upgrades, number of go lives? How's that trending across verticals and
product lines? And how does that bake into your equation for closure rates in the next couple quarters and getting
confidence with new customers to buy this whole broad suite of apps? Thank you.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: A great question. And it's interesting that we monitor this very, very closely. In HCM
alone we have 30 customers going live in the next six weeks, and that's a very, very important – and that's extremely
important as our reference base increases. These are relatively new businesses for us. So our reference base has greatly
expanded in HCM. That's one of our main focus areas like service is, like sales is. Our win rates against Workday are
going up, as Mark pointed out, we follow our secular competitors very closely, we look at every competitive deal, we
measure our win rates, and those win rates against Workday are going up. And we think we're – we actually have a new
and improved UI coming out for all of our cloud applications that's being applied.
It's a change in our middleware platform. So it automatically – that UI suddenly appears then in all of our cloud
products. We've improved the UI. We have a lot more references coming on, the technology continues to advance, the
UI is making a giant step forward, so we are encouraged that our ability to compete and win in the marketplace is
getting better every month.

<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Yeah, I think what – we have a very, very significant presence in billing systems, in
provisioning systems in the telco space and what we'd like to become is a more – or one of the most strategic suppliers
to telcos overall which involves broadening our footprint of what we supply them. So you're going see us through our
own engineering, through innovation and acquisitions, greatly broaden our footprint as our ambition is to be the
primary technology provider to the telecommunications industry. So that's an area where we've been very successful in
certain parts of it and we think we can expand that business by again adding to the footprint.
And you're going to see us adopt a similar strategy in retail and in financial services. Combination of innovation and
acquisitions to broaden our footprint to become more and more strategic to telecommunication companies, more and
more strategic to retailers, more and more strategic to banks as we can solve more of the problems.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: You know, I'm really glad you asked that question because when we announced the acquisition
it was during our quiet period, and most of the people that wrote about it wrote about it as a horizontal networking
acquisition, and what we were doing was exactly what Larry described. Phone companies have two networks or two
sets of IT systems: those who manage the business and those that manage the network. And this was an opportunity for
us to get into that network side of the business and, if you will, open up an entirely new opportunity for us strategically
inside the phone companies and leverage our existing go to market, our existing assets and our existing relationships.
So we look at this as just a fantastic acquisition to build on our assets that exist already in CGB – CGB being our
Communications GBU [Global Business Unit].
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Perfect. Okay. Thank you.

Our final question will come from Brendan Barnicle with Pacific Crest Securities.
<Q - Brendan Barnicle>: Thanks so much. Safra, you mentioned that maintenance attach rates were at the best levels
in Q3 that you've seen in five years. What do you think's driving that attach and what are you seeing in terms of pricing
and competition around maintenance? Thanks a lot.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Well, as a general matter, really the only place to get the updates for your products in addition
to the product support is from Oracle. And so as a general matter, customers know that the value they're getting from
the licenses that they bought, often years ago, is when they upgrade and when they get all the new features. And there's
quite a lot of interest in making sure folks are staying current, especially as they're looking at their data centers, et
cetera. And as a result, I think we've just continued to offer them fantastic value and we are the place for them to get
the updates that they need.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Operator?
