Peter D. Hancock
Good morning. Thank you, Liz, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Before we begin our discussion of the
quarter, I'd like to say that I look forward to leading AIG, and am confident in our team, the strength of our
industry-leading balance sheet and the opportunities for our global businesses. AIG is well positioned to meet the needs
of its broad customer base across the markets we pursue and we'll continue our focus on balancing growth, profitability
and risk to deliver exceptional returns to shareholders. I'm pleased with the quarter's operating results and the continued
execution of our capital management objectives. Through the first nine months of the year, book value per share growth
has exceeded 15%, a trend we expect to continue.
This morning, my remarks will touch on the three topics. The first is our new management structure and operating
committee; the second is my immediate priorities; and I'll conclude with a brief update on fed oversight.
First on management structure. Last quarter, I stated that you should not see abrupt changes in our strategies and
objectives and that's still the chase. The recently announced new operating committee creates a structure that facilitates
further collaboration and reinforces the value of One AIG. This committee reports directly to me and represents the
team that will be leading our strategic initiatives across products and geographies.
AIG is a company where 20 different businesses account for 80% of our revenue. It's critical that we take an integrated
approach to managing our operations in order to best serve our customers and pursue new growth opportunities. We're
looking to improve operating efficiency and decision-making by eliminating layers in the organization. As an example,
we're not filling my former position and we're incorporating the Life and Retirement businesses into our global
operating framework.
I'm grateful for the strong team that Jay developed over his many years at AIG and I'm committed to the future growth
of our Life and Retirement businesses. Jay's responsibilities will be largely assumed by Kevin Hogan, who as Head of
Consumer is focused on our global life opportunities, and as you know, has decades of experience in the life, personal
lines, and accident and health markets. John Doyle continues to oversee our Commercial businesses and has assumed
responsibility for UGC and our Institutional Markets business. The diverse experience that Kevin and John bring to
their respective roles allows them to be span breakers, and encourage collaboration across all our disciplines on a
global basis.
Our three regional leaders are locally focused and have accountability for executing our strategies in conjunction with
our local teams. Their local reach is designed to improve speed and effectiveness.
You'll see that technology and science are represented on the operating committee, which speaks to our commitment to
their respective roles within AIG. Science continues to partner with all our functions to capitalize on data analytics and
other scientific breakthroughs. Our investments in technology are essential to providing the solutions our customers
demand with the greatest of efficiency and adaptability.
Now turning to my immediate priorities of culture, technology, and value-based metrics. Starting with culture, to begin,
I believe that a culture of collaboration is necessary to realize the true value of all that AIG has to offer. Few companies
have the scope of businesses, customers, and sheer data available to AIG. We believe our customer relationships are
important and mutually beneficial. By working across the organization, we've tapped into opportunities that we may
have overlooked under a more siloed approach to running our businesses. The new management structure was another
step to encourage collaboration and we believe a culture of collaboration will drive future opportunities.
Turning to technology, you've heard me discuss science and technology to drive problem solving and to reduce claims
costs. Science is already paying dividends to us and is working across our businesses to provide critical insights and
further data segmentation. Our OneClaim technology provides more enriched and consistent data to science, actuarial,
and others to drive better decision-making.
We've taken another step forward by elevating the role of technology with the announced hiring of Phil Fasano, our
new Chief Information Officer, who also reports directly to me. Under Phil's leadership, we expect to achieve our
vision of providing a truly seamless technology experience to our customers, distribution partners, and employees.

Phil's most recent experience is at Kaiser Permanente, and he brings an extensive track record of improving systems
and data management while creating innovative solutions.
Turning now to value-based metrics, I've talked about value over volume approach in our P&C companies, and going
forward, you can expect a broader implementation of value-based metrics at AIG. The success at AIGPC has translated
to improved results and effective capital allocation. A framework of assessing the economic value of all our products
won't result in dramatic changes to our business mix, but is an important discipline for us to continually access the
highest return on our capital, taking into account risk and sustainable growth.
Now, finally, fed regulation. I'd like to speak about the ongoing importance of fed regulation for AIG and how to
consider the impact at this stage. We continue to work closely with the fed and maintain a positive dialogue with a goal
of providing the insights and information that are essential to operating as a well-regulated financial institution. It's too
early to discuss CCAR requirements for a non-bank SIFI, and there are unique aspects to insurance companies that are
noteworthy. As an example, in comparison to banks, insurance companies have significantly lower leverage and greater
liquidity. Diversification of risk is the essence of insurers' existence, while banks' risk profiles tend to be highly
correlated to the economic cycle.
Furthermore, primary insurers are far less interconnected to each other than the banking industry is. Our policyholder
focus and the requirements of our existing regulatory bodies also has a meaningful impact on how we operate. We
mention these differences to highlight the complexity involved in non-bank SIFI regulation. We continue to work with
all our regulators globally and will provide more insights as they're available.
With that, I'd like to turn our call over to David to discuss the numbers and the quarter.
David L. Herzog
Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will review the highlights of the quarter's results, our
capital management activity and our liquidity and capital position.
Turning to slide four, our after-tax operating income for the quarter was $1.7 billion, up 23% from a year earlier, or
$1.21 per diluted share. Our operating return on equity was 7.2%. Since our earnings are tax affected, and we are not
paying taxes to the U.S. Government given our NOLs, our operating ROE excluding the DTA from equity was about
8.6%.
Reported net income of $2.2 billion included a non-operating gain related to the previously announced settlement with
Bank of America, which was about $570 million after-tax. The after-tax impact of this gain reflected the benefit of
utilizing substantially all of our remaining capital loss carry forwards. Partially offsetting this non-operating gain was a
loss on extinguishment of debt associated with our liability management actions during the third quarter.
Third quarter book value per share excluding AOCI was $69.28, up 11% from a year ago, largely driven by our
earnings. The comparable book value metric on the same basis as the ROE excluding DTA is book value per share
excluding AOCI and DTA, which was $58.11 per share at the end of the third quarter, up 15% from a year earlier.
However, this assumes that the DTA has no value. There is significant economic value in the DTA, which results from
the monetization of the tax attributes in the form of cash to our holding company from tax sharing payments from our
operating companies. In our view, the present value of these cash flows can be projected at somewhere between $7 and
$8 per share.
Operating income, which is shown on slide five, reflects a 14% growth in insurance operating income from a year ago
quarter. I will mention just a few noteworthy items and John and Kevin will provide more details on the operating
results.
In the quarter, our P&C business incurred approximately $227 million of net adverse prior year development stemming
principally from accident years 2006 and prior, and concentrated in the primary casualty lines, primary general liability,
including construction defects and commercial auto.

Overall, experience for accident years 2007 and subsequent was favorable, mainly due to the effects of reduced policy
limits and re-underwriting of our excess casualty portfolio. Our Life and Retirement results benefited from net
favorable unlocking adjustments of about $120 million as part of our normal annual review.
Collectively, the DIB and Global Capital Markets, or DIB GCM, delivered another solid quarter with over $350 million
of operating earnings that was driven by market appreciation on legacy assets, whose values may fluctuate as they
move towards the ultimate recovery values that we expect. We continue to reduce the DIB GCM. In the third quarter,
we redeemed about $2 billion of DIB debt due in 2016 and 2017. And in October, we redeemed another $2.4 billion of
DIB debt due in 2018. In each case, using cash and short-term investments allocated to the DIB.
We continue to expect that the actions that we will take will result in the release of the capital to Parent over time as the
maturities of liabilities and the underlying assets and derivative positions are monetized and settled. Recent
improvements in risk profile and leverage led to the release of NAV to the Parent, which will be taken into
consideration in next year's capital planning.
With respect to our 46% equity pickup in AerCap's earnings, as I mentioned to you last quarter, we will have
differences from time to time in our estimates and the actual results because of timing. Such differences will be trued
up in the subsequent quarters, as was the case this quarter with a positive true up of about $30 million related to the
second quarter results.
Corporate expenses were $280 million for the quarter, and included a short-term incentive compensation accrual of just
over $50 million. We will evaluate the level of our accrual in the fourth quarter based on the full year performance and
true it up as necessary. Our reported operating effective tax rate for the quarter was roughly 34%, in line with the
previous outlook of 33% to 34% for operating tax rates.
Our strong capital position as of the end of the quarter is shown on slide six. During the quarter, we utilized the
remaining amount under our existing share repurchase authorization, deploying roughly $1.5 billion towards
repurchase of approximately 25 million shares of common stock. Following the end of the quarter, an additional 3.9
million shares were delivered to us in full completion of the ASR, which was initiated in September. We also
distributed about $180 million in dividends to our shareholders during the quarter. In addition, our board of directors
authorized an additional share repurchase authorization of $1.5 billion.
With respect to capital management, we continue to manage the cost of debt and our debt maturities. During the
quarter, we purchased, in tender offers, certain high cost hybrid debt and senior debt securities at the Parent for an
average purchase price of about $2.5 billion.
In unrelated transaction, we also issued $2.5 billion of debt comprised of $1 billion of 2.3% 5-year notes and $1.5
billion of 4.5% 30-year notes, and we issued an additional $750 million in the 4.5% 30-year notes in October.
Additionally, in October, we repurchased $1.6 billion of principal amount of the 8.175% hybrid notes as part of our
continued effort to reduce our high cost legacy debt. Year-to-date annual net interest savings from these actions are
approximately $160 million. The run rate for 2015 interest expense now is roughly $1.1 billion.
We ended the quarter with financial leverage ratios including the hybrids of about 16.4% or 15.8% when giving effect
to the October activity. We continue to be opportunistic in our debt capital management, and expect that our improving
earnings profile, particularly from our core insurance businesses, will continue to positively impact our coverage ratios
going forward.
Cash flows for the holding company remained strong, as you can see on slide seven. We received cash dividends and
loan repayments from our insurance subsidiaries of $2.1 billion during the quarter, bringing year-to-date cash
distributions to $5.4 billion. Third quarter cash distributions included $400 million from the Property Casualty
companies and $1.7 billion from the Life and Retirement companies. Property Casualty also distributed about $400
million of securities, which are included in the AIG Parent liquidity under unencumbered fixed maturity securities.
The cash distributions from the Life and Retirement included $465 million associated with the litigation settlement that
I mentioned earlier, and little over $480 million of proceeds from the sale of the PICC shares to Parent. We also

received additional distributions from Life and Retirement of a little over $600 million in October in the form of cash
and securities. We ended 2013 with an RBC ratio of 568% in the Life and Retirement. We look to distribute excess
capital from Life and Retirement through the holding company to operate those businesses with an RBC closer to
470%.
In addition to these distributions, we received tax-sharing payments from our insurance businesses of a little over $300
million in the third quarter, bringing the total to $1.1 billion year-to-date. We expect to make small tax payments to
some of our insurance companies in the fourth quarter to true up to actuals.
Following the quarter, we paid $960 million associated with the previously announced 2008 class action settlement,
which had previously been reserved. We expect continued strong cash flows from our operating companies, and we
also expect 2015 tax sharing payments to be somewhere between $1.8 billion and $2 billion and our current expectation
is that our tax attribute DTA will be fully utilized by 2020 to 2021.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to John.
John Q. Doyle
Thank you, David, and good morning, everyone. AIG's Property Casualty results in the third quarter reflect execution
against our strategic objectives and our continued focus on underwriting discipline and risk selection.
If you turn to slide eight, you can see the third quarter Property Casualty income of $1.1 billion, up from a year ago,
benefited from earned premium growth, improvement in the accident year loss ratio in both Commercial and Consumer
businesses and higher net investment income. Reported net premium written grew 3% from the same period last year,
also reflecting growth in both Commercial and Consumer insurance. Similar to the year ago quarter, this quarter was a
relatively benign cat quarter with losses of $284 million from eight different events.
Net investment income growth reflected improved returns from alternative investments, which were roughly 10% on an
annualized basis, better than our 8% expectation.
If you turn to slide nine, Commercial Insurance reported net premium written growth of 5% versus the same period a
year ago, or a 3% when adjusted for FX and additional premiums on our loss sensitive business. This was led by
increases in our Property and Financial Lines businesses. Property net premiums written rose on increases in new
business in the middle market and highly engineered risks. In addition, this growth benefited from improved retention
on renewal business and changes to optimize our retention of more favorable risks.
Financial Lines growth reflected new business increases of targeted growth products, such as multinational, small
business, and M&A across all of our regions, as well as a favorable rate environment here in the United States.
Global Commercial rates increased slightly in the quarter and were up 1.8% in the U.S. U.S. Financial Lines led with a
3.9% increase, followed by our Specialty Lines at 2.4% here in the U.S., while Casualty was up 2.2% in the United
States. Property rates were down 2.3% and overall, market conditions have been fairly stable and consistent with the
second quarter.
With respect to rate trends, we believe it's our pricing strategy, our business mix, and our focus on pricing each risk
appropriately that gives us confidence in our accident year loss ratio trend and continued growth in risk-adjusted
profitability. The accident year loss ratio as adjusted in Commercial improved by 1.4 points from the year ago quarter,
primarily due to an improvement in Financial Lines as a result of refined business mix and underwriting improvements
as well as a 0.6 point decline in severe losses from the year ago quarter. Our Global Property business continues to
deliver positive risk-adjusted profitability even considering the recent elevated trends of severe losses.
Turning to slide 10, Mortgage Guaranty reported another strong quarter of operating performance with operating
income of $135 million. Mortgage Guaranty continues to benefit from improvement in its delinquency ratio and cure
rates. UGC has become part of our Commercial Insurance business and remains an important core insurance operation
for us given its strong returns and strategic insights into the residential mortgage market.

To sum up, the Commercial team continues to advance on its strategic initiatives, work collaboratively across all AIG
businesses, and further build value for all of our stakeholders.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Kevin to discuss our Consumer PC and Life and Retirement businesses.
Kevin T. Hogan
Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As Peter mentioned, we are bringing together our consumer-oriented
businesses in both the Life and Retirement and Property Casualty segments to create a global consumer platform with
broad distribution reach under common management. Both of these businesses are well positioned with strong
leadership, deep management teams and a sustainable strategy. The third quarter represented strong results across all
our consumer businesses, including our significant Life and Retirement businesses, which I will address later.
In terms of PC Consumer, at our Japan Investor Day, we highlighted the uniqueness of our franchise, our data-oriented
decision-making and our focused growth approach. Our progress this quarter was consistent with this message, as we
saw positive developments across our global businesses, underwriting improvements in lines where data drove pricing
and we achieved growth in a number of products.
I'll begin on slide 11, where you can see net premiums written for Consumer Property Casualty grew 2% from the same
quarter a year ago, excluding the effects of foreign exchange. There were a number of businesses driving this quarter's
top line, including attractive new business sales in Japan Personal Property, continued growth in AIG Fuji Life
products and improved rates and retentions in our U.S. private client group.
We note that some of this growth was offset in the quarter due to changes we made in our U.S. warranty programs. We
remain positive about the growth potential going forward for Consumer PC and will continue to pursue opportunities
across select geographies and product lines.
Importantly, we delivered better-than-expected underwriting results across our major products. The third quarter
accident year loss ratio of 55 for Consumer is the lowest we have reported since we began to separately present
Consumer PC results.
In Japan, where our largest Personal Auto book resides, we continued to see favorable claims experience and realize the
benefit of positive rate actions. This quarter's underwriting improvement was also positively impacted by the coverage
actions we took a year ago in our U.S. warranty book. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we have historically
experienced a sequential increase in our loss ratio compared to the third quarter. That said, I believe the over 2 point
improvement in our loss ratio year-to-date is based on sustainable underwriting and pricing actions that allows for
continued underwriting profitability, which in turn supports our competitive position in the marketplace and allows for
ongoing investments in our Consumer franchise.
The investments we are making in our infrastructure are evident in our general operating expense ratio, which rose 2.4
points from the same period in the prior year. The Japan integration costs were the greatest contributor to this increase
and are ongoing. Our acquisition ratio was flat with the year-ago quarter, largely reflecting the level of production
growth.
Turning to slide 13, the current Life and Retirement segment, I am pleased to report continued strong financial
performance generating $1.3 billion of operating earnings, 18% higher than the year-ago quarter. Growth in earnings
was driven by an increase in fee income on higher assets under management and higher net investment income due
primarily to strong returns on alternative investments. Results also benefited from our continued focus on spread
management and our disciplined approach to new business pricing across products.
In addition to strong earnings, Life and Retirement declared nearly $2.4 billion in insurance company dividends in the
quarter. Our dividend activity is reflective of strong statutory capital generation by the underlying business, as well as
our ongoing efforts to distribute excess capital to Parent. Assets under management increased for the fifth consecutive
quarter, reaching a record of $334 billion, 10% higher than a year ago.

Growth in assets under management was driven by an 18% increase in separate account assets and reflected positive
net flows in individual variable annuities, growth in our stable value wrap business, and equity market appreciation. In
the third quarter, we achieved new records in our Retirement Income Solutions business, generating $2.9 billion in
premiums and deposits and nearly $2 billion in net flows. Approximately half of the growth in Retirement Income
Solutions sales came from index annuities, which have become an important offering in our suite of retirement
products.
Also reflected in third quarter earnings is the impact of our annual review of gross profit assumptions, which resulted in
a $120 million net positive adjustment to earnings, approximately equivalent to the level of adjustment made in the
prior year period. Our net adjustment this quarter was impacted by changes to investment spread assumptions.
Although spreads have recently been under pressure, our actual experience has been more favorable than what we had
assumed in our models, resulting in a positive adjustment in our Fixed Annuity and Group Retirement businesses this
quarter. This was partially offset by adjustments in our Individual Life business due to higher than previously assumed
mortality, although still within our pricing assumptions, as well as a loss recognition charge for discontinued long-term
care business.
Slide 14 illustrates the diversified contribution to earnings from our Life and Retirement businesses. Excluding the
adjustments made in both the third quarter of 2013 and 2014 for updated assumptions, Retirement Income Solutions
earnings increased 23%, driven by higher fee and spread income. Also excluding the adjustments, Fixed Annuity
earnings increased 25%, benefiting from a reduction in our cost of funds and higher alternative investment income.
Sales of Fixed Annuities will remain challenged in the low interest rate environment as we continue to maintain our
new business pricing discipline. Also excluding the adjustments for assumptions, Life and A&H earnings were also
dampened by increased expenses related to initiatives to enhance distribution and improve operational efficiencies.
Institutional pre-tax operating income increased 31%, excluding the adjustments to assumptions, and benefited from
higher fee income and higher alternative investment returns. Group Retirement continues to produce strong earnings
based on higher fee income generated on increased assets under management, which were up 5% from a year ago.
However, we did experience a large group surrender as a result of normal competitive pressures in this business.
Overall, we remain comfortable with our risk appetite across our Retail and Institutional businesses. We have
maintained our disciplined approach to pricing and product design, which enables us to generate attractive returns on
new business.
Slide 15 illustrates the performance of our spread businesses. The decline in base yields across product areas reflects
the reinvestment of cash flows at rates that are lower than the overall portfolio rate. We remain focused on actions to
control the cost of funds, including disciplined pricing of new business and active management of crediting rates on in
force business. We're also benefiting from outflows of older policies, which carry higher crediting rates than current
rates offered. These efforts have paid off, and in both Fixed Annuities and Group Retirement, we have consistently
reduced our cost of funds over the last 12 months.
Slide 16 shows our Life and Retirement investment portfolio composition, which remained stable and continues to be
highly rated and managed with discipline. Total net investment income fluctuates from period to period as can be seen
in the alternatives line and other enhancements, reflecting the mark-to-market nature of certain investments. The
increase in net investment income from a year ago quarter is primarily the result of higher returns on alternative
investments. Performance of this asset class in the third quarter slightly exceeded our expectations of a 10% annualized
return.
To close, it was another strong quarter for our Consumer businesses, and we remain focused on executing our strategy,
maintaining a prudent risk profile and capitalizing on growth opportunities going forward.
Now I'd like to turn it back to Liz to open up the Q&A.

Elizabeth A. Werner
Thank you, Kevin. Operator, could we open up the lines for questions?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Kai Pan>: Thank you and good morning. So first question on the buyback and looks like you added another $1.5
billion to the regional authorization back in August 2013. So just wonder, is there any difference between like addition
to the existing authorization versus a new one? Just wonder, why you are taking this piecemeal approach like adding $1
billion to $2 billion each time, and you're quickly running out and have to add to it. And so, that's my first question.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Well, I think that we feel that each quarter is a good cadence to reevaluate the capital
adequacy of the company, the progress that we're making. And so we feel that $1.5 billion is a sizable commitment that
we want to make sure that we deliver on. So I think that if we change our view on the frequency with which we should
do that, we'll certainly signal that to the Street.
<Q - Kai Pan>: Okay. Then switch gear to the underwriting improvements, quite a bit improvements year-over-year,
the core underwriting P&C margin. But if you look underneath, actually the U.S. Commercial line as well as
International Consumer line, the underlying combined ratio had been pretty stable year-over-year. Given the pricing
outlook in the U.S., as well as the ongoing restructuring, like programs in Japan, do you expect like, at least in the near
term, that we will continue to see some improvements in these two segments?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: I think that the – you've picked up the right trends. We continue to see good steady
improvement in the accident year loss ratio in the Commercial sector in particular. I think that the pace of that
improvement may face some headwinds, especially in the U.S., but I think that the successful diversification to
international markets offset some of that headway. In the Consumer space, we've, as Kevin's mentioned, made some
significant progress to lower accident year loss ratios, but the challenge there is investment in infrastructure, and in
particular the integration of the Fuji Fire Marine and AIU entities in Japan, which will be ongoing for several quarters
to come. So I think that while we feel confident in our long-term goal of combined ratios south of 95, the timing on that
is not something that we are giving guidance on because we want to maintain flexibility as we execute on these major
initiatives.
<Q - Kai Pan>: All right. Thank you so much for the answers.
Operator
And moving on, we'll take a question from Josh Stirling from Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: Good morning. Thank you for taking the call. Congratulations on the quarter and we're very
glad to see the progress you're making on the accident year and obviously love the buybacks.
I was hoping, though, to dig in a bit, maybe with John or Charlie, to talk about your reserves. For context, I mean,
obviously, we're all happy that you're releasing reserves for the more recent years, but the charge you took for the older
years really held back your headline combined ratio this quarter. And after releasing reserves last quarter, I was
personally surprised. And so, you mentioned in the Q, I think, a few things, the New York labor law charge – New
York labor law claims, large construction defect, some changes to how you handle – or how you reserve for mass tort
for legacy years, as well as some more recent commercial auto.

And I'm wondering if you can help us unpack this a bit? We'd love to understand how material each of these are, what's
driving each, and sort of fundamentally, should we look at these as idiosyncratic challenges where you're sort of seeing
case reserve development from maybe some of the larger claims or is this a sign of weaker IBNR that you guys are still
addressing?
And more broadly on this point, is this a result of new facts or this a function of new processes for the actuaries? And
do you think by now – or I guess the question is, when should we expect your actuarial processes to be stable so that
you're not necessarily having changes except for when you see deterioration or improvements in the underlying
business? Thank you.
<A - John Q. Doyle>: Hey, Josh, thanks. It's John Doyle. Just quickly on the favorable side, we did see some favorable
development in Financial Lines also in Canada, in more recent years in Canada, and had favorable development in cats
as well in the quarter. Some of the older issues, more legacy issues that you referred to were construction defect, New
York labor law. On the CD side, we saw emergence in some new states that weren't consistent with the review we had
done in the prior year in the third quarter. And then in Commercial Auto, it was more recent with the uptick in the
economy, I think consistent with what some others have reported, we saw both an increase in frequency and severity in
the 2010 to 2013 accident years. We have updated our risk selection models and pricing models in Commercial Auto to
reflect the changes, and I've gotten some price of late. Maybe I'll ask Charlie to talk a little bit about some of the older
development in particular.
<A - Charles S. Shamiah>: Josh, I'd only add to what John said that, of course, in the CD space, over 50% of reported
claims come in in development years 2007 to 2010. And so that's why you're seeing most of it in the earlier accident
years. In the excess Casualty line, to give you a sense of it, the mass tort claims are very slow to develop. We see about
40% to 50% developing after 10 years, but the most substantive favorable thing that we can point to is this – there's
been a very material reduction in policy limits on an occurrence basis, which is really the risk that we would be most
concerned about in reserving. And that, for example, exceeded $50 million in the years 1997 to 2001 and has since
been reduced to below $30 million since 2011, and that's something that's very substantive that we can point to which
gives us a lot more confidence in the stability of the excess Casualty reserves.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: That's helpful color. I guess if I could just ask one other question, maybe more for Peter or
David – or Peter in particular, I loved your characterization of the goals of the firm to deliver exceptional returns, and
as you know, we think that's possible. But to do that, AIG clearly needs to finally put its legacy reserves issues to bed.
And if you look at peers, typically folks intentionally book conservative reserves and then consistently release reserves
over time to be able to manage these issues without – and sort of keep investors from sort of overly focusing on historic
challenges and making sure that you have a certain amount of conservatism in the business fronts for surprises.
And I guess the big question for you and then I'll let you guys go, do you agree that ought to be your goal? And if it is,
and if you believe that, and you would like to look like your peers, where are we in the financial and actuarial process
of getting the reserves' strength up and getting the balance sheet to be in a position where you can – where you're
sufficiently paid up for all the old legacy issues and you can finally put the legacy of under-reserving behind you?
Thank you.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Well, I respect our peers' practices, but we view our own practices as very much committed
to a true north of giving our best estimates of reserves with the information that we have at hand. We don't try and
squirrel away reserves for a rainy day. So what you see is what you get. It may lead to a little bit more quarterly EPS
volatility than everybody would like from the outside, but we think that the long-term sustainability of our strategy is
what is most important and that comes from facing the truth on a timely basis, good news and bad news. And I think
that that's a philosophical belief that I'd like to underpin the way we manage our business throughout. We want to
create sustainable, long-term growth and that requires us to face the truth on a timely basis, good news or bad.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: Okay. Thank you. Good luck.

Our next question today comes from Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Yes. Thank you. Two questions. The first is on the DIB, you had said that you were able to
extract some capital out of the DIB. I think it was about $1 billion, I'm going to double-check that. But more
importantly, going forward, should we expect to see, given the actions you're taking, continued extraction of capital
from the DIB?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Hi, Jay. Good morning, it's David. Thank you. You're correct, we released about $1 billion in
the quarter. And as I said in my remarks, we do expect to release DIB capital. It may be in the form of cash, it may be
in the form of securities or other assets over time, which the key is to release the assets – the net assets from the DIB,
get them to the Parent for monetization. I would expect – we would expect, that over the period of time between now
and 2018, roughly 80% to 90% of the NAV to be released. That's largely in line with the runoff of the liabilities , the
debt that's there. We have assets and liquidity and investment, short-term investments to cover that, those maturities at
par when due even under stress. So that's sort of the glide path. That is more heavily weighted towards 2018, which is
reflective of the concentration of maturities in that year. So that's consistent with what we have seen from the past, so
hopefully that's helpful.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Yeah. Maybe if you continue to take the actions you're taking though, I assume it would be a
little quicker than what you've just laid out.
<A - David L. Herzog>: It may be, but I'm giving you what is our best estimate at the time. But we again, we continue
to be very opportunistic in looking at the wind down activities and runoff activities of the DIB.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Okay. Fair enough. The second question, on the Consumer business, the expense ratio as
advertised is elevated this year. When do you expect to see that expense ratio level off and then begin to come down? If
you can give us a bit of a forecast for that?
<A - Kevin T. Hogan>: Yeah. Okay, thanks, Jay. As Peter mentions, an important part of the elevation in expenses is
due to the integration of Fuji Fire and Marine in Japan. And as we explained at our Tokyo Investor Day, a merger
process in Japan is quite a bit different than other places around the world where a great deal of activity has to go into
preparing for the actual legal merger, including allocating a single set of products across the companies for day one,
having all of the systems investments in UAT is done, et cetera.
And so I think that we really need to look at this as a continuation of the successful acquisition and introduction of Fuji
Fire and Marine. And as we previously indicated, we are anticipating a little bit less than half of the $250 million that
we had previously announced this year, with the remaining going forward. And as Peter pointed out, we need to look at
the long-term opportunities for the efficiencies in this business.
At the same time, also driving up some of the expenses are accruals for profit shares on the warranty business in the
U.S., which has a dramatically improved profile after the program restructuring that we undertook last year.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: So it was elevated a little bit because of that this quarter?
<A - Kevin T. Hogan>: The difference from year-over-year last year versus this year is because of the profit share
accruals. But primarily, the Japan integration is really the largest number driving the expenses. We would expect to see
a continued elevated expense as we integrate the businesses in Japan due to the unique process that exists in Japan.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Got it. Thanks.

We'll go to Tom Gallagher from Credit Suisse next.
<Q - Thomas G. Gallagher>: Good morning. First question is related to a comment in your Q, which says AIG
Property Casualty will seek approval from authorities to update the discount rate to reflect the then current level of

interest rates. I just wanted to get some clarification on that. I know last year in 4Q, you took an interest rate related
charge related to workers' comp, but it was offset by some other adjustments. But should we take that comment to
expect that you're going to take another low interest rate related charge related to workers' comp in 4Q?
<A - Charles S. Shamiah>: It's Charlie here. I would just say that, last year on excess workers' comp and primary
workers' comp business, where we admitted to you was a non-tabular rate, we disclosed that we changed the basis to
basically follow a use of the forward treasury curve, with a liquidity premium. And if you just compare the rates as of
year-end 2013 with the rates as of September 30, that reduction alone would get you to a number that maybe is $250
million to $350 million lower if rates stay at their levels by the end of the year. So we're just really disclosing a
mechanical application that's off that basis for discounting.
<Q - Thomas G. Gallagher>: So, Charlie, if rates are at year-end where they are now, it would be a $250 million to
$350 million charge that you would take related to that, where rates are relative to the original forward curve
assumption. Is that -
<A - Charles S. Shamiah>: That's correct. That's purely the effect of the drop in treasuries.
<Q - Thomas G. Gallagher>: Okay. The other question I had was related to the expense ratio on the Commercial side,
both in North American and International was lower this quarter. That actually looked pretty good and it was in
contrast to the Consumer business. Is that a trendable number or – I know there was some reference in the Q to bad
debt expense improving. So I didn't know if there was any noise there or is that a trendable expense rate on the
Commercial side?
<A - John Q. Doyle>: Yeah, I think that the noise, Tom, was from last year. We have taken some steps, as Peter
indicated in his opening comments, to operate a bit more efficiently. Had gone through a program of work during the
course of this year to reflect some of the organizational changes that we were anticipating. And so we do have fewer
folks on the team than we did at the beginning of the year and more focused and better aligned with the opportunities
we have around the world. I don't expect meaningful expense improvement in Commercial next year, but we have
made some efforts to improve the results this year.
<Q - Thomas G. Gallagher>: Okay. And then, just last question. Kevin, just in terms of the spreads in the Life and
Retirement business, those have held up pretty well. Can you comment on the level of flexibility that you have on the
crediting rate side? Obviously, core yields will go down if rates remain where they are today. So just can you give us
some color as to spread visibility just given flexibility you have on the crediting rate side?
<A - Kevin T. Hogan>: Yeah. Sure. So in the Fixed portfolios, I think we still have flexibility on about 28% of the
reserves and we remain disciplined in that respect, Tom.
<Q - Thomas G. Gallagher>: Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Our next question today is from Mike Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: Thanks. Just a couple questions here. Peter, just you mentioned the authorization and the
quarterly frequency of revisiting it. Should we take that to mean that this is kind of a perceived run rate for sort of
quarterly authorizations?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Yeah, I think that there are some exceptional items that were driven by our internal capital
optimization, in particular, the over capitalization of the Life and Retirement subsidiaries. So there's some rather
elevated dividends up from those entities to the holding company. But on the other hand, there are other items that free
up capital as well in future quarters. So I don't think we've stabilized to the point where the capital actions in any given
quarter are a good predictor of the next quarter. We want to maintain flexibility pending approval of up streaming
dividends and frankly the market environment. So in contrast to dividend policy, I think we want to maintain flexibility
of our capital management and maintain an excellent upward trend in credit perception with all of the stakeholders,

regulators, as well as rating agencies.
And as we think about the opportunities for capital, we really do have a hierarchy of priorities. First, fueling organic
growth, and we see some excellent opportunities for organic growth in our core businesses. Second, inorganic, and we
made a modest acquisition this summer, which added capabilities to our International Life business. And finally,
obviously, returning it to shareholders in the form of buybacks. But I think that as we evaluate those choices, we're
weighing out the accretive nature of all three before we decide how much to do in any given quarter.
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: I mean, should we be looking at the authorizations, historically a quarterly true up, for
what you expect over the next few months?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: I think that for the most part we like to deliver on what we promise. And I think, barring
unusual circumstances during that quarter, we want to maintain a cadence that we do what we say and we say what we
do. And I think that a lot of companies, I guess, make larger buyback authorizations and then take a long time to
execute them, and I think we'd rather be more immediate in our response.
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: Got it. Great. And then just on International Commercial, it looked like that was an area
that performed pretty well in the quarter, certainly on the expense side as well as the loss side. Anything unusual there
this quarter or is that sort of an average quarter, or a quarter without incident that we should think about?
<A - John Q. Doyle>: I think, Mike, it's mostly around the short tail loss improvement in the quarter versus the prior
year. We had a pretty sizable severe loss in Asia last year in the third quarter that didn't recur. But obviously, we play
that as it lies each and every quarter. So it's not necessarily a straight line. But we see good momentum on our
International Commercial business. We saw a pretty good growth in Asia in the third quarter, pretty good growth across
most of Europe and the Middle East. So we're pleased with the progress there.
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: And then last one, just on – David, the subsidiary dividends. You mentioned the tax
sharing payments. Any update on what to expect for sub-dividends in 2015?
<A - David L. Herzog>: We've not – it's a good question. We have not yet updated that guidance or that outlook, so to
speak. But again, they remain strong and I think the important aspect here of what I commented on with respect to the
Life and Retirement and migrating the RBC from its prior year at 568% to a normalized operating range around 470%.
And so, some of that excess capital may come out in the near term, which could influence the run rate for next year, but
the key is to get it up to the holding company where it is the most fungible and flexible. So we will be updating that in
the course of discussions as part of our fourth quarter.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: And I would just add on the comment that John made on International Commercial, that
we're seeing the benefits of the leadership that John has exercised over the last three years to take a holistic approach
globally to risk appetite and using our best expertise in a collaborative manner across borders. Our international
operations had historically had much different risk appetite than our U.S. domestic. And so I think our customers are
really seeing one AIG around the world and rewarding us, I think, with a better mix of business internationally as a
result. So we're really punching at our weight in all countries as opposed to just in the U.S.
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Moving on, we'll hear from Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Joshua D. Shanker>: Good morning, everyone. If I look at the operating results for the quarter, you had a 34%
tax rate in 3Q. When I look at your competitors, a lot of them have tried, through certain arrangements, to bring down
their tax rates as much as possible, but there's not a lot of incentive at this point for AIG to do so. With tax laws
changing worldwide, if we fast forward five years into the future, when the DTA is less valuable to you than it is today,
will AIG be at a disadvantage to its competitors in terms of their tax rates versus yours?

<A - David L. Herzog>: Josh, hi. It's David. I think we'll evaluate our tax planning strategies over the course of the
next several years. At this point, we've been very mindful of the expiry dates on the various deferred tax assets that we
have, be it the NOLs, the foreign tax credits. I think you've seen us be very proactive and effective at realizing the
benefits of our capital loss carry forward. So I think from that, you could infer that we will be prudent in trying to
optimize the total cost of operations. And so I don't want to comment any further than that. So we're mindful of it and
we understand the value of the DTAs and we'll manage the tax rate appropriately.
<Q - Joshua D. Shanker>: And following up on Josh Stirling's questions on reserves. Is this a business as usual
quarter for the actuaries? Is $0.5 billion in reserve subsidization for reserves more than 10 years old, is that a risk that
AIG shareholders should be willing to bear on an every few quarters basis or should we think that this is an exceptional
quarter? And are the actuaries compensated to get the numbers right?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: As I said earlier, I think we compensate and incentivize our actuaries to do the very best they
can to come up with their best estimate. We are investing heavily in giving them better and better tools to do so. And
I'm pleased with the progress they've made in what is a very challenging job to estimate long tail businesses that we
inherit from fairly old accident years. And so over time, I think that we will see the noise narrow as long as the tort
environment and macroeconomic factors that also drive trends and updated estimates stay relatively stable. But we are
committed to updating on a timely basis and using our best judgment to come up with best estimate and delivering that
news to you as it happens. And so we're in this together.
<Q - Joshua D. Shanker>: Good luck bringing that down in the future.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Thank you.
