Frederick Wallace Smith
Thank you, Mickey. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our discussion of results for the first quarter of fiscal
2015.
As you can see in the press release, FedEx is off to a good start for the fiscal year, thanks to strong performance at
Ground; solid volume and revenue increases at Freight; and volume and yield growth at Express. We expect continued
revenue and earnings growth in fiscal year 2015, assuming moderate global economic growth and stable fuel prices.
Clearly more customers are relying on FedEx because they appreciate the competitive advantages provided by our
portfolio of solutions.
FedEx Ground's performance was driven primarily by higher average daily volume as a result of increasing
e-commerce. At FedEx Freight, increased revenue per shipment and strong LTL shipment growth drove operating
margins higher. FedEx Express's operating income and margin improved, and we are confident we will achieve our
profit improvement program goals.
Now let me turn the call over to Mike Glenn for his thoughts on the economy, after which Alan Graf will provide more
detail on the first quarter earnings. Mike?
T. Michael Glenn
Thank you, Fred, and good morning.
With private sector demand accelerating and fiscal austerity winding down, our expectation for real GDP growth is to
average around 3% for the remainder of this year and next. Our U.S. GDP forecast is now 2.1% for calendar 2014 and
3.1% for calendar 2015. We have increased our expectations for industrial production growth to 4.1% this year and
3.8% in calendar 2015. The global economy has improved, although it certainly remains a multi-speed world. The U.S.
is leading the way and emerging markets are picking up. We expect global growth of 2.6% in calendar 2014 and 3.1%
for calendar 2015.

Now let me make a few comments regarding the company's yield performance. Excluding the impact of fuel,
year-over-year Express domestic yield increased 0.5% in the first quarter. This increase was driven by product mix and
rate and discount. The Ground package yield increased 3% year-over-year in the first quarter excluding the impact of
fuel. The Ground yield has improved steadily due to rate and discount and product mix. Excluding fuel, International
Export Express package yield increased 1.9%, which was primarily driven by product mix. And finally, excluding the
impact of fuel, yield per shipment increased 1.2% at FedEx Freight, which was driven by rate and discount and changes
in weight per shipment.
As noted in the press release, FedEx Express, FedEx Ground and FedEx Freight will be increasing shipping rates an
average of 4.9% effective January 5 of 2015. FedEx Ground will also be implementing the new dimensional weight
policy previously announced to include packages less than three cubic feet, which will also be effective on January 5.
And finally, just a couple of comments on peak season; we're expecting another record peak season in terms of delivery
volume. Peak will once again be compressed this year with Cyber Monday falling on December 1. We've been in active
dialogue with our retail and e-tail customers all year to understand their peak shipping needs and plan our operations
accordingly.
We expect more than 50,000 seasonal positions to be added for the upcoming peak across the FedEx operating
companies. This includes package handlers, helpers, drivers and other support positions. Based upon our growth
expectations and network expansion, the majority of those seasonal workers will have the opportunity to continue
working for us after the holiday season.
So now let me turn it over to Alan Graf for a few comments.
Alan B. Graf
Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. We had an outstanding first quarter with EPS of $2.10 a share and an
8.5% operating margin. Revenue growth from increased volumes and yields drove a significant increase in earnings for
each of our transportation segments. Our sales team is executing our improved revenue quality strategy at a very high
level. In Q1 we repurchased 5.3 million shares of FedEx common stock and completed the share repurchase program
that we announced in FY 2014. The repurchase program had a $0.15 per share year-over-year positive impact on our
EPS this quarter.
To improve the transparency of our results, this year we ceased allocating the cost associated with our corporate
headquarters division through our transportation segments. These costs are now included in corporate eliminations and
other in our segment reporting and reconciliations. A reserve for a legal contingency was recorded at corporate in Q1
causing the increase in these unallocated costs versus the prior year.
Looking at our segments, at Express operating income increased 35% and operating margin increased 130 basis points.
Revenue growth in our U.S. and International Export Package business drove higher income partially offset by higher
maintenance expense and lower freight revenues. The profit improvement programs also contributed to the
improvement in operating income for Express. U.S. domestic volumes increased 5% in Q1 driven by both Overnight
Box and deferred service offerings. International Economy volumes increased 3%. International Priority volumes were
up 1%. Overall International Export revenue per package increased 3%.
Turning to Ground, average daily volume increased 6% during the quarter from continued growth in our Home
Delivery service and Commercial business. SmartPost average daily volume was down 10% due to lower volume from
a major customer. However, SmartPost revenue per package increased 10% from rate increases and improved customer
mix, partially offset by higher postage costs. Volumes increased 8% excluding the changes in shipping patterns from a
major customer.
Ground segment operating income increased 13% and operating margin increased to 18.4% on higher revenue per
package and volumes. Higher network expansion costs partially offset Ground's increase in operating income, as we
continued to invest in the high-margin, high-ROIC growing Ground businesses.

At Freight, it was a great quarter, with operating margin of 10.4%, up 340 basis points from last year. Operating
income and operating margin increased from higher less-than-truckload revenue per shipment, higher average daily
LTL shipments, and solid cost management. Freight saw higher demand for both its Priority and Economy service
offerings in the quarter, which drove an 11% increase in average daily LTL shipments.
Turning to our outlook and based on the economic outlook that Mike talked about, we reaffirm our FY 2015 earnings
per share forecast of $8.50 to $9.00 a share. Our outlook depends on key external factors, including fuel prices and the
pace of improvement in the global economy. Revenue and earnings growth are expected to continue into the second
quarter and the remainder of FY 2015, driven by ongoing improvements at all of our operating companies along with
continued volume and yield improvements.
Profit improvement programs that we announced in FY 2013 will add to our FY 2015 results as we continue to execute
on them. FY 2015 will see the full benefit of the voluntary buyout program, which was completed in May. We should
also see additional cost savings from sourcing and procurement. Every new 767 replacement aircraft should add about
$10 million annually to profits. We have four 767s in service currently and expect to have another 12 delivered by the
end of FY 2015. There are many other initiatives that we are working on at Express. In short, we are progressing as
planned with the profit improvement programs. We had an excellent quarter and we are looking forward to a very good
year.
Now we will open up the call for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go on and take our first question from Rob Salmon with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Hey, good morning. How are you doing, guys?
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Good.
<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: I'll let someone else have at the guidance given the strong results in the first quarter, and I'll
direct this question to you, Fred. I'm trying to think about the significant growth that the industry keeps talking about in
terms of wide-body passenger aircraft and how you guys think about your aircraft renewal opportunity given the
incremental capacity that's coming on and your experiences using third-party line haul to date in the International
Economy package and your thoughts in terms of where these aircraft are going to be coming on in different lanes, if
that provides you the opportunity to potentially reduce the asset intensivity of the aircraft fleet over time.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: I think it's early; it's one quarter. Our guidance does show a 26% to 33% increase in EPS, which
is a little bit less than the first quarter. The second half will be a little bit tougher comparison as we really start to hit our
stride in the second half of FY 2014. So I'm comfortable with where we are now, and we'll talk about it again in
December.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Hartford with Robert W. Baird.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Let me go in and answer the question that was just asked before you make the
question about the fleet planning. Dave will put some color on this, but basically our strategy is to have an unparallel
proprietary Priority network, and then we do use the underbellies, as you mentioned, for our Economy service. And we
are very cognizant of the lift that's out there, that's planned to be out there, and it's a very sophisticated planning process
that goes into it that determines what sort of aircraft that we acquire.

Having said that, I think Alan has made this point. We're not buying any airplanes other than to modernize our fleet.
And these airplanes are very profit accretive, as Alan mentioned to you, and the 777s in the international business are
just unprecedented in the type of operating capabilities and competitive advantages we have. So let me turn it over to
Dave to put more color on it.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Thanks, Fred, and it's a great question. Our 777s provide us the global powerhouse that
FedEx Express is the best in the world. We have the latest cutoff times and the earliest arrival times all over the world
coming out of Asia into the United States, into the Middle East, into Europe. The 777s are replacing the MD11s. The
MD11s are coming back to the United States. The 767s are actually replacing, as Fred pointed out, older used airplanes.
And we're getting tremendous fuel efficiency, operating efficiency, maintenance efficiency out of the 767s back here in
the United States. So the combination of both of these planes into our fleet has provided us a tremendous opportunity to
grow our profits and improve our service around the world.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: Now that other question.
Operator
From Ben Hartford again with Robert W. Baird.
<Q - Ben J. Hartford>: Hey, good morning, guys. I guess, Alan, can I get your perspective on – piggybacking on that?
To the extent that CapEx is going to remain focused on fleet replacement and not growth and you guys continue to
execute on this plan within Express, clearly, you have the cash flow capability coming. You're done with the buyback.
Can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about managing excess cash going forward between the dividend and
a potential new share repurchase authorization? Thanks.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: I don't have anything to say today about a new share repurchase authorization other than the fact
that we talk about this at every single board meeting and we will continue to do that. We have stated that we want to
continue to increase our dividend. We understand our dividend yield is subpar. Part of that is because of the
outstanding stock performance, but we will continue to increase our dividends at some level as our strategy and
objective, and so we'll see where we get. We're very pleased with the stock buyback program that we recently executed,
and we'll keep our eye on that as well but that's a board decision.
Operator
Thank you. We'll go next to Chris Wetherbee with Citi.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Great, thanks. Good morning. I wanted to touch a little bit on the pricing environment when
you think about turning the page into calendar 2014 with dimensional pricing coming in and obviously the GRIs
announced last night some of them were a bit higher than last year. LTL is a little bit faster than the annual cycle. I just
wanted to get a rough sense when you think about across the spectrum of your products and capacity being a little bit
tighter. How should we be thinking about the pricing environment that sets up for calendar 2015?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: FedEx bases all pricing decisions on current market conditions, the economic environment
and things of that nature and we feel the changes that we put in place are appropriate. They allow us to continue to
invest in the value that we're providing our customers and of course always our objective is to strike the right balance
between yield improvement and volume growth to contribute to the bottom line, and I think we have successfully done
that. So that's really the backdrop on which all these pricing decisions are made and we feel very comfortable with the
announcement yesterday. We think it's appropriate given the market conditions and the economic environment and
again, our sales team is executing very crisply on the strategy to strike that right balance.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Great, good morning, a solid start on the year here. Can you just talk about the progress of
maybe some of the expense cost reductions and the profit improvement plan in terms of the SG&A and the progress of
the facility, some reallocation you had talked about or consolidations? And then did you mention there was a one-time
charge within the corporate allocation? Can you delve on that too? Thanks.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Ken, I'll start and I'll turn it over to Dave. I am very pleased with where we are on our cost
reduction program. We're basically exceeding it in every category. Had we not done what we did, our costs would've
been significantly higher this quarter than they were and our earnings would've been a lot lower. I'm also proud of the
fact that we've done it. We've still been able to maintain and increase our service levels and not give up on that which is
a very integral part of what we try to do every day. We'll continue to work hard on that. We continue to find additional
opportunities everywhere. Everyone is focused on it. We know we have a profit improvement program to hit but also I
think we are getting to world-class in terms of cost management, in terms of our management, so I'm going to turn it
over to Dave.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Thanks, Alan. I'm extremely proud of our Express team around the world. They've executed
flawlessly. As has been mentioned twice already, we're on plan, projected to be on target for the run out rate in FY
2015. We had a solid quarter and going forward, we're expecting the same kinds of results in terms of exceeding our
plan.
On top of that, I wanted to say that in terms of the parts of the profit improvement plan, you mentioned the voluntary
buyout, the SG&A, we're 100% in on that already so that's already rolling into FY 2015. Our fleet modernization is
rolling out as we had planned and, as Alan pointed out, probably ahead of plan in many if not all of these categories.
So, we have our focus and we have our eyes set on achieving those kinds of results going forward. We know what's
expected and our team is executing.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: We did take a legal reserve at corporate in the first quarter and it was for an immaterial amount.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Kelly Dougherty with Macquarie Capital.
<Q - Kelly A. Dougherty>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow up on the pricing
question earlier, especially in light of what we've seen from the Post Office recently. I guess two things, how do you
help us think about the magnitude of the yield impact from the price increases and the DIM weight changes? And then
just some thoughts on what you think about the move by the Post Office to aggressively cut price to gain share and how
that plays into your market share strategy and the outlook for margins at Ground?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: First, let me say we don't comment on specific pricing actions by our competitors. We make
all of our pricing decisions independent based upon market conditions and economic conditions, as I mentioned earlier.
Having said that, we have a tremendous portfolio of services, which allow us to effectively serve the e-commerce
market. I think we've demonstrated the ability to develop a strategy that really targets the right kind of growth within
the e-commerce segment that contributes to the bottom line and supports our yield strategy. So we're very comfortable
with our strategy there. We're very comfortable with our growth opportunities there.
Regarding the specific impact of decisions like dimensional weight, it would be extremely difficult to speculate on the
impact of that, because we're working with customers right now to alter their packaging so that they have more
efficient packaging, which is good for sustainability and certainly fits with our corporate social responsibility programs.
So as those changes are made and let me remind you we announced that change six months early to give customers
plenty of time to respond to that and many are taking advantage of our packaging lab to redesign packaging to be more
efficient, which we like. So, at this stage, it would be impossible to speculate on that, but let me just say, we're very
comfortable with our position going forward.

<A - Henry J. Maier>: Hi, Kelly. This is Henry Maier. Ground margins in the first quarter were reflective of better
revenue quality, cost control, and ensuring every package was in the right network. We expect to continue to deliver
industry-leading margins, and as I've told you on this call before, the Ground team would not be satisfied with anything
less than margins in the high teens.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Scott A. Schneeberger>: Thanks, good morning. Just following up on that last point in the Ground margins, very
nice revenue growth, pretty consistent with what we were expecting. But those margins were nice. You just hit a few of
the areas. I know there's some OpEx going on with network expansion. Was there any change to an ebb or flow in the
quarter? And how do you anticipate that going forward as an impact on margins? Thanks.
<A - Henry J. Maier>: I don't think there was any change. We expect to spend roughly $1.2 billion in CapEx this
year; 85% – 90% of it is all for capacity. We are right on plan in terms of our plans to bring those new facilities on.
And I think as we said in the past, we manage roughly 150 real estate projects a year in anticipation of peak.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Greene with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Hi, there. Good morning. Mike, can I ask you about the International side? We saw the package
volumes turn up a bit. In your experience, do product launches like iPhone 6 or these sorts of things have a material
effect on that part of the business for FedEx? Or is it that this is just an iteration of a new product, so it wouldn't have
the same kind of effect that we've seen in the past?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: It has some impact, but more in the area that it relates to are FedEx Trade Networks
company. There has been a change in the way companies position inventory for product launches. There's much more
forward deployment of that inventory, using forwarding capacity to stage product in the U.S. And then we work with
companies to then deploy the product to either retail locations or individual consumers.
So those product launches are now more likely to show up in the domestic businesses and there really are surges. I
mean there are one- to two-day surges now based upon the product launch. Now, having said all that there is the
aftermarket affect of accessories and things of that nature, which do flow through the system but don't have the impact
of the product launch itself in terms of number of units. So you really kind of need to think differently about those
product launches now as much more of the product is forward-deployed.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: This is Fred Smith. We've got a couple of questions over the Internet. One from Art
Hatfield with Raymond James; how should we think about margin goals for Express. Given the changed corporate cost
allocation, I don't think that the latter has much effect on what our goal is. Our goal is to have all three of our major
transport sectors operating at double-digit margins, and we're confident that we can do so. Obviously in this quarter we
had two out of the three, but significant progress at Express.
Another question from Shelby Holiday at Bloomberg; in addition to adding seasonal employees, what else is FedEx
doing to ensure a smooth peak season in 2014? I think if we answer that question fully, we'd spend the next two hours
talking to you about it. The peak planning begins in January or February each year after peak season. There are just
scores of things that are done at each of the FedEx operating companies to accommodate a smooth peak season.
Contrary to some of the popular press, we actually had an outstanding peak season last year, with the exception of a
couple of weather events and the CEOs have reported at the SMC that they are prepared for peak season this year and
hopefully the weather will be accommodating.

There's a question about the long-term strategy for handling the shift to B2C. I think Mike Glenn answered that quite
frankly. We've done a great job of understanding what parts of the B2C business make sense and that are profitable.
We've got a broad portfolio of solutions. Our customers want to buy these solutions in great profusion. And then
entering into emerging markets, of course, as you know, we bought a wonderful company in Mexico. We bought a
great company in Brazil. We have an outstanding operation in India. We have an excellent domestic operation in China
and recently received after a long delay the licenses to continue to grow that business, so we have a major focus on
emerging markets as well. So we'll now take other questions from the moderator.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Thanks, good morning. In response to an earlier question on returns to shareholders, the
dividend hike, and a potential buyback and that you are consistently talking about it at the board meetings, I was just
wondering if you could remind us when the next board meeting will take place.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Allison, our annual meeting is a week from Monday.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Okay, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. So, Alan, one of the questions earlier about the profit
improvement plan, I think you had said that you're now tracking ahead of the plan or something to that effect. That
seems to be a change from some of the commentary you were giving last year, and so I want to understand that a little
bit more in terms of what's changing to give you confidence that you're now above plan? Is it additional costs that
you're finding? Is it maybe you think pricing can become a bigger part of this? Or what is really driving the confidence
that you now can be better than the $1.6 billion?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Hi, Scott. I think what I said was on the cost side we were ahead. There's still a long way to go
here, and we just reported a 5.4% margin. We've got a long way to go to hit this profit improvement plan. So I'm very
pleased on the cost side.
As I mentioned in my opening remarks, I'm extremely pleased with our execution of our improved revenue quality
strategy, which we've all talked about and continue to talk about on these calls and are working very hard inside the
company. We need to get paid adequately for the services that we're providing. We have stabilized the Express
network. We're not expanding it. And we are continuing to work to improve the revenue quality on those international
flights, which is a key part of our profit improvement program, but it's also probably one of the hardest parts of the
profit improvement program because we don't see the global trade situation today as we did in October of 2012 when
we announced the program. So we're doubling down on everything else, and I'm very confident on the cost side. I am
confident that we are on track at PIP, but we've got seven more quarters ahead of us.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Thomas Kim>: Thanks. Can you talk a little bit more about the status of international Express markets by region?
We're seeing Asia seemingly rebounding nicely. Europe appears much more mixed and some of the data actually looks
like it's rolling over. And I guess if you could comment on to what extent you're seeing different commodities drive the
growth, that would also be appreciated.

I guess further to one of the earlier questions, to what extent is the tech launches that we're seeing driving the growth?
And do you think that there's anything beyond tech that's going to sustain the growth? And I appreciate your comments
that it's – I'm referring to your comments from perhaps other companies that continuously refer to the rebound, and
particular out of Asia, about tech launches driving some of the growth that some of your peers have been seeing.
Thanks.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: This is Dave Bronczek. I'll let Mike go back and talk about the tech launches. But in terms
of our regions around the world, they've all performed very well. As you pointed out, Asia-Pacific rebounded nicely for
us. Europe is performing very well. We've opened up 109 stations in the last two years, and the business is performing
exactly as we had hoped it would. And I think around the world, we're very pleased with the progress we're making. I
do think Alan's point is right. The global economy is still probably softer than we would like to see it, but that being
said, we're performing well in it.
On the international revenue side, our yields are strong and our volume is strong, especially in our box volume. It's also
strong in our domestic business. Our box volume and overnight box is up 9%, deferred boxes are up 7%, the overnight
letters is what's down slightly. So when you look at our mix of products and our drivers of profit improvement, that's all
benefiting us.
I should add one other thing, one that you can see and one that you can't see probably. In aircraft maintenance, it's a
timing issue for us, and you can see that it's our number one expense item in terms of incremental expense year over
year. On fuel, and we talk about fuel all the time and I know you all do, it was slightly positive. It was not material, and
I think that's important to note.
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Let me comment again just to make sure there's clear understanding of my comments
regarding product launches. Over the last couple of years, there has been a change in the strategy regarding product
launches. This is not a FedEx strategy, let me be clear. This is a market strategy. More of these companies are electing
to build time into their product launch planning to allow them to take advantage of more traditional freight networks to
forward-deploy the product and move the product into the United States or other markets and stage that inventory for
the launch itself. So that is changing the mix of traffic. And this is not only affecting FedEx; it's affecting the entire
transportation market in terms of how this product is forward-deployed. So I want to make sure I'm clear about that.
Now having said all that, once the product launch occurs, then other inventory moves through more traditional
channels; and specifically, accessories move through more traditional channels. So the real impact of the change in
product launches is the removal from the International perspective of the large bubble that took place early in the
product launch cycle, and that has now smoothed out quite a bit. The bubble then takes place as a result of that, for
example, in the U.S. When the product starts moving through the U.S. network to achieve advance or to fulfill advance
orders either through the retail stores or direct to individuals.
So it has been a change in strategy by the companies that are launching these products and obviously we're responding
well, and we're very comfortable with our position because of the portfolio of services that we provide. Just quickly,
you asked about the segments that were driving international growth. These are typically consumer-driven services,
manufacturing durables of which these high-tech products would be part of that. So those are the areas where we see a
lot of growth and wholesale durables as well.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Good morning, everyone, and congratulations on the good quarter. I think this
question is going to be for Fred or for Mike. We talk a lot about trying to shape customer behavior, with the DIM
weight change trying to get smaller boxes into the system. But wouldn't one of the best levers be some form of
real-time pricing where you can really start to manage the peaks and the valleys in the network? And what's really
limiting the industry from shifting to more of a real-time pricing model?

<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Again, we work with our customers very specifically about the pricing that they have on a
contractual basis based upon the forecasted demand and the volume that they anticipate. That's one reason why
December 26 we start focusing on the next year for peak season. So when we go into a contractual negotiation with a
customer, if that customer has a peaking factor, for example, of three times, that would imply that they will give us
about three times as much volume, for example, in the month of December that they would the other 11 months.
That information is known on the front end and our negotiations are based upon that. So this is not a situation where we
get surprised by the lumpiness, if you will, of a customer's volume, we know that going into a negotiation. So
obviously we won't rule out other pricing tactics. We announced a change to our DIM weight policy based upon the
change in market conditions and the economic environment and I'm sure there'll be future changes along those lines.
But I want to be real clear, we have a great deal of understanding and data to support pricing decision and contractual
negotiations based upon the forecasted volume that customers give us. A lot of our discounts are also volume-based, so
if the volume goes up or down, we adjust those discounts accordingly. So there's a tremendous amount of science that
goes into revenue management and we are world-class at that. Our pricing science group is outstanding.
And that's really one of the reasons why that data feeds our growth strategy and that's one of the reasons why we've
been able to sustain a balance between volume growth and yield improvements contributed to bottom line expansion.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Thank you very much and congratulations. Alan, I just wanted to kind of take 10 steps back
here. I mean you raised your global IP outlook. You had a very strong quarter. Fuel prices seem to be a little bit better,
costs are ahead of plan, yet the guidance remains in line. Can you help me connect the dots on that?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: When I gave you this guidance at the end of last year, we had factored all that into the guidance.
So, as I said, we're very pleased with the first quarter; second half was a little bit tougher. I have no idea about peak
season weather yet, which could swing us quite a bit. So, as I said, we'll have more to say about this at the end of
December when we have that basically mostly behind us and we'll see where that is.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein Research.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Hey. Thanks for taking the question; Mike, a question for you on the domestic yields.
David mentioned that the box volume was up 9%. That's the best quarterly figure that I can see back in my model and I
was just try to get a sense for what the underlying rate development was and what you think is really driving that?
Whether it's macro, maybe response to lower prices, any other shifts that are going in there to drive the outstanding
volume growth in overnight box?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: There are a couple of issues that are in play here. One is Express is certainly benefiting from
the growth of e-commerce, which we've said previously on this call. Secondarily, as part of the profit improvement
plan, Dave Bronczek and I along with our teams have really developed a targeted growth strategy that is targeting
specific amounts of growth opportunities at targeted yields, which we feel if we're able to achieve that it's going to
benefit his bottom line and our sales team is executing that strategy perfectly.
So, Dave, and I have worked very closely together. We monitor all the opportunities, all the pipelines to make sure that
we're achieving our desired goals. And again, hats off to our sales team for executing that strategy.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Bruce Chan with Stifel.
<Q - Bruce Chan>: Thank you, gentlemen. You alluded to another compressed peak season in your prepared remarks.
I'm wondering with what's been going on over on the West Coast with the ILWU, it seems that a lot of shippers have
been pre-positioning inventory and I don't just mean tech product launches here. I'd like to get your view on whether
that should affect your volumes going into peak, and as far as last-minute inventory supplements whether that's been a
factor in your preparations? Thank you.
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: This is Mike again. It's certainly an issue that we're monitoring, but I would say at this stage
based upon the feedback from our customers, we don't expect that to have a material impact on our peak season at this
point.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from David Campbell with Thompson, Davis & Company.
<Q - David P. Campbell>: Thanks for taking the question. Some of the international companies see China as more of
an import freight business, much more of an import business than an export business as it has been the last 10 years. Do
you see the same thing going on there? And of course that import business has a lot to do with the intra-Asia growth. I
just wondered how you are positioning the company to participate in that growth.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Thanks, David. This is Dave Bronczek. As you know, we've been in China for over two
decades now and – three decades now. We've had growth in our international segment and that continues to grow. The
777s continue to add more value to customers all around the world with later cutoffs there in China feeding the rest of
the world. We have an excellent intra-Asia network off of our hub in Guangzhou, China and then we have a domestic
business in China. So we're actually playing in and succeeding in every segment of the Chinese marketplace, and
thankfully, we've been in business there for a long time and have a great reputation, a great management team. And so
to your question, we're seeing international export growth, we're seeing domestic intra-region growth and domestic
China growth.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: This is Alan. I have a question here from Ryan Novak with Citadel, about the $35 million
year-over-year increase in the new corporate eliminations and other line. That is largely the result of the legal reserve
that we took. We are being maniacal about our corporate headquarters' cost and trying to keep them down, which is
why we are now reporting it separately, so that we can show you transparency on the progress we have there as well.
Sometimes those costs tend to get lost in chargebacks and now we're focused on it.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Kelly Dougherty with Macquarie Capital.
<Q - Kelly A. Dougherty>: Hi. Thanks. Just wanted to get your thoughts on the pace of trade down from Priority to
Economy and how it might differ domestically versus internationally. Do you think we've had a point where there's
stabilization, I mean, the delta between the two has kind of leveled out at a good level that we can assume going
forward? And then how are you assuming this trend as part of the Express profit improvement plan?
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Well, this is Dave Bronczek. I'll start off and then Mike can add some color. What we feel
at Express and FedEx is the same trend and the same way of business conducted around the world as it is in the United
States. People look for different means of transportation and we have them all at FedEx in our portfolio. So we're not
surprised. We're actually right in line. We've actually tweaked our model, if you will, so we can take advantage of the
global economic activity in the deferred space and that's performing well for us in the Express overnight space. Very
much like the United States, we think the global marketplace is the same.

<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Let me just say our mission is to work with customers to deliver solutions to them leveraging
the entire bundle of services that we provide in order to deliver the value that they need to improve their performance.
So when they win, we win. So we really look for opportunities to work with customers to make their supply chains as
efficient as possible. A lot of the transition has occurred. Would I say it's over? No. Customers are always looking for
ways to tweak their supply chains, but clearly I think the economic situation starting in 2008 drove a lot of that.
Obviously as the economy improves, I think you'll probably see less focus on that and hopefully more focus on growth
from our customers, but clearly they'll continue to look to refine their supply chains.
"<A – [05F5TR-E]Fred Smith – FedEx Corp.>: Let me just add a point to this because I believe this has been an area of
confusion on the part of a lot of people for a long time. What drives the selection of Express over Ground is not the fact
that there's a Ground alternative and an Express alternative; it's the nature of the product being shipped and the need of
the shipper that's making the transaction. So a defibrillator going for an operation is going to go Express. The plug-in of
a charger for a new product that might be introduced by the electronics industry is almost certainly going to go Ground.
So as the market grows, there is a percentage of the traffic by virtue of the nature of the product and the consequences
of the item being delivered in a short time will pay Express rates for Express service.
And for some reason, several years ago there was a large body of thought that everything was going to go Ground.
We've tried to tell people that that wasn't the case, and I think that what you see in the marketplace now is a more stable
picture as some of this trade-down has occurred, as Mike mentioned. But there's a certain percentage of the parcel
traffic and the freight traffic, whether it's international, domestic, it's going to go Express, and we have the greatest
Express company in the world. And we've mentioned over and over again, we intend to get the Express company back
up to earning at the level that it should.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Comments on the call sound quite positive regarding international activity, and
year-over-year comps and international volume and yield are positive. You've mentioned you expect international trade
to continue to grow, although you wish faster, but I've also noted that Fred speaks a fair bit on risk of heightened
protectionism. And I guess I wonder if you're detecting some relief. Or can you give some insight into sources of
expected trade despite these obstacles?
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: You're correct. I think we had on the investor website several speeches I gave last
spring. The reality is that perhaps the most important thing that's been done since the end of World War II was
American leadership to open up markets and lift literally billions of people out of poverty. It's the American consumer
combined with the Chinese liberalization that has created this incredible prosperity for hundreds of millions of Chinese.
India began to become more market-oriented in the 1990s. Brazil did.
But recently as I point out in those speeches, there's been a real increase in the number of protectionist measures around
the world and a lack of leadership on the part of the United States in moving towards more open markets. As you know,
there was just a very disappointing result in the negotiations that was in essence vetoed by India. And so the United
States will have to resume that mantle of leadership, get trade promotion authority, really push these various initiatives
that are underway. There are four major initiatives, treaty negotiations the United States is involved in today. But
absent that, I think you're going to see a very difficult environment for trade around the world if these protectionist
measures continue to proliferate.

<Q - Thomas Kim>: Thanks for letting me ask another question. Alan, I was wondering about the dividend side. Can
you help us just frame about how you're thinking about what would be deemed adequate? Are you thinking about more
of a yield, or are you thinking about more of a payout ratio?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Both. I think we just need to continue to improve it until we get up into a range where people who
are interested in dividends and dividend yields would be more interested in our shares than they are today. It's what
Mickey is after from me about every five minutes, so we'll continue to do that. And I think every year for many number
of years now we've increased at our May/June board meeting, and we'll take it up again then this year.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey, thanks for the follow-up, so one for Henry on the Ground side. So we saw margin
expansion for the first time in a bunch of quarters. Are you comfortable that we're through the overhang of the capital
expansion costs and we can start seeing Ground margin improvement?
And do you see any impact from the outcome in California on the contractor side that could lead to more legal costs or
could lead you to change the contractor model?
<A - Henry J. Maier>: The answer to the first question is that we've probably got another year of increased capital
before we're over the hump here in terms of building out the capacity we view we need going forward in the network.
Most of that expenditure is in the area of hubs and automated satellites. All of our hubs are automated. I think the thing
that's important for the folks on the call to understand is we are expanding the footprint of our auto satellites pretty
aggressively here because of the capacity it gives us, the flexibility it gives us, particularly when we see volumes spike
up and peak, and the ability long term of those facilities to lower our costs both in terms of lower line haul expense and
fewer handlings. So I think there's one more year here, and then you'll see CapEx go back to something that we would
consider to be "normal." I'm going to let Chris answer the question on California.
<A - Christine P. Richards>: Hi, Scott. In light of legal and regulatory developments in several states, we've taken a
number of steps in recent years to enhance the operating agreements with all the independent businesses that contract
with Ground to provide transportation services. These independent businesses agree to remain incorporated and in good
standing in the states in which they do business and to treat their personnel as employees and to comply with all
applicable federal and state laws. That being said, we have announced we are transitioning to new independent service
provider agreements in California, Oregon, Washington, and Nevada.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Hey, great. Good morning. Just to follow up on the charge that you mentioned before, is
that anything related to the California move to contractors as employees? Or is that a completely separate and being a
large charge can you maybe provide some details on that?
<A - Christine P. Richards>: Ken, it's Chris Richards. While we do not agree with the Ninth Circuit's decision, we
have established an accrual for the estimated probable loss in these cases that was required to be recognized pursuant to
applicable accounting standards.

<Q - Robert H. Salmon>: Yeah, thanks for the follow up. Henry, just to piggyback on Scott's earlier question; with the
changes that have been announced in California, should we be thinking about any sort of incremental cost to the
company as you execute there? Or can this be like some of the changes in the past where we actually saw margins
expand due to efficiency that you gained?
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Well, Rob, we've currently transitioned to 17 states. We don't expect any change here. Any
additional costs we would see in terms of the transition would be immaterial. So I guess the answer is, no, I don't think
you should read anything into this. In fact if you look at the 17 states that we previously transitioned, our service
actually improved; so, no.
