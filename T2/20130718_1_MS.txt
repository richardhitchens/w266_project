MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Celeste Mellet Brown
Good morning. This is Celeste Mellet Brown, Head of Investor Relations. Welcome to our second quarter earnings call.
Today's presentation may include forward-looking statements which reflect management's current estimates or beliefs
and are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially. The presentation may also
include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Please see our SEC filings at morganstanley.com for reconciliation of
such non-GAAP measures to the comparable GAAP figures and for a discussion of additional risks and uncertainty that
may affect the future results of Morgan Stanley. This presentation, which is copyrighted by Morgan Stanley and may
not be duplicated or reproduced without our consent, is not an offer to buy or sell any security or instrument.
I will now turn the call over to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, James Gorman.
James Patrick Gorman
Thank you, Celeste. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We will again review the progress we've
made towards the six strategic priorities we delineated in January that would drive our return on equity and return on
tangible equity excluding DVA to greater than 10% and 12% respectively.
We're pleased with the progress we made during the quarter and we met or exceeded several of the goals. Let me just
go through them quickly. First, was to acquire 100% of the Wealth Management joint venture. As you know, we closed
on the final 35% of that joint venture on the last business day of the quarter. As we've taken you through the benefits
numerous times, I'm not going to spell them out again, suffice it to say however, the deal was a game changer for this
firm and for our shareholders now and for decades to come.
Secondly, we put out a goal to achieve Wealth Management margins through expense management and through
revenue growth. In addition to owning 100% of the business, one of the key drivers for ROE upside is the revenue and

margin upside in the Wealth Management business. Both were high this quarter. The margin of 18.5% represented the
fifth consecutive quarter of margin improvement excluding nonrecurring costs associated with the integration in Q3
2012. We reached our highest margin level since the first quarter of 2008.
In addition, we increased our margin goals for the Wealth Management business at our financials conference in June to
20% to 22% by the end of 2015 without the benefit of higher rates or markets and more than 23% if markets or rates
increase. Why the increase? The margins reflect the simple math of the upside from 100% ownership with ongoing
investment in the business using the first quarter of 2013 results as a base.
Our third objective was to significantly reduce RWAs in fixed income and commodities. We continue to make progress
regarding our fixed income RWA reductions, ending the quarter at $239 billion down from the first quarter. We
continue to expect fixed income RWAs to be below $200 billion by the end of 2016.
Our fourth goal was to drive expenses lower in 2013, 2014 and beyond. We're on track to meet our expense reduction
targets and Ruth will take you through these in more detail. As you can clearly see, our expense ratios have improved
as we said they would with revenue growth.
Our fifth point was to grow earnings through Morgan Stanley specific opportunities. We recently received
approximately $16 billion of deposits in the initial wave due to us now that we own 100% of Wealth Management. The
team is executing against our plan to prudently deploy those deposits in support of loan growth in both Institutional
Securities and Wealth Management.
Now that we own 100%, we can execute on more of the initiatives we have in place to better align Institutional and
Wealth Management including a deeper partnership between the businesses and their trading desks. Because order flow
is no longer split with our former partner, we expect deeper and more efficient markets for both our institutional and
retail clients as well as greater revenue opportunity for fixed income in addition to the order flow benefit we discussed
for you for Wealth Management. We're also looking forward to launching new products and increasing the efficiency
of firm funding.
So our sixth point asks what did it all add up to? Well despite difficult markets, our result this quarter evidenced
strength and resilience. Revenues in all of our major businesses were up double digits year-over-year with Institutional
Securities excluding DVA up 40% and Investment Management up 48%.
In addition, we're pleased to commence the share repurchase we announced this morning which will offset some of the
dilution relating to employee stock programs and also benefit ROE. We recently received a non-objection from the
Federal Reserve to return 1% of our Tier 1 capital and will execute on the buyback in the forthcoming quarters.
We've been on a long journey to generate stronger, more sustainable, long-term returns with businesses that balance
each other in volatile markets. With the acquisition of 100% of Wealth Management, that business model is solidly in
place. Our Wealth Management business complements our leading Institutional Securities business and the adjacencies
across the entire platform will drive upside for all of Morgan Stanley.
We have strengths across areas of fixed income and are consistently in the top three in equity underwriting and M&A
league tables with increasing momentum in fixed income underwriting. Our Investment Banking franchise is a leader
globally and we demonstrated the power of our footprint with important cross-border deal announcements in the
quarter.
I'd now like to draw particular attention to our institutional equities franchise, which consistently ranks top two globally
in market and wallet share. In the second quarter we continued to execute extremely well against challenging markets.
In the cash product, we benefited from a hybrid voice and electronic model centered around integrated client coverage.
We approached this business with the delivery of research driven content, market insight and state of the art trading
technology to a wide variety of client types. Our electronic offerings spends cash, synthetic cash and derivatives and
has more than doubled market share over the last three years. In equity derivatives, our team is capitalizing on the
investments we've made over the last several years driven by the breadth of our client reach, deepening relationships
and partnerships across the firm and ongoing strong risk management.

And last but not least, in prime brokerage with significant balances, we have a practice focused on market access,
service excellence and innovative solutions for clients all leading to an outstanding performance by Institutional
Equities this quarter. With Morgan Stanley's global reach we're confident there is continued upside for this business
and for the firm.
Thank you and I will now turn the call over to Ruth and look forward to your questions later on.
Ruth Porat
Good morning. I will provide both GAAP results and results excluding the effect of DVA. We have provided
reconciliations in the footnotes to the earnings release to reconcile these non-GAAP measures. The impact of DVA in
the quarter was $175 million with $114 million in equity sales and trading and $61 million in fixed income sales and
trading. Excluding the impact of DVA, firm-wide revenues were $8.3 billion down approximately 2% versus the first
quarter. The effective tax rate from continuing operations for the second quarter was 31%.
Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders excluding DVA were
approximately $720 million which included a negative adjustment of $152 million related to the acquisition of the
remaining 35% stake in the Wealth Management joint venture.
Earnings from continuing operations per diluted share excluding DVA were $0.37 after preferred dividends. EPS
included a negative adjustment of $0.08 per share from the acquisition of the remainder of the Wealth Management
joint venture. On a GAAP basis including the impact of DVA, firm-wide revenues for the quarter were $8.5 billion.
Earnings from continuing operations applicable to Morgan Stanley common shareholders were $831 million. Reported
earnings from continuing operations per diluted share also inclusive of the negative adjustment of $0.08 were $0.43 per
share after preferred dividends. Book value at the end of the quarter was $31.48 per share. Tangible book value was
$26.27 per share reflecting a reduction of $1.49 due to the completion of the acquisition of the Wealth Management
joint venture partially offset by earnings.
Turning to the balance sheet. Our total assets were $806 billion at June 30, essentially flat versus last quarter. Deposits
were $82 billion, basically unchanged from the prior quarter. Quarter end deposits did not reflect the first tranche of
deposits that are transferred to Morgan Stanley in conjunction with the acquisition of the remainder of the joint venture.
The initial deposits come in on a lagged basis was $16 billion transferred this week. We will receive the remaining
deposits on a monthly basis through the middle of 2015.
Our liquidity reserve at the end of the quarter was $181 billion compared with $186 billion at the end of the first
quarter. The decline was driven by a reduction in bank liquidity as we deployed excess liquidity to support loan growth.
Although our calculations are not final we believe that our Tier 1 common ratio under Basel I will be approximately
11.8% and our Tier 1 capital ratio will be approximately 14.1%.
Risk-weighted assets under Basel I and including the final market risk rules are expected to be approximately $404
billion at June 30. Reflecting our best assessment and expectations of the recently received Federal Reserve rules, our
pro forma Tier 1 common ratio under Basel III was 9.9% as of the end of the second quarter. We note that this ratio
reflects our best interpretation at this time and is subject to change as we further study the new rules.
We estimate our pro forma supplementary leverage ratio to be 4.2%. This estimate reflects the most recent United
States proposed regulatory rules for the numerator and the denominator and is also subject to change as we study the
guidelines. We have a clearly identified path to exceed in 2015, the 5% regulatory requirement.
Turning to expenses. Total expenses this quarter were $6.7 billion, up 2% versus the first quarter, with compensation
expense down 3% and non-compensation expense up 11%. Relative to the expense reduction targets that we articulated
in January, we remain on track as best evidenced by our expense ratios relative to our 2014 target. Recall that we
expected the sum of our expense reduction efforts to result in a $1.6 billion decline from 2012 reported expenses to
2014 full-year expenses.

Our $1.6 billion target was set based on revenue consistent with 2012 levels, notwithstanding our expectations for
growth. Thus, we further indicated that on higher revenues, our variable expenses would grow, but that our overall
expense ratios would improve. Our revenues excluding DVA were up 8% in the first half while our expenses were up
5%. Excluding higher litigation costs, our expenses would've been up 2%.
Our $1.6 billion cost reduction target on flat revenues implied an expense ratio of approximately 79% for the firm for
2014. We are at that level in the first half of 2013 and would be even better than 79% without higher litigation with still
more expense savings to be realized over time.
As a reminder, our targets are two-year targets and expenses have, and will likely continue to vary from quarter to
quarter. Recall that we had some nonrecurring expenses in the second half of last year. In addition, we had severance
and certain Wealth Management items in our results in the first half of this year. Our targets include an expectation for
continued elevated legal expenses, but of course those tend to be lumpy and difficult to forecast. We continue to work
through our cost cutting programs and they will drive operating leverage through the end of 2014.
Let me now discuss our businesses in detail. In Institutional Securities, revenues excluding DVA were $4.2 billion,
down 5% sequentially. Non-interest expense was $3.4 billion, up 3% versus the first quarter. Compensation was $1.8
billion for the second quarter, down 7% versus the first quarter reflecting a 42% ratio excluding DVA.
Non-compensation expense of $1.6 billion increased 16% from last quarter driven by increased litigation expense as
well as revenue and activity related costs. The business reported a pre-tax profit of $785 million excluding the impact
of DVA. Including the impact of DVA, the business reported a pre-tax profit of $960 million.
In Investment Banking, revenues of $1.1 billion were up 14% versus last quarter with strong growth in EMEA.
According to Thomson Reuters, Morgan Stanley ranked number two in global completed M&A, number three in
announced M&A, number two in global IPOs and number three in global equity at the end of the second quarter.
Notable transactions included: In advisory, Morgan Stanley acted as lead financial advisor to Kabel Deutschland on the
proposed euro 10.7 billion takeover offer from Vodafone. In equity underwriting, Morgan Stanley successfully priced
the $4 billion IPO of Suntory Beverage & Food Limited. Morgan Stanley acted as joint global coordinator and lead-left
book runner on the international tranche. Our JV partner MUFG also acted as joint book runner on the domestic
tranche. And in debt underwriting, Morgan Stanley acted as an active book runner on Petrobras jumbo $11 billion
six-tranche senior notes offering as well as Chevron's $6 billion four-tranche senior notes offering.
Advisory revenues of $333 million were up 33% versus our first quarter results driven by cross-border activity and
improved performance in EMEA and the Americas.
Equity Underwriting revenues were $327 million, up 16% versus the first quarter driven by a significant increase in
IPO activity and the highest level of sponsor-related activity in several years.
We had strength in the Americas and Asia, particularly Japan. Fixed income underwriting revenues were $418 million,
up 2% versus a strong first quarter, driven by loan syndication fees. Equity, Sales and Trading revenues excluding
DVA were $1.8 billion, an increase of 13% from last quarter. Equity revenues were up broadly across products, regions
and client segments versus the first quarter. Client revenues were the highest level in over a year driven by higher
market volumes, increased volatility and greater prime brokerage balances.
In cash equities, the revenue increase was driven by continued strong market share and volume growth, in particular in
the Americas. Derivatives revenues were up versus last quarter with strength across regions, particularly in Japan and
the Americas, and in part driven by higher volatility. Prime brokerage revenues also increased driven by increased
activity during the European dividend season and higher client balances which increased with overall market levels.
Fixed Income and Commodities Sales and Trading revenues excluding DVA were $1.2 billion. Fixed Income revenues
decreased versus the first quarter due to higher volatility that resulted in lower client activity. However, a reduction in
our risk levels during this period helped offset price volatility.
FX delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of revenue gains benefiting from ongoing strong contribution from the
firm's electronic trading platform. Commodities' results were up meaningfully versus the first quarter benefiting in

particular from increased client activity in North American power and natural gas as well as precious metals volatility.
Generally, however, the oil liquids market which, over time, has been the most important driver of our Commodities
business, continues to operate at historically low levels. Finally there was a modest CVA benefit in the quarter.
Other sales and trading negative revenues of $57 million compared with positive revenues of $73 million last quarter.
Average trading VAR for the second quarter was $61 million versus $72 million in the first quarter driven by a
reduction in risk in May in Fixed Income and Commodities.
Turning to Wealth Management. We achieved revenues of $3.5 billion in the second quarter, a record level. Asset
management revenues of $1.9 billion were consistent with the first quarter, benefiting from higher market levels that
were offset by lower deposit referral fees due to a rate reset late in the first quarter. Transaction revenues decreased 7%
from last quarter, consisting primarily of commissions of $567 million which were flat to the prior quarter; investment
banking related fees of $258 million, down 6% versus last quarter reflecting lower new issue volumes; and trading
revenues of $223 million which were down 25% versus the first quarter reflecting the impact of lower activity due to
difficult market conditions in June.
Net interest revenue increased 8% to $446 million driven primarily by growth in our lending product. Other revenue
increased to $139 million in the quarter primarily due to a gain on the sale of our Global Stock Plan business and our
investment portfolio gains. Non-interest expense was $2.9 billion, flat to last quarter. The compensation ratio was 58%
versus 60% in the first quarter, reflecting a higher level of net interest income and higher non-compensable revenues in
the other revenue line. Non-compensation expense was $834 million, up 3% versus last quarter due to a number of
expense items incurred in conjunction with the closing of the Wealth Management joint venture including software
write-offs, branch consolidation and increased advertising expenses. The PBT margin was 18.5%. Profit before tax and
the PBT margin benefited modestly from the net impact of the unusual revenue expenses in the quarter.
Profit before tax was $655 million, the highest level of absolute profitability since the inception of the joint venture.
We reported non-controlling interest of $100 million in the quarter, reflecting a full quarter of earnings. Prospectively
we will not have the NCI deduction.
Total client assets were basically flat to 1Q at $1.8 trillion. Global fee-based asset inflows were $10 billion. Fee-based
assets under management increased to $629 billion at quarter end. Global representatives were 16,321, up slightly from
the first quarter. Bank deposits were $127 billion, effectively flat to 1Q. Approximately $70 billion were held in
Morgan Stanley banks. As mentioned previously, we received the first wave of deposits associated with the final 35%
ownership this week.
Investment Management revenues of $673 million were up 4% versus the first quarter. In Traditional Asset
Management, revenues of $419 million were up from the first quarter driven by higher performance fees in asset
management and administration fees. In Real Estate Investing, revenues decreased 11% versus the first quarter when
the firm realized strong principal investment gains. Due to the ownership structure of these funds, the majority of these
revenues are passed to third-party investors in the non-controlling interest line. In Merchant Banking revenues were up
31% compared to the first quarter driven by higher principal investment gains.
Expenses were $513 million, up 12% from the first quarter reflecting a change in revenue mix. Profit before tax was
$160 million, down 14% sequentially. NCI was $21 million versus $51 million last quarter. Total assets under
management increased to $347 billion driven by net inflows of $9.8 billion.
In terms of our outlook, in the U.S., positive economic data suggests that headwinds are abating. Improving
employment, signs of strength in discretionary consumer spending, a healthy outlook for housing and a declining
deficit are encouraging signs for our clients and our businesses.
Recent Federal Reserve guidance is also constructive, in particular its emphasis on interest rate policy. Institutional
clients are repositioning in response to the Fed comments. Equity activity in the U.S. remains strong with U.S. equities
viewed as a relative safe haven. Our M&A pipeline remains healthy with corporate clients increasingly focused on
executing strategic priorities ahead of potential rising rates. And our retail clients remain engaged in the markets. In the
eurozone, our outlook for GDP remains subdued. We expect to see higher activity levels but only relative to anemic

lows in recent periods. Japanese markets remain strong and we are well-positioned given our partnership with MUFG.
In short, we benefit from our leading positions globally, our franchise momentum continues and we are increasingly
leveraging strengths within business units to the benefit of the entire firm.
Thank you for joining us, and James and I will now take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Mike Carrier with Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Thanks, Ruth and James. Maybe, first question, just on the Wealth Management business,
so you're hitting the margins, you do the buy-in, just the one area that it just seems like for that business still looks a
little bit on the low side would just be on the returns. And granted this quarter there's a lot of charges and you don't get
the full benefit. But it just seems like even on an adjusted basis it might be in that 7%, 8%. You know, just going
forward, what's the driver there of improving those returns? I mean obviously as the margins pick up, that's going to
benefit it. But just what's the long-term opportunity for the return in the Wealth Management business?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well a couple of points. Given there was an acquisition, there's goodwill associated with this. So
the return on tangible equity in the business is about 30% today. And we do see the profit – profitability, the profit
margin and the returns on that business increasing. So, up nicely year-over-year, increased versus the last quarter, and
that really reflects the ongoing strength on the revenue line, the benefit of the cost moves that we've made. On expense
line, I did call out that there were some higher expenses this quarter, but fundamentally the benefit on the expense line.
And we do see longer-term upside as we continue to execute on the lending products.
So again, upside from lending, we revised our target to 20% to 22% by the end of 2015, and again to be clear, that was
with no assumption about higher equity market levels or rate changes and we expect that we would be above 23% with
the benefit of markets and rates.
The other thing I'd note is that this quarter we did take the charge associated with buying in the balance of the Wealth
Management business. That's a $152 million charge, so the return on equity excluding that's 10%. But again, I'd focus
you to the return on tangible equity given the acquisition.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay. All that's helpful. And then maybe just as a follow-up on the capital side. So you
gave the color on the leverage ratio and the outlook in terms of 2015. In terms of how do you get there, what are the
different leverage points that you have? And then any impact on the revenues of the business? And then probably more
importantly, given that you got the buybacks this quarter and for the rest of the year, how do you think that plays in?
Because obviously their earnings power is improving. The leverage ratio's lower but you're getting some buyback
opportunities. So when we think about buybacks going into 2014 and 2015, just any view on that just given the
different dynamics? Thanks.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Sure. So let me start with the leverage ratio. As I indicated, we estimate we're spot at about 4.2%
this quarter and, as I said, we expect to be above 15% in 2015. We do see opportunities with both the numerator and
denominator and most important, they're very consistent with the strategy against which we've been executing. So
starting with the denominator where we see a big opportunity, there are a couple things to note. First, with our focus on
reducing risk-weighted assets in fixed income, this is not model approval but passive and active mitigation and as a
result we're taking balance sheet down because there's a relationship between risk-weighted assets and gross balance
sheet. So that's the first point. And as we repeatedly said, we're taking risk-weighted assets down in areas that are not
accretive to revenues. So we don't see that as impacting the business.
The second is our focus on central clearing. We've talked about that on many calls. We've invested meaningfully in
central clearing. We're well positioned to increase the volume of our derivatives through central clearing and back

loading old trades leads to an elimination of the gross up in the denominator. We're obviously accreting capital which
benefits the numerator. So when you incorporate those items, $500 million share repurchase we talked about, and an
assumption that we do continue to return capital in the future, that takes us to this glide path to above 5% in 2015. Now
to be clear, on top of those items, we do believe there are additional opportunities to reduce the denominator but it's too
early to quantify.
So a couple of examples. With banks on both sides of the Atlantic focused on reducing balance sheet, we believe there
could be lower derivatives notionals by compressing offsetting trades between clients and counter parties for
non-clearable derivatives. A second opportunity is more upside in central clearing. In our calculation, we only
incorporated our expectation for the amount to be cleared in the next 12 months. We didn't go beyond one year. This is
an important area and so we do see, again, upside in the reduction in the denominator from the amount that's centrally
cleared.
And then finally, consistent with all that we've been doing to optimize capital, business unit leaders have the analytics
to optimize their returns. We've talked about this in the past. We look at – we charge them for the capital balance sheet
and liquidity needed to support their business. And when you look at the way we're organized with our bank resource
management effort – we've talked about that in the past, BRM; it's a centralized resource governance structure. We're
well positioned to make appropriate resource allocation adjustments. So we do feel good about the strength of our
capital base. We've baked in returning more capital into that calculation and I would note that we're already above 6%
at the bank.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks, Ruth.
Operator
The next question will come from Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning. It was very encouraging to see the buyback. Can we assume that that was
something that was approved as part of your approvals process with the Fed just ahead of the joint venture buy-in?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So just to break it down, in the 2013 CCAR, the only request we put in, as we've talked about on
prior calls, was for the Wealth Management acquisition given how strategically important that is. And there is a
provision, though, within CCAR, once you have capital approval, you can apply for an additional 1% of Tier 1 capital
for capital actions. So upon closing it – I think this is where you were going but just to make sure I'm very clear on it,
as we went to the final closing of the Wealth Management acquisition, we put in the request to use this incremental 1%
of Tier 1 capital for capital actions. We thought it was the logical next step and are pleased to have the approval, no
objection, and to be commencing the share repurchase. It hasn't yet started. We just got approval for it, so it gives us
the ability to use it, as James said in his opening comments.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Yeah. I think, Guy, the key, as we've said consistently, is to focus on the strategic
platform, get Morgan Stanley in the shape that it needs to be in for the next decade and more, and then the financial
management through buybacks and other capital actions obviously follow from that. So we were very careful to make
sure we got the deal done, even though it was a modest capital outlay of $400 million and some before we started
anything on the capital action and we've taken this first step and obviously we're pleased to do it.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Well thanks for that. But just to follow up on it then, as we think about the platform and the
capital that's needed in it, I look at the capital allocations that you give for the different business units, which is, as I've
told you before, a very, very helpful disclosure, which a lot of people don't do. So thanks for that. I noticed that you
brought the capital in ISG down this quarter by a little over $1 billion and with the accumulation of retained earnings,
you've brought the parent unallocated capital up by a little over $2 billion. Are we supposed to read, or can we read
anything into that, into what you think you need for the different business platforms and how much you might be
accumulating for ultimate return?

<A - Ruth Porat>: Well let me first clarify within the allocation of required capital. So you're absolutely right. The
parent capital number went up. The allocation is based on the final Basel I, Basel I plus 2.5 if you want to call it that.
And with the reduction in risk-weighted assets in Fixed Income, that meant we require less capital in Fixed Income
which is why the ISG number went down and the parent number went up; accretion of earnings plus the reduction of
capital required in the business. Now, the way we are managing the business is with a Basel III lens as we've talked
about. And we will shift this table to Basel III as soon as we're – the industry is reporting on the Basel III basis
completely. But fundamentally, what you see here is that we are continuing to accrete capital. That's why we said we
believe we are increasing our degrees of flexibility. That's reflected in our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio and in
particular, the clarity we think we have with the execution path on the leverage ratio.
So directionally, yes, and then the numbers just change a little as it moves to Basel III.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay that's great. Thank you. That's it for me.

The next question will come from Howard Chen from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Hi. Good morning, James. Good morning, Ruth.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Morning, Howard.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: On the – congratulations on the buyback and the results – On the core client FIC franchise,
it's been a challenging backdrop. But I think you've expressed some – level of disappointment on an absolute basis and
the results somewhat lag the peers. As you look at broader FIC franchise performance, what do you attribute the
underperformance to? And what's within your control from here to improve those results and the trajectory?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well it was a tough quarter. We reduced risk in May given our concerns about the potential market
volatility within Fixed Income products. You can see that, when you look at VAR, we ended the quarter with VAR
down about 15%, and as I noted, risk-weighted assets were down, down to $239 billion. In our view, it does set us up
well going forward to support higher client activity. And we do think that we have upside in quite a number of the
product areas and we're continuing to benefit from the leadership positions across our franchise given the benefit of
adjacencies.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: I would just add how there is a little bit of an obsession in comparing for size. We
don't frankly compare for size. We have a different structured business from a lot of other institutions for very
important reasons. We're not a global commercial bank in the traditional sense. So we have – always going to have
smaller foreign exchange and rates businesses. But we focus on our returns. We've been through a period where we had
to clean up a lot of stuff that we had. We did that going back to MBIA and longer. We had to then build out our flow
footprint which we've been doing over the last couple of years. And now the business is aligned the way we like it.
We're now working on each of the parts as we laid out at the last analyst call, getting to their individual returns. So
some aggregate obviously gives us a decent return for the business. So we're much more focused on returns than on
size.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Understood. Thanks. And then switching gears over to GWM, Ruth, asset administration
fees grew, but maybe not as much as we expected with the lag pricing dynamics. So I was just hoping you could walk
through the dynamics of the moving parts of the referral fees this quarter and any other notable trends ex the referral
fees that you might've seen through the business.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well you went right to the key point which was the referral fees. That referral fee is set on an
annual basis. It was – and it's based on rates at the time. It was reset late in the first quarter, so this is the first full
quarter of the lower deposit referral fees. It gets reset again next year. And the deposit referral fee, just like the higher
FDIC fee from Citi as well, both of those roll off as the deposits roll over to Morgan Stanley.

<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Okay. Great, thanks. And then my final question – thanks for all the thoughts on the
supplemental leverage ratio. Just – if I heard you correctly, it sounds, Ruth, like most of the mitigating actions you
could take are mostly on Fixed Income. And I guess, when I take a step back, I inherently think of your Sales and
Trading franchise equities being inherently more levered business than fixed. So how do we marry that with you having
fantastic equities results with that inherently being a higher leverage business with you achieving the glide path, if that
make sense? Thanks.
<A - Ruth Porat>: So a couple of things. One, we are managing a leverage-based capital – looking at both
leverage-based capital and risk-based capital, and a portfolio actually, when you manage those two results in the
highest overall return. Second, on the gross up, in terms of the gross up for the balance sheet, the areas that we're
running down are areas entirely consistent, as I said, with the strategy we're executing upon. So back to James's
comment that we're not focused on fixed income size for size sake. We're looking at the returns on the business. And so
the rundown in risk-weighted assets enables us to focus on the areas that are core to our client franchise, where we're
continuing to put risk behind clients, and the reduction in denominator associated with the move to central clearing,
again, we've repeatedly said on calls that we believe that central clearing's not only good for the markets, because it
increases transparency and standardization, but it does play to Morgan Stanley's strengths, because it's less about
competing on size of balance sheet and more about content and service and execution. So we were moving in that
direction in any event. And the opportunity to back load old trades into central clearing and thereby reduce the
denominator, again, consistent with our ability to have a right – a focused Fixed Income business that plays to our
strengths and again, benefits from all that we're doing across the franchise.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Okay. Maybe just one follow-up on that. I guess what I'm asking is, it doesn't sound like
there's a high level of concern that this supplemental leverage ratio and mitigating to that will disrupt these great results
and share gains that you've all made in the Equities business over the last few years.
<A - Ruth Porat>: I know. As I said the – I think what the elegance of the rundown to 2014, if that's the right word to
use, is it is consistent with the strategy that we've already articulated and against which we're executing. And our
Equities franchise is a stellar franchise, continued strength across products and geographies, balanced across the
franchise. And so again, able to continue to execute.
<Q - Howard H. Chen>: Great. Thanks for clarifying that and for taking the questions.
Operator
The next question will come from Mike Mayo with CLSA.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. I just wanted to clarify, Ruth, when you said getting the leverage ratio of 5%, that has an
assumption for return of capital in the future. What did you mean by that?
<A - Ruth Porat>: We included an assumption, but I don't want to prejudge where 2014 CCAR comes out. And given
the flexibility that we have as I enumerated the various other items to further reduce denominator, we've built in levels
of flexibility so that again, it will be based on where is CCAR at the end of this year and managing the mix of levers
that we have. But I noted it because $500 million is a good first step in terms of a share repurchase. And it is a tool that
we believe we've built flexibility to use on a go-forward basis but don't want to prejudge 2014's CCAR by putting a
number out there.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: I'd just point out though, since the last CCAR, we've had earnings of 800 – round
numbers $800 million, $1.2 billion, and $900 million, so we're obviously creating reasonably healthy levels of capital
quarter by quarter.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Still on the topic of capital, the ROE is about half of where your target is. Any general thoughts
on how you're going to improve the ROE from where it is in this quarter?

Page 10 of 14
<A - Ruth Porat>: Yeah. So, James laid out in January the six-point ROE plan. And as you said, we've already made
progress – substantial progress on a number of the items. Completing the Wealth Management acquisition, obviously a
key step. The earnings this quarter don't have the benefit of that incremental 35%; we closed on the last day of that
quarter. That starts July 1. The revenue and margin upside we've delivered, but as we indicated, we think there's more
upside there. The reduction in risk-weighted assets in Fixed Income, we're very much on track if not ahead of track and
we do believe that there's upside in that business. We're continuing to execute on the Wealth Management – I'm sorry,
on the expense ratios. And expenses were a bit higher this quarter as we noted; litigation was a bit higher and again,
we're on a good trajectory to have tighter expense ratios as we go through to 2014. We're executing on our – on the
bank strategy which again, gives us some upside in capital as well. So the ROE this quarter was obviously also
depressed by the charge associated with buying in the Wealth Management business. But when you roll those items
together, excluding the charge about 6%, and that we see upside from the six items that we've consistently taken you
back to.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Mike, I would just – I'd just say, there's nothing that we have seen in this quarter that
changes our view on what we laid out on our ROE projections and we stand by them.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And you mentioned backlogs little bit, but could you elaborate a little bit more?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Sure. The pipeline does remain healthy. U.S. activity's the strongest. I did note Europe is up, but
that's versus a very weak prior 12 months. Japan continues to be strong. Emerging markets are mixed; China's slow,
Brazil has a big pipeline but is a challenge. We think that's on pause for – at least for now. But we're seeing greater
opportunity in Asia-Pacific so it's very country specific. I think the intriguing element is this backlog in M&A which
has been sitting for quite some time and I've said on prior calls, we attribute that to CEO confidence. But what we are
increasingly hearing is a reassessment of timing, in particular of – Fed comments are that any moves are data dependent
or there are signs of improvements in the economy. That is inspiring in conjunction with concern about higher rates and
what that means if there's a delay. So we are hopeful to see that backlog start moving through to execution. The drivers
to date on activity have been more cross border as I noted, and the sponsor and activist-related activity. The equity
pipeline's stable. It's skewed more towards the U.S., Mexico and Japan.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And two more small ones. Litigation, how much was it this quarter and where do you expect
that to go and what's normal?
<A - Ruth Porat>: So the second quarter was up $140 million relative to the first quarter. It's proven to be an ongoing
cost for the industry associated with all the pre-crisis matters. It's proven to be lumpy, tough to forecast. But we called
it out in terms of the expense comparison because at some point the financial crisis is behind the industry and these
start to abate. And just to give you a sense, first half this year versus first half last year were up $250 million.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then lastly, your VAR was down. At some others it was up. Is this – what is that? Is that
just a more cautious risk profile? Or is this just temporary?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Yeah. The VAR was down in particular, on the interest rate and credit line. And that really goes to
my comment that we reduced risk in May given concerns about potential market volatility within Fixed Income
product. And think the team did a good job managing that. But it does set us up well to put – to support client activity
this quarter going forward. We have capacity there.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Thank you.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Thank you.

<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Morning.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: So quick one on leverage. Does the new rule change your view on moving derivatives over
to the bank sub?
<A - Ruth Porat>: You know, that's a great question because I indicated that we're above 6% at the bank now and the
way we're looking at it, it's obviously just come out and it's still in the proposal stage. But if we move derivatives to the
bank, we get a dollar for dollar benefit because we're not, obviously, funding them with unsecured anymore, but with
deposits. So there is some optimization there. And I think what we're – the way we're thinking about it is client
preference, efficiency, logic of it, how the market's evolving. We have some capacity in the bank, but we have a clear
flight path for the holding company. So, it's much more about looking at the specific asset classes and assessing it and
it's too early to actually answer it more specifically than that.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: That's fair. So switching gears then I guess, as you guys continue to work to improve
margins in Wealth Management, is there a way we should think about FA head count going forward?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well FA head count is up a bit this quarter. We continue to be very focused on FA productivity
which, as I noted, is at a record high. And it's – kind of in and around this level it is logical and again, our focus is
primarily on FA productivity. so there's not a line in the sand here.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Yes.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: It'll bounce around a little bit quarter to quarter. Honestly, I wouldn't think about it too
much.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: But really productivity is probably the bigger driver and the way that we should think about
it more so than actually the number of heads?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Yes.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: By far.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Great. And then last one for me, as NII becomes more important to you all and the asset
leverage increases, paying a lot more attention to that and so this question's a little dated but I had kind of had not paid
as much attention to NII for you guys for a while. It seems as though NII in ISG has been really weak since 2008.
What's been behind that? Is there any way to think about that? Or what are the drivers there?
<A - Ruth Porat>: No. I think your opening comments actually answered it. NIM is much more a banking book than a
trading book concept. And so it's much more relevant for the Wealth Management business and it has been improving
nicely and should continue to as we deploy deposits. So really, it's less relevant in the trading business.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. Okay. And on that – the latter business spend, the Wealth Management business, we
have seen kind of a move here in the two- and three-year treasury. Is there any benefit that we can expect down the line
for you guys from that move? Or is the deposit investment far shorter and only really like the 6-month LIBOR would
have an impact?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Yeah. We've indicated that it really is – we focus on the much shorter end. So the first 150 basis
point in Fed funds is about $1.1 billion in PBT for the business. To the extent we're seeing rising rates because there's
improving economic activity, that's constructive for all of the businesses. But the guidance that we provided was really
anchored at the short end.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Fair enough. Thanks a lot.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Thank you.

The next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Good morning. Could I just ask a follow-up question on the Derivatives business that you
moved to central clearing? We talk a lot about the numerator benefit. But have you've done any work trying to figure
out what the – if any capital benefit would be on a Basel III basis and going to – moving more and more of the
Derivatives to a centralized clearing platform?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Still too early.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: But is it at least – in your gut it makes sense that you get some benefit or there's just no way to
tell at all?
<A - Ruth Porat>: No. Our assumption is there is some benefit. There is benefit to it and trying to quantify it for our
call, it's too early. Our assessments is there will be capital, too early.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Okay. And just a follow-up on the spread question on the deposits. As you pull in $55 billion
over the next 24 months, how do we think about – you talked about your leverage is more on the short end. But in the
short – in the near-term, I assume you're putting it mostly in AFS portfolio.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Correct.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: And with the backup in yields in the intermediate bond area, wouldn't you get some benefit? I
know your target was 1% spread before the rate spike. Should that – should we be assuming a little bit better than that?
<A - Ruth Porat>: We are still fairly short. And it's been our philosophy, given we've been in a low interest rate
environment, is keep duration short given the inevitable rise in rates would prove to be a financial drag and think that
was the right thing to do.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Okay. All right. Thanks.

The next question will come from Roger Freeman with Barclays.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Oh, hi. Good morning. I guess just on the FIC business, you were talking about risk
having come down in May. With markets more normalized, is sort of the level of liquidity provision gone up? And was
the decline in May just the volatility? Or, I know you had some management changes too, so I'm not sure if that's
factored in there.
<A - Ruth Porat>: There was concern from the team that – about potential market volatility and just thinking that it
was prudent risk management to bring risk down in the business given that concern and we're pleased that they did.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay. And so market normalcy has returned from your perspective? So far this
quarter it seems like we're hearing that from others.
<A - Ruth Porat>: It does seem that way, yes.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay. And just back on the buyback and CCAR, I know you've probably said what
you can. But just thinking about the 1%, is that sort of a mechanical outcome of this provision to be able to apply for
that and not to read into that one way or another as to the Feds thinking on improving capital stock buyback requests
with, say, your leverage ratio where it is against the target? I mean are they kind of separate issues?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Well there's a provision that you have the opportunity to apply to use 1% of your Tier 1 capital. But
it's still an approval. And so we were pleased to have received the approval and no objection and to be able to proceed.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay. And I guess the only other one, on the clearing rollout, how's that – in the
Swaps businesses, how's that going from your perspective? And it seems like what we're hearing from others is no real

impact on customer volumes. Are you finding the same thing?
<A - Ruth Porat>: Yes. I mean the big event was obviously Category 2. The move went well. Clients were ready. We
didn't have operational issues. We do think the staggered rollout of clients was constructive between Category 1 and
Category 2. At this point it's premature to judge, I think, the impact fully on market activity because there were so
many other exogenous events. But it went well and we feel we're well positioned.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Thank you.
Operator
The next question will come from Fiona Swaffield with RBC.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Hi. Good morning. On two things. Firstly on the Basel III kind of look through, the 9.9
versus Q1, I don't know if you could talk about the numerator and the denominator because the RWAs keep on going
down in Fixed Income. But I don't – there seems to be something offsetting it, was kind of the first question. And the
second question was the total exposure number; so, the supplementary leverage ratio exposure and the move to that to
fall. If we look back, and you've had that big reduction in FIC Basel III RWAs, could you tell us where the exposure
would have been or the leverage ratio would have been at a bottom? Just to work out what the correlation is potentially.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Okay. So on the first question, the Basel III firm-wide RWAs are $426 billion. Some of the
movement between the first quarter and the second quarter, obviously there's earnings accretion. There was obviously
the charge associated with the Wealth Management acquisition and then just finalization of the rules and it gets you to
the 9.9%. And then could you repeat the question regarding the leverage ratio?
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: I'm just trying to understand the moving parts in the total exposure because we've
obviously seen the Fixed Income RWAs come down a lot in the last 18 months and you're kind of getting more towards
the end of that process. So how much of the total exposure going down is really due to the Fixed Income? Is it that the
total exposure number would've been much higher before you started reducing the Fixed Income book?
<A - Ruth Porat>: It would have been much higher before we started reducing the Fixed Income book. And I think the
two buckets that I broke out, one the RWA reduction, and the RWAs in Fixed Income were $390 billion at the peak.
They're down to $239 billion, so. And most of that really is in areas that are relevant to the gross up, in particular our
structured credit, credit correlation business. So yes, we've absolutely benefited from what we're doing and we continue
to be on an execution path to take it down even more which is what gives us the confidence we can continue to do so.
And then similarly we've moved – already moved quite a bit. We were early in central clearing and so we're already
seeing some benefit in the denominator from the move to central clearing and look forward to continuing to execute on
that portion.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Great. Thanks.
<A - Ruth Porat>: Thank you.

The final question will come from Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate the disclosure, particularly
specific to Wealth Management loans on Page 12. I guess I'm just curious as to if there's any dollar target or growth
target of those loans now that you've got deposits obviously flowing in from the MSSB transaction, given your ongoing
statements about trying to grow the spread revenue within Wealth Management.

<A - Ruth Porat>: So I may give you a somewhat unsatisfactory answer because I'm not going to be able to quantify it
by buckets. And the reason is, we've said consistently that we're leading with credit risk management and that it will be
a prudent build out of the portfolio and that is how we're continuing to build it. So the deposits are going to continue to
grow and support growth and lending product both for Wealth Management and Institutional Securities. And on the
Wealth Management side, the biggest growth is on the securities-based lending and secondarily on residential
mortgages. We have 5% penetration of our clients relative to our peers who have 10%. So our view is that there's
tremendous upside. We've got a tailwind there, but where, again, leading with prudent steady growth, and that's going
to be the continued philosophy around it.
And then on the Institutional side, that's also how we're going to be utilizing some of the deposits. We do get a funding
benefit when we move – dollar for dollar funding benefit when we substitute unsecured debt with the more efficient
deposits. So certain product does move to the bank and obviously our relationship – or maybe not obviously our
relationship, in event lending is in the bank. And then we have an attractive opportunity growing bank appropriate
product in the bank. So areas where we already have very strong teams, domain expertise, client base, like commercial
real estate lending, asset-based lending, project finance, we can grow the lending suite an area we hadn't heretofore
been focused on. So it is a real diversified portfolio of asset-supporting growth on both Wealth Management and the
Institutional Securities businesses that will build over time. And we'll be sharing more about the bank and the bank's
strategy over time given the growth that we're seeing there.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: And just switching gears a bit, James, maybe a question for you in terms of how you're
thinking about the long term total payout ratio of the firm given that you've now taken a big step towards that with the
announcement of the $500 million – the $500 million share buyback.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: Well, as they say, a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step and we've
had our first step. That's really what mattered. We don't want to get ahead of that, obviously. It's – what payout ratios
are. It's going to be a function of where our absolute earnings are and managing against the changing regulatory
environment. But what we wanted to do is put ourselves in a position where we could launch a buyback and begin that
process which is what we did.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Fair enough. Thanks for taking my questions.
<A - James Patrick Gorman>: You're welcome.
