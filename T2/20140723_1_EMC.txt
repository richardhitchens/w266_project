mode until the question-and-answer portion of the call. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. If you have
any objections, you may disconnect at this time.
I would like to introduce your host for today, Mr. Tony Takazawa, Vice President-Global Investor Relations of EMC.
You may begin.
Anthony T. Takazawa
Thank you. Good morning. Welcome to EMC's call to discuss our financial results for the second quarter of 2014.
Today, we are joined by EMC Chairman and CEO, Joe Tucci; and David Goulden, EMC Information Infrastructure
CEO and EMC CFO.
Joe will begin our discussion with his view of the trends happening in IT, EMC's vision and strategy and how the EMC
Federation is managing the transition to the 3rd Platform. David will then make a few comments on our results and
provide a bit more detail regarding the operation and success of the EMC family of companies. He will also discuss our
outlook for the remainder of 2014.
After the prepared remarks, we will then open up the lines to take your questions. We are providing you with our
projected financial model for 2014. This model lays out all of the key assumptions and discrete financial expectations
that are the foundation of our outlook this year. We hope that you find this model helpful in understanding our
assumptions in context and in ensuring that these expectations are correctly incorporated into your models. This model
is available as background in today's slides, available for download in the Investor Relations section of emc.com.

Joseph M. Tucci
Thank you, Tony and a warm welcome to everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Overall, we are pleased with our
execution and results in Q2, as our year-on-year revenue growth accelerated to 5%. Across our three major businesses,
VMware grew 17% year on year; Pivotal grew 29%, which actually understates their growth as Pivotal has moved to
mostly a subscription software model. So looking at them on a bookings, demand basis, the year-on-year growth rate
was closer to 60%; and EMC II grew 1%.
EMC II was truly a tale of two cities in Q2. Excluding their high-end storage business which declined 14%, their
growth was up 7%. And the really good news within EMC II is that our all-new high-end VMAX 3 was launched on
July 8 and it will begin shipping in September. This launch is very important to us, as without a doubt, the pause ahead
of this product was hurting us.
I would like to publicly thank my 65,000-plus colleagues from EMC, VMware and Pivotal and our value partners
around the world for their professionalism and hard work and for their total dedication to our customers' success.
Now, let's change gears a bit and discuss the major transformation that the global IT industry/market is going through.
And to be clear, as we have said before, this IT transformation is a secular, not cyclical shift and thus business as
unusual is not and will not be a viable strategic option. The clear drivers of this secular shift from the client server PC
era of IT to an era defined by always-connected mobile client devices, private and public cloud computing, big data
with true predictive real-time analytic capabilities and new ways to interact via social networking. Collectively, this
new era is being called the 3rd Great IT Platform.
This shift to 3rd Platform IT is creating a real dilemma for CIOs; namely that today, virtually all companies or
enterprises run the vast majority of their businesses or governmental services on 2nd IT Platform technologies. At the
same time, CIOs are facing huge pressure from all parts of business, from marketing, from sales, from R&D, from
services, to invest large sums of money to capitalize on these big data, mobile and cloud trends to connect with their
customers, their supply chains and their employees and partners in a more agile, highly-personalized real-time way,
with a lot more information and knowledge. So the CIO with a tight IT budget is trying very hard to take as much cost
as possible out of his or her Platform 2 budget to invest in game-changing Platform 3 opportunities, while keeping their
precious information assets and identities secure.
This is where we, the EMC family of companies, play. We help CIOs optimize their 2nd Platform investments and
leverage these investments as we support them in their journey to the 3rd Platform. We do this with technologies like
converged infrastructure, our broad family of software and hardware storage products, virtualization software, the
software-defined data center, delivered through hybrid, private and public cloud models, with advanced automation
software, with consulting implementation support and managed services and with modern HDFS-based big data
analytics featuring innovative industry-leading query capabilities. And in the information security world, we help verify
and protect identities, detect anomalies in real-time, while assuring proper governance and compliance of security
policies.
The EMC federated model delivers these compelling technologies and services in a tightly-integrated fashion, while
also offering our customers the ability to choose individual technology components from any of our companies or
business units. Giving customers this choice is and will be a hallmark of our success in the 3rd Platform era.

We are able to leverage our different offerings as points of entry into the conversations with our customers and see a
critical advantage in being able to do so with a broad family of products and services. Our innovative operating model
is designed to reinforce the principles I just articulated. For example, our businesses are strategically aligned but
laser-focused on their individual missions. We selectively align around key partnerships and go-to-market opportunities
to realize the benefits of scale. We are better able to recruit and retain the best and brightest people and focus them on
the most important opportunities.
The power of this model is reflected in customer survey after customer survey, which highlights the fact that our
strategic relevance has never been greater and is, in fact, rising. Interestingly, customers tell us that by offering real
choice, they don't feel locked-in and they are more prone to buy our integrated technology solutions. And very, very
importantly, as part of our operating model and strategy, we have made a string of innovative game-changing
investments that will help customers immensely in their journey from the 2nd to the 3rd Platform. These are
investments which will give us real, sustainable competitive advantage.
Since the beginning of 2012, we have invested almost $6 billion in acquisitions and internal developments in six key
strategic product/business areas. We acquired Nicira, the leader in software-defined networking, now an integral part of
VMware's NSX, SDN offering.
We acquired AirWatch, the leader in mobile device and security management, an integral part of VMware's end-user
computing initiative. We formed Pivotal to focus on an open PaaS layer called Cloud Foundry; HDFS-based big data
solutions and a new paradigm for rapid agile application development.
We developed from scratch a new innovative software-defined storage offering in EMC II named ViPR and introduced
a new solution aimed at cloud scale object and HDFS storage, called Elastic Cloud Storage or ECS. We acquired
XtremIO and ScaleIO for very high performance scale-out flash and block storage, and we acquired DSSD and
pre-introduced a new rack-scale flash storage architecture to the market.
These six bold investments have three things in common. First, they will all show up as a loss on our P&L this year.
Second, I'm 100% convinced that they all will be high-margin, billion-dollar plus businesses or product lines for us
over the next few years. And third, they all have game-changing capabilities.
We are confident that we will deliver in 2014 and beyond, supported by the fact that we have achieved the revenue and
EPS targets that we set for ourselves in the first half this year, while building significant backlog; by the fact that our
new 3rd Platform offerings are showing substantial double digit growth; and by the fact that we are entering the second
half with great momentum, a strong technology roadmap, and a new VMAX 3 high-end storage platform will be
generally available.
Since the beginning of this year, David and I have personally met with over 100 investors and what we heard has
resonated with us. You said, we understand and like EMC's strategy and strategic position. You said, we believe there
is a strong leadership team across the EMC companies and they have demonstrated an ability to execute. You said,
EMC knows how to acquire companies and retain talent. You noted that our growth rate has slowed, but EMC has been
growing faster than its large cap tech peers and our new Platform 3 offerings are growing rapidly and that EMC has
made a large number of strategic investments which are expected to pay off in the intermediate future.
And lastly, our investors made it clear that they believe we should return more cash to them as we execute our
long-term strategy. We listened closely. As a sign of our confidence in 2014 and beyond, we are accelerating $1 billion
of our buyback from 2015 into 2014. In other words, on top of the $1 billion of stock we already bought back in the
first half of 2014, we will buy back an additional $2 billion in the second half of this year. Together with our dividend,
we expect to return almost $4 billion of cash to our shareholders this year.
Let me close by addressing this week's media attention on EMC. We have not heard from Elliott Management other
than their call to us stating that they are or intend to be one of EMC's larger investors. They also requested a meeting
with me and I have agreed to meet with them as I periodically do with all of our large investors.

For the record, and I deeply believe in this principle, we, and we as management and our board of directors, are always
open and welcome a dialogue with all of our shareholders. And we respectfully listen to their ideas and beliefs as we
form our strategic direction and policies.
Thank you again for being with us. And now let me turn it over to David Goulden. David?
David I. Goulden
Thanks, Joe. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report EMC performance in
Q2 that was solid and on track, with good performance from each of our major business units. I'd like to echo Joe's
comments and thank all the members of the consolidated EMC team for their ongoing efforts.
These results attest that while the shift to the 3rd Platform is transforming the industry, one thing that has not changed
is EMC's unique competitive advantage, helping customers manage their valuable asset, information, in more agile,
trusted and cost-efficient ways. This core strength is even more relevant with the rise of the 3rd Platform and by
leveraging the capabilities and critical mass that we have built through the EMC Federation of best-of-breed
companies, we fully expect the success we've achieved in the 2nd Platform will be even greater in the 3rd.
In spite of continued lackluster spending on IT and on storage, EMC grew consolidated revenue 5% year on year, on
strength from across the business; with Pivotal up 29% and almost twice that growth rate in orders; VMware up 17%
and EMC Information Infrastructure up 1%. Excluding our High-End, which is in transition, EMC II was up a robust
7%. Revenue reached a second quarter record of $5.9 billion, non-GAAP EPS was $0.43 and free cash flow grew 10%.
Within our major geographies, revenue grew 3% in North America, 12% in EMEA, 14% in Latin America, and was
down 4% in APJ. Our BRIC + 13 markets grew 5%.
Finally, as a result of the change in our approach to quarter-end processes, the level of unfulfilled storage product
orders grew in the quarter and ended the quarter where we expected them to be.
Looking at the line items driving our earnings growth, consolidated gross margin in Q2 was 63.8%, up 100 basis points
sequentially and down 50 basis points compared with Q2 of last year. Within this result, VMware was up sequentially
and down year-on-year, reflecting some of their growth initiatives. EMC II gross margin was up 120 basis points
sequentially and down year-on-year, primarily due to volume and some pricing pressures at the High-End, in
anticipation of the new VMAX. We continue to be on track for flat gross margins for this year in EMC II.
Pivotal gross margins also expanded from Q1, while the year-on-year compare was down as a result of Pivotal's
revenue model shift to subscriptions, which results in a higher in-quarter mix of professional services revenue
compared with Q2 a year ago. As in Q1, the increasing mix of VMware was helpful to the overall gross margin results.
Operating expenses grew 8% reflecting major investments we're making at Pivotal and VMware. And while we
continue to make significant investments in EMC II, operating expenses there were flat. This increase in OpEx in Q2
over last year amounted to $0.06 per share. The retirement of our convertible debt and our accelerated buyback
program contributed $0.02. As a result, non-GAAP earnings per share in Q2 was $0.43. We generated $930 million of
free cash flow in Q2, up 10% year-on-year. Our cash and investments at quarter end were $14.6 billion, $3.7 billion of
which is EMC II U.S.
We repurchased approximately $600 million worth of EMC shares in Q2 and returned about $200 million to
shareholders via our quarterly dividends. As previously announced, our quarterly dividend will increase by 15%
starting this month.
As Joe said, we're very pleased to announce today that we are accelerating our share buyback plan for 2014, from $2
billion to $3 billion, pulling the balance of our $6 billion authorization into 2014. This accelerated buyback combined
with our dividend returns over $7 billion of cash to shareholders over the course of 2013 and 2014 and we've added
$0.01 to our full-year EPS expectations to reflect the additional buyback.

We're confident in EMC's ability to leverage the power of the Federation Model for the long-term benefits of
customers, partners and our shareholders. We believe that this quarter's performance shows that our strategy is sound
and is bearing fruit and we're confident about the rest of the year. As a result, we feel accelerating the buyback program
is a good investment decision for our shareholders.
Let me share with you some early signs of success we've seen so far this year in bringing the value of our unique
business model to some large global customers in three very different industries. Note that all three customers in these
examples are investing not only in EMC's 3rd Platform products and services, but in our well-established 2nd Platform
technologies as well. This is because most enterprise workloads today run on 2nd Platform technology. However, fully
leveraging this data with an eye to the future requires a technology partner that can bridge the 2nd to the 3rd Platform
where almost all the new apps developed over the next several years will be deployed. EMC, through the Federation, as
these examples illustrate is highly-valued partner in both.
The first is a major European telecom that's using active network monitoring and analytics to make real-time
adjustments to coverage and quality. To do this well, the carrier needs to model network traffic in low levels in multiple
regions for the thousands of customers in each region, adjusting quickly to changing needs, while anticipating new
requirements. With a combined solution from each of the members of the EMC family, including virtualized
infrastructure from EMC II and VMware, and application development and data analytics tools from Pivotal, this
customer can achieve higher service levels and deliver a better mobile experience.
Another is a global industrial based in Germany that is collecting massive amounts of data from customer-owned
equipment through sensors and meters. Their goal is to derive insight from these data to create new revenue streams
from value-added services like preventative and predictive maintenance, performance benchmarking and equipment
optimization. The combined EMC solution, which includes Vblocks, Pivotal HD and HAWQ, which is Hadoop with
Query, will be deployed via the global cloud of one of EMC's largest service provider partners.
The last example that I will share with you is a global pharmaceutical company. This customer wants to offer
infrastructure on demand to its business units. After piloting a range of offerings including [ph] large comology (18:48)
public cloud services, the customer chose the EMC Federation to deliver its new public cloud capability for flexibility
and compatibility with its existing EMC VMware Vblock-based private cloud. The result, which includes VMware
vCloud Hybrid Service, VMware Orchestration Tools and Pivotal, will be a fast and flexible hybrid cloud, leveraging
common tools and delivering application and workload mobility and cost optimization.
These are large global customers that really value what our Federated business model is able to deliver for them. And
we're only in the very early stages here. With 95% of the Fortune 200 as EMC customers, we're well-positioned to
repeat this quarter after quarter. In addition to our installed base, we're also starting to see net new customers,
companies who are choosing EMC for the first time or investing with us more heavily because of our expanded
capabilities through the Federation.
As powerful as the Federation can be together, one of its most attractive aspects for customers is it provides them a
choice. Each business is a best-of-breed provider in its respective layer in the technology stack. So let's go through each
of these businesses now before wrapping up with our outlook for the year.
Starting with Pivotal at the top of the stack, Pivotal grew revenue 29% over last year's Q2, while demand grew at
almost twice this rate. Pivotal Labs saw agile development services business continues to perform well. Pivotal Labs
has been a healthy source of customers that decide also to leverage Pivotal's software, where subscriptions more than
tripled from last year's Q2. Overall, we believe Pivotal is on track as it builds its product portfolio, expands its footprint
with leading customers across every major sector and transitions its business to a more stable and valuable
subscription-based approach.
To that end, Pivotal saw strong growth in both Pivotal CF, our commercial version of Cloud Foundry; and our new and
revolutionary Big Data Suite, where we simplified packaging and pricing around a per call licensing model. This means
customers only pay for what they analyze regardless how much data is stored. In Q2, we had several large enterprise
customers embrace our subscription offerings.

A long-term driver of success for Pivotal is the proliferation of Cloud Foundry as a standard for development.
Attendance at the second Cloud Foundry Summit in June more than doubled from six months ago to almost 1,000
attendees, as momentum for Cloud Foundry continues to build. The list of committed foundation members has grown
to 35, with Swisscom, Rackspace, Ericsson, CenturyLink, Capgemini and BNY Mellon among those joining recently.
Pivotal CF continues to be the leading version of Cloud Foundry with an increase in enterprise customers, including a
global media and technology provider, multinational agricultural company, an international provider of health care
equipments and a property and financial information services company. The broad level of support and contribution
from companies large and small speaks to the growing influence of Cloud Foundry as the industry's open source PaaS,
providing choice of clouds, frameworks and application services.
Turning now to VMware, in the middle of the stack, which continues to leverage its virtualization technologies to
propel its three strategic initiatives: software-defined data center, hybrid cloud and mobile. The key indicator of traction
in software-defined data center is the success of NSX and the paying customer account for NSX is over 150,
representing all our geos and verticals. Another is the growth of non-standalone vSphere bookings and these were up as
well, accounting for more than half of VMware's total license bookings in the quarter, compared with over 35% in Q2
last year.
Our hybrid cloud business which includes our vCloud Service Provider Partner program and vCHS grew nearly 80%
year on year. And the end user computing, including AirWatch, new license bookings grew over 60% year on year,
while our end user computing desktop business grew at double digits.
Now, turning to the foundational layer of the stack, EMC's Information Infrastructure business and starting with the
largest part, storage. Overall storage revenue was up 1% compared to last year's Q2. It is also interesting to note that
excluding the High-End, which is in a product transition, storage revenue grew 7% which is faster than the industry
overall and a good indicator that we gained share in Q2 in these markets.
We continue to see customers prioritize 3rd Platform technologies with their tight budget dollars and minimize spend
on existing infrastructures. This dynamic was evidenced in our own results as we saw a continued excellent growth
from our Emerging Storage business which grew 52% compared to Q2 a year ago. Emerging Storage includes several
of the technologies that are in high demand in the shift to 3rd Platform, including all-flash arrays and software-defined
storage, supporting both big data analytics and cloud workloads.
XtremIO, our purpose-built all-flash array is exceeding our expectations with demand ramping steeply in Q2 and
momentum continuing into this quarter. XtremIO surpassed a $300 million annualized run rate for demand in Q2 in
only its second full quarter of availability, establishing itself as the clear leader in the all-flash array markets. All
XtremIO metrics were up, new customer wins, including new to EMC accounts, sales of multi-controller scale-out
configurations, sales of our large 20-terabyte X-Bricks, repeat customers and customers purchasing more than $1
million of XtremIO.
XtremIO saw a significant uptake in new use cases, with databases and virtual servers augmenting an already robust
business in VDI. With the recently announced enhancements to XtremIO, including compression, encryption, writable
snapshots, performance improvements and expansion configuration options, we expect our momentum with XtremIO
to continue.
Software-defined storage is a strategic growth area for us. The investments we've made at VMware with vSAN and at
EMC II with ViPR and ScaleIO are beginning to bear fruit. vSAN exceeded its plan in its first quarter of availability.
Our software-defined storage platform ViPR also exceeded its plan and more than doubled its customer count in Q2
from Q1. At EMC World in May, we announced ViPR 2.0, which included the addition of ViPR Block services via
ScaleIO and new geo capabilities for ViPR Object and ViPR HDFS.
Our new Elastic Cloud Storage appliance which is powered by ViPR got off to a great start, shipping multiple petabytes
of capacity in the quarter despite the fact that it started shipping with just a few days left in June. Built with [ph]
comology (25:59) components and optimized to scale and density, ECS is cloud storage infrastructure for Object,
HDFS and Block workloads that customers would rather not run on a public cloud.

ECS offers public cloud features such as multi-tenancy, metering and a self-service portal and billing integration to
make it easy for customers to deliver storage-as-a-service within their own environments and doing it more
cost-effectively than in the public cloud. We were proud to announce that The Vatican was the first ECS customer.
Big data has driven the development of technologies like ViPR HDFS and ECS and it continues to power the success of
Isilon, as customers' direct attached storage environments begin to approach 100 terabytes, it makes sense from a TCO
and management standpoint to use Isilon instead, especially for Hadoop. Isilon offers native HDFS access to NAS files
which means petabytes of data can be analyzed in place without any data movement. We just made Isilon even better
with its next gen systems, which are an order of magnitude more scalable than other approaches for data consolidation
onto a single file system.
Moreover, the deployment of Isilon is easier with new Vblock systems with Isilon for scale-out VDI and for Hadoop
analytics; and with the new Data Lake Hadoop bundle with Pivotal. These new form factors augment Isilon's already
strong growth in scale-out NAS and make it a natural fit for Federation Data Lake plays with Pivotal, of which there
are several in Q2.
In the world of HDFS, we do not see one size fitting all. Both Isilon and ViPR provide best-of-breed HDFS
capabilities, but their design points are very different. We see Isilon being deployed primarily in data center scale use
cases, while ViPR is targeted at cloud scale, globally-distributed deployments.
Our Unified & Backup/Recovery revenue grew 6% in Q2, with growth coming from both areas and EMC clearly
taking share in both. VNX continues to benefit from the launch of VNX2 and the transition here is essentially
complete. VNX is also benefiting from its place in converged infrastructure, both at VCE and in our VSPEX program.
Our backup recovery portfolio continues to do well as DataDomain had another strong quarter and our Data Protection
Suite showed very strong, double-digit growth, both sequentially and year-on-year.
Our High-End business improved from Q1, but was once again hampered by a tough prior compare and customer pause
related to its pending refresh. The good news here is that the new VMAX 3 has been announced and with a GA date
late this quarter, we expect the new VMAX will ramp more meaningfully in Q4.
VMAX 3 is a complete new family with a new dynamic virtual matrix architecture and new HYPERMAX operating
system, enabling the running of infrastructure applications directly inside of VMAX for the first time. Protect points
and ability to drive backup copies directly from a storage array, eliminating the need for dedicated backup service.
Three times the performance of the previous generation of VMAX and industry-leading density versus our competition.
All together, these give VMAX powerful new capabilities to drive consolidation and cost efficiencies in the data center
and change the TCO conversation we can have with customers.
The breadth and depth of our best-of-breed storage portfolio has a number of benefits. It allows us to cover all the bases
with customers, we can innovate and integrate across platforms for unique architectural costs and TCO advantages and
we're able to deliver more consistent results due to the benefits of portfolio diversification.
We continue to outperform the storage market because of our relentless focus on getting customers to hybrid cloud
which began five years ago. Since then, we've evolved our product portfolio to operate effectively in hybrid cloud
environments. The latest example being the public cloud gateway technology we are embedding from TwinStrata and
we have steadily developed and acquired next generation technology such as ViPR, Elastic Cloud Storage and DSSD's
innovative new rack-scale flash storage architecture we expect to launch next year.
While having the best technology is critical, equally important to success in hybrid cloud is the go-to-market model for
these technologies and our strong partner ecosystem is a key factor in our ongoing success.
Converged infrastructure delivered through VCE and through our VSPEX program has been a very popular

the first half.
Other partnerships are important as well. Just last week, we announced the collaboration of EMC, Microsoft and
Equinix which gives EMC customers the ability to host EMC storage solutions in Equinix data centers and connect to
Microsoft Azure safely, reliably and securely.
And long time partner, Capgemini, attest to the power of the full EMC family in winning a key multi-year
transformational projects with European client to build a truly scalable and flexible IT infrastructure. Patrick Nicolet,
Capgemini's CEO of Infrastructure Services says that this was one of their first wins using the power of the Federation.
EMC for storage transformation based upon preconfigured building blocks, VMware for the multi-sourcing service
integration with IT business managements and the cloud journey with vCloud Automation Center from VMware.
Finally, as we continue to win deals spanning all of our operating units, it's increasingly important that we hone these
solutions and make them more repeatable to both sell and implement in our customers' environments.
Through a recently established Federation lab at VMware, we have proven a number of solutions leveraging EMC plus
VMware plus Pivotal technologies. We call them EVP solutions internally. We're building solutions in key areas,
including software-defined data center, data lakes, security analytics, VDI and platform-as-a-service.
The first of these solutions, software-defined data center is now complete and the EMC sales team is rolling it out
globally. EMC Consulting is another valuable asset here and was instrumental in some of the Federation win examples
I mentioned earlier.
Turning now to security and content management. RSA is an important part of the Federation play, as security is a
priority as organizations build out hybrid clouds. RSA grew 6% over Q2 of last year. Security Analytics and Archer
continue to drive growth here with each up over 20% year-on-year in Q2. Our Information Intelligence Group revenue
returned to growth in Q2, up 4% from last year. EMC II demonstrated solid financial performance in Q2 and we also
hosted a very successful EMC World in May, a mega launch earlier this month. I'd like to thank the entire team who
worked hard to make all this happen, and as always, our partners and customers for your continued support.
As we look to the second half, we still expect IT spend growth and storage industry growth to be broadly similar to
what they were in 2013. However, our strategy is paying off and we believe we'll continue to grow and gain share in
this tough environment and achieve our targets of revenue of $24.6 billion, up 6% year-on-year, non-GAAP operating
margins between 24% and 24.5%, non-GAAP EPS of $1.91, up 6% year-on-year, and free cash flow of $5.8 billion.
Achieving these full year results requires second half growth similar to the first half for VMware, and an acceleration
of growth in the second half for EMC II. This acceleration is due to the changes we made to our quarter-end process in
the first half, which will result in less build-up of unshipped orders in the second half.
Additionally, we expect to benefit from a stronger Q3 in Federal than last year and some improvement in Symmetrix in
the second half, driven by the new VMAX 3. Importantly, EMC continues to outperform the market and we're very
well-positioned to benefit from any upside should the IT spending environment pick up. EMC is at the threshold of
expansive opportunity and we are very confident we're on the right track with our unique and powerful business model.
We are facing an opportunity right now that comes along only once every two or three decades, and the investments
we're making in leading-edge technologies today will determine our success over the long run.
Our market leadership, healthy partner ecosystem, go-to-market strength, cutting-edge technologies and a winning team
of three talent-rich organizations all support a strategy that deeply resonates with customers. Our ability to continually
gain profitable share, as we did this quarter, is directly tied to the soundness of our strategy, the flexibility of our
business model, the growing synergies across our businesses and the ability of our team to execute.
With that, I will turn it over to Tony to moderate Q&A. Tony?

Thanks, David. Before we open up the lines for your questions, as usual, we ask you to try and limit yourselves to one
question, including clarifications. We thank you all for your cooperation in this matter. Rebecca, can we have the first
question, please?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, we will begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions]
Our first question comes from Aaron Rakers. Aaron, your line is open.
<Q - Aaron C. Rakers>: Yes, thank you. Thank you for taking the question. So, you know, just looking at the
guidance, David, I can understand the variables on the revenue side, but one of the comments that you had made was
that after – it seems to imply after six quarters of year-over-year declines in EMC II gross margin that you're assuming
a fairly healthy uptick and even year-over-year increase in gross margin possibly into the 58% range into the second
half of the calendar year. Again, just speaking to EMC II, can you talk a little bit about the drivers of that? How do I
parse through, be it product mix relative to the change in unfilled orders and what that impact is through the second half
of the year? Thank you.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Aaron, sure. Thanks for the questions. So I'm glad you understand the revenue explanation. I
won't go through that again, unless we get a second question on it. Relative to gross margins, yes, we do expect them to
increase in the second half of the year over last year. We believe that we're on track to still have relatively flat gross
margins II for the full year.
The biggest driver of that is actually volume. The increase in volume of the second half is driven by the factors we
talked about, including the change in business practices which push a percentage more of the full year into the second
half. It's actually a pretty big driver. Also, we're expecting a little improvement in the High-End business with the new
Symmetrix, which we saw some pricing pressure in Q2. A lot of people knew that Symm was coming along and
obviously to entice customers to continue to invest in the second quarter, it cost us a couple of margin points on the
high-end. Now we've got that new high-end product out there. We feel we're in a better position to be able to compete
with both platforms in the market at the same time. But the biggest single driver will in fact be the increase in volume
because the increase in volume has a big impact on the fixed costs and that's what drives the increased margins we
expect in the second half.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thanks, Aaron. Next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Kulbinder Garcha. Your line is open.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thanks. A question for, I guess, Joe – and for David, you both kind of addressed this
upfront, but just on the speculation and the proposals, can I ask the question a different way. Suppose EMC and
VMware were separate companies, can you speak about the negative implications or the positive implications that that
might have for EMC II? You can answer that any which way you want. I'm just curious as to how you think about the
Federation and just to very clearly here why you think it's the right structure.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: Well, first, Kulbinder, I want to make it clear, other than speculation that I've read in the
press, I have not met with anybody from Elliott. As a matter of fact, in my whole life, I don't think I've ever met with
anybody from Elliott. So I really do want to hear what their proposals are and I'm sure they would like to hear some of
our plans as we presented to other shareholders.

The point here is I think you can capitalize – you can kind of put this all under one heading. If you think of what's
happening in Platform 3, I mean the whole game here is going to be how do you support customers in Platform 2 so
they feel comfortable and then how do you transition them and how do you make their journey as seamless as possible
to Platform 3?
So without a doubt, we have some great assets for Platform – David told you how much the new storage products are
growing up 52%. You know the Pivotal bookings, booking basis are up almost 60%. VMware was up 17%. VC was up
north of 50%. So we have tremendous assets and I went through those six new streams which have yet to play in the
market, which are going to be massive opportunities for us. So we have a great collective set. To me, splitting them up,
selling one of your most – spinning out one of your most strategic assets, I don't know another tech company that's
done that and been successful.
So again, I'm interested to hear ideas. We do have one basic total agreement coming into the meeting, is that I think we
both agree that EMC is undervalued and the question is how do we capture that value and make sure shareholders get
it.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: I guess, Joe, just to be clear, what your argument really is that there's quantifiable, real,
multiple examples of significant synergy across those two organizations which you can continue sharing with us. That's
the point, right?
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: That's right. We operate under the principle of strategic alignment. And then basically, where
competitors get in is when you leave seams. So we actually plan – when we plan our strategic alignment, we do plan
some overlaps. Do we get some flurry in the field and other places when we do have the overlap, a bit of overlap of
missions? Sure. But I think that's healthy.
And of course, like in anything, bad news travels multiple times as fast as good news, but the multitude as David went
through it, where this works fine, the way customers are looking for more cooperation, not less cooperation, our
strategic relevance, the opportunities we're getting, the opportunities [indiscernible] (41:30) that we're getting are just
fantastic. So, again, we're absolutely going to listen and – but again, I'm answering your question the best I can.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thank you very much.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thanks, Kulbinder. Next question, please.
Operator
The next question comes from Brian Marshall, your line is open.
<Q - Brian Marshall>: Great. Thanks, guys. As enterprise workloads migrate to the 3rd Platform, it seems like
YARNs, specifically Hadoop 2.0 is going to be an interesting sort of data platform that emerges. And obviously, David
talked a little bit about how Isilon plays into that, as well as Pivotal. But at the end of the day, can you help us think
about how this transition will be somewhat cannibalistic to some of the core array business at the company and how
you look to offset that? Thank you.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Brian, I think you have to look at these in two distinct buckets. The fundamental architecture
of a Platform 2 application that's built around file and block is just different from a Platform 3 architecture that's built
around Hadoop and Object. So you're not seeing a migration of workloads away from Platform 2 to Platform 3. You're
seeing new workloads emerge in Platform 3. You're not going to run your Platform 3 workloads on your Platform 2
infrastructure or vice versa. So think of them as two swim lanes, one of which is Platform 3, Hadoop, growing a lot
faster than Platform 2. So they are really additive in terms of the opportunity.
Now, we think that Hadoop and HDFS is going to be, obviously, a killer technology in the 3rd Platform. We're focused
on it with Isilon. We're focused on it with ViPR, with Elastic Cloud Storage and DSSD. So we're going to have a lot of
assets to pick up that growth as it develops. A lot of those applications are still being developed and some of the
existing ones are batch-based and a lot of the new ones are going to be in memory and there will be a combination of

both.
So there's going to be, if you like, a new set of technologies and architectures built around Hadoop. And one of the key
things is how you get the data out of your existing Platform 2 apps and into Platform 3 and that's obviously what we're
working on with some of our bridging technologies. But think of them as two very different environments, each of
which is going to have different dynamics in terms of their overall growth rate, but it really is additive.
<Q - Brian Marshall>: Helpful. Thank you.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thank you, Brian. The next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Alex Kurtz. Your line is open.
<Q - Alex Kurtz>: Yeah. Thanks, guys, for taking the question. David, can you just give me a little more detail about
when you think about synergies in the Federation around revenue and how it drives through the model, what are the
real key indicators for you about execution on that strategy? Is there anything you can share from the model about what
you expect how that drives through the model through VMware, Pivotal, EMC and some of these new Hadoop
products? How does that all filter into better margins and higher growth?
<A - David I. Goulden>: Sure, Alex, I can give you a couple of examples. Again, let me try and separate the
conversation between Platform 2 and Platform 3. So if you look at where the installed base is today, predominantly in
Platform 2. If you look at, for example, EMC storage in VMware environments, much higher than it is in the rest of the
marketplace. And of course, VMware is a big driver of overall application workloads in the 2nd Platform. So there are
clear examples there.
If you go to the 3rd Platform, a lot of the examples I talked about in my script, the three large examples were all
Platform 3 wins, where the customer really wants the Federation to come closer together to bring complete solutions. If
you look at what we're doing around these EVP solutions, things like SDDC, data lake, platform-as-a service, VDI,
security analytics; those are all 3rd Platform apps that leverage the power of the Federation. So we see it showing up in
wins. We see it showing up in our installed base and we think the synergy is going to be bigger in the 3rd Platform than
they were in the 2nd Platform.
<Q - Alex Kurtz>: Thanks.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thank you, Alex. Next question, please.

The next question comes from Nehal Chokshi. Your line is open.
<Q - Nehal Chokshi>: Yes. Thanks for taking my question. A couple of questions around the Emerging Storage; first
of all, it was flat Q-over-Q. The past three years it has been up at least 10% Q-over-Q. Can you talk about why it was
only flat?
And then on the XtremIO compression coming out, do you expect that to drive elasticity of demand in gigabytes with
the significant savings there? And how do you expect that to play out? And finally, can you address variable block size
operating system, why that's not needed on the XtremIO?
<A - David I. Goulden>: I'm sorry I missed the third part of the question. Can you just repeat the third part?
<Q - Nehal Chokshi>: Yes, your primary competitor on XtremIO claims that variable block size operating system is a
significant advantage. Can you discuss why you believe that's not a disadvantage for the XtremIO operating system?

<A - David I. Goulden>: Sure. Let's talk about – clearly, it's a three-part question. XtremIO compression is a huge
additional feature for us. Essentially, it broadens the aperture of the use cases enormously. Now I mentioned that
XtremIO has already got to a $300 million demand run rate in the second quarter without having compression. So it is
orders of magnitude bigger than anybody else in the marketplace and the expansion of compression now means it can
play in general purpose workloads on a broader basis.
The variable block size argument is basically crazy. Block sizes don't really matter, particularly to how these systems
work. Just look at the revenue growth that we've been able to achieve and the booking growth we've been able to
achieve so far. So what's different about XtremIO which is key, people try and focus on the wrong issue.
What's different about XtremIO is its fundamentally different architecture. It's truly scale-out, a lot of our XtremIO
customers are actually buying the system in multiple scale-out blocks. It has always-on data services, which means that
you never slow the system down because you have to go back and do things after you've written them to flash. The
flash lasts longer because of that. So architecturally it's completely different from other systems and that's what makes
it important and that's why it's growing so strongly, as we mentioned that growth rate has only continued into Q3.
And then in terms of being quarter-on-quarter, with any emerging business, you've got some lumpy things going on. So
we saw great growth sequentially across all of – most of the lines in there. Some of our larger object-oriented systems
have lumpy growth based upon individual orders and so that's why you saw a little bit of flatness quarter-on-quarter,
but the underlying growth rate for the sector is still very strong.
<Q - Nehal Chokshi>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: The next question, please.
Operator
Our next question comes from Andy Nowinski, your line is open.
<Q - Andrew J. Nowinski>: Thanks for the question. So VMware noted that vSAN has more than 300 customers now
in its first full quarter and they're adding more functionality to it down the road with VVOLs. So can you give us your
thoughts on whether it's competitive to ViPR in the ScaleIO block services that you've added or any of the other
platforms that serve in that sector?
<A - David I. Goulden>: Sure, Andrew, this is David, let me take that. Thanks for the questions. So, absolutely – let's
talk upon the area where there may be I think a little bit more confusion out there, specifically when it comes to vSAN
versus ScaleIO. The ViPR is a much broader software-defined storage platform, but ScaleIO and vSAN are two
software-defined block storage products.
But let me explain, they're very different. They're from very different design points. One is naturally part of EMC and
one is actually naturally part of VMware. Let's talk about vSAN, vSAN essentially is an extension of vSphere. It lets
vSphere manage the storage that it is sitting on top of and it's great for things like remote branch office. If you look at
the example that Kyle gave yesterday on a couple of ELAs they spoke about. One was for remote branch office
application, the other one was for internal storage inside a caching server where the customer wanted to basically have
the ability to upgrade those environments very rapidly. So repurpose-built for that world.
ScaleIO is also a software-defined block storage product, but it is designed to be a separate layer that sits outside of
VMware. Think of it as the block storage part of ViPR. It's designed for massive scalability across thousands of
servers. It's also designed to run in a completely heterogeneous environment, physical, bare metal, all forms of a
hypervisor, so one is basically storage within vSphere, the other is software-defined storage that is designed to work as
a separate pool of storage outside of the server operating environment.
And we think there's a lot of market potential for both and we are making sure that we have our sales forces aligned so
they can position the products properly. But there really isn't much overlap, even between ScaleIO and vSAN and
there's almost no overlap at all between what we're doing with ViPR and vSAN.

The next question comes from Keith Bachman. Your line is open.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi, I wanted to ask a question, Joe, of you if I could, in terms of aggregate demand. As you
think about – NetApp commented that they thought the demand profile for storage had been increasing. I was
wondering if you could characterize that. But particularly, drilling down on the fact of workload distributions; in other
words, if you look at the aggregate growth rate of storage over the next couple of quarters, when you have products
such as XtremIO or Pure Storage or Nimble, are you seeing dollars transfer from what you would characterize as at the
high-end in your category of Symm and VNX or more broadly, legacy products? Are you seeing the migration of those
dollars into emerging categories or indeed these new workloads? If you could just talk a little bit about, A, has there
been an inflection point, any kind of inflection point change in storage? And then, B, how are you thinking about the
aggregate growth rate of storage as you think about legacy products versus emerging technologies? Thank you.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Keith this is David, let me start with that and then hand over to Joe. So picking your question
up from the bottom forward. In terms of XtremIO, obviously, we can talk about what we see in the marketplace. We
see about 20% of our XtremIO sales going into environments where people are moving applications from high-end or
mid-tier storage systems. But bear in mind they're moving individual apps, they're not replacing a complete storage
system. They found one app that really benefits from the always-on value proposition of all-flash storage arrays. And
obviously, what those storage arrays don't have is the multi-tiering and all the other things and all the multi-site
capabilities et cetera of a high-end storage system.
So about 20% of the situations we find people are moving apps off a Symm or a VNX and about 80% is going into new
environments. So if you think of VDI being our biggest use case, for example, with XtremIO, that's the net new
application area. People were not running VDI systems on the Symmetrix are not going to move them off to an
XtremIO, they're starting off with net new deployments of VDI on XtremIO. By the way, another good area of synergy
across the Federation, obviously, the desktop business inside or the end-user business inside of VMware is growing
very rapidly and as is all-flash array in the same marketplace, so a good example of synergy.
In terms of workload distribution and aggregate demand, we see continued caution out there, as I mentioned in my
comments. We see a lot of our customers grappling with the Platform 2, Platform 3 debate and how much investment
dollars they spend on one versus the other. And as I said before, they're very different environments. So we see that and
just a macro IT caution being a bigger factor than anything at the micro level going on with storage other than the
continued impact of that upon people just continuing to use more efficiency technologies, extend the life of their
installed base [ph] fact (54:10) as we talked about for several quarters.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: So no real change in the demand profile that you guys have witnessed?
<A - David I. Goulden>: Nothing more than we – basically, I think we were fairly consistent with what we said at the
start of the year, in terms of we expected IT spending and storage growth to be broadly similar to what they were in
2013. That's the assumption that we've set our plans against and we still see that being the right assumption.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: It's Joe. Just to add a little bit of color. As you look at what our position, we have this
tremendous broad spectrum of storage solutions, all the way from what we're doing in converged infrastructure, back
into the newer products like XtremIO, ScaleIO, vSAN. So we can kind of listen – we go into the customer, understand
where they are, where they need to go and we have a great selection. And there's nobody else. There is nobody else in
that category. There's point – we have point competitors, so we talk about our storage competitors, we've got a – have a
synthetic consolidation of about five different companies to say this is where we compete. And so it's a tremendous

strategic advantage we have.
And second, I will say something, a lot of these new flash companies are making a lot of noise, but I'll make a little bit
of noise right now. They got the wrong architecture, because if you're really going to play in the future and you don't
have scale-out, you're going to lose. And if you look at what we're doing in the future, whether it's ScaleIO, vSAN or
XtremIO, all scale-out. If you look at what we're doing with the system we kind of just tipped our hat to a little bit and
kind of lifted up the kimono a little bit and gave you a peek at, DSSD, all scale-out.
So, when I look at rack-scales, when you look at what's going to happen on the Hadoop market, obviously, I think
you're going to be looking at, on the bottom layer, when you're storing these huge persistent data, at slightly lower
margin percentage. But if you look at margin dollars, it's way bigger. So when I look at the future, I'm actually excited
about our position. And then if you look at the layers of how we play with Pivotal, of how we play with VMware and
put that all together, it's extremely compelling.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: All right, thanks, guys. Good luck.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thank you, Keith. Next question, please.
Operator
The next question is from Brian Alexander. Your line is open.
<Q - Brian G. Alexander>: Okay. Thanks. Just a question on the Federation. You highlighted some key wins with
global accounts that leveraged the Federation. So maybe go into more detail about how you're motivating that behavior,
how maybe you're altering go-to-market strategies, sales structures et cetera to facilitate that. And then related to that, is
this something you intend to push harder with your channel or is this more of a direct sales effort at this point? Thanks.
<A - David I. Goulden>: Brian, thank you. Let me start. So as to your last question, yes, with the channel because a lot
of our channel partners actually have relationships with all parts of the Federation. We just announced a new partner
program at EMC World this year to make that actually even easier for them to transact with the different parts of the
company. So this applies to both.
So from a go-to-market point of view, we're doing a couple of things. We are coordinating more closely now across our
top global accounts to make sure we have a coordinated sale situation. We're also, as I mentioned, investing in these
EMC, VMware, Pivotal solutions, which are design points and proof points for how the Federation comes together in
the 3rd Platform. So there are a number of initiatives that we're taking, the channel, the global accounts and EVP, so
will be just three examples of making sure we can make it more seamless. And as I mentioned, particularly in the 3rd
Platform, that's when we can get a lot of demand from our customers to really come together and offer a stack or a suite
which brings parts of the companies together, because obviously, the market there is less mature and people are looking
for complete solutions.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: Thanks, Brian.
<Q - Brian G. Alexander>: Thanks.
<A - Anthony T. Takazawa>: We have time for one more question and then a few closing comments from Joe.
Operator
Our final question comes from Ben Reitzes. Your line is open.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Well, good morning. You know, it's safe to say that the last three guys probably asked what I
wanted. But a little more on the VMware front, are you guys – is there – without maybe giving things away, there's
been some reports in the press about you guys getting even closer to VMware as well in your go-to-market strategies

and perhaps a hedge to some of the competition that's emerging out there, with current partners as well as something on
the offensive. Is there anything you want to say about that and how could you move closer together and how excited
you are or not about joint products that you could put out together that could give us a better indication of synergy as
well?
<A - Joseph M. Tucci>: Well I don't want to preannounce any products, Ben. But if you look at the marketplace and
you look at, say, the big players, clearly – if you look at say IBM, they're in security, they're in big data, they're in
consulting services, cloud services, they're doing a lot with software and their own SDDC; Cisco very similar and
Oracle very similar. So basically, we're going to follow our roadmap and we are going to continue to provide that
choice. But together, we're going to make sure we're better than ever strategically aligned. We're going to continue,
again, and this is where the choice will come in, that each of these – each of the companies will focus on their mission.
And then the thing you're – David alluded to it and I think I mentioned it before, we are operationally aligning where it
makes sense, around specific opportunities. And David gave you three of them, around some bigger global accounts,
around some big partners, around our EVP solutions. And there will be other areas where we operationally align. Some
of them will be around actual announcements of products, but I don't want to go there yet. So that's the playbook that
we're following and I think when you look at what our competition and in some cases and I think coopetition is going
to – companies that can coopetate are going to be more successful. So how we basically – I think I made up a word, but
companies that understand how to do that, I think are going to win because customers – I am totally convinced that if
you don't give customers some choice, you're not going to be in as good a stead in this transition to Platform 3 and I
think that's where we'll shine.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Okay. Thanks a lot.
Joseph M. Tucci
Well, first of all, thank you for being with us and in closing, I want you all to understand, we really believe we have a
terrific set of assets and a very strong strategic position and I could tell you it's a position that is the envy of many of
our IT peers out there.
We are laser-focused on the Platform 3 opportunity, but as we've said before, we're also focused on supporting our
customers in their Platform 2 environments, where most of the applications and most of their businesses run on today.
And we see a fantastic opportunity and help them transition to this new mobile, cloud, big data era and this is where the
full power of the Federation will shine.
We are balancing, trying hard and we're open to all your suggestions of balancing our investments in the business and
our return of cash to shareholders. As David has indicated, across the companies, we have a strong product roadmap
ahead of us, and most importantly, we have momentum and our people believe in our future. So thank you for being
with us today and we'll be talking with you.
