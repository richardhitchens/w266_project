In the third quarter, we reported $23.7 billion in revenue, expanded gross and net operating margins, and increased
operating earnings per share by 10% to $3.99. For the year, we are maintaining our full-year 2013 expectation for
operating EPS of at least $16.25 on all-in basis or $16.90 excluding the second quarter work force rebalancing charge.
Looking at the results by business, our total Services business returned to modest revenue growth at constant currency,
led by 5% growth in GBS. Our backlog was up 2%, or 6% at constant currency, with another strong performance from
GBS. Software delivered mid-single-digit growth at constant currency in key branded middleware. In Hardware,
growth and System z mainframe was more than offset by declines in Power, System x and Storage. Two-thirds of the
overall hardware decline was driven by the growth markets.
Across IBM, we delivered strong performance in our growth initiatives that address key market trends, Smarter Planet,
business analytics and cloud, leveraging both organic investments and acquisitions. Our Smarter Planet solutions are up
more than 20% through September, and business analytics is up 8% year-to-date. In cloud, we closed the acquisition of
SoftLayer in July which significantly improves our capabilities in public and hybrid cloud. For the first time, we
delivered more than $1 billion of cloud revenue in a quarter, of which $460 million is delivered as a cloud service.
Through the first three quarters, our cloud revenue was up more than 70% year-to-year.
From a geographic perspective, our challenge this quarter was in growth markets, where revenue was down 9% or 5%
at constant currency. Our performance in growth markets has historically outpaced major markets by 8 to 10 points, but
this quarter, for the first time, the growth markets trailed the majors. I'll get into the specifics and actions later in the
call.
For the quarter, IBM's revenue was down 4%, or down about 1.5 points at constant currency. So the currency impact to
revenue was about 2.5 points. Currency also impacted our profit performance. As we've discussed in the past, a
weakening yen drops largely to the bottom line. This quarter we improved gross and net margins. Our operating gross
margin expanded by one point, driven by an improvement in Services margins and the relative strength of Software and
Mainframe. The net margin improvement also reflects savings from the second quarter work force rebalancing activity,
tough-minded spending actions and a better tax rate.
There are three drivers of the lower tax rate. First, discrete benefits associated with recent foreign tax audits; second, a
reduction in the ongoing effective tax rate, which we now expect to be in the range of 23% for the year and through
2014; and third, last year's tax included a higher rate on the gain from the divestiture of our RSS business. Bottom line,
we delivered operating EPS of $3.99, which was up 10% year-to-year.
Now I'll get into the third quarter details, starting with revenue by geography, where I'll discuss the results on a
constant-currency basis. I'll start with a few comments by major geography and then provide a perspective on the
majors versus growth markets. Americas revenue was flat year-to-year, which is a three-point improvement from last
quarter's rate. The improvement came equally from the U.S. and Canada, and once again we had strong performance in
Latin America.
Our EMEA revenue was down 2%, fairly consistent with last quarter. Western Europe in particular showed some
stability while Eastern Europe, led by Russia, had double-digit declines. In Asia-Pacific, revenue was down 4%. Within
that, Japan's revenue was up 5% with good performance across hardware, software, and services. This was the fourth
consecutive quarter of revenue growth, with good execution by the team in Japan. Consequently, the AP decline was
driven by the growth market countries.
So now let me comment on the major markets versus growth markets globally. Major markets year-to-year
performance improved by almost two points from last quarter. In fact, this is the best major market performance since
the first quarter of 2012. Our challenge this quarter was in the growth markets, which were down 5%. Though we
continue to gain share and deliver strong growth in Latin America as well as Middle East and Africa, we fell short of
our objectives in the market and other regions. Our performance in growth markets was driven about half by execution
and half by a pause as China moves through the process to develop its new economic plans.

China was down 22%. We experienced a slowdown in demand across the board, but most significantly in hardware,
which was down about 40% and which makes up about 40% of our business in China. While we had some execution
problems during the third quarter, we were impacted by the process surrounding China's development of a broad-based
economic reform plan, which will be available mid-November. In the meantime, demand from state-owned enterprises
and public sector has slowed significantly, as decision-making and procurement cycles lengthened. We believe the
changes will take time to implement and do not expect demand in China to pick up until after the first quarter of next
year.
Now let me put this in context. The hardware performance in China accounted for all five points of the constant
currency decline in the growth markets and for 1.2 points of the 1.6 points of constant currency decline for all of IBM.
Regarding execution in the growth markets, we understand the issues and have already taken management actions to
improve performance. Looking forward, we have confidence that we can get this back on track. We expect a change in
trajectory starting in the fourth quarter and will be back to growth early in 2014.
Turning now to IBM's revenue by segment, in GBS, we improved our year-to-year constant currency growth rate to
5%, led by consulting and systems integration. Our GTS performance is a modest improvement from last quarter's rate,
reflecting the addition of SoftLayer to our portfolio.
Our software revenue grew 2% at constant currency, led by key branded Middleware at 4%. Performance was stronger
in the infrastructure layer, including solutions for Data Management, Application Servers, Security, Mobile and
Rational development tools. As I said earlier, in Systems and Technology the deceleration in our performance was
primarily driven by the growth markets.
In Global Financing we had growth in both financing revenue, which was driven by client asset growth, as well as new
sales. The return on equity in our Financing business was 38% this quarter.
Turning to gross profit, our operating gross margin improved a point, driven by a combination of margin expansion in
both Services segments and an improving segment mix.
Now let's take a look below the gross profit line to our expense and spending profile. Our total operating expense and
other income was flat year-to-year. Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove two points of expense growth. Currency
contributed a point of decline, driven by translation. So consequently, our base expense was better by two points.
Now I'll comment on a few items that had year-to-year impacts. Last year we had a significant charge for workforce
rebalancing activity. We also had a significant gain from the sale of our Retail Store Solutions business. So looking at
the year-to-year dynamics, in SG&A workforce rebalancing is down nearly $400 million year-to-year, and in other
income and expense, divestiture gains are down over $450 million.
Next, parts of our business didn't perform as expected, and as you know, IBM has a pay-for-performance culture.
Accordingly, performance related compensation across both costs and expense was down about $175 million
year-to-year.
Finally, I want to comment on the impact of currency this quarter. In the third quarter, the hedge activity was fairly
neutral in the period, though on a year-to-year basis hedging gains were down about $80 million, with about
three-quarters in expense and the balance in cost. While there have been a number of currency movements year-to-year,
we have been significantly impacted by the depreciation of the yen. Because our business in Japan is dominated by
local services without cross-border cash flows to hedge, the impact falls largely to the bottom line. The year-to-year
profit impact was more significant than the third quarter and will continue at current spot rates through the first quarter
of next year.
Now let's turn to the segments, starting with Services. This quarter the two Services segments generated $14 billion in
revenue, declining 3% as reported but at constant currency return to growth of 1%. Pre-tax profit was up 17%, and
pre-tax margin expanded by 3.3 points. Total backlog was $141 billion, up 2% at spot rates and up 6% at constant
currency. Backlog again grew across both the Transactional and Outsourcing businesses.

Turning to the two segments, Global Technology Services revenue was $9.5 billion, down 4% or down 1% at constant
currency. This represents a one point improvement over last quarter's year-to-year performance. In Outsourcing, we
continued to see a decline in revenue from sales into existing base accounts and from the structural work we did
previously on low margin contracts. Our Integrated Technology Services revenue was up 2% at constant currency and
grew in both major and growth markets. GTS delivered 12% pre-tax profit growth in the quarter and expanded pre-tax
margin by 2.8 points. Margin expansion was driven by lower year-to-year workforce rebalancing charges and some
savings from second quarter rebalancing actions along with tough minded spend actions and continued efficiency
improvements.
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue of $4.6 billion was flat as reported and up 5% at constant currency.
That's up from 2% last quarter. With this performance, GBS gained share.
From a geographic perspective, there was growth across the portfolio, led by North America and Japan. Europe
returned to growth for the first time since the beginning of 2012. Looking at the GBS business by our two major
categories, we had good results across the portfolio. Within the digital front office we delivered double-digit growth
across the initiatives, business analytics, Smarter Planet and cloud. And within our back office solutions that we call the
Globally Integrated Enterprise, we again grew in implementation services that support the traditional packaged
applications.
Turning to profit, GBS grew 28% year-to-year and PTI margin expanded by 4.4 points. The year-to-year profit drivers
included lower year-to-year workforce rebalancing charges, savings from second quarter rebalancing, and
tough-minded spend actions. So to wrap up services, we returned to revenue growth this quarter. Our growth initiatives
continued to perform. We grew pre-tax profit expanded profit margins, and we're entering the next quarter with solid
backlog growth of 6% at constant currency.
Software revenue of $5.8 billion was up 1% or 2% at constant currency. Segment pre-tax income of $2.4 billion was up
2%. Our strategic Key Branded Middleware revenue grew 3% or 4% at constant currency and held share. I'll take you
through the drivers by brand. WebSphere was up 1% at constant currency. Within WebSphere we saw strength in
mobile and good performance in application server. Information management software grew 3% at constant currency.
Our distributed database had a good quarter with double-digit growth.
Tivoli software was up 3% at constant currency, driven by storage growth in our portfolio of security solutions. Our
security business delivered another quarter of double-digit growth. The acquisition of Trusteer in the third quarter
extends our data security capabilities further into cloud and mobile environments. Rational grew 14% at constant
currency. Rational's DevOps solution leverages IBM's cloud capabilities for the rapid and iterative deployment of
software. Social workforce solutions grew 15%, driven by Kenexa, which provides cloud-based recruiting and talent
management.
Looking forward to the fourth quarter, we have a strong pipeline in software. Consequently, we expect improvement in
software revenue growth and double-digit growth in profit.
Systems and technology revenue of $3.2 billion was down 17%, and growth markets performance drove two thirds of
the revenue decline, about half of which was China. This impacted each of the hardware brands. System z grew 7% at
constant currency, with double-digit growth in the major markets. MIPS were up 56% driven again by specialty
engines, which were up more than 90%. During the quarter we successfully launched the new zEnterprise midrange
server with over 50% more capacity than its predecessor.
Power revenue was down 37% at constant currency. High-performance computing accounted for 10 points of the
decline. To improve future performance, we're continuing to invest to expand our Power platform to go after the Linux
opportunity, which is now larger than UNIX and growing more rapidly. System x was down 16% at constant currency.
Storage hardware revenue was down 10% at constant currency. This decline was driven by the growth markets. In the
major markets, storage revenue was up. Our Storwize products again delivered double-digit growth and we also
continued to grow our flash solutions. These were offset by declines in our legacy OEM midrange offerings and
softness in the high-end. PureSystems continue to gain momentum. In the major markets, we grew more than 30%

sequentially. Globally, we shipped over 2,000 systems in the third quarter with over 8,000 total shipments since
announcement.
Moving onto the cash flow analysis, we discuss our free cash flow performance excluding the change in global
financing receivables. We do this because we consider the financing receivables as an investment to generate returns,
not as working capital that should be minimized for efficiency.
As I mentioned earlier, our global financing business is delivering a terrific return on equity. This quarter, we generated
$2.2 billion of free cash flow, down $900 million year-to-year. There were three key drivers of the year-to-year decline,
higher work force rebalancing payment for the second quarter program, changes in sales cycle working capital, and our
operational performance.
Through the first three quarters of the year, we generated $6.6 billion, which is down $2 billion year-to-year. Looking
at the uses of our cash through September, we spent $2.6 billion to acquire seven companies, including four in the third
quarter, the largest of which was SoftLayer. We've returned just over $11 billion to shareholders this year. We paid out
$3 billion in dividends and spent over $8 billion in gross share repurchase to buy back almost 40 million shares. At the
end of the third quarter, we had $5.6 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $10.2 billion. Total debt was $36.2 billion, of
which $25.8 billion was in support of our financing business, which is leveraged at just over 7-to-1. Our non-financing
debt was $10.4 billion, effectively flat year-to-year, and our non-financing debt-to-capital was 39%. We continue to
have a high degree of financial flexibility with a strong balance sheet to support our business objectives.
When you look at the year-to-year drivers of our operating EPS performance, the 4% decline in revenue at constant
margin impacted profit growth by $0.15 per share. Margin expansion was the largest contributor to our growth. Within
that, we had positive contribution from gross margin expansion and a lower tax rate, mitigated by a higher E to R. Our
ongoing share repurchase program contributed the balance at a level fairly consistent with last quarter.
So to wrap up, in the third quarter, the combination of continued momentum in key growth areas, better business mix,
yield from productivity initiatives, reductions in spending and compensation, discrete tax benefits and effective use of
cash all enabled us to deliver 10% operating EPS growth. Clearly, we need to improve performance, predominantly in
the growth markets. And keep in mind, that we're dealing with a couple of substantial headwinds.
We absorbed a significant impact from currency in these results and are affected by the pause during the development
of China's new economic plans. As far as the growth markets are concerned, we will be dealing with the China impact
for another couple of quarters. More broadly, in growth markets, we are taking management actions to improve
execution and are confident we can get it back on track and improve our performance starting in the fourth quarter,
driving to mid-single-digit performance in growth markets in 2014.
Looking to the future, we expect continued strong performance in our growth initiatives: Smarter Planet, business
analytics and cloud. These not only address key market trends, but they drive a higher mix of software and
consequently a higher margin. We'll continue our transformation over the long term to a higher-margin annuity-base
and even stronger business profile. And so with this improved operational performance, continued momentum in our
growth initiatives and the flexibility in the financial model, we are maintaining our view of at least $16.25 of operating
EPS in 2013 and remain confident in our ability to achieve at least $20 in 2015.
Now Patricia and I will take your questions.
Patricia Murphy
Thank you, Mark. Before we begin the Q&A, I'd like to remind you of a couple of items. First, we have supplemental
charts at the end of the deck that complement our prepared remarks. And second, I'd ask you to refrain from multi-part
questions. When we conclude the Q&A, I'll turn the call back to Mark for final comments.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. You may ask your question.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: [question inaudible] (22:02) ...pipeline and maybe mid-single-digit revenue growth and
a return to growth in services a bit stronger...
<A - Patricia Murphy>: I'm sorry, Steve. Steve, can you start at the beginning? We missed the beginning of your
question.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Can you hear me?
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Now we can, yeah.
<Q - Steven M. Milunovich>: Okay. Sorry about that. Coming into the quarter, Mark, you talked about
mid-single-digit revenue growth in software and somewhat stronger services growth than you posted. So even aside
from the hardware issues in China, it seems like things are a bit weaker. What do you attribute that to? Is it just demand
as we're hearing at a lot of enterprise companies? How much of it is execution? Because in the third quarter last year
you had some software execution problems, you're talking about some growth market execution problems. I guess, how
much is under your control? How much isn't?
<A - Mark Loughridge>: Okay. Well, let's – let me answer your question in stages just as you asked it. So let's start
with software. I agree; we did not have the software quarter we were looking for. If you look historically, both for the
IBM Corporation and certainly for the software business, third quarters tend to be difficult for us. Fourth quarters tend
to be strong. So I would expect based on all of the work we've done to look at their pipeline going into the fourth, that
we would maintain that relative characteristic and see our Key Branded Middleware with growth rates in the kind of
mid-single digits and double-digit profitability in the fourth quarter.
You know, if you look at the characteristics, once we get to the end of the year, obviously quotas close out December
31, so there's an awful lot of energy in the sales organization as we close the year, but we have typically had this same
pattern as you have seen if you go back the last number of years with the difficult third followed by a stronger fourth
quarter. I think that has a lot to do with our overall software performance.
Now when you go to the Services organization, however, I would say the first of all backlog up 6%, that's pretty good
performance. If you look at the GTS business, I mean GTS did improve revenue, albeit on a more marginal base, but
the GTS are long extended contracts. It is the battleship to turn here. On the other hand, GBS at 5%, I think that's pretty
good. And if we look back on the GBS profile over the last four quarters, they've taken that business from a minus two,
to a plus five. And as we look at their strength as they have built that backlog, we see closer to plus seven as we go into
the fourth quarter. And in both cases returning services, as we had said, to growth in the third quarter and both third and
fourth generating double-digit profitability.
So I do think we saw the cadence of improvement on our Services business. I think on the software side, we wrestled
with this kind of typically weaker third followed by what we're looking to be a stronger fourth.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Steve. Can we go to the next question, please?
Operator
The next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Thank you. I wanted to follow up on the first question but a bit more broadly. I
understand some of the specific issues this quarter around China, but if we kind of step back and think about what's

been happening to IBM over a longer period recently, you've had six straight quarters where revenue growth has been
negative. You've missed consensus revenue expectations for seven straight quarters. If it weren't for a huge tax benefit
this quarter, it would've been a very significant EPS miss, which has occurred to IBM in the last couple of quarters and
hadn't occurred in seven or eight years. So if we step back beyond the current quarter, we see a pattern of financial
performance that is way out of whack with your historical model. Lower revenue growth and operating profit growth
that is dramatically lower but has been buttressed by tax rate and not including workforce rebalancing charges.
So my simple question is what's changed in the last six or seven quarters? Has there been less of a focus on execution
that had to do with the change in leadership at the top? Are you seeing new secular forces? I think it's very easy to
explain away a given quarter, but six, seven or eight quarters in a row begin to make a trend. And so perhaps you can
try and address what you think is happening more broadly? And whether we should be thinking about a financial model
that is more like 0% revenue growth and something less than double-digit earnings growth on a sustained basis?
<A - Mark Loughridge>: Okay. Toni, as always, a very good question. Let me answer your question by giving you a
framework for how I would look at that in 2013 then moving into 2014 to give a framework for the dynamics and how
we intend to deal with them.
So first of all to state the obvious, I mean we never said that the roadmap progression would be a straight line. And
we're assessing our progress on a year-to-year basis versus the $16.25 at least for the year. I will say that to me, and I
think we have stated this repeatedly that tax and shares are operational cadence for us, but I do not debate your point
that we have had some very discrete difficulties as we've gone through the quarters, which I want to address now.
I would say broadly that plus or minus the software and services portion of our business has been marching down the
field in kind of the structure that we're looking for. We talked a little bit earlier, GBS has made very good progress. We
got backlog up at 6% at constant currency. We did get some lift in our GTS business, both generating profitability. So I
don't think that the services business have shown a substantially different vector, and in fact are improving as we go
forward. Software, I agree with the point, difficult third quarter. I got to say, you know, in that software organization,
just like for the broader IBM, we tend to have more difficulty in third quarters and stronger fourth quarters.
But to be specific to your question, what's changed, we had two major headwinds that really hit us hard this year. So on
a year-to-date basis, we had $1 billion of year-to-date decline in profitability from our hardware business. Now that is
quite substantial. That is quite substantial as a headwind. And on top of that $1 billion of profit decline in our hardware
business, we had a $500 million year-to-date, year-to-year impact from currency. Now that's clearly the theoretical
upper limit but given the fact that the bulk of that impact is from the movement of unhedged currencies like the impact
from the yen, that presented us with a pretty stiff challenge.
So in a way, if you look at the bottom line performance in 2013, the elements of financial flexibility, whether that be
tax, both the discrete items that we've recognized in the third quarter, or the improvement of the rate, which extends
through 2014, or the benefit of share repurchase, has helped along with the operational performance that we did see
from software and services, helped mitigate, absorb and partially offset this very strong headwind we had in the
hardware business, and the currency. Now if you look at currency, currency at current spot rates should right itself as
we go into the second quarter of next year.
Now obviously we'll all be tracking that over time, but that's what the math would say. So that leaves us with the
impact from hardware. So if you look at the hardware content, the point we were making in the third quarter
performance that in that hardware base of business, the kind of nexus of erosion that we had was really in China. Now
China broadly in a year accounts for about 5% of IBM and about 40% of that business is hardware. But the hardware
business across those elements of the product line excepting zSeries performance, it was down substantially. I mean,
we're talking 40%, 50%, enormous reductions on a year-to-year basis in a geography where we tended to see growth
rates.
You can see that in compare we had to China last year, up 19%, so up 19% last year, driven heavily by really strong
performance on the hardware base that is this year down. And you got to look at that and say what significantly
accounts for that? And I would say quite honestly, if you look at the elements in China and as we have worked with the

team in China, there simply has been a substantial impact as the process surrounding China's development of a
broad-based economic reform plan takes shape. And that is going to be announced and available, we think, in
November. It probably will take some time to implement, so I think we're looking at a couple of quarters. But once that
economic plan is announced, adds clarity to the market, we should see, I think and certainly within our team, a recovery
in the demand pattern for state-owned enterprise and public sector.
Now if you look at the profile that we would be counting on that generating next year, we'd be looking for the growth
markets with that new economic plan in China to recover and generate something mid-single digits. And in fact, if you
took that hardware impact that we saw in China, I mean frankly, that hardware impact in China is all of the decline in
our growth markets unit.
So I think that's a rational set of objectives. And with that performance in our growth markets unit next year, again,
back to mid-single digits as we get the better definition on the economic plan in China and improve performance across
the other regions in GMU. That too should help us suspend the erosion that we are seeing in our Hardware business. On
a year-to-year basis, I frankly think we've set a pretty low bar to establish our financial structure and our operations
objectives for our other business units, expecting only flat year-to-year profitability, which clearly this year is a loss.
Now one would think we could do even better than that, but on a flat basis for the STG business in 2014 compared to
2013, with our new pSeries POWER8 product set to address the Linux opportunity, which you know is larger than
UNIX opportunity and growing, better growth in volume behind our Pure Flex business, which is picking up steam and
broader exposure to our flash memory content in storage, that should help us right size it even though in the mainframe
side of the house we will be driving more towards the microcode upgrade part of the zSeries cycle. All of that clearly
complemented in 2014 by the benefit on a year-to-year basis of the workforce rebalancing yield that we've already
taken, which in 2014 will be more than enough to offset the year-to-year challenge from the tax discrete items that we
saw this year, complemented additionally by the financial flexibility that we have to drive share repurchase.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Toni. Let's go to the next question.

The next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.
<Q - Bill C. Shope>: Okay, great. Thanks. On the growth market challenges, I think you've been very clear on the
macro drivers and the government issues within China. But looking at the execution component you mentioned, as we
think about the normalization process here, could you give us some more granularity on exactly what the execution
issues are? And I think when we look at this longer term, given how sharp some of the downturns – how sharp some
the shortfalls are in this segment for you, what gives you confidence that the problems in Asia Pac and the growth
markets specifically aren't secular in nature for IBM?
<A - Mark Loughridge>: Yes. I think – let me give this framework for the explanation. First of all, if you look at the
performance that we saw this quarter in growth markets, revenue at constant currency down 5% compared to the IT
growth rate in growth markets of plus five, we have about a 10 point gap there. So we did a very kind of simple back of
the envelope analysis on that to distinguish what was macro and what was execution, and we said, well, if we took that
big STG erosion that we saw in China that we would conclude is highly related to the process of developing the
Chinese economic policy, if we snap that out, the growth markets would've been flat. And so to us that sounds like
about 5 of that 10 point gap to the industry coming from a macro environment issue.
The other five we think is pure execution. Now I would argue that you've seen our ability to put leadership teams on the
ground to turn our performance in geographic. Now the hallmark in that respect for us is Japan. Japan has really turned
around in a very big way under the leadership of Martin Jetter and his team that engage quite broadly, and we've seen
that perform quarter after quarter with that leadership capability.
So in the growth markets organization, the leadership team that established that to begin with and drove that
organization is now back in the cockpit, led by Bruno Di Leo and his leadership team. They know how to get this done.

They helped build this to begin with. I think that's an explanation on the macro environment impact that we saw that we
would say accounted for about half that differential to the industry as well as the leadership differential and the actions
that IBM has taken to address those on the execution element.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Bill. Can we go to the next question, please?

The next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel, Nicolaus. You may ask your question.
<Q - David M. Grossman>: Thank you. I'm wondering if we can just turn to free cash flow for a minute, Mark. Is the
free cash flow year-to-date in your view a good proxy for the 2013 decline? Or do you think you go up or down in the
fourth quarter? And then secondly, are you still comfortable given where we are and where the fundamentals of the
business are with the free cash flow target outlined in the 2015 roadmap?
<A - Mark Loughridge>: Yeah, a very, very good point. Let me address that, starting with where we see ourselves in
3Q and on a year-to-date basis. So year-to-date, we are down $2 billion of free cash flow. And if you look at the drivers
behind that, that would be broken down into the operational performance, obviously, of the business; our performance
on sales cycle, working capital, those two, I would say, are execution based; and then the complement being the impact
that we've seen on cash tax. We do see that now as more in a little over $1 billion range. We had originally thought
more like $2 billion. We now think it's more like $1 billion. And the cash side of our workforce rebalancing. But that's
only the elements of that year-to-date performance.
I think more importantly is how we see that full year 2013 free cash flow, which will be down on a year-to-year basis,
how we see that moving through the roadmap to 2014 and 2015. So in 2014, based on that same kind of structured
model that I described to you, we would see our free cash flow, excepting the impact of cash taxes, growing at a rate of
about 15% to 20%. Now cash taxes, we believe now in 2014, will be a headwind of about $2 billion. But even
including cash taxes, we would see our free cash flow growing by a little over $1 billion. So the operational profile
within that in that 15% to 20% range and on that basis, free cash flow growing faster than net income.
Going to 2015, we would see that free cash flow, now including the inclusion of cash taxes, growing at about 15% to
20%. Again, free cash flow growing more rapidly than net income. And in 2015, that cash taxes should be a tailwind as
opposed to the headwind that we've been wrestling with in 2014 and 2015.
Now if you took that back and say, well, let's structure that around the financial roadmap, as you remember, the
roadmap we detailed what we saw in the usage of free cash flow and said we expected to spend about $90 billion
between share repurchase, dividends and acquisitions. That $90 billion on a gross basis is about $85 billion, $86 billion
on a net basis. And the free cash flow that we see across the roadmap is also in that range of $85 billion-plus or minus.
So over the roadmap, those two relatively balance, and that's not including cash inflow that we would think would be
likely from potential divestitures. So with that basis, even though we had a disappointing free cash flow performance
this year, we still see the overall construct through the roadmap supporting those original objectives.
Now across those elements of share buyback, dividends, and acquisitions, there's fungibility, right? You've seen that
even in our to-date performance on the first 2.5 years of the roadmap, more share repurchases, a little less acquisitions,
and so I don't think the category or the cadence across the years will be linear. But I think the aggregate is still very,
very relevant and the best guide for you to use as you look at our usage of free cash flow.

<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Yeah, thanks. I appreciate it. Mark, I wanted to ask you about the $20 roadmap and the
philosophy behind it. I think what our challenge tonight is going to be when we go back to investors and we look at the
base of 2013 and we exclude all the tax benefits, you know we're talking about a number that might be around $16 and
we're talking about trailing free cash flow of around $14.60. So eventually, free cash flow and earnings tend to migrate
to each other, and then let's just forget free cash flow and start at a $16 base. You've got to grow 12% each year to get
to $20. And I'm just thinking with the acceleration that we've got to convince people that you're getting there. So I'm
wondering what is the confidence level in the $20 based on that, based on that kind of a conversation that we need to
have with investors to get you there? And how do we get them there? And what your confidence level as of today?
Thanks.
<A - Mark Loughridge>: Yes. Really, the basis for that trajectory to 2015 involves, number one, in 2014, stabilizing
our STG, our hardware business on a profitability basis to be relatively flat on a year-to-year basis. We have absorbed
this year that $1 billion decline on a year-to-year basis, and I showed how I thought that really did correlate based on
the work the team has done to the issues we had in China. But we believe it should be a very reasonable objective to
stabilize on a year-to-year basis relatively flat profitability with STG. And we are able to do that, the vehicle for that
being new product announcements across our STG businesses as well as returning growth markets to mid-single digit
growth on a constant currency basis.
Once we get through this process surrounding China's development of a broad-based economic reform plan, those two
capabilities are the primary elements to stop the erosion in profitability in that part of our business and then have the
operational profile for software and services show through the bottom line. Additionally, this impact that we've
wrestled with on currency, again, Ben, on a year-to-date basis, a $500 million headwind that's kind of a theoretical
limit, that should reverse and actually be a tailwind in the second quarter of next year.
And then lastly, if you look at the complement to help offset the year-to-year headwind from the discrete tax benefits
that we have in 2013, really the flow through, the flow through of the workforce rebalancing yield that we've already
completed should be more than enough to neutralize that, and allow us to take really the financial flexibility, the
strength of the balance sheet to complement that operational performance and maintain that trajectory in 2014 on our
way to at least $20 in 2015.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Ben. Let's go to the next question, please.

The next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. You may ask your question.
<Q - Keith F. Bachman>: Hi. Thank you. My question is also how do you get there in terms of 2015? And, Mark, was
hoping you could specifically address how you're thinking about revenue growth which has been not only from a
currency perspective, from an absolute dollar perspective how you're thinking about next year. And if we focus on
services for the second, how does the pipeline and the backlog you mentioned is up 6%? If you're thinking about
services for FY 2014, if you provide any dimensions about how you're thinking about the growth profile there, is it 1%,
2% or is it small single digits? And the second part of that question is can hardware really be a flat revenue number as
you think about CY 2014? Because it seems like there'll still be extraordinary pressure on the market overall and even
with normal products, just curious if you think that can be a flat number with all the currency assumptions that you've
already outlined?
<A - Mark Loughridge>: Yeah, first of all on the hardware base, my point was to drive the STG hardware business to
flat profitability, I agree with you, I don't think that's going to be necessarily flat revenue but flat profitability based on
all the work that we've done. Now I will say in that skew, in 2014 for our hardware business, that would probably be
driving in the first half down a couple of hundred million and the second half up a couple of hundred million. But
relatively flat profitability, not revenue, on the STG side of the business. Now, again, I point out that's a relatively low
bar, given the level of profitability that the hardware business will generate in 2013.

On the services side, I mean I do think it's worth clearly recognizing the real contribution that the GBS team has driven
by constantly improving that backlog performance and then yielding that backlog performance right to the revenue line.
And let's go back on that four quarter march that they've been on. They've been kind of methodically driving a couple
of points improvement every quarter. That's why we feel it's a very confident basis for us to look at 7% revenue growth
for GBS in the fourth quarter. And if we have 7% revenue growth for that platform with ongoing improvement in the
backlog, given the momentum they've been able to drive with the faster take-up of backlog to revenue for GBS, that
should really assist us as we go into 2014.
But I think within that, the linchpin assumptions that we need to drive for 2014. And 2014 being the platform for
moving into 2015 is stabilize that STG business at the low level profitability we see this year, return GMU back to
mid-single-digit growth as we get through the process surrounding China's development of their broad-based economic
reform plan, allowing the improving momentum we see on the Services business as well as a return to their more
consistent profile in software business to help drive that operational performance.

The next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. You may ask your question.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Yes. Thanks a lot. When I think about the implied December quarter expectations you have
and given the commentary you made about the growth market headwinds, I'm actually curious, do you need the
execution issues to get resolved and see normal seasonality to achieve the implied December quarter expectations or
could you get there if one of those two events do not happen? And then specifically just on the Software side, I think it
was up 1%, I would've thought it would be up more like 4% or 5%. Was there any China-centric headwinds on the
Software side as well for you this quarter?
<A - Mark Loughridge>: Well, the way I would frame the software performance is not around China. The China issue
was predominantly an impact to our Hardware business. The software issue, I think, is this ongoing challenge that we
typically have in third quarters going into a stronger fourth quarter. So that's the way I would look at this.
Now if you look at the magnitude of improvement that we're looking at for our growth markets content, going to the
fourth quarter and then into next year, that profile going into 2014, remember about half of it we said we thought was
macro driven that should resolve itself, we believe, as China establishes this broad-based economic reform plan in
March of 2014. And the second half of that really driven by the leadership, and we do need to see that trajectory
improve as we go into the fourth quarter to get back to mid-single-digit performance in 2014 consistent with the
industry.

The next question comes from Rob Cihra with Evercore. You may ask your question.
<Q - Rob G. Cihra>: Hi. Thanks very much. If I could ask kind of a more strategic question particularly in Services, if
you look at your – you disclose in the software acquisition this quarter and beyond adding whatever – a point of
revenue or whatever to GTS, what does that mean for your go-to-market strategy? Does it change the look of GTS and
particularly given that it's coming at the same time, you also announced the planned divestiture anyway of the customer
care BPO business for a relatively low multiple. I mean, when you combine those two things, are you sort of driving a
more aggressive change to the look of GTS? Or is it just the fact that one's high-growth, high-multiple, one's
low-growth, low-multiple? Thanks.

<A - Mark Loughridge>: Well, let's separate those two. I mean the divestiture was really a divestiture that was
complementary to IBM and to the partner that we're working with. For us, it was an area that we thought we could get
better capability of the partner and the partner's capability and then we would apply our energies to broader intellectual
property capability. If you look at the cloud content and the SoftLayer content that we see within cloud, we crossed
kind of a milestone for us this quarter with over $1 billion of cloud revenue. The content within that, about $610
million of it was the hardware and software and implementation services for us to establish cloud-based operations
within our customer set. And then $460 million of that was cloud delivered services and solutions including software.
Now if you look underneath the dynamics in that, in that cloud delivered services and solutions content, most of those
customer engagements for us turned out to be incremental. And you remember when we started the roadmap content to
drive cloud to be about $7 billion by 2015. We said that we thought only about $3 billion of that would be incremental
due to the cannibalization of base. And so we're always using that as kind of a checkpoint. Actually we didn't see that
in our own profile. Most of that content was indeed new and incremental. So it does provide a very strong platform for
us within GTS and a platform for moving to the market for other business units. I will tell you that since we have made
that acquisition, I have heard nothing but very positive statements from our business units on the capabilities and the
added dimensions that it applies to IBM and to GTS.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Rob. Can we go to the next question, please?

The next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.
<Q - Katy Huberty>: Thanks, Mark. To your comments about growth and execution improving in the fourth quarter,
consider the risk of delayed U.S. Federal spending? And any impact that may have on enterprise sales cycles in the
U.S.?
<A - Mark Loughridge>: Sure. Let me talk about that explicitly. So if you look at our U.S. Federal business, Katy, our
U.S. Federal businesses little less than 3% of our total revenue mix. So as you look at the risk within that 3%, it turns
out that really the bulk of our Federal business is either not exposed, or even if it is in a category that is expose it has
been deemed essential. So as we look at it, it is kind of a time dimension. So if we close on that issue in October, there
really shouldn't be much of an impact for IBM. If it extends through to November, then it will be an issue but
something that we ought to be able to deal with and manage through. If this extends into December, then it's going to
get to be a meaningful number, say around $0.05 that we would probably not be able to contain. But it is kind of a
time-based exposure that we're tracking quite carefully. The advantage that we do have to keep that total down is how
much of our business is in fact deemed essential.
<A - Patricia Murphy>: Thanks, Katy. Operator, can we take one more question, please?

The last question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup. You may ask your question.
<Q - Jim Suva>: Thank you very much, Mark and Patricia, for your details. A quick clarification, you mentioned tax
rate of 23%. Is that what you mean going forward for every quarter? Or kind of over the full year, which means the Q4
would then have to go up to something like 30%? But the bigger question is following up on the last question about the
federal government, did that also impact your signings and bookings in new business coming in also? I would imagine
there's kind of a big pause there of new business being handed out?
<A - Mark Loughridge>: Yes. Let's take the bookings issue first. If you look at the business unit that would be most
impacted by that exposure, it would be our GBS business, but I have nothing but very positive observations of their
performance both on driving performance on a global basis, generating profitability from that growth and increasing
their backlog. So though that would be the area most exposed, you sure wouldn't see it in the results.

As far as the tax rate, what I'm referencing is the average tax rate that we would assume before discrete items. And that
tax rate would be the tax rate for the year and for the quarter going forward for 2013 as well as 2014. But again, that's
the tax rate before discrete items.
Mark Loughridge
So let me now just take the opportunity to wrap up. I want to thank you for the questions and the time on the call.
Obviously, this was a tough quarter for us especially in STG and the growth markets. But we are on track to deliver at
least $16.25 for the year on all-in basis, and we believe with the actions we're taking we'll have stronger operational
performance as we go into 2014. In STG, we're going to wrestle with the mainframe ramp in the first half of next year
but should return to profit growth in the second half and stabilized hardware profit on a year-to-year basis through the
year. That's the game plan.
And in growth markets, we'll improve the trajectory get back to mid-single-digit performance for the 2014 full-year,
especially after we get through the broad-based economic reform plan that's developing in China, consistent, I think, on
that trajectory basis for growth markets, consistent with the overall industry. We'll continue to use the overall flexibility
of our financial model, including productivity and share repurchase, and I think we're going to see that ongoing
operational performance in our Software and Services business show through, then, to drive the bottom line. So this
keeps us on track to our 2015 objective of at least $20 of operating EPS. I want to thank you again for joining us, and
now, as always, it's back to work.
