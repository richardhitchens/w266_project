MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone – ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Honeywell's First Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference
Call. At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions
following the presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Elena Doom, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Elena Doom
Thank you, Leo, and good morning. Here with me today are Chairman and CEO, Dave Cote; and Senior Vice President
and CFO, Dave Anderson.
Today's call and webcast including any non-GAAP reconciliations are available on our website,
honeywell.com/investor. Note that elements of today's presentation do contain forward-looking statements that are
based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change and we
would ask that you interpret them in that light. We do identify the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our
performance in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings.
This morning, we will review our financial results for the first quarter, share with you our outlook for the second
quarter and the remainder of the year; and finally, we'll leave time for your questions.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Cote.

Thanks, Elena. Good morning, everyone. A very good start to 2013. EPS in the quarter was $1.16 and that's
normalizing for tax. That came in $0.01 above the high end of our guidance range and up 12% driven by the strong
margin performance across the businesses. And we accomplished this in a slow growth macro environment that was
really coupled with some particularly challenging prior-year comps and I think is a nice reinforcement of our
conservative sales planning process and the results you can get from that. Sales of $9.3 billion were in line with
guidance and like we talked about during Investor Day, it demonstrates the importance of a balanced portfolio.
Now, I say that because while we saw headwinds from lower defense spending, lower European auto production and
generally challenging comps, we also saw modest signs of improvement in several of our key short-cycle ACS
businesses, and of course, another terrific quarter from UOP not just in sales but in what the future is for sales.
Similar to prior quarters, EPS growth was driven by strong margin expansion. We were up 100 basis points to 16.2%,
and this was driven by cost management of our productivity; that focus on material cost and remaining conservative in
our census planning. This discipline, along with our considerable amount of seed planting, helps us to deliver these
results while maintaining our investments in the future. Now, as a result of that success, we are raising our full year pro
forma EPS guidance by $0.05 on the low-end making our new range, $4.80 to $4.95, up 7% to 11% versus prior year.
This reflects our strong first quarter performance as well as our confidence in our ability to drive continued margin
expansion. However, also as we've been saying since October, we want to ensure we're remaining balanced in our
planning. And as a result, we're maintaining a range that incorporates possible risks and opportunities.
We're achieving these results while continuing our investments in the future or that seed planting that you always hear
us talking about. In the quarter, we proactively funded over $30 million of new restructuring projects, building on a
healthy pipeline of projects as we've talked about in the past. This is more than we originally expected, which again
speaks to the strength of our first quarter results.
We also continue to invest in stuff that's really just terrific when it comes to new products and technologies and that are
winning with our customers. As an example, Honeywell's SmartPath was selected by the Airport Authority of India, or
AAI, to be part of a pilot project for satellite-based precision approach and landings at the Chennai International
Airport. As you know, airport congestion remains a major issue globally and SmartPath will support this increasing
demand by reducing delays, lowering operations costs for airlines and increasing traffic throughput. Think of it as like
the Honeywell Operating System for an airport. It's the same concept.
We also saw a number of new wins from UOP, building on their already record backlog levels and setting them up for
a multi-year cycle of continued outperformance. For example, UOP announced its twelfth Oleflex project win since the
beginning of 2011, driven by the renaissance in petrochemical investments spurred by low natural gas prices. Now, if
we take a step back for a moment, we see ourselves in what continues to be a slow growth macro environment. We do
see some reasons to be optimistic on the horizon, but we also see plenty of reasons to continue to remain cautious.
For example, U.S. and European sales were as expected in the quarter. However, China saw a weak start to the year
reflecting a government austerity and a concerted attempt to contain growth. That being said, the majority of our
businesses there are quite healthy. Inventory levels are returning to normal and order rates are improving, particularly
in our long-cycle businesses signaling a modest recovery over the remainder of the year.
As we've said before, taking a conservative approach to top-line planning helps ensure we deliver the results you've
come to expect and you can expect we'll be ready to capitalize on the opportunity if and when things do pick up. In the
meantime, we'll keep following the playbook you've come to expect from us. Seed planting for future growth including
investing in our businesses, launching a bunch of new products, global expansion and driving productivity through our
key enablers so we can deliver this year, next year and beyond that.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Dave.

Thank you and good morning, everyone. Thanks for your participation. Let's go to slide 4 entitled 1Q 2013 results. I'll
just take you through the summary highlights. Again, sales of $9.3 billion were approximately flat year-over-year on a
reported basis and in line with our prior guidance, down about 1% on an organic basis, so adjusting for acquisitions and
adjusting for currency. And as expected, challenging comps in Aerospace and also in Transportation Systems were
headwinds in the quarter although we expect these comps to get easier in the second half of the year. We'll talk about
that a little bit more.
Segment profit for the quarter was up 7%. Segment margins expanded, as Dave said, 100 basis points to 16.2%
representing really exceptional sales conversion in the quarter. We saw margin expansion in three of the four SPGs and
we're going to take you through that in just a moment but PMT, you'll note, in particular benefited from a strong UOP
quarter as we expected. Below the line, largely – those numbers largely as anticipated and consistent with our prior
guidance and you'll recall that pension favorability we had this year which was essentially redeployed in the quarter to
fund smart repositioning projects which will help continue to drive productivity in a slow growth environment.
The first quarter effective tax rate at 23.1%, planned – against the planned 26.5% for the full year. The lower tax rate
was driven by the passage of the U.S. tax extenders earlier this year and that came just late enough to not be a 2012
benefit and early enough to be a first quarter 2013 benefit. So that's going to correct and will be offset later in the year
and we're still planning the 26.5% for the full year.
So EPS of $1.21 reported was up 16%, however, normalizing to 26.5% ETR. EPS would have been $1 – been – would
have been a $ 1.16, up 12% and above the high-end of the guidance driven by stronger segment margin expansion in
the quarter. And finally, free cash flow for the quarter $327 million was up 9% versus prior year and right on track to
our full year guidance.
Let's go through each of the businesses in turn and start with slide number 5 with Aerospace. Sales for aero down 1% in
the first quarter, again, as expected. U.S. defense and space program ramp downs as well as tough prior year comps in
the commercial business both contributed to a challenging top-line sales quarter for Aerospace. Commercial OE sales
were up 1% driven by 9% growth in air transport and regional as a result of continued strong OE build rates, BGA OE
on the other hand was down primarily driven by backlog burn down in the first quarter of 2012.
Commercial aftermarket sales were down 3% versus prior year, a little color on that to help you understand what we're
seeing today, it makes a lot of sense to look back at where we were this time last year. You'll recall in the first quarter
of 2012, Honeywell commercial aftermarket sales were actually up 16%, which at the time was our eighth straight
quarter also of double-digit spares increases. Of course, we benefited from strong win rates in airline selectables, new
aircraft spares provisioning, favorable platform mix as well as higher than normal engine maintenance events and also
some discretionary RMU sales. Key point is obviously lapping a very strong period last year.
Fast-forward to today and as we foreshadowed a year ago, the aftermarket growth has continued to moderate. As is
expected this quarter, we experienced a decline in spares volumes mostly as a result of the strong performance we had
last year but also as a result of the airline buyer behavior. However, the flight hours continued to be positive and we
feel confident we'll see aftermarket growth the remainder of this year.
Defense and space sales were down 1%. U.S. sales were unfavorably impacted by the anticipated program ramp downs
and these were partially offset by good growth in the international market.
Looking at segment profit for Aerospace, you can see margins up 80 basis points to a robust 18.9% in the quarter,
largely driven by commercial excellence and also continued productivity net of inflation including the absence of the
prior year unfavorable impact you recall of the Hawker bankruptcy, partially offset by lower commercial aftermarket
volume. So with those highlights for Aerospace, let's go to slide 6, Automation and Control Solutions.
So ACS sales were roughly flat for the quarter on both a reported and organic basis. Regionally, Europe was a little
better than we expected back in January while the U.S. and Asia were a little bit worse. Let's just take a little bit closer
look at the ACS businesses.

For ESS, Energy, Safety, and Security, sales were up 2% driven by good growth in ECC as a result of a more normal
winter heating season and also continued strong residential market conditions and new product introductions in security
products. Process Solutions sales were down 2% driven by challenging comps, is really as a result of several large
projects which have been steadily ramping down over the course of the prior year and into the first quarter of this year.
Now, the good news here for Process Solutions is the project pipeline remains very strong, the backlog is converting at
a higher margin and this is partially as a result of being more selective in what we bid as well as the organizational
improvements we've made in the last year. In fact, HPS margins were up strongly in the quarter, so a positive margin
story for HPS and the contribution to ACS as a whole.
For BSD, Building Solutions and Distribution, sales were down 2% driven by several large project completions in
2012, coupled with a remaining weak U.S. energy retrofit market partially offset by continued growth in our Americas
distribution business. Now, segment margin for ACS expanded 80 basis points to 13.8% in the quarter. The
performance was driven again by commercial excellence, by operational improvements and also by continued cost
management, and of course, the benefit of previously completed restructuring actions, which of course are continuing
to flow through and pay dividends.
Let's go now to slide 7 PMT and just the highlights for Performance Materials and Technologies. Now, UOP sales were
up 34% reported, 10% organic in the quarter, primarily driven by increased petrochemical catalyst shipments and also
equipment sales growth. UOP also continued to build backlog now approximately $2.9 billion reflecting an organic
increase on both the year-over-year as well as on a sequential basis. On the other hand, Advanced Materials was pretty
soft in the quarter. Largely as expected, sales were down 9% versus prior year, driven by lower volumes in Advanced
Materials as a result of planned plant outages in both resins and chemicals as well as in fluorine products and those
outages had roughly a 6% negative impact on sales in the quarter. We would not expect these to have a significant
impact on sales importantly for the remainder of the year.
Additionally, while we continue to see price/raws pressure in resins and chemicals, the end markets there remain
relatively stable and we exited the quarter with a robust order book supporting continued future growth outlook. The
segment margin for PMT was 21.8% representing an increase of 200 basis points versus last year. Again, the strength
of UOP sales, in addition to favorable price net of inflation partially offset by lower volume in Advanced Materials as a
result of the plant outages that I referenced and also the continued investments that we make for growth in PMT.
Let's go now to slide 8, Transportation Systems. TS, the sales decline was 4% in the quarter year-over-year, an
improvement over the fourth quarter performance. We continue to see European light vehicle production decline of
approximately 10% as auto sales remain depressed across most of Europe including now France, Germany and Spain.
TS, however, has had the benefit of new launches partially offsetting these declines and with higher turbo gas
penetration in both North America as well as in China. And while we expect the difficult environment in Europe to
persist, the comps, of course, are going to get easier in the second half of the year.
Segment margins for TS were down 50 basis points, driven by the lower sales and also the investments we're making to
improve friction materials partially offset by productivity actions. Overall, TS continues to execute well in the difficult
macro environment it's in, illustrated by maintaining margins at a solid level despite Western EU light vehicle sales at
17-year lows, driven really this productivity by continued efficiency improvements and also flexibility.
Let's now, with that review of the businesses for the first quarter, go to slide 9 and give you the brief highlights for our
outlook for the second quarter. Again, for the second quarter, we're expecting modest sales growth roughly flat to up
2% in the $9.5 billion to $9.7 billion range. EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.18 to $1.23, up 4% to 9% when
normalizing for the tax rate in both years.
Let's take a look then at it each of the businesses, just the highlights of the revenues – revenue outlook for each of the
businesses in the second quarter. Aerospace, we're expecting sales to be roughly flat with modest growth in
commercial, partially offset by mid single-digit decline in defense and space. Then, we continue to monitor aftermarket
activity in relation to global flying hours and airline inventory levels and we'll see spares comps improve as we move
through the remainder of the year.

For ACS in the second quarter, we think that's going to play out much like the first with sales flat to up 2% driven by a
modest organic improvement in ESS and the timing of Intermec, which is expected to close by the end of June. This is
partially offset by continued slowness in both HPS and BSD. We anticipate continued strong conversion in ACS with
margins up year-over-year despite the potentially dilutive impact of Intermec in the quarter. And as a reminder, ACS
margins for the year are estimated to be approximately 14.5% including 40 basis points of the Intermec-related dilution
reflecting the acceleration we've seen in margin expansion here the last couple of years.
PMT for the second quarter, we're expecting sales to be up 12% to 15%, which would equate to mid single-digit growth
organically. UOP is expected to have another strong sales quarter, driven by the Thomas Russell acquisition and also
higher equipment sales. Again, as a reminder, UOP saw very strong licensing revenues in the second quarter of 2012,
which are not expected to repeat at those levels this year, and as a result, we expect PMT margins in the second quarter
to be lower both sequentially as well as year-over-year.
Finally, in Transportation Systems, we're expecting sales to be flat to down slightly. EU light vehicle production is
expected to be down approximately mid single-digit with turbo volumes approximately flat sequentially. There's a
possibility we could see low single-digit volume growth, which would be terrific with – and this is reflected at the
high-end of the range – the revenue range for TS for the second quarter. So as you can see, very good performance
despite a slow growth macro environment supported, as Dave said, by a strong focus on driving productivity, and of
course, the balanced portfolio which gives us confidence in this outlook.
And now before going to the full year, I just want to take a few minutes to just say a few words and give you an update
on NARCO. So on slide number 10, as we discussed in our December outlook call and this is really the highlights of
what we discussed but just to really make sure that we're reminding you of this the long awaited NARCO trust
formation is happening. And specifically, the NARCO bankruptcy plan is expected to be effective around April 30.
And thus, we think it's likely the trust will be established in the second quarter, which means we'll start seeing some
trust formation cash outflows this quarter.
A couple things we'd like to take a moment to point out. First, we continue to estimate the 2013 cash outflows to be in
the range of $200 million to $300 million pre-tax or $120 million to $170 million which is shown on the slide after-tax.
The outflows in 2014 are also expected to be roughly in that range, $175 million to $225 million net of tax and net of
insurance recoveries. And as you can see, 2013 as well as 2014 on the left-hand side of the chart, slide 10, reflect the
high watermark for cash outflows as a significant portion of the early outflows are carryover of pre-existing claims yet
to be paid.
Now, beyond 2013 and 2014, we expect the cash outflows to reduce and stabilize subject to the annual payment cap on
new claims of $140 million pre-tax, or approximately $60 million again net of taxes and insurance receipts. Now, at
this point, we feel we're adequately reserved with over $1 billion remaining for NARCO specifically. So no P&L
impact envisioned for some time. It's going to take several years of experience operating the trust to discern certain
trends in claims activity and then reevaluate reserve levels.
So key takeaway number one is no change to the cash or earnings guidance for 2013 for this year. Key takeaway
number two is this level of funding is very manageable. It will not impact our ability to assertively and positively
redeploy cash to build value in other areas. We've been smart in how we've negotiated the trust terms specifically with
Honeywell's level of engagement in trust operating procedures and audit rights over the claims, payment processes, in
addition to the ongoing cap on new claims. And you saw that in terms of that post-2014 presentation, all of which serve
to differentiate the NARCO trust from any other. And of course, we'll continue to update you on this as events unfold.
So let's now turn to slide 11 and take a minute on the full 2013 guidance summary. As you can see, some small puts
and takes based on what we've discussed today but very much in line with your expectations. Sales expected to be up
3% to 4%, 1% to 2% on an organic basis. We're still assuming a euro rate of 1.25 at the midpoint which we believe
remains a prudent assumption in light of the volatility we've all been experiencing.
Now, the revenue forecast for the full year is down slightly from our previous expectations. Really has to do from –
with the assumption regarding the timing of the Intermec close. Previously, we were assuming June 1. Now, we're

assuming June 30. We've incorporated the full impact, obviously, of sequestration and then obviously just the
continued outlook for slower growth in the macro economy.
We've increased segment margins importantly for the full year, 10 basis points on both the low and the high-end. These
increases reflect our strong first quarter performance and our continued confidence in driving margin expansion
through our enablers and our ongoing proactive funding of repositioning. The full year tax rate is still expected to be
26.5%, which is consistent with prior year. So as we mentioned earlier, we would expect the first quarter tax
favorability to be offset in the second half of the year.
So taking into account these items, we're raising our full year EPS guidance at the low-end by a $0.05, resulting in a
new range of $4.80 to $4.95, up 7% to 11% versus 2012. And as you can see, we're still expecting around $3.7 billion
of free cash flow, so no change there. And as Dave said earlier, we believe a very balanced outlook for the year, but
taking into account the good start that we saw in the first quarter.
So with that, let's go to slide 12, just a brief wrap-up before we turn it over to Elena and to you for Q&A. The first
quarter obviously reflected another strong quarter for Honeywell and like most top performing companies, we continue
to set high expectations and we continue to deliver. We remain confident in our 2013 outlook. We continue to plan for
growth in a low growth environment with mixed orders trends by business and region, which is to say we're not
counting on a big second half recovery to deliver strong results.
We're focused on executing our prudent playbook, driving sustainable operating leverage, progress on key productivity
initiatives, in addition, continuing to fund smart new restructuring projects that will yield incremental savings in 2013
and 2014. And finally, we planted a lot of seeds for the future. With a strong portfolio aligned to favorable macro
trends, these are all intact: industrial reinvestment, infrastructure expansion and renewal, continued urbanization
combined with a growing middle – global middle class.
These trends are going to continue to build and we're going to continue to leverage those. We've got the right people.
We're developing the right products for the right markets at the right value to capitalize on these trends. So we look
forward to global growth returning to more normal levels, but we're not beholden to it. We're going to keep doing what
we always do, executing on our business strategies, continuing to evolve as a company, and as Dave said, seed planting
for a strong future.
So that – with that, Elena, let's go to you and to the group for Q&A.
Q&A

Very good. The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is coming from
Scott Davis of Barclays.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi. Good morning, guys. Hi, Elena.
<A - Elena Doom>: Good morning.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Good numbers, obviously, and thanks for not disappointing like some of the other large-cap
names have here, it makes our lives a little easier. But...
<A - David M. Cote>: Scott, I just wanted to note that we broke your paradigm about lackluster results today.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Well, you did but I still got another 24 that aren't so great either. So...
<A - David M. Cote>: As you might imagine, I read that last night and said, oh, I can't wait to bring that one up
tomorrow.

<A - David M. Cote>: I do read your stuff.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Oh, that's good. Somebody does. So look, the only thing I'm going to pick on then is just this
kind of flattish free cash flow year-over-year and obviously you're going to spend some capital. But it begs the question
of given just how weak the macro – the overall macro is coming in in the quarter and your outlook, which I don't think
indicates much of a recovery from here. I mean what – why do you think you need to make substantial capital
investments from here?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, if we take a look at where the increase is coming from on the CapEx side, it's really for
orders that we already have in PMT. And this is growth that's going to happen. We've got the new molecules. We've
landed the new orders in UOP and we got to be able to ship the stuff, and it's as simple as that and that's where the
increase is primarily coming from. It – this is a good thing, not a bad thing.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Sure. But isn't there a potential to have a decrease in some of the other areas just given that you
probably don't need to spend much capital at all for flattish type growth?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, I'd say it's flattish for this year. That's the way we're going to think about it, but when
we're making these kind of investments, we need to be looking further out than that, and I'd say, we're pretty rigorous
about how do we think about CapEx and where do we put the money and any of the spending we're doing, I'd say is
more than judicious when it comes to the returns that we're going to get from it. As I said, the big increase is really
coming out of PMT...
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Sure.
<A - David M. Cote>: ...where we already have the orders in hand and we have to be able to support it.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Yeah, no. And I totally understand that part of it. Okay. Then just as a follow-up, the – when
you think about the amount of cash you have in Europe and other areas around the world, is there any flexibility in how
you fund the NARCO trust? I also assume that some of this CapEx you're spending is going to be overseas money as
well, although PMT is a fair amount of that is U.S. but anything that kind of gives you some flexibility on utilizing
overseas cash instead of having to use your U.S. base?
<A - David John Anderson>: Yeah, Scott, this is Dave. We'll just continue to be smart in terms of our tax and treasury
planning, in terms of managing our cash balances. Again, the guidance that we gave you at the beginning of the year,
all of our communications in terms of both cash and coverage ratios and everything else assume this outflow. So we'll
just continue to be smart on that, continue to be very smart in terms of, as I said, our tax and treasury planning.
<A - David M. Cote>: It's also [indiscernible] (30:48)
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Yeah, it doesn't totally answer. I guess my question is, can you use some of that European cash

<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Peter.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Hey. A question on the aerospace aftermarket, just in general. I know you're not planning for
a stronger second half kind of pickup in the global economy but you are expecting an improvement on the commercial
aftermarket. Is it – as we transition, is it just easier comps or what kind of gives you the confidence when you're talking
about what you're seeing for airline inventory levels?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, first of all, I should say, we're not counting on much, Peter. We've tried to do that as a
company and we've lowered our sales sights even further in just about every business saying we got to make sure that
we plan conservatively. So we're really not counting on much.
<A - David John Anderson>: Yeah, I'll just maybe piggyback on Dave's comment, Peter, just to add a little to it.
We're looking at now up, low to mid-single mid – digits in the commercial aftermarket for 2013. We think that's kind
of a reasonable range given the first quarter performance and also just looking at the pattern of global flying hours and
our pattern of sales for last year. So the comps, as we said earlier and as you know, become much easier...
<A - David M. Cote>: Correct.
<A - David John Anderson>: ...in the second half. So I think that is a good way to think and to plan going forward.
You know some of the specifics on that, we're going to continue to see very good R&O on both BGA as well as on the
ATR side of it.
<A - Elena Doom>: And that's really two thirds of ...
<A - David John Anderson>: Yeah, that's really...
<A - Elena Doom>: ... to make within aftermarket.
<A - David John Anderson>: That's a very good point, Elena. That's two-thirds of the makeup of the revenues of the
Aerospace aftermarket. So we're continuing to see that being relatively good and also our anticipation for the spares
side of BGA is pretty good.
<A - Elena Doom>: Yeah, RMUs are continuing to be very strong.
<A - David John Anderson>: And RMUs are continuing to be very strong. So I think there's a lot of reasons why we
think this low to mid-single digits but that is tempered from where we started the year.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: All right. Okay. That's helpful. And just maybe – just speaking in general about the regions, is
it similar to – regionally around the globe? I mean it sounds like just in general from the – from your report that Europe
feels a little less bad and Asia is a little softer, is there – is that consistent also like what you're seeing?
<A - David John Anderson>: Yes. Yes.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Okay. I'll jump back in queue. Thanks for the good numbers Thanks.

<A - David M. Cote>: [indiscernible] (33:50). We can't get enough.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: So just on the short-cycle trends. I mean it's a little bit all over the map here. I mean Danaher
talked about U.S. being a little bit weaker, GE was down 17% in Europe and it fell off a cliff in March, I mean maybe
if you could just talk about your kind of view, your highest-frequency economic indicators, the businesses you watch
for that and maybe if you can just talk about those trends, anything interesting that happened in March and kind of into
early April here?
<A - David M. Cote>: Sure. I would say when it came to March, things actually started to look a little tougher than
they had before. And interestingly, in the first couple of weeks of April, things look a little bit better than they did
before, but there's nothing here and there's a business we do watch called basic switches that we pay attention to when
it comes to kind of something that portends to the future. But at the end of the day, I wouldn't say there's anything that's
caused any of us to say, okay, the trend has begun in one direction or the other. There's just kind of this order
equivocation, if you will, where you've just kind of say, okay, I still don't know enough one direction or the other to
make a permanent, or let's say, more long lasting call. That's why we're going to stay conservative. I'd like to think that
this is the trend, but after a couple of weeks of things being slightly better I'm certainly not ready to declare.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Can you just remind us also on these moves in commodity prices with oil kind of going down
and natural gas coming back up. How that impacts PMT and how you see that? Is there any impact to the net out, I
mean also I guess Advanced Materials as well, the price cost dynamic there, any risks?
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah, I don't see any risks from the – first of all, gas pricing going up is a good phenomenon for
PMT because now you have more people willing to look for the stuff and then pump it because that's a – when it's only
$2.50, $3.00 MMBtu, there's fields that just don't make sense and when you get up to $4.50, well, there is a lot of stuff
that makes more sense than it did before and we will encourage that dynamics. I like it. If we take a look at oil, I mean
whether it's $80 or $100 that it's worth looking for. So I don't see either of those trends being any or kind of movement
around those kinds of numbers to be a problem for us.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Right. So the pipeline, the quotation and opportunity pipeline of UOP is still robust no matter
what's going on here?
<A - David M. Cote>: No, it looks very good and I'd say all the seed planting that we did there since we acquired it
and all that additional Horizon 3 spending and becoming more global in our outreach is all stuff that just continues to
play out very well for us.
<A - David John Anderson>: As well as the strength of their position in the petrochemical industry...
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah.
<A - David John Anderson>: ... which is really reflected, Dave, and how they really outperformed peers in the first
quarter.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Sorry. Sorry. One last quick one, I mean a lot of these chemical companies have been getting hit
recently and I guess what is the risk that some of these projects get pushed even further? Are you seeing any of that?
<A - David M. Cote>: I can't say we're feeling anything like that and the stuff that we're looking at doing is – and
where we're investing really has nothing to do with kind of commodities trends or anything like that. It's more – the
world needs energy. The world is going to continue to need energy. The world needs the new HFOs that we're – that
we've invented. That's where the investments are going and that's where the backlog is built and I just – I have a tough
time seeing that really changing. It's always possible, but with any kind of minimal global economic growth, those
trends continue.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Great. Thanks for the detail. Appreciate it.

We'll move next to the site of Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Thank you. Good morning, folks.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Hey. Just a few things. Can you just elaborate a little bit more on what you're seeing in Europe
overall? I mean your comments there sound a little bit better, actually a lot better than most people that we're hearing
and, I mean can you put your finger on some particular share gain or something going on with end market – your
particular end-markets?
<A - David M. Cote>: I'd say that if we take a look at the overall macros, we are not saying things are better there and
based on how things are going, we would still forecast and plan for 0% GDP growth over the next three years. It's just
the way we're going to continue to think about it and plan for it, because there's nothing to indicate that they're ever
going to have just a bang-up quarter or year. So we're going to keep thinking about it that way. Part of what I think
we're seeing is last year, we took – orders trends were really pretty negative in Europe. We were down pretty much
double-digit, all year along. It was just one of those things that we had to manage. We've got our cost structure in line
which helped. But then on the orders side, there's a bit of a rebound that you get from, there's nothing else just being
down so much and managing your way through that. So I'm not ready to declare a victory on anything and I would say
in terms of products, ACS did much better...
<A - David John Anderson>: Yeah.
<A - David M. Cote>: ... in Europe overall. But again, I think some of that's driven by just being down so much last
year and you get some of the – I wouldn't call it a dead cat bounce, I think it's better than that. But at the end of the day,
it's not an indicator that Europe is turning around in my view.
<A - David John Anderson>: Yeah, I think, Jeff, just to add quickly to what Dave said is it's really – it continues to be
an inconsistent orders pattern. Overall, the sort of slight negative organically that we have in terms of growth in the first
quarter in Europe is really again a tribute just to the balance of the portfolio so long...
<A - Elena Doom>: Both long and short cycle.
<A - David John Anderson>: ...long and short cycle, we see that balance working and so it's not as we sort of, the
theme if anything, we're really striking here again today is we're not counting on...
<A - David M. Cote>: Correct.
<A - David John Anderson>: ...any kind of improvement and in fact, what we're really counting on is just a continued
opportunity to improve our cost structure...
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah.
<A - David John Anderson>: ...our productivity, thus some of the repositioning that we funded here in the first
quarter.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Yeah, actually on that point, I mean the restructuring size isn't huge, but very attractive
payback kind of surprises me a little bit given how far along ostensibly you guys are on restructuring. How are you
finding such big payback projects? And is there more of that that may happen over the course of 2013?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well I'd go back to these process initiatives that we always talk about, Velocity Product
Development, the Honeywell Operating System, Functional Transformation. The evolution of that is going to continue
for a long time to come. And as long as we continue to progress on that path, I'd like to think there are always going to
be high return projects that are going to come available to us, and I don't see that opportunity declining in the future.
There's going to be good payback projects for us for a long time to come.

<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Right. And then just maybe one final one and I'll pass it on. The flipside of Scott's concern
about the weak economy and spend in CapEx, I mean maybe there are some vulnerable deal targets out there; people
getting a little bit jumpier about their station in life. Are you seeing any pickup in your M&A pipeline just the funnel
itself, or the likelihood that things maybe happen more actively over the course of the next 6 to 12 months?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, it's always tough to predict, Jeff. So we – as we said before, we always maintain just a
very big active pipeline, we conduct reviews with the businesses about every six weeks where we go through what are
the possibilities and how are things looking and what could be new or different. I can't say that we've noticed any big
change in any of that, but again, we're not looking for any big changes. We try to really make this a very methodical
un-cyclical process.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Okay. All right. Thank you very much.
<A - David M. Cote>: Thanks, Jeff.

We'll move next to the site of Steve Winoker of Sanford C. Bernstein.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Hey, thanks and good morning.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hi.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: I got to tell you, after Steve's reaction to Scott's comment, I just got to say I'm in the camp
of nice quarter. And there should be a few apples on your desk in Morristown.
<A - David M. Cote>: I look forward to it.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Now, just a couple of things. First, can you – the other side of the prior question on input
cost, or on the commodities is what was the sort of specific input cost impact on Advanced Materials this quarter, the
sort of benefit from that? And was it broader also across the portfolio?
<A - Elena Doom>: Steve, if you don't mind. The net price raw spread for Advanced Materials is actually slightly
favorable. However, yeah, where you're really seeing the impact on rise is within resins and chemicals with increased
prices on benzene and propylene specifically. But the remainder of Advanced Materials was a slightly favorable benefit
in the quarter.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay. All right. And you would expect that to continue?
<A - David M. Cote>: Who knows? Who can predict...
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Yeah.
<A - David M. Cote>: ... commodities cost? I would say, overall, to bolster Elena's point that tends to be more of a
kind of a capital question than anything else because the rest of the business doesn't really get affected much by that.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay. All right. But it's in your plan? I mean you're planning for that continuity?
<A - David M. Cote>: We always plan conservatively I can promise you that whether it's sales, cost/price spreads, we
try to be conservative because you just never know.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Right. Okay. And then just a higher level, again, so here we have another quarter with
limited overall volume growth, margins are progressing forward, you're getting at that with the prior question as well.
But as we start, again, thinking about longer-term, and assuming that you do not get – if your top-line continues to be
weak and, in fact, we don't get the pickup and all of that, and you think about how much margin room, how long you
can sustain the cost and efficiency improvements, I mean at least just thinking about the next few quarters. I mean how
are you currently thinking about that?

<A - David M. Cote>: I'm sorry, Steve. How are we thinking about what exactly...
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: How much margin expansion you get in the absence of any volume growth?
<A - David M. Cote>: Oh. Well, as you know, we're believers that margin expansion is a kind of a fundamental based
on how good your processes are in your process improvement. And this is where I'm going to come back again to the
Honeywell Operating System, Velocity Product Development, Functional Transformation and our overall margin rate
versus some of our peers. And when you look at it that way, you say, okay, there's still a lot of upside here. I'd prefer
not to do it this way for the next five years. I mean I'd like to think that there's some economic growth, sales growth in
there at some point but at the end of the day, we still got a lot of room to progress just becoming more efficient every
year
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay. But at least not going negative, right? You can at least maintain it?
<A - David John Anderson>: Well...
<A - David M. Cote>: I don't see it going negative.
<A - David John Anderson>: And, Steve, you can see that in our forward guidance. I mean you can see it in our 2013
numbers what we have and as we communicated at Investor Day for 2014 and again, as Dave said, that's against the
backdrop of the – modest to no revenue growth, depending upon the business. You're going to see some lumpiness
quarter-to-quarter. For example, we had just very, very terrific, as expected, UOP margin contribution in PMT this
quarter. PMT, as I indicated in my comments earlier, is going to benefit from again revenue growth from UOP in the
second quarter, but it's not going to have the same favorable mix that it had in the second quarter of 2012 where we had
very strong licensing revenues and obviously...
<A - David M. Cote>: Intermec.
<A - David John Anderson>: ...and conversion, we also have Intermec. It's going to happen; it's going to dilute the
margins. So there's things that influence it, but the overall general trend will continue to be positive.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Great. And just finally, a little bit more color about how defense and space is currently
thinking about sequestration playing out and the impact on their model versus where they have been over the last sort
of nine months?
<A - David M. Cote>: Say the smart call is to just assume that it continues, and that's the way we're going to keep
thinking about it. This is not a time to be bullish. We're better off staying conservative and if they change the spend
profile in defense, great, if they don't we're fully prepared.
<A - David John Anderson>: And we added additional sequestration impact in our full year revenue forecast. That's
one of the key reasons. As we said, on a full year basis, we were bringing our total revenues down a little bit, partly as
we sort of now reflect in that full sequestration.
<A - Elena Doom>: Right.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Thank you.
<A - David M. Cote>: You're welcome.

<A - David M. Cote>: Well, Howard, I would say, one of the things that we're doing in Process Solutions and that's
important is the guys are doing a very good job of going after the installs that we want. So think of it as the same sort of
thing that we talked about in Aerospace is being selective about the platforms that you decide to go for. Our Process
Solutions guys have been doing the same thing and as a result of that, we're seeing much better margin rates in the
backlog than what we saw before. As we look around the world, I'd say it's pretty well mixed in terms of where you see
the big projects. But in general, it's got more of a focus on high growth regions, if you will, than what you're going to
see in developed markets.
<A - Elena Doom>: Right.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: And then just as a follow-up on new products, could you – you talked about a lot of things
playing out about the way you want. Are there one or two things you'd like to call out where, as you've developed new
products across the portfolio, where things are playing out maybe a little bit better, and they can accelerate as you look
forward?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, I can tell you some of the stuff that I'm pretty pumped up about. We just went to the ISC
West show for security and we unveiled three or four really pretty cool new products for both, on the video side, and
the overall integrated system side, and if any of you were in Times Square yesterday and happened to look up at the
Reuters board, you would've seen in earned media. In other words, we didn't pay a thing for it consistent with our kind
of tightwad spending, but you saw our new thermostat, our new Wi-Fi thermostat put up there by PR Newswire as
being the greatest thing since slice bread. They might not have put it that way, but that was certainly the message. So,
yeah, I'm pretty excited about all that stuff. ACS has some really great new products already out there, and as you
might imagine a lot more good stuff to come.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you very much.

We'll move next to the site of John Inch of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, John.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Hey, guys. Just on the point of sequestration, do we think assuming that nothing changes now
that this down 5% is about the new norm for that business, which obviously can be managed, but is that the run rate or
is there something about the second quarter that makes that a little bit worse?
<A - David John Anderson>: I think it's just really timing in large part, John, of some of the project phase-outs,
wind-downs. We had a little more favorability in D&S and the first quarter will have a little less favorability, a little
more decline in the second quarter, since really just timing there. And then the other thing as we indicated is the – just
the continued progress and performance that business's leadership is making in offsetting U.S. DoD budget declines,
just in terms of pursuing opportunities elsewhere. So that's coming through the numbers as well. But basically I would
say...
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah, particularly international.
<A - David John Anderson>: Exactly. So – but for the full year, I'd say, it's a modest tweak down from roughly 3%
previously guided down for DMS to now more like 4% down.
<Q - John G. Inch>: And does that imply that the U.S. piece of the defense and space is down more but you're making
it up internationally? Is that part of the mix or...?
<A - David M. Cote>: Yes, it is.

<Q - John G. Inch>: Okay. All right. So that makes sense. What about Turbo? This is prospectively the worst
European auto build quarter. What is the – what do you think the runway is for Turbo and particularly on kind of a
growth rate basis, given the easier compares, as you sort of exit the year? Because you've got all these new platform
wins. That business should be ramping up, I would think, pretty nicely heading into the second half, no?
<A - David M. Cote>: I would say there's that opportunity, but I'm certainly not going to predict what the Euro auto
industry build is going to be. We're going to stay conservative even with what we get from kind of the EDI and Global
Insight forecasts and I certainly hope what you're saying is correct and we do believe that there is that strong
possibility. But we're going to be – we're going to continue to be careful.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Well, let me ask it this way. Does new platform wins in Turbo, based on what you've been able to
achieve over the past couple of years, does that materially impact growth rate this year?
<A - David M. Cote>: Sure.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Or is it more of a tailwind into next year?
<A - David M. Cote>: Both. We certainly see the impact this year. We saw it even in this quarter where the Euro auto
industry was down about 10% and ...
<Q - John G. Inch>: Yeah.
<A - David M. Cote>: ...and we were down about 4%, largely because of the impact of new launches. That's why with
any kind of just market stabilization, never mind growth, we end up in a really great place.
<A - Elena Doom>: I would add that the new launches in the second half are also expected to accelerate...
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah, good.
<A - Elena Doom>: ...over the levels that we saw in the first quarter and what we'll see in the second quarter.
<A - David John Anderson>: As we indicated, I think we actually have a shot, knock on wood here, of actually
having a volume increase in Turbo in the second quarter at the high-end of our range and launches together with some
other favorable macros, commercial vehicle...
<A - Elena Doom>: Better comps.
<A - David John Anderson>: ... better comps, all of those should support improved performance, John, over the
course of 2013.
<A - Elena Doom>: And some modest low single-digit growth in the second half.
<A - David John Anderson>: Yeah.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Right. And was this contingent on some sort of a framework of European auto build? I can't
remember if you said that this is based on the European auto build this year doing X?
<A - Elena Doom>: Yeah, we're assuming that light vehicle production is down low to mid single digits for the year in
Europe.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Okay. And then just lastly, Dave Anderson, I thought we, historically, have been talking about
several hundred million of NARCO trust funding. Why is it – how have you been able to possibly accomplish this at
such a lower rate? Is that because you had pre-funded it before and it really still is that number? Or maybe a little more
color on the NARCO and why now? And it seems like you've done a better job of being able to kind of fund this. Just
what's happened here?
<A - David John Anderson>: Well, I think what we're seeing now is we're seeing a calendarization, if you will. The
phasing of the anticipated claims payment for those that have not been processed and executed since the beginning of
the stay that goes back to 2002. So I think number one, we have a better read on what the timing of that could be, John,

that claims processing through the trust.
And I think number two, what we're showing here is a little more precise numbers given the insurance recoveries and
also tax affecting those, those cash outflows. So it's the combination of those and then something that's consistent
obviously is the future period look in terms of the enforcement of the caps, 2015 and beyond. But again, including in
what we've shared with you today, the after insurance recovery and after-tax impacts to Honeywell. So I think it's really
just those – a combination of those updates and refinements.
<Q - John G. Inch>: I'm sorry. The reason this is costing so much less today is why? Because of actuarial precision or
something?
<A - David John Anderson>: No, I don't think it's costing less. I think what we're doing is we have the payments for
claims that, if you will, catch up, the historic claims processing, spread over two years, 2013 and 2014 as well as 2013
includes trust formation funding, trust formation spending, that's about $45 million after-tax. We have those now
calculated we think more accurately or more – a little more precisely is probably the best way of saying it, still very
much estimates in terms of how this is going to play out. And we're showing all of those numbers to you on an after
insurance recovery after-tax basis. What you may be recalling is some communications that we've made on pre-tax
dollars and some of those communications probably also did not factor in some of the direct insurance recoveries. So
what we have done is sharpened a pencil in our communication today to show you really the net impact and our best
judgment of the timing of those outflows.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Got it. Thanks a lot. Thank you.
<A - David John Anderson>: You're welcome.
<A - Elena Doom>: Leo, we have time for just one more question.
Operator
Very good. We'll move next to Deane Dray, Citi Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah, hope you like the amount of cabbage this quarter?
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: You know what? I think you've done some good harvesting there. So I can also say I was
at that ISC West trade show last week in Las Vegas, and did see a number of those new products, especially the
integrated security systems that combine security, HVAC controls, and energy savings. And there were a number of
blue ribbons that you all won as best in show, so congratulations on that.
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah, thanks. We're pretty – ACS has a lot of – just a great new product pipeline on all the stuff
they're doing. So we're pretty excited about where that's going to go. Thanks.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: And the question I had is on, in ACS, on the process side, the comments about the
backlog converting at higher margins, I mean that's all good news. But hopefully you can break out how much of this is
the result of better pricing going into backlog. Is there a mix benefit? And how might there be some new products in
there as well?
<A - David M. Cote>: I'd say you touched on all the items. I would also I guess maybe to bolster the first part of that is
just better discipline in how we price, how we understand, what our cost is going to be and how do we manage that and
whether we decide to go after. But in addition, they've done a great job on new products and moving up the value chain
into the kind of simulation operator training type products that others can't really do and that always gives you just a
better margin overall. So, Dave, I don't think you have anything to add to that?
<A - David John Anderson>: I think that's exactly right.

<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: So just lastly, on that is – where are we in that cycle? The pushback, I hear from some
investors is, hey, this is the peak and you're going to see diminished spending in these areas. But it just doesn't seem
like that would be the case with the amount of retrofits and upgrades. But just can you comment on where we are in
that cycle?
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah, I guess I have a tough time seeing that myself. And if we remember about half their sales
go into the petrochemical and oil and gas side, and we have a good insight to that from just what's going on in UOP and
that looks pretty robust and for the same reason we said before, the world needs energy and there was a long period of
time where there was disinvestment. We're starting to see that churn within the refining industry that while only grows
2%, there's a big shift that's going on and high-growth regions are building more capability, and – well, I just have a
tough time seeing that being a declining industry.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Grant Thank you.
Elena Doom
All right. I'd like to hand it over to Dave Cote for any final comments.
David M. Cote
Thanks, Elena. We're obviously pleased with our performance in the quarter and we're able to raise our margin rate
substantially even on low sales growth. And for me, anyway, it's exciting to think about what we could do if we just got
some sales growth. It's exciting to think about the possibilities. We'll continue though to plan on a slow macro
environment really because there's no percentage in planning otherwise and I think it's important to think about that this
performance is a result not just of conservative planning which we talk about a lot and we do every year, but it's also
that relentless seed planting that we do whether it's products, technologies, process, geographies.
We want to do a great job not with this quarter but this quarter next year, three years from now, 10 years from now.
And that seed planting continues and it's just a part of who we are and I think it's why you can continue to expect us to
outperform in the future. So thank you for listening and I hope you're as pleased as we are. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful
