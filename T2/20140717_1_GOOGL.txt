MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Google, Inc. Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. This call is
being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Jane Penner, Director of Investor Relations. Please go
ahead, ma'am.
Jane Penner
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Google's second quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With us are Patrick

expected performance of our businesses, and our expected level of capital expenditures. These statements involve a
number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation, and we
undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements in
light of new information or future events. Please refer to our SEC filings for a more detailed description of the risk
factors that may affect our results.
Please note that certain financial measures that we use on this call, such as operating income and operating margin, are
expressed on a non-GAAP basis, and have been adjusted to exclude charges related to stock-based compensation and
restructuring. We've also adjusted our net cash provided by operating activities to remove capital expenditures, which
we refer to as free cash flow. Our GAAP results and reconciliations of non-GAAP to GAAP measures can be found in
our earnings press release.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Jane. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today for our second quarter 2014 earnings call. So I'll
dive right into the numbers, Nikesh is going to give you a business update, and then we'll open it up for Q&A. So let's
dive into the details of our financial performance for Q2.
Our gross total consolidated revenue grew a healthy 22% year-over-year, to $16 billion, and was up 3%
quarter-over-quarter. Without currency fluctuations, our gross total consolidated revenue growth would have, in fact,
been 21% year-over-year, still very healthy. Our Google site revenue was up 23% year-over-year, to $10.9 billion, and
was up 4% quarter-over-quarter, driven by strength in our core Search advertising business.
Our network revenue was up 7% year-over-year, at $3.4 billion, and was up 1% quarter-over-quarter, driven by
year-over-year growth in our AdMob and Ad Exchange businesses. Finally, Google Other revenue grew 53%
year-over-year, to $1.6 billion, and was up 3% quarter-over-quarter. Digital sales of apps and content in our Play Store
drove the year-over-year growth.
Our global aggregate paid click was strong this quarter, up 25% year-over-year and 2% quarter-over-quarter. Aggregate
CPC were down 6% year-over-year but flat quarter-over-quarter. And without currency fluctuation, aggregate cost per
click would have been down 7% year-over-year. So currency had a very minimal – and currency had no impact on
quarter-over-quarter CPC growth.
As we indicated in our last earnings call, we're now disclosing paid clicks and cost-per-click changes by property type
in addition to aggregate numbers. So, to that end, Google sites paid clicks were up 33% year-over-year and up 6%
quarter-over-quarter. Our Google site CPC were down 7% year-over-year and down 2% quarter-over-quarter. On the
network side, network paid clicks were up 9% year-over-year and down 5% quarter-over-quarter, and our network
CPCs were down 13% year-over-year and up 3% quarter-over-quarter.
Our monetization metrics continue to be impacted by a number of factors at an aggregate level, including geographic
mix, device mix, property mix, as well as our ongoing product and policy changes. And since we're now disclosing
additional property metrics related to our monetization, it may be helpful to remind you all of what we include in each
property.
So let's start with sites. Sites monetization metrics include ads that were served on Google owned and operated
properties across different geographies and form factors. So these properties include YouTube Search, obviously;
YouTube engagement ads like TrueView, and then other owned/operated properties such as like Maps or Finance and
otherwise. Our network monetization metrics include ad serves on non-Google-owned properties participating in our
AdSense for search, AdSense for content, and AdMob businesses.

We also provide corresponding historical data since Q1 of 2013 for reference, which can be found in our earnings
slides. Nikesh and I will obviously be happy to respond, as usual, to your question about our Q2 monetization in the
Q&A today, but I'm sure that some of you may have detailed questions about monetization trends from prior quarters.,
and to help you with that, the IR team will be ready to answer your questions after the call.
Turning to geographic performance, we saw solid performance in the U.S. and the UK and continued strong
performance in rest of world. In our earnings slides, which you can find on our Investor Relations website, you'll see
that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., UK, and rest of world to show the impact of FX and the benefits of our
hedging program, so please do refer to these slides for these calculations. The U.S. revenue was up 12%
year-over-year, to $6.6 billion. The UK was up 22%, to $1.6 billion, and in fixed FX terms, the UK grew 15%
year-over-year, a clear improvement from last quarter's performance.
As we've mentioned in previous quarters, our AdSense for search business skews toward the U.S. and the UK, and our
ongoing user-focused product and policy changes have continued to have a clear impact on our revenue growth in these
two geographies. Our non-U.S. revenue, excluding the UK, was up 31% year-over-year, to $7.7 billion, and this
accounted for 48% of our total revenue, which includes a $6 million benefit from our hedging program, so in FX terms,
the rest of world grew also 31% year-over-year.
Let me now turn to expenses. Traffic acquisition costs were $3.3 billion, or 23% of total advertising revenue this
quarter. Our non-GAAP other cost of revenue was $2.7 billion in Q2, and this is excluding stock-based compensation.
Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $4.8 billion, again excluding SBC. And as a result, our non-GAAP
operating profit was $5.1 billion, and our non-GAAP operating margin stood at 32% in Q2.
Headcount was up roughly 2,200 people in Q2 in the last 90 days, and in total, we ended the quarter with
approximately 52,000 full-time employees. But please note that the head count does include approximately 3,500
full-time employees from the Motorola business. Our effective tax rate was 21% in Q2. Our tax rate this quarter was
impacted by the continued mix shift of earnings between our domestic and international subsidiaries.
Let me now turn to cash management. Our OI&E, or other income and expense, was $145 million for the quarter.
Interest income and realized gains on investments offset the continued impact of expenses from our FX hedging
program, and for more detail on OI&E, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website. We
continue to be happy with our strong operating cash flow, at $5.6 billion. And CapEx for the quarter was $2.6 billion.
This quarter, the majority of the CapEx spend was related to data center construction, real estate purchases, and finally,
production equipment, in that order. Investors should see our investment in CapEx as a positive signal, since it reflects
our sustained optimism about Google's business. As I've mentioned before, we'll continue to invest for the long term,
and our infrastructure and real estate assets remain a key strategic area of investment for us. Our free cash flow for the
quarter was $3 billion.
And before I close, I want to give a brief update on Motorola. The team continues to be hard at work, and we look
forward to seeing them join with the Lenovo team soon. Motorola had a great Q2, with the Moto E and Moto G both
showing strong sales momentum, especially in emerging markets.
So, there you have it: strong results, and an optimism that provides us the confidence to continue to fund strategic
growth opportunities in many areas, including our CapEx area that we talked about earlier. And now I'll let Nikesh
cover some more details on our business performance in the quarter, and after his remarks, I'll take it back to open up
the phone lines for questions. Here you go, Nikesh.
Nikesh Arora
Thank you, Patrick. We've had an amazing last few months at Google, and our focus on great creating great
multiscreen experiences is paying off. I hope you saw our annual I/O Developer Conference a few weeks ago. We were
joined by over 6,000 developers in San Francisco, along with approximately 1.9 million people globally tuning in
online. We unveiled the upcoming Android L release. We also showed how we're expanding the Android platform to

cars, watches, TVs, as well as making it easy to search Google from anywhere by simply saying, okay Google.
Making magical products that people love using every day is what drives our ambition and fuels our business. Last
quarter we saw strong growth, with $16 billion in gross revenue. We saw particular strength in the travel and retail
verticals, as well as in several countries like Japan and India. By now, you know the four areas driving our business:
one, performance or direct-response marketing; two, helping clients build their brands; three, our ad-tech platforms for
agencies and publishers; and four, our emerging businesses like digital content, enterprise, and hardware. I'll quickly go
through each of them, and this quarter I'm going to highlight the investments we're making to serve small businesses.
Firstly, in performance advertising, in the long term, we're bounding towards a world where people jump seamlessly
across screens of all sizes on all types of services. In today's world, unlocking the mobile phone opportunity is
absolutely key for every marketeer, and we're seeing tremendous amounts of momentum here. We've been building
popular mobile app formats for years, like showcasing a business' location or click-to-call, et cetera. The teams are
laser-focused on making ad campaigns easier across screens and helping businesses measure their effectiveness across
devices as well as offline.
We already offer great solutions for marketeers wanting to promote app installs. In April, at our AdWords Performance
Forum, we supercharged our offerings for app developers across Search, Display, as well as YouTube We launched
improvements like app de-blinking in Search to help developers re-engage users who've already downloaded their app,
better targeting options in AdMob to help them reach the most likely customers, given a new app install format on
YouTube and more powerful measurement tools so they know exactly how their app is performing at every stage.
Mobile hotel booking app Hotel Tonight uses mobile search ads as a key part of their global marketing efforts because
it drives consistently high-value users who are more likely to purchase quickly in the apps. In fact, international mobile
search campaigns drive three times higher conversion rates compared to other direct-response channels.
We're also seeing tremendous amounts of momentum in the retailer segment product listing ads across screens. In fact,
this past quarter, we sent over three times as much traffic to merchants on smart phones and tablet devices compared to
Q2 of last year.
Moving on to the second area of brand-building, I recently spent some time at the Cannes Lions Festival – it was
working time – where Google had a big presence, hosting over 300 meetings with creative agencies and brands. What
was actually interesting this year was how much the conversation of brands has changed from years past. Whereas
digital used to be just one channel, today's brands are putting digital at the center of the brand-building campaigns.
We see this from our clients as well, and video seems to be the linchpin of the strategy. YouTube continues to be driven
by the insanely popular channels from some of our top content creators like Breakout Hits, Epic Rap Battles of History,
and new sensation VICE news. We launched our Google Preferred video offering at Brandcast in April, giving
marketeers access to top content on YouTube, and have gotten a phenomenal amount of support from agencies and
brands so far.
Digitas was our first agency to sign on, and since then, Omnicom Media Group has also pledged its support. Brands
including General Motors, Coca-Cola, and Universal Pictures are also having tremendous amounts of success with
Google Preferred. Adidas was one of the major brands to leverage our global platform to reach fans during the World
Cup. They engaged soccer fans by live-streaming events with athletes, promoted them on YouTube to improve the ads,
as well as using Google Lightbox Ads across our Display Network.
Now, a few words about our ad technologies for agencies and publishers. Again, video is at the forefront of our efforts
here. Last month we introduced a premium programmatic video marketplace called Google Partner Select to help
publishers monetize their video content and to help agencies reach top-quality video content across the Web. The
feedback that we've gotten from agencies and publishers has been great. We continue to see strong growth across
premium inventory. Particularly with the growth of private exchanges across AdMob and AdSense, publishers are
increasing their investments in mobile sites and apps and growing their businesses using our platforms.

Before I move on to our emerging businesses, I want to talk about an area we've continued to invest in, online tools for
small businesses. Small businesses are the cornerstone of the world's economy and a major priority for us at Google.
But there's still a huge opportunity, as over 50% of SMBs still don't have a website. To help set them up for online
success, last month we introduced Google My Business, which helps small businesses manage their online presence
across Search, Maps, and Google+.
We also have a vibrant ecosystem of partners who help local businesses optimize their AdWords campaigns, and we've
been improving our customer support for small businesses. In fact, over the last two years, we've doubled our advertiser
customer satisfaction scores, which bodes really well.
Now, let me talk about emerging new businesses, digital content, enterprise, and hardware. Google Play continues to
grow at breakneck speed across all types of digital content, helping developers and content partners reach users around
the world. For instance, Play in movies is now available in over 90 countries, with the recent additions in Argentina,
Poland, and the Czech Republic. We also recently signed deals with the CBS TV and Viacom to bring their TV content
to Google Play. With over 1 billion active Android users, the growing success of Google Play means that more
developers are building successful global businesses on our platform. As we mentioned at I/O, since last June, we've
paid out more than $5 billion to developers through Play, which clearly means it's a growing business for us as well.
Shifting gears to our enterprise business, I can report that over 60% of the Fortune 500 use our paid products. This
quarter, we added even more, like Rockwell Collins, which signed up 20,000 employees to use Google Apps. We also
launched Google Drive for Work, a premium service for businesses that includes unlimited storage. The reception so
far has been great, and we even closed our first sale within minutes of the announcement. Our cloud platform business
also has momentum, with new features announced at I/O.
On the hardware side, over 1 million Chromebooks were sold into schools, clearly a record quarter. And the popularity
of Chromecast continues to grow, now available in Australia, Korea, Portugal, and many more. I got to watch the
World Cup games from the ESPN app using my Chromecast.
Before I close, I want to mention our marketing team. In addition to a great I/O this year, we also launched the Made
With Code Initiative with partners like Girl Scouts of the USA and Girls Who Code to inspire the next generation of
women coders. We are really excited by the enthusiasm around this initiative, and who knows, hopefully some of these
coders will join us at Google.
With that, I'd like to thank today all the Googlers around the world who helped make this a fantastic quarter. On a
personal note, as you might have seen, I'm moving on to a new adventure. I'd like to thank Larry and Sergey and the
founders at Google, my colleagues and Larry's staff, as well as everyone at Google for the amazing experiences and the
phenomenal 10 years I've had. I look forward to working with them in the future and cheering them from the sidelines.
I'll hand back to Patrick.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Nikesh. And as you've just heard, this will be Nikesh's last call, so I want to take a minute on behalf of,
Nikesh, your friends here at Google, your colleagues, and also all of our Googlers to thank you for all of your
contributions to Google over like what has been really a decade of work, so a huge thanks.
While many of you on the call may have questions about transition, if you don't mind, we'd like to keep the discussion
focused on our performance in the last quarter, if you don't mind. So that's really where we'll focus our questions.
And with that, why don't I turn it over to Jamie, who will line us up for our Q&A. Jamie?

Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Mark Mahaney with RBC.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Thank you, two quick questions. The recovery in the growth rate in the UK, could you
provide any more color around that, or was it just that you had hard comps last quarter so that the growth rate is really
consistent with what you'd seen before? And then there's been some recent reporting about YouTube revenues. Could
you just clarify, even if it's just historical data, the size of that asset and any more color around the growth there, new
monetization initiatives, et cetera? Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Yes. So it's Patrick. And, Mark, as we had discussed in the last quarter, we had talked about
the UK having had a tough comp the year before, so you can see basically the recovery of that in the numbers, and
we're pretty pleased with the momentum there. In terms of YouTube, I know there's been a lot of speculation out there.
But in, essence, what we have is great opportunities in front of us, and we don't comment on outside estimates.
YouTube, it serves as a powerful starting point for advertisers for looking to anchor their brand campaigns online. And,
coupled with the online measurement of the digital audiences – be it Nielsen, ComScore, everything that we've just
announced over the last couple quarters – clearly a great runway ahead of it. So that's basically the story on YouTube.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Thank you, Patrick.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thanks. Jamie, what's our next question, please?
Operator
We'll go next to Eric Sheridan with UBS.
<Q - Eric J. Sheridan>: Thanks for taking the question. I guess, for Nikesh, maybe if we could get an update on your
e-commerce initiatives. You called out retail as one of the strongest verticals in the quarter, wanted the little more detail
on what you might be seeing with PLAs, and then also the decision to extend Google Shopping Express to an overnight
service in San Francisco. Thanks.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Yeah, thanks, Eric, for your question. I think two quick answers to that. As we've talked in the
past, PLAs is actually a fundamental existential need of our Search business because, as people go to tablets, as people
go to mobile devices, they're looking for more and more precise answers when they search. And the ability for them to
go directly to the entity they're searching for is phenomenally powerful when they're searching for these things. And
Sridhar [Ramaswamy] and his team have done a great job with working with every retailer out there to try and get as
many products listed in our product listing service, so when you actually search, you get a plethora of options in terms
of where you can buy the product, what it's priced at, and how many products are available in that category.
So it's actually a very, very good evolution from a search perspective, which clearly translates into people clicking on
those, and thereafter hopefully driving more commerce towards our partners in the retail segment. As I said, we drove
three times as much traffic this quarter than we did same time last year, so it's clearly good.
In terms of Google Shopping Express, it started off as an experiment. Clearly, our users are delighted with the service. I
can't seem to find people who are not happy with Google Shopping Express. And we are seeing tremendous results. We
are learning a lot, we're getting our logistics right, we're getting our processes right, and we believe it's clearly an
opportunity for us. And our teams are really, really excited about continuing to invest in that area and keep
experimenting with different formats and different solutions to make sure that we can provide the most optimized
experience to our users.
<Q - Eric J. Sheridan>: Okay, thanks...
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Just a point of clarification – you talked about an overnight service in San Francisco. In fact,
we've launched overnight delivery in all of Northern California. But that continues to be amazing demand for the
product.

<Q - Eric J. Sheridan>: Thanks, and good luck going forward, Nikesh.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thanks, Eric.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Thank you very much.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.
Operator
And we'll go next to Ben Schachter with Macquarie.
<Q - Ben Schachter>: Nikesh, good luck in your new role from me as well. Patrick, when you're budgeting for some
of the longer-term projects, and you're trying to thinking about a timeframe to get to profitability – for instance, the
team at GoogleX or Google Fiber or something around self-driving cars – how do you think about the timeframe for
getting to profitability? Is there any general rule on how far away it needs to be? And related to that, in terms of the
potential financial contribution within the next, say, three to five years, what are the new initiatives that you expect to
have the most impact? Thanks.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thanks for your question, Ben. And what you really have is, as I've explained many times
before, we set up our governance around, like a VC model, where we actually have gating and funding. And projects
that are more software-based will have much shorter lifetimes before we expect a bunch of returns. Projects that are
much more fundamental physics R&D will have much longer timelines for actually funding and expected milestones.
But, in both cases, they're all set around the boundaries of you have a business case, you have a thesis, and that thesis is
basically tested on a regular basis through the gating of the funding that they get.
And in some cases, like self-driving cars, obviously multiyear, and we have a couple of other projects in X that are of
that nature, where it would take, we think of half-decades, sometimes even a bit longer, before we know that you can
get real momentum on revenue and profitability. Others are much shorter. So that's how we think about it. What
matters most is really that we actually set up that gating and that we have these refinements to the business model. And
Google Shopping Express, another great example of that, right? Where you just have the gating, and then they come
back for funding every so many months to look at where they're going.
So that's what we have. In terms of the next three to five years, I wouldn't be able to comment on the specifics of any
one of those, but you can basically, through the guidance I've just given you, you can comb through what is really an
asset-intensive versus a software-intensive play. And then it gives you a guidance of how fast and how slow we should
expect our returns to be.
<Q - Ben Schachter>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thanks, Ben, great question. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.
Operator
And we'll go next to Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Justin Post>: Great. Thank you. A couple – you mentioned on the prepared remarks that the U.S. growth is being
impacted by some of the network changes. I don't suppose you could quantify it, but please do if you can, but when do
you think you work through all those changes and we can start seeing a normalized growth rate, or maybe you can
answer it by how far you're along that process? And then the second question, pretty excited about Google Play
opportunity, can you just tell us what's the margin opportunity related to Google Play, or the profit opportunity? Thank
you.

<A - Patrick Pichette>: I'll take the first, and then I'll let Nikesh talk about the second. On the first one, we've talked
about this – again, as you said so rightly, Justin, we have talked about a couple of things going on, right? As early as
Q1 of 2013, we announced these DLA policy changes, and you'll all remember that. And we also reminded you at the
time that by announcing these changes, it would take time to actually flow through to a bunch of partners across 2013,
so clearly there's an effect there on a year-over-year basis, as it didn't all happen in Q1 of 2013.
In addition to that, I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we continue to have ongoing user-focused product
changes, and they continue to impact our AFS business as an example, so AFS, right? And then what you end up with
is you, all remember that AFS, our AdSense for search, it really skews to the U.S. and the UK. And because of that,
that's why you see the disproportion into those results, so.
On the DLA, obviously they will last over the course of this year, but the additional continued product changes and the
user-focused product changes and policy changes, we'll continue to kind of hammer them to make sure that we get the
perfect balance between what is right for the user and what's right for the advertiser. And so that's why, all in all, I feel
pretty confident in what I said when I said that we're pretty pleased with our growth rate in the U.S.
As for the Play, why don't I actually let Nikesh give you a bit of comment on that?
<A - Nikesh Arora>: I think it's important to step back and look at what the Google Play team has achieved. It's come
from nowhere. It's a phenomenal platform which provides services, apps, content around the world, and as we
mentioned, over 90 countries with Google Play movies. And as Patrick would say, if you give away $5 billion to
developers, which is $5,000 million, it's a lot of money. And it's actually really great for innovation, it's phenomenal for
the app developer ecosystem, and it's really good binding glue for the Android ecosystem because people find
tremendous amounts of agility in all the apps and all the services they get in Google Play.
So, for those us, we're really, really very excited about the Google Play opportunity. I think in terms of the margin, you
should be able to look at the market and understand how typically these relationships work, and it should be no
different than what the current market is around the margin opportunity for software and services in the long term.
<Q - Justin Post>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thank you, Justin. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.
Operator
We'll go next Ross Sandler with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Ross A. Sandler>: Thanks, guys. I just had two questions, product-related. So, at I/O, you announced some new
innovation in search and discovery for apps, including opening up app indexing globally. So what kind of timeline do
you think Google's on before we start to see a lot of app content appearing in core search results more regularly, and
what kind of revenue opportunity do you see around that? And then the second question, somewhat related, is you also
announced a bunch of new screens for Android watches, TVs, et cetera. I know it's still very early days, but do you
envision the long-term business model for these being similar to the existing model with ads in Google Play, or do you
see potentially doing closed-loop transactions, as an example? Thanks.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Ross, thank you for your question. Let's talk about the app indexing first and then and about the
screen stuff. If you think about it, Google has been in the business of making sure that we drive traffic on behalf of
people, and advertise and help people find things. And as we look at mobile phone behavior, people spend a lot of time
on apps, as well in the browser, searching for things. So I think it's important for us to make sure that we provide the
content that users are looking for.
So you should expect us to most aggressively try and make sure that app indexing all happens and it's available and
easily accessible across devices, and if people are looking for things, we provide them the most relevant answer, and
which in certain cases that happens to be the apps. So allowing for people to discover apps as well as creating more
engagement for apps that people may not have been engaging with for a while. So I think clearly an area of focus, and

clearly you should expect us to see activity in that space. And in terms of revenue, it's not unlike any revenue we create
in search, where we help people find things, and that allows us to create an advertising opportunity where we're able to
monetize that on behalf of our properties.
In terms of your second question, I think you have to take a longer-term point of view towards the screen question. As
you can see, all screens are almost designed as islands where every screen has its own operating system, has its own
ability to work, but we're noticing more and more people want to switch from screens and retain the service experience.
And towards that end, the Android team is doing a phenomenal job making sure that we provide that seamlessness
across screens and the fungibility of services across those screens.
So I think in the long term, we have to think about this as a user-centric model for helping users take their services
fungibly from one screen to the other and making that happen seamlessly. And if that works out, I think they'll be
phenomenal business opportunities for us in the future. But, at Google we always worry about the user first, and we'll
figure out the monetization when we have a lot of users excited about it.
<Q - Ross A. Sandler>: Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Jamie, why don't we go to our next question?
Operator
And we'll go next to Carlos Kirjner with Bernstein.
<Q - Carlos Kirjner>: Thank you. Two questions, if I may. One on revenue, is there a significant positive net impact
of growing penetration in users of smartphones on search, [ph] Play and (29:29) revenue? And what happens to search
revenue growth if there's no more benefit in developed markets as smartphone penetration approaches 100%? Second,
you added more than 2,400 employees to Google in the quarter versus 1,400 in the second quarter last year. I think
that's the highest quarterly head count addition in more than two years. But if this is the new normal in terms of the rate
in which you grow head count for the core, how do you think about rate of head count growth versus gross profit, or
you don't think about that at all? Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Let me tackle the second one, and then I'll let Nikesh talk about the first one. On the issue of
head count, look, we have this amazing opportunity and machine to actually look around the world to look for the best
engineers. And we promise ourselves that, given the bar is very, very high, that when we do find people that fit the
culture and that we think will actually do a great contribution and be great Googlers, we actually don't hesitate and we
hire them, because if we hire them a bit too early or a bit too late, on balance, we're very happy to have them early on.
You are right that if you look at the last couple quarters, the trend has been pretty solid, and in addition to that, you
have to look at the impact also of our acquisitions. When we make acquisitions, that compounds a bit the numbers. But
from that perspective, Carlos, we don't set up a specific target, we say we're going to end up with X amount for this
quarter, and then once we hit our quota, we see everybody else next quarter. So, from that perspective, we're a bit more
organic about it. And the vast majority of our hiring, to give comfort to our investors, it is really still in the engineering
field and the product management field, which is really where we want to focus our attention, and we continue to focus
there. So that's basically the puzzle with which we work.
On the question, maybe Nikesh can talk about revenue and smartphone penetration.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: And of course, unequivocally, the answer is yes. As we see more and more usage and penetration
of smartphones, people spend more time looking for things on smartphones. And I think there's a very, very long
runway that this opportunity has, because we're just seeing people getting onto smartphones. Now you're beginning to
see businesses and other websites take mobile very, very seriously. They want to be present on mobile. I think the
revenue opportunity is phenomenally high because, right now, mobile does not monetize as well as certain other forms,
but given the huge influx of queries we're seeing, we expect as people make it more and more relevant to be able to
find information, in the long term, mobile should be monetizing even better than desktop. So I think there's tremendous

runway going forward. I don't think we have to fear the saturation of smartphone penetration in developed markets for
a while.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thank you, Carlos. We'll take our next question, Jamie.
Operator
And we'll go next to Anthony DiClemente with Nomura.
<Q - Anthony DiClemente>: Thanks very much. Patrick, can you give us an update on your Internet access initiatives,
particularly Google Fiber, maybe update us on the evolution of the economics of that business, and then perhaps even
the timing of the Google Fiber rollout for more recently announced cities? And then a separate question on the Google
Compute Engine business, how big of a growth driver can GCE be, and what do you guys see as the competitive
advantage that Google has in what seems to be an increasingly competitive space in terms of the cloud? Thanks.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: So why don't I jump on the first one, then Nikesh, if you don't mind talking about GCE
afterwards. Look, here's what's going on with Google Fiber. It's important to bear in mind the following. First is the
economics of a fiber network today are clearly much cheaper than they were, say, a decade ago. There's been a lot of
improvements and cost reductions in technology components all through the fiber network, but also in the way we
build it. The second one is I just want to remind everyone that an important part of our strategy is actually to build the
demand. So, unlike the typical over-builder, actually we have a very different business model and thesis for that. And
we do work closely with each city to streamline the process that keeps, again, the cost of construction way down.
So, as an update to you, right now, Anthony, as you know, we are working with 34 cities – separate cities – with a
completed checklist of items to help us prepare for the next wave of our construction project, and we're going to be
basically – they're in the last throes of finishing these checklists and coming back with us. Over the coming months,
we'll actually be going through all of the details with them, whether they be right-of-way or permitting or otherwise,
and that's what we're going to use to make decisions as to how broad a program we'll have. We expect to give an update
between now and the end of the year as the information comes along. So we're really thrilled about the opportunity. It
continues to be a great piece of focus for us. And just stay tuned for more – the next update on it.
As per the GCE, do you want to take it, Nikesh, or?
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Yeah. So I think what's very important to understand, and we've talked about this in the past, that
we believe there is a lot of businesses out there have still to shift to the cloud. We think in the long term, every business
will be most efficient when they shift to the cloud. So we're not really concerned about trying to compete with other
cloud providers. What we're really concerned about is making sure we have an amazing offering for businesses so they
find value in working with us, and making sure that we can support them in their transition to the cloud.
We think we have a great set of products. Our team is really excited. We're beginning to ramp up. So I think there's
tremendous opportunity going forward, and I think it won't be time to slice the pie for a long time, because a lot of
businesses are clamoring to move their business to the cloud, because that's where the users already are. Because we
are used to the cloud and are personalized, and it's about time that are businesses that we work in actually got to the
bleeding edge of technology as much as the consumer services are.

<Q - Mark A. May>: Thanks for taking my questions -a follow-up on the network business. I think some of the quality
initiatives that you've been undergoing and continue to for a while, part of the intended consequence or result, I would
imagine, would be to recognize higher overall CPCs or pricing over time. But that doesn't seem to have been the case
so far. So I wonder if you could shed a little light as to why we're not seeing that show up in some of the metrics, and
kind of what your expectations are going forward: is that, in fact, one of the intended consequences that we should be
expecting going forward?
And then, secondly, you've highlighted, not just this quarter but previously, that one of the main headwinds to the
company's overall CPCs has been the mix shift around geography. I wonder if you could shed some light on if you've
been seeing or making any progress in closing the gap there, maybe in markets like APAC, and what exactly are you
doing to try to improve pricing outside the domestic and more established markets?
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Yeah. So, Mark, it's Patrick. I think that you readily point to the fact that we are spending –
there're so many factors. The issue we have with the CPC, one of the key things about CPC is, clearly, it gives you a
trend, but the trend is really shaped by the combination of CPC and clicks. So you can't just look at one in isolation of
the other. It's really that mix of the two. And in the case of network, for example, we just discussed at the beginning of
the call that we've put a lot of time and a lot of energy in the last 18 months to actually work on quality issues, and that
clearly has an impact when you push on quality to – when you look at the mix, to actually drive for the kind of
revenues and growth rates that you see in our results on network.
Having said that, it's also compensated by all of the other positive factors that we see, whether it be, as you said,
geography or product mix or otherwise. So, all in all, I think that the team is doing a good job both on network and on
sites. And you can see that as well on our detailed information of sites, where we continue to see, certainly over the last
few quarters, creeping back up of CPCs, which actually continue to push for this quality issue.
In terms of geography, I think that, yes, geography makes a big difference in that CPCs are much, in some cases, lower
in international markets or emerging markets. But the team continues with a number of localization initiatives. So we
don't take CPCs as just one general; we will focus on each country, look for initiatives on localizations for each
country, to get the maximum CPCs on a geographic basis, country-by-country basis. And that's why you'll see a lot of
the localization initiatives. They're just one, again, one contributor. And it's really early days. There's so much more
potential in many of these areas. And that's why Sridhar's team and our Search teams continue to work side-by-side to
continue to push on these areas.
So we see a lot of runway in this one, and geography is just one of these areas. And you mentioned APAC, but APAC
is a combination of more mature markets like Australia and Japan, and then we have the real emerging markets in there
as well like Indonesia or India. And so even APAC itself is – again, localization matters immensely because very
different answers for different countries. But, all in all, a pretty good story, and we're really proud to continue to focus
with this balance between user, first, and then make sure that we have the right monetization.
So thanks for your question, Mark. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.
Operator
And we'll go next to Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Great. Thanks for taking the question, just wanted to ask two things. First, thanks for the
added disclosure just on volume in CPCs. If we look at the sites data on pricing, it looks like we've seen an inflection
here over the last two quarters, and then now more flattish here sequentially in 2Q. Can we interpret from that that
we've seen the worst in terms of the negative pricing impact from mobile? And can you give us some color on what
you're seeing in terms of like-for-like mobile pricing at this point? And then, secondly, just on CapEx, Patrick, can you
just help us understand how your philosophy maybe has changed around CapEx spending over the last few years, and if
you're in this period of building out potentially a lot of excess capacity, is it reasonable to think here at some point over
the next few quarters we can also see things slow down as the business grows into that spending more? Thanks.

<A - Patrick Pichette>: So, Douglas, let me start with the last question first, and then I'll jump to the first. On CapEx,
if you listen to the script I gave a couple minutes ago, interestingly, this quarter, in priority order, was construction of
data centers; second was actually real estate which typically would have been – historically you would have heard me
talk about equipment; and then equipment was third. So CapEx, we think, continues to be a strategic asset of ours. And
you're correct in that we signaled that, that we're actually building – we have a big building program right now because
these are long lead-time items for our data centers, and we just talked about a minute ago about GCE and other cloud
services that continue to grow. So, to strategically have the capacity versus not having the capacity is such a strategic
asset to us that we'll continue to look that way.
In terms of real estate, we found the same thing. We found that when we have opportunities to actually acquire real
estate, so buy versus lease option, and if you think of our growth and the growth in the strategic areas where we want to
be, when we find great opportunities, I think that we have no regret in actually taking that action. So you're seeing more
activities on that front, which answers – a lot of questions have been around, is the core business kind of capital
intensity growing? Well, you can see from these data points that it's not really that. It's really a strategic focus that we
have right now in making sure that we have the long-term assets necessary to win. So that's basically the mindset in
which we're investing in CapEx.
In the volume of CPCs, you're talking about more flattish sequential in Q2. This is for sites, I assume? Was that for
sites?
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: For sites, and the smaller decline over the last two quarters.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Yeah, again, I would refer you back to the IR team to get a lot more detailed questions, but I
think on a quarterly basis, there can be so many fluctuations. I think year-over-year gives you a much more kind of
realistic trend about what is fundamentally going on in the business, because one or two changes can really kind of
swing. Even seasonality can swing quite a bit both in terms of growth rates or clicks and CPCs. So, beware always of –
and as you can see that in the network numbers, clearly on the quarter-over-quarter as well, there's a lot of noise in the
data, so you have to be careful in the quarter-by-quarter. But year-over-year actually gives you a pretty good story of
the efforts we're putting into this. That's how I would do it.
Thank you very much for your questions. Jamie, let's go to our next question, please.
Operator
And we'll go next to Peter Stabler with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Peter C. Stabler>: Thanks for taking the questions, just wanted to revisit the topic of small business for a second.
Could you help us understand a little bit on some of the qualities of the small business growth profile? Is this about
bringing businesses that have no online identity, online, or is it about taking more mature small businesses and getting a
greater share of the spending? Just wondering if you could step back and maybe give yourself a report card on the small
business progress you've made and where the best opportunities are. Thanks very much.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Thanks, Peter, for the question. I think, again if you think about the phenomenal scale at which
the Google team operates vis-à-vis small businesses is staggering. We have millions of advertisers, millions of
publishers we deal with, and we trying to make sure that millions of publishers get monetizations for advertising. At the
same time, we're trying to make sure that millions of small businesses achieve their goals in trying to drive traffic, both
online and offline, into whatever services they're offering to their end-users.
Now, as we've gone through this transition to mobile, and it's very important that these small businesses make that
transition effectively because all the user traffic is slowly and steadily shifting towards mobile, and part of our effort is
to make sure that we work closely with all of our small business advertisers existing to help them go mobile; at the
same time, trying to bring on more small businesses both onto the mobile and the desktop platform. So it's really a
concerted effort to try and support small businesses around the world. It's very targeted programs to show them ROI, to
show them the value of living online, because we believe in the long term that's where most business is going get

And we'll go next to Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. I had two, I guess. Given the success of
Chromebooks over the past few years, how do you think about the direction of Android and Chrome from a
development standpoint as you look out, and also when you think about the multiscreen comments that you made
before about the value being able to transfer people's experiences across screens?
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Did you say you had two questions, Heather?
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Yeah, and then I had a second one, was just – I was going to start with that one since it was
long-winded. And then the second one was just Google Shopping Express seems to be a great way to impact the small
business environment. I'm just wondering, now that we're seeing that expand into different areas, should we start to see
an inflection in small business advertising adoption?
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Let me – okay, so we got the two questions. I think Google Shopping Express is really about
local, and local is really about both small businesses as well as large businesses. So it really – so absolutely small
businesses will be part of the focus area, and we're engaging with many of them, which is actually pretty terrific. But
it's really about local, so it's not only with a focus on small businesses, and that's really the focus of Shopping Express.
In the case of Chromebooks and Android, we've discussed this many times in the past, where basically you have a great
convergence because there's humongous strength in both of these platforms, and they're basically converging in many
ways. Today, you can get – for example, on an Android phone, Chrome powers the search and vice versa. So we have a
lot of this cross-pollination between the two teams. They're under one leadership, which is Sundar [Pichai], and he
basically actually makes sure that these two teams continue to work into an integrated fashion.
Everybody knows that Chrome has a huge focus on security, and that is, in fact, a great focus to migrate over into the
Android ecosystem to make sure that we have the equivalent of enterprise-grade security for all of our users, whether
they be Chrome or Android. So I think that when you think of multiscreen, both of these OSs are actually very
complementary to each other, and that's why we continue to work in parallel. I think that, across these multiscreens,
you should expect – Android continues to be very much the thing of choice for mass, and Chrome continues to be very
much the enterprise infrastructure, and you should continue to see that evolve with that collaboration.
So that's how we think about it, Heather. There's no it's one or the other. I think that they are perfect complements. So
thank you for your question.

<Q - Youssef H. Squali>: Thank you very much, two quick questions, please. Going back to Doug's question about
CapEx, Patrick, can you give us any example of a non-search initiative where you've invested heavily over the last
maybe three, four, five years, where the ROI today exceeds your threshold? I'm assuming maybe on the display side?
And then on the YouTube content strategy, how high in the professionally created content funnel do you want to get?

Over time we've seen more and more professionally created content, so if you can help us with that, that would be
great. Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: We have a whole host of products where they are – just think of display, think of YouTube,
think of maps, think of – there's been so many of these products that have – yeah, Gmail, Chrome, Android, all of
those, whether they are directly tied to advertising because they're an advertising product, or they're a platform that
actually gives you distribution that gives you a great infrastructure that fuels the searches and the advertising. I think
that we have so many areas that we get absolutely terrific returns. So it's not only about search. It's really about the
entire experience and the delivery around them.
Then your second question is – could you just repeat the second question for me, please?
<Q - Youssef H. Squali>: Sure. Sure. Just trying to understand the content strategy within YouTube. So just how high
do you want to go up the professionally created content funnel, and how do you plan the monetization, if the – is it all
advertising, or is there another model?
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Thank you, Youssef, for the question. I think it's fair to say that YouTube has all forms of
professional content available today. It has all the way from user content to very popular user content with people like
Michelle Phan, et cetera, and it has a lot of clips from professionally driven content from various media partners. We
talked about CBS and Viacom on the earnings call. So we have lots and lots of content from different players out there.
And our monetization model on YouTube is working. It's a phenomenal model. It is now the linchpin of each of our
brand strategies, where partners and advertisers want to come work with us to create brand campaigns because
YouTube allows you to actually target a fragmented set of interests in a most efficient fashion, as opposed to try and do
burst advertising that you would do on television and broadcast mode. So, clearly, the monetization model is working.
In terms of other models, as you have seen in the past, we have experimented with various models on YouTube, and we
continue to experiment to see if advertising is the only model or there are ways that we can monetize using subscription
or paid-for content. I think that we will continue to do and see which ones of those sticks with the users.
<Q - Youssef H. Squali>: All right. Thanks, and all the best, Nikesh.

<Q - Richard A. Kramer>: Thanks very much. Nikesh, could you just expand on that last comment, putting together
Google Fiber and a year on from YouTube channels, how important is it for Google over time to establish a
subscription-based type revenue stream, especially if content moves to bundles? And for Patrick, two things that would
help us benchmark Google versus peers, first of all, can you talk about the portion of ad growth or even the overall ad
sales which are being driven by mobile? And also, clearly, there's some questioning of the notion that large amounts of
offshore cash can be permanent reinvested. Can you tell us what portion of cash is now offshore and how we should
think about international opportunities that might absorb these very large volumes of cash? Thanks.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Richard, thank you very much for the question. I think in terms of your question around Google
Fiber, YouTube, content bundling, subscription revenue streams, I think it's a very good question, and I think it's an
area where there's a lot of movement across the board, where different people are trying different models, where cable
is trying to provide content over the top, where YouTube is available on television screens, where people are trying to
increase the broadband speeds, because everybody gets the sense that we will consume more and more broadband
content. I think what's clear to us in this process is that bandwidth will continue to increase. People's appetite for
bandwidth will continue to grow up. It's clear that people will consume content more and more in a non-linear fashion.
It is clear that content will come from different places, not just the traditional mechanisms of cable and television.

So I think that's pretty clear. It's also clear that people will monetize content both either in some form of payment or
some form of advertising. Beyond that, how all of this coagulates and takes form still remains to be seen. I think it's fair
to say we're experimenting on different ends of the spectrum where we have, like YouTube, purely advertising-based
content and monetized today is just over-the-top, which works on broadband. We have Google Fiber; we have channel
bundles. So I think we are experimenting, we are playing in every space, and I think eventually the user will decide
whatever is most convenient and they are most able to use, they will decide. But I think it's fair to say we have a horse
in every one of these races.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: That's terrific. Let me jump into the second question. I'm going to once again kind of take a bit
of exception to the premise of your argument about how much is driven by mobile. We really are living in a
multiscreen world. You start on mobile, you hop on tablet, you go to your desktop, you come back to your television,
you Chromecast back to your TV – that's the world in which we live. And when people say, how much of your
advertising is really driven by one, we do a lot of research that actually shows that – in fact, that's what we try to show
to our advertisers is, how much attribution to kind of show to each of these elements which is in the chain of activities
that actually leads to the end, which is either a consumption of something or a purchase.
So, from that perspective, that's why we don't actually talk about mobile as a percentage of ads. What really matters is
that you have the footprint across all of these devices and modes to actually deliver the best answer to our users. And
that's why you heard about I/O continuing to expand that landscape.
In the case of CapEx in international, like last quarter, our offshore cash was about kind of 60% and 40% in the U.S.
We'll share those numbers in our 10-Q, so stay tuned. But, in rough numbers, that's really where we stand today. It may
move a percentage here and there. We do have great opportunities outside the U.S. as well to actually invest our cash,
whether it be through acquisitions – you've seen a number of acquisitions in the last year that were made internationally
– as well as we're building data centers outside of the U.S. Our headquarters in Ireland continues to grow, and we're
investing quite a bit of money there as well into the real estate, so when you see our real estate numbers, they may
include over time a number of these projects in Ireland, but also in London and other places where we're investing. So
we actually have pretty exciting plans for our international portfolio both in APAC and in Europe. And so there's a real
great case to actually continue to keep this amount offshore. It's not a shortage of opportunities that we have. So it's just
a question of pace and discipline.
So thank you for that.
<Q - Richard A. Kramer>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thank you, Richard. Maybe we have time for one more. We'll take one more question.
Operator
And we'll take our final question from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.
<Q - Colin A. Sebastian>: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. First off, Nikesh, congratulations and good luck.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Thank you.
<Q - Colin A. Sebastian>: Firstly, through Google Play and applications such as Shopping Express, there already is a
transactional model in place in terms of purchases and payments. I guess I wonder if it wouldn't be natural to assume
that some of that transactional functionality could be extended to Google Shopping, appealing more broadly, or is it
really about just driving traffic to third-party sites for those businesses. And then, secondly, just a clarification on the
cost-per-click breakout from the report, why aggregated cost-per-click year-over-year growth is actually better than
individually the Google sites and the network sites. Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: I can actually give you the answer to the last one, and then you can come back. It's basically
the Simpsons – what's it called? – paradigm. So if you go on – paradox. If you go on Wikipedia and you just check the

Simpson's paradox, you'll understand that. You may have two factors that are actually correlated in the same directions,
but when you actually put them together, they actually may correlate in an inverse proportion. And that's what you get
into the numbers. And that's why you have the discrepancy. Because we all kind of laughed at this number as well
because, when we saw it, we said, hey, something doesn't add up, and in fact it does add up. So that's really the issue
there, Colin. And – unless you already know the Simpson's paradox, then don't go to Wikipedia.
<Q - Colin A. Sebastian>: I'll search Google first.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: And on the first question...
<A - Nikesh Arora>: On the first – sorry.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: No, go ahead, Nikesh.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Okay. On the first question, I think that's a fair observation, Colin. And I think if you look at
some of the applications that our payments team has developed around InstaBuy, it's the ability to do a one-click buy,
where we can partner with merchants and any kinds of transaction providers, but they don't have to keep entering their
data or entering their credit card in different places, so it gives them the comfort and ease of transaction. So I think,
over time, it's kind of like an open system solution, where we have platforms where retailers can work with us and pick
and choose what part of our platform they want to leverage. And our hope is to create a more and more frictionless
ability to create transactions, which effectively benefits commerce and hopefully creates more revenue opportunities
for us.
<Q - Colin A. Sebastian>: Okay, great. Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thanks, Colin. I usually stop by thanking all the Googlers, but, Nikesh?
Nikesh Arora
Yeah, Patrick, I just wanted to also take a moment and thank everybody on the call for tolerating and enduring me on
this call and supporting me over the last many years. Thank you, everyone. I look forward to working with you in the
future in a different role.
Patrick Pichette
And with that, we're going to actually thank all the Googlers for their amazing work over the last 90 days. It's been a
real roller coaster as we're continuing with I/O and everything else. And we look forward to Q3.
With that, Jamie – again, Nikesh, all the best, and, Jamie, I'll let you close the call.
Nikesh Arora
Thank you, Patrick.
