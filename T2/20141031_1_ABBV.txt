On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand
AbbVie's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP
financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which can be found on our website.
Following our prepared remarks, we'll take your questions.
So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Rick.
Richard A. Gonzalez
Thank you, Larry. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.
During today's call, I'll spend a few minutes on our strong results in the quarter as well as our performance since we
launched as an independent company. I'll also discuss our pipeline advancement, including forthcoming data and other
milestones. I'll then turn the call over to Bill, who'll provide additional color regarding the quarter and our outlook for
the remainder of the year. We'll also make sure we leave enough time for your questions.
Since launching AbbVie 22 months ago, we have focused on driving strong performance, creating shareholder value
and building a robust pipeline to drive future growth. To that end, we have delivered a total shareholder return of more
than 90%, representing $40 billion of shareholder value creation. Today we reported robust third quarter results with
adjusted earnings per share of $0.89, significantly exceeding our guidance range for the quarter. This included
operational sales growth of more than 8%, also ahead of our outlook for the quarter. We drove this performance with
double-digit growth across a number of products, including HUMIRA, Synagis, Synthroid, Duodopa, and Creon.
In the quarter, we also delivered improvements in gross margin and continue to invest in the business for future growth.
And for the second time this year, we significantly raised our full-year EPS guidance range for 2014, reflecting the
robust performance of our underlying business and positive trends we expect through the remainder of the year. This
guidance reflects EPS growth for 2014, despite the headwinds created by the loss of exclusivity in our lipids franchise.
Our results demonstrate the strength and sustainability of our portfolio and they underscore our continued focus and
execution.
Our third quarter results were led by HUMIRA, which delivered nearly 18% global operational growth. HUMIRA's
performance was driven by several factors, including continued market growth resulting from increasing penetration
across therapeutic categories and geographies. As we've indicated in the past, HUMIRA's broad label and new
indications are a competitive advantage. We recently reported positive results from our Phase 3 studies of HUMIRA in
HS, a chronic inflammatory skin disease that currently has no approved treatment options. We're on track to submit our
U.S. and European regulatory applications for HS this year.
We've also spent the last several years developing and implementing a strategy that we believe will protect and grow
our leadership position in immunology, including product enhancements and intellectual property. And behind
HUMIRA, we have a number of promising immunology assets in development. As a result, we are confident in our
strategies to defend our position across our immunology categories.
Our interferon-free HCV therapy represents another exciting vehicle for strong growth. We are on the cusp of approval,
with the regulatory reviews progressing very well. We are actively engaged with regulators on various fronts, and have
completed our pre-approval manufacturing and clinical inspections.
As we said at a healthcare conference last month, we do not expect that an advisory committee meeting will be required
prior to U.S. approval. In anticipation of U.S. commercialization by year-end and European approval in early 2015,
we've built the appropriate infrastructure and are fully prepared for our launch. Our next-generation HCV program also
continues to progress well. We're currently conducting Phase 2b studies, and expect to transition to Phase 3
development in 2015.

Beyond HCV, we have a robust pipeline of promising development programs. These programs span specialty
therapeutic areas and include both biologics and small molecules. All told, we have more than 40 active clinical
development programs underway. This includes 12 products in Phase 3 development or currently under regulatory
review.
We have a high level of enthusiasm in our oncology pipeline, which includes 10 new molecular entities being studies in
more than 55 clinical trials. In collaboration with Roche, we will present additional data on ABT-199 at an upcoming
medical meeting, including Phase 1 data on AML and early data from a trial combining ABT-199 with Gazyva.
We'll also see data from a large single-agent study in relapsed refractory CLL patients with 17p deletion in early 2015.
As a reminder, if the data warrant and regulatory authorities agree that ABT-199 addresses an unmet medical need in
this patient population, these data have the potential to support an early pathway to registration.
Veliparib is our PARP inhibitor in development for a wide range of solid tumors. Over the past year, we have initiated
four pivotal studies. This includes Phase 3 trials in neoadjuvant breast cancer, BRCA breast cancer, and most recently
two studies announced in small cell lung cancer that includes patients with squamous and non-squamous cancers.
We're also excited about ABT-414, our anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody drug conjugate, being evaluated in
combination with chemotherapy for glioblastoma multiforme, the most common and most aggressive type of malignant
primary brain tumor. We were recently granted orphan drug designation for ABT-414 by the EMA and FDA, and we
are moving aggressively to start a Phase 2 study in patients with GBM by early next year.
Also in our late-stage development in our oncology pipeline is elotuzumab in partnership with Bristol Myers Squibb for
multiple myeloma. Results from the pivotal trial in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma patients are expected in early
2015.
Our late stage neuroscience pipeline includes daclizumab and Duodopa. Daclizumab is in development for the
treatment of multiple sclerosis. Despite advances in the MS category, there continues to be a significant need for novel,
high-efficacy agents with favorable benefit-risk profiles, and we believe daclizumab has the potential to be an
important therapy in this large and growing market.
We presented promising pivotal trial data earlier this year, which demonstrated patients treated with daclizumab had a
statistically significant 45% reduction in annualized relapse rates versus AVONEX. We have begun to engage with
global regulatory authorities and are working with our partner to complete our regulatory applications in the first half of
2015.
Duodopa is AbbVie's novel therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease. It is currently under regulatory review in the
U.S., with an FDA action expected in early 2015.
Elagolix is our compound in Phase 3 development for endometriosis and Phase 2b for uterine fibroids. We continue to
expect to see initial data from the first of two pivotal studies in endometriosis later this year, and plan to report top-line
data shortly thereafter. We'll also see data from the mid-stage program in uterine fibroids next year as well.
As I mentioned, we have a number of promising immunology assets in development, including oral selective JAK1
inhibitors, several biologics, and two bio-specific biologics currently in mid-stage trials. We expect to see data from the
selective JAK1 inhibitors next year, allowing us to make a decision regarding Phase 3 development.
In summary, we delivered excellent performance in the quarter and our pipeline continues to evolve. We're on the
verge of a number of important milestones, including the commercialization of our interferon-free HCV combination,
and we're prepared for a successful launch. AbbVie is poised to deliver top-tier performance, including strong sales and
earnings growth beginning in 2015. We have a high degree of confidence in our strategy and our performance.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Bill for a more detailed view of our results. Bill?

Thank you, Rick. This morning I will review our third quarter performance and provide an update on our outlook for
the remainder of 2014.
This was another very strong quarter for AbbVie, as we exceeded our guidance on both the top and the bottom line.
Total sales increased 8.3% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.5% unfavorable impact from foreign exchange.
HUMIRA delivered global sales of more than $3.2 billion, up 17.8% operationally and up 17.5% on a reported basis. In
the United States, HUMIRA sales increased 25.3%, driven by continued market expansion, strong prescription trends
and share gains, partially offset by a reduction in retail buying patterns.
Internationally, HUMIRA sales grew 10.3% on an operational basis, excluding a 0.6% unfavorable impact from
exchange. International growth was driven by strong underlying trends, including the uptake of new indications and
share gains, but was partially offset by the timing of shipments in international markets. We continue to see
double-digit market growth for HUMIRA in most international markets. Certainly, we are well on track to significantly
exceed our original full-year guidance for HUMIRA.
AndroGel sales were $232 million, down 6.7% from the prior year. We continue to see a notable slowdown in the
market, with overall prescriptions down significantly. However, we did gain share from competitors during the quarter
and benefited somewhat from favorable pricing trends.
U.S. sales of Synthroid were $200 million, up 24.3% year-over year. Synthroid maintained strong brand loyalty and
market leadership, despite the entry of generics into the market many years ago. The overall market has experienced
low single-digit growth with Synthroid growth outpacing the market including pricing trends.
Global Lupron sales were $196 million in the quarter, up 0.4% on an operational basis. Lupron continues to hold a
leadership position and maintain significant share of the market.
U.S. Creon sales were $148 million in the quarter, up 47.6%. Creon maintains its leadership position in the pancreatic
enzyme market, where the product continues to capture the vast majority of new prescription starts. Growth in the
quarter benefited from a favorable comparison to the prior-year quarter.
Sales of Synagis were $109 million in the third quarter, up 18.3% on an operational basis. Synagis, which protects
at-risk infants from severe respiratory disease, is a seasonal product with the majority of sales in the first and fourth
quarters of the year. Growth in the quarter was driven by continued product uptake and strong commercial execution.
Sales of Duodopa, our therapy for advanced Parkinson's disease, approved in Europe and other international markets,
were $56 million, up 20.8% on an operational basis this quarter. Performance is in line with recent trends as well as our
full-year outlook for the product.
And sales in our lipid franchise were down significantly due to generic competition. We expect these trends to continue
for the remainder of 2014.
I'll turn now to the P&L profile for the third quarter. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 81.1%, somewhat above our
expectations, and up 140 basis points year-over-year. This reflects the loss of exclusivity in our lipid franchise, offset
by favorable mix impacts across the portfolio, as well as margin enhancing initiatives we've implemented.
Adjusted SG&A was 26.4% of sales in the third quarter, up more than 9% year-over-year, reflecting continued
investment in our growth brands and preparations for our upcoming HCV launch. Adjusted R&D was 16.2% of sales in
the third quarter, up more than 14% versus the prior-year quarter. As expected, our absolute R&D investment was up
sequentially over the second quarter, as we increased funding of our mid and late-stage pipeline assets and additional
HUMIRA indications. Adjusted net interest expense was $53 million and the adjusted tax rate was 22.4% in the
quarter.
Third quarter adjusted earnings per share, excluding noncash intangible amortization expense and specified items were
$0.89, well above our previous guidance range of $0.77 to $0.79. On a GAAP basis, earnings per share were $0.31.
You will recall that in early September we updated our third quarter and full-year GAAP EPS guidance to reflect

up-front payments related to the Infinity and Calico agreements, which were treated as specified items.
Also in accordance with the final regulations issued to the pharmaceutical industry in the third quarter by the IRS,
AbbVie has booked an additional year of its branded prescription drug fee, which we have treated as a specified item.
By way of background, starting in 2011, the pharma industry was required under the Affordable Care Act to begin
paying a fee based on branded prescription drugs sold to the U.S. government.
During the third quarter of this year, the IRS issued final regulations which changed the recognition of the fee from the
period in which the fee was paid to the period for which the fee is owed. As a result, the industry is now required from
an accounting perspective to recognize in 2014 one additional year of the fee. There is no cash flow impact of this
one-time adjustment.
Due to the timing of the termination of the Shire transaction, the majority of one-time costs related to that event were
reflected in our fourth quarter results.
Moving on to our outlook for the remainder of the year, this morning we significantly raised our adjusted EPS guidance
for 2014. We now expect adjusted earnings per share guidance of $3.25 to $3.27. As a reminder, our 2014 outlook
continues to exclude any potential revenue from the expected 2014 U.S. launch of our HCV therapy. Our revised
GAAP guidance for the year includes the full impact of the Shire transaction costs.
Given our strong product performance, we now expect sales to exceed $19.5 billion in 2014. We're forecasting an
adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 79% for the year, reflecting product mix and actions we've taken to
further improve our margin profile. We expect full-year R&D expense to be somewhat above 16% of sales as we
continue to advance our late-stage pipeline, and we expect SG&A expense of around 27% of sales in 2014. We are
forecasting net interest expense of about $250 million for the full year, and we continue to expect an adjusted tax rate
just above 22%.
As you know, our business generates significant cash flow and we expect this to grow in 2015 and beyond with new
product introductions. As a result, we announced last week that AbbVie's quarterly dividend will be increased by more
than 16% to $0.49, beginning with the dividend payable in February 2015. We intend to maintain our strong
commitment to a growing dividend going forward. And we disclosed a new $5 billion share buyback program to be
executed over the next several years, further reflecting our commitment to return cash to shareholders.
So overall, we're very pleased with our strong third quarter performance as well as our outlook for the remainder of
2014. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry.

Thanks, Bill. We'll now open the call for questions. Elan, we'll take our first question, please.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Chris Schott from JPMC.
<Q - Chris Schott>: Great. Thanks very much for the questions. I guess first one just for Rick, operationally AbbVie
seems to be obviously firing on all cylinders here. But with the Shire deal you highlighted the potential for greater
access to your cash flow as well as the diversification that deal would bring. So on those two topics, first can you talk
about your access to cash flow and your ability to deploy capital on an ongoing basis with your current tax structure
and the recent dividend increase? And then second on the business development side, what is the sense of urgency at
this point to further diversify AbbVie? And can you give us any color on the range of M&A options you are
considering. I guess specifically should we think of Shire as a one-off or would the company still consider pursuing

large-cap acquisitions? Thanks very much.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Okay. Hi, Chris. It's Rick. I think this question has come up a couple of times now, since
the termination of the Shire agreement and in the backdrop of the Shire agreement. And so, I think it's important to put
it in perspective and important to acknowledge that at the outset, there were certain attributes of the Shire transaction
that made it unique and out of the normal course of our M&A strategy. I'd say specifically, the potential for inversion is
only offered with target selections of very significant size, and the benefit of inversion allowed for an acquisition price
that was obviously higher.
So I think one of the things that you must remember as we approach the opportunity with Shire was against the
backdrop of where was AbbVie overall, because I think that's an important perspective to keep in mind. And if you
think about the prospects of our business, they were never brighter than they were when we approached the Shire
transaction. We had cleared most of our significant LOE events. Our growth brands are exhibiting extremely strong
growth, particularly HUMIRA; we've built a deep, mid and late-stage pipeline with several potential blockbusters
which we believe will allow us to drive top-tier EPS growth starting in 2015 and beyond. HCV is a good example of
that, 199 is a good example of that, daclizumab is a good example of that, and there are many more.
And while I think it's fair to ask the question, has our strategy, our M&A strategy changed following the Shire affair, I
think it's also important to acknowledge that we're a company that's in an even stronger position today than we were
before we announced this deal. Today's earnings show that very clearly. The base business is running stronger than our
guidance at the beginning of the year suggested to us. We have a much better idea of the size of the HCV market, and
our potential to stake out a significant position in that market.
We've had positive data readouts on dac, 888; 199 continues to perform well, and we've continued to be active in the
LNA front. So there are no developments really that have happened to our business. In fact, any development that's
happened has actually been a positive development. But don't leave us with a tremendous amount of confidence that we
can drive the level of performance that we have projected and the level of performance that we need going forward
from 2015 with our base strategy, which brings me to M&A.
If you look at our cash flow and our ability to access that cash flow, we clearly have the wherewithal to be active in the
M&A front. What's more is we have a track record and our ability and our willingness to pursue and acquire attractive
assets, assuming two things, it makes strategic sense and they have a good financial return. That's essentially the
criteria that we use. We've always said that our highest priority for our cash is to deploy it to further grow the business
and make the business more and more healthy going forward. And I think you can expect us to continue to do exactly
that, deploying cash to acquire attractive on-market and pipeline assets to further enhance our growth. But what I don't
think is that we absolutely have an imperative to run out and do another $50 billion deal. In fact, I would tell you we
don't have that imperative. And it's unlikely that we would do another $50 billion deal.
As I said before, Shire is a unique opportunity based on a number of different factors, some of which don't exist in the
same way as they did before. So the underlying growth prospects for AbbVie don't require us to do a transaction of that
size. I'd also say we're not going to limit ourselves to what we do. We look at individual products, we look at mid-sized
companies and we look at larger companies, and we're going to continue to do that and continue to look for those
opportunities that strategically fit and give us a strong financial return. And we'll deploy our capital accordingly.
The other thing I'd say is, we have always committed that we'll return cash to shareholders, and that's a commitment
that we've made as part of our cash. You saw us do that here recently with the dividend increase and the buyback
program, and those are the two priorities for the cash. The cash isn't trapped. Obviously, we have access to the cash for
offshore acquisitions. We have access to the cash if we choose to repatriate it. Obviously, we have an incentive to look
outside the U.S. first if we choose to, but we have total flexibility as it relates to our cash.

Thank you. Our next question is from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. Can you all hear me all right?
<A - Larry Peepo>: We sure can.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Okay. Great. Thank you. Congratulations on a terrific quarter. Maybe Rick, this is either for Rick
or Bill. But clearly 2015 is shaping up to be a huge year. I think 2014 turned out to be a much bigger year than you or
anybody else anticipated just given the profitability of the base business. But 2015 is really shaping up to be a very big
year with the Hep C launch. But as we move out beyond 2015 post the HCV launch, can you comment on the pace of
earnings growth? Obviously with biosimilar competition towards the end of the decade for HUMIRA that's going to
have an impact on your earnings growth. But will 2015 be a one-off year, or how should we think about the pace of
earnings growth going forward?
And then a second question for you, Rick. We have a lot more information now about the Hep C market. We now
know the pricing of the new Gilead combo. We've seen the spectacular initial launches of Sovaldi. Can you comment
on how I think early at one point you talked about achieving a 20% market share in this massive market, can you – will
you refresh us on your expectations just given how much more information we have now? Thanks very much.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Thanks. Well, Jami, this is Rick. So first, I'd say on the expectations for 2015 and
beyond, obviously we're not going to give guidance out multiple years, but I think I can frame it this way for you. If
you look at what we expect to be able to deliver out of our pipeline, including HCV and other assets like 199, we have
a high level of confidence that we can continue to drive strong growth over the long-term. As far as the biosimilar
impact is concerned, obviously that's something we have looked at and we have carefully analyzed, and we've had now
a number of years to put a strategy in place that we believe will protect HUMIRA through that period of time, and so
we've obviously modeled what that looks like, and I can tell you we have confidence in what we can do in that area.
I'm not going to give you a lot more specifics on that at this point. We've described in detail what it looks like, that it's a
combination of three major areas; product enhancements, both formulation as well as device, intellectual property and
commercial strategies, and this is a market we understand well, and as I said, I think we have planned this out very
well, and I think we have a high level of confidence in our ability to be able to execute that strategy in the face of
biosimilar competition. There will be a time where we can give you more color. I know this isn't very satisfying to you.
There'll be a time where we can give you more color. This just is not the time to be able to do that. We have to make
sure that we have planned this out appropriately, and so in the future we will be able to give you a little more detail
around that.
As it relates to Hepatitis C, what I would tell you is this; if you look at the Hep C market and HCV for us, it's a very
exciting opportunity, and I will tell you it's a very important opportunity for AbbVie. So let me say in the backdrop of
we're getting very close to entering the U.S. market once we're approved, it wouldn't be prudent for us to provide a lot
of specific details around our commercial strategy or our go-to-market strategy. But what I can do is, I think frame for
you how we think about the competition in the marketplace, how we think about the marketplace. I'm not going to
provide and expectation at this point but I'll give you some perspective I think.
As we've said many times before, we believe the clinical performance of our product across all patient types is very
strong, and it's especially strong in the cirrhotics and difficult to treat patients. And we believe that will be an important
factor in how we compete into the marketplace. We believe relapse rates and SVRs are important. We still don't believe
that minor differences in pill count or shorter duration of therapy in certain patients will significantly change the
competitive dynamics in this marketplace. In fact, I'd tell you in our interactions with many KOLs, they indicate that
they're going to go with 12 weeks of therapy in patients to minimize the risk of relapse in those patients.
As far as the market is concerned, to the point you made. We see the market as being even more attractive than we
thought about it a year ago. It's certainly bigger than we thought, it's far more receptive to high curate therapies that are
highly tolerable, and the market wants alternatives; that's clear. So I can tell you, we feel very good about our ability to
compete in this market and create meaningful share for our product. But as I said, I'm not going to go through a lot of
specifics around the commercial strategy until we've launched. The last thing I'd say is, as you know, the 2014

guidance we provided excludes any HCV revenues, so it's not counting on any HCV revenues. Whatever we get in
HCV will obviously be upside. But certainly when we provide 2015 guidance and product-specific detail, at that point,
we will provide you with what our expectation is for HCV for 2015. Thanks.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Jami. Our next question please, Elan.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Yes. Thanks very much. So I missed a little bit of the call, I just wanted to ask a couple
questions about some of the select product upside. I guess specifically, maybe you could just make an overall comment
on whether inventory levels changed at AbbVie between the end of the second quarter and the end of the third quarter,
i.e., was there a buy-in or buyout for the company overall?
And then second, were there any buy-ins for any select products of note? And then third, with respect to Kaletra
ex-U.S., I don't know if you commented, but that was unusually strong. Could you just explain that revenue number in
the quarter, and what we should think about for the fourth quarter ahead sequentially? Thank you.
<A - William J. Chase>: David, it's Bill Chase. So, inventory I'll discuss in really two different pieces. You've got
inventory at wholesalers, and then obviously you've got inventory in the retail chain. At the wholesaler level, our
inventories across all products in the U.S. was roughly consistent between quarter two and quarter three. The retail
channel is a little tougher to call, as you know. In Q2, we did see some speculative buying in advance of a price
increase around HUMIRA. We think some of that buying came out in Q3, although obviously it didn't mute the overall
performance of the brand to a meaningful extent. But in general at the wholesale level, everything was consistent
quarter-to-quarter.
From a Kaletra ex-U.S. standpoint, that product is subject to some volatility based on tender timing, and you saw that in
the third quarter. I think the long-term outlook for this brand is probably somewhat negative from a single-digit
standpoint, so I think what you're really seeing in Q3 was the anomaly of tenders internationally.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Got it. Thank you.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, David. Elan, next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Marc Goodman from UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Yeah, I was hoping you could give us a flavor for how much of the pre-spend for the HCV
launch is already showing up in the quarter here? And how much additional we should be expecting in the fourth
quarter and the first quarter? And then second, if you could just go through what data we will be seeing at ASH?
<A - William J. Chase>: So, Marc, Bill Chase. We're not going to get into specific details on how much of the HCV
investment we've put in. Suffice to say, we have obviously begun spending this year, and you would – you should
expect that spending to increase sequentially in the fourth quarter, and that's been reflected in the profile guidance
we've given.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Change in sales force, has that started already, or...?
<A - William J. Chase>: Excuse me?
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Sales force?
<A - William J. Chase>: We are all ready to go on HCV. We're just waiting approval.

<Q - Marc Goodman>: So that's already reflected in the third quarter?
<A - William J. Chase>: It is.
<A - Michael E. Severino>: On your question regarding ASH, this is Mike Severino. I'll take the question regarding
ASH. There's going to be a number of important presentations on ABT-199, our BCL-2 inhibitor. This includes initial
single-agent data in AML. And we'll also provide a number of updates on our ongoing earlier studies. An update on our
RITUXAN plus 199 study in CLL, including an update on patients who have stopped therapy. And we're going to have
first data on a chemo combination study of bendamustine plus Rituxan plus 199 in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and
DLBCL. And there will be a number of other updates including 199 and GA-101 and CLL from early phase studies.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Marc. Elan, we'll take our next questions.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Holford from Jefferies.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Hi. Thanks very much for taking my questions. So just on your HCV program you mentioned,
do you expect to bring [indiscernible] (34:54) at any point into your next generation program? And give us any updates
on how you think you might go about that if that's the case.
Secondly, around margins, as a result of some of the cost savings you would have looked at as part of the Shire
transaction going forward, did you see any opportunities in the base business going forwards that you can look at for
further margin enhancement? And then just lastly, this will be for Rick of course. Are you concerned that by
highlighting your underlying tax situation that you could have potentially made the company vulnerable to a takeover
by a foreign company going forward? Thank you.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: So, Mike why don't you cover the first question?
<A - Michael E. Severino>: Sure, this is Mike Severino. With respect to our plans for Hep C we feel very good about
both our current generation Hep C program and our next generation Hep C program, which is advancing very nicely
through the clinic. We're currently in Phase 2b studies with our next-generation program. That combines our next
generation protease inhibitor and our next-generation NS5A inhibitor. Things are progressing very well. We're going to
continue to evaluate these data as they roll out and we'll be providing updates in appropriate scientific settings over the
course of the next year. We're always looking at promising mechanisms in our early discovery efforts and we'll
continue to evaluate those efforts in light of the clinical results I described as well. Overall, though, I feel very good
about the progress we are making in Hep C, and I think we're going to have a compelling offering with first-generation
and it's an area that we are committed to and it's an area that we will remain active in.
<A - William J. Chase>: Jeff, on cost savings, I can tell you that this is an organization that has always focused on
driving cost out of the business. I think you can see that to an extent on the progress we've made on gross margin, and
certainly we keep our eye open for those things all the time. I think in 2015 if you look at some drivers behind the
business, the dynamics trend favorably for operating margin expansion. Obviously, the TriCor/Trilipix LOE event is
fully behind us at that point. You're seeing the efficiency efforts play out on gross margin, and we would obviously
expect a strong positive impact of the HCV launch, which offers both a high gross margin as well as SG&A profile
improvement. So, too early to get into a specific operating margin number for you for next year, but I'm confident we're
going to have a nice story to tell on this when we get into it next year.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: On your question about potentially being a takeover target, let me address it this way. If
you look at our situation about offshore cash, we're certainly not unique in our industry. In fact, I'd say, we're pretty
consistent with how our industry tends to operate. So I don't know that we flagged anything in the process. But
essentially, I'd tell you that our goal as a company is to stay a strong, sustainable, independent company. We've
demonstrated that we can drive strong shareholder value. You see that in the TSR that we've delivered, you see that in
our market cap. So I can tell you my focus is on driving the business at top-tier performance, building on our robust

Thank you. Our next question is from Colin Bristow from Bank of America.
<Q - Colin N. Bristow>: Good morning and congrats on the quarter. Just on Hep C, arguably you're most competitive
versus Harvoni in the treatment experience cirrhotics with the TURQUOISE-II data. Given your excluded prior
protease inhibitor patients, how should we be thinking about this from a labeling perspective? And can you just help us
quantify the size of this population?
And then just a little more on the label? I know it's hard, but how confident are you that you can get a 12-week label in
the treatment-experience cirrhotics and how important is this for you from a commercial perspective? It seems like the
FDA has a very high bar for the SVR sacrifice versus duration of therapy. Thanks.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: We're in the midst right now of dialogue with the agency over labeling. So we're not
going to – it's just not appropriate to talk about a lot of the specifics that we're talking through with them. I can tell you
we feel comfortable with our data set in cirrhotics and across all the other patients. We certainly feel comfortable when
we look at our 12-week and 24-week data in cirrhotics. Both have excellent SVR performance, and so we don't feel at
all uncomfortable with the direction that our labeling is going in. PI failures...
<A - Michael E. Severino>: Treatment – this is Mike Severino. Treatment regimens are obviously evolving
considerably. I think I'd point to the overall breadth of our data, both in cirrhotics and outside of cirrhotics. We feel
very good with our profile. We have very high SVR, very high curates, and again, we feel very good about the profile
that we see. I think that's probably...
<Q - Colin N. Bristow>: Okay.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Colin. Next question, Elan.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Good morning and thank you for taking the questions. Bill, could you please build on your earlier
comments about gross margin. What specifically are these margin-enhancing initiatives that you are referring to? And
is this what we can expect going forward, because we would only expect gross margin going up with Hep C. And as
follow-up, could you please give us an update about your efforts to simplify your current Hep C regimen with fewer
pills, please? Thank you.
<A - William J. Chase>: So, yes, Alex, regarding the gross margin line, a couple of things are at play on that line. First
and foremost, as you know, we have obviously lost TriCor and Trilipix, which had a higher-than-average gross margin
than the corporate rate. So that's some headwind we've actually been facing over the last couple of years, and you can
see we've negotiated that nicely. Offsetting that has been a couple of things. First of all, there is an impact of product
mix and pricing. But equally important, there have been efforts that we've put in place to reduce cost, and that can be
manufacturing cost, supply chain cost, as well as, of course, to address some of our royalty burden on HUMIRA as
well. And you're seeing some of that play out this year. Next year, obviously with HCV coming online, we would
expect that to have a gross margin that would be higher than the corporate mix. And HUMIRA obviously has been

performing very, very nicely as well, and that ought to have a benefit on that line item as well.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Alex, this is Rick. You kind of broke off when you said the last question. But I think
what you asked was what are we doing to work on simplifying the regimen for HCV, is that what you asked?
<Q - Alex Arfaei>: That's correct. Yes.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Okay. Well, let me start with what I commented on before. We don't believe the
difference in pill burden is going to be a competitive disadvantage. So first and foremost, I'd tell you that. The second
thing is we are working on some ways to be able to simplify our regimen with the current generation and those
continue to progress well. Next generation obviously has significant simplification associated with it as well, and that
will be an advancement as well. So we have an active program in both areas to move it forward. We're not at a point
where we want to talk a lot about it beyond that, but we are working on ways to simplify the regimen and continue to
make sure that we're advancing the regimen. This is a market that I can tell you we're absolutely committed to for the
long term. And obviously we're investing in a way to be able to continue to sustain our position in the market.

Thank you. Our next question is from Mark Schoenebaum from ISI Group.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for taking the question.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Sure.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: Number one, if I may. Do you guys happen to have data out there in the Hep C market
around how many patients are actually under the active care of a treating specialist? That's a data point that one of your
competitors historically has provided and declined to provide in the most recent quarter, just wondering if you have a
view on that.
And then number two on Hep C, have you generated yet any data for your regimen in Victrelis or Incivek failures? And
then finally on HUMIRA, could you just give us the year-on-year price versus the volume change, please? Thank you.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Thanks, Mark. As far as the data of the number of patients under active care with
specialist, I'm assuming you're talking about hepatologists and infectious disease specialists. Our people know that, but
to be honest with you, I don't know that number. Does anybody else in the room know that number?
<A - William J. Chase>: Yeah, I don't think we have that one for you, Mark.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: So maybe as a follow-up, we'll try to provide that. I can tell you that as we've geared up
commercially, we obviously believe that it's important and I've seen the numbers that a significant percentage of the
patients are under the care of specialists. But I'd also tell you that they're – based on the massive number of GI
specialists, that's also an important commercial channel to cover. And we have scaled our sales force to cover both
aspects of it, both specialists as well as GI physicians as well. But I don't remember, Mark, the actual split between the
two.
<A - William J. Chase>: Mark, on HUMIRA, you really have a tale of really two different markets. In the U.S., we
have typically been able to take some price along with the category. And if you really look at volume trends, script
trends, which this quarter were very, very strong, you can pretty much get back to the 25.3% growth on the quarter by
looking at that strong TRx and really reconciling it back to the price increases we've taken this year. Ex-U.S., we
typically see negative price, so ex-U.S. is primarily more than a 100% volume. On a total brand basis, I think you can
think of price this quarter netting out in the mid-single digits and the rest being volume.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: And the PI failures?

Operator
And our next question is from Steve Scala from Cowen.
<Q - Steve M. Scala>: Thank you. I have two questions. First on Hep C, AbbVie would appear to have a potential
competitive advantage in the sickest patients where treatment to 12 weeks might be necessary. And I know that AbbVie
isn't going to reveal pricing today, but given this possible competitive advantage, what are reasons that AbbVie would
not price at a premium? Maybe you can provide at least one reason why AbbVie wouldn't price at a premium.
And then second, a bit of a broader issue. AbbVie has done a terrific job maintaining HUMIRA's position as the
leading TNF despite very similar competitive products and very high price points. It seems that your competitors that
sell basal insulins and inhaled asthma products could have learned from your strategies. But as managed care seems to
be rotating among the big therapeutic categories and attempting to extract price, why won't we see this happen in
TNFs? Thank you.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Okay. This is Rick. I'll try to answer your two questions. Although I'd say your first
question basically asked me about our pricing strategy, which I'm not going to go into any detail. But I would say to
you is, we've looked very carefully at the overall market, how our product would be positioned in that market, our
ability to be able to take share and we've come up with a strategy that we believe optimizes our ability to take a
meaningful share position.
We've looked at alternatives that were different. Some of which similar to what you described and some of which
weren't similar to what you described. And so, we've come up with what our commercial strategy will be and we're
going to execute that upon launch of the product and approval of the product and at that point we'll provide you more
color.
On HUMIRA and payer actions, what I would tell you is this, we have competed in this market for a long, long time.
Obviously in the U.S. market, the payer component is a very critical component. It's an area where we have good
relationships with payers, there have been lots of competitive entrants into this market and I'd say predictions of
HUMIRA's market share erosion and that hasn't occurred. And it's partially because if you look at the product and its
ability to be able to perform clinically, if you look at the breadth of the menu of applications and indications that it has
that plays a very important role.
And so I don't see the payer dynamic changing significantly in anti-TNFs going forward. This has been a competitive
market for many years now and we've done quite well in that market and there's always price pressure and you have to
work through that in the appropriate way.
<A - Larry Peepo>: I would say, Steve, this is Larry, that we certainly feel good about how 2015 settled out for us
with payers on HUMIRA.
<Q - Steve M. Scala>: Thank you.
<A - Larry Peepo>: All right. Thanks, Steve. Next question, please?

Page 13 of 15
<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. A couple here. Just one, you recently announced this
$5 billion buyback program. Can you just let us know if you've already started executing on that program, and if so
how much buybacks have you completed this quarter? I guess specifically, I'm just wondering in terms of what your
share count expectations might be that are baked into your new 2014 earnings guidance, and is it a very different
number from what we saw at the end of the third quarter?
And the second one kind of following up on Chris's question earlier on M&A. You talked about size, can you talk a
little bit about maybe therapeutic areas that might be of a priority now, for example rare diseases where Shire is
obviously strong? Is that an area in particular that you may wish to invest more? Any thoughts around areas of
investment would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - William J. Chase>: So, Vamil, obviously the quarter's not done yet, the fourth quarter that is. We do intend to
when the year finishes you'll see that we have repurchased shares, but I can't give you exact guidance on what that
number is going to be at this point in time.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Vamil, on the M&A strategy, this is Rick, I mean I think if you look at what our strategy
is for AbbVie, we want to build leadership positions in specialty focused areas. If you look at what we're good at, what
we're really good at is taking products that have strong clinical data and the decision making process is driven around
clinical data and be able to go out and commercialize that effectively. And so, we really have two primary goals when
we look at M&A. One is to build out those areas where we currently have leadership positions like immunology as an
example and other areas where we have a leadership position, our goal is to try to restate standard of care in those
segments and in many cases we're looking at multiple different mechanisms of action to be able to try to do that
standard of care restatement in the areas that we have leadership positions in.
And then we have areas where we have emerging strengths where we want to build out leadership positions and expand
more aggressively. Oncology's a good example. 199 we believe will create a good anchor position for us in that market.
888, 414, we have a number of assets coming behind that. Certainly we would be interested in looking for more
oncology assets. If there was the right kind of opportunity with on-market products in oncology and had some
commercial infrastructure in place that would be attractive to us moving forward. Rare diseases is certainly a profile of
a specialty market that's consistent to what we look at, and I'd say hepatology is the other area that would be of strong
interest. I'm not giving you a complete list, but I'm giving you sort of the top-of-mind areas that we focus on.
<A - William J. Chase>: Vamil, one other thing. Bill Chase again. Just in the event that you were inferring something
through your question. Our increase in the guidance for the year is purely based on the business fundamentals as we see
them. We're not anticipating that being significantly moved by our buyback activity. Just wanted to be clear on that.
<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.
<A - Larry Peepo>: Thanks, Vamil. And Elan, we have time for one more question please.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question today is from Mark Purcell from Barclays.
<Q - Mark D. Purcell>: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. On HUMIRA can you help us understand the benefit
from the royalty roll-off in Q3 from the cessation of payments to Merck KGaA I think was in June and how that
schedule of roll-off changes going forward through the plan expiries in both U.S. and Europe?
Secondly, could you help us understand the size of the international shipment timing effect for HUMIRA in terms of
how much growth it took off the ex-US sales?
Third, the IL-17 is about to launch in psoriasis, I think it is about 15% of HUMIRA sales. Could you help us
understand the impact you feel those will have, or otherwise, on your business for next year? And then lastly on debt,
$9 billion of long-term debt, can you help us understand your plans to restructure that and obviously that's with respect
to potential capital employment going forward.

Page 14 of 15
<A - William J. Chase>: So Mark, on the dynamics in gross margin, I guess this is a simple way to think of it. We in
the quarter had about a one point headwind from – related to TriCor/Trilipix LOE event. Obviously, we made that up
and then some. Our ability to make that up was driven probably somewhat equally by product mix and cost efficiency
as well as including the royalty stack. I'm not going to get into specifics on how much that royalty stack impacted it,
what I can tell you though is, it's not all royalty stack. We have a lot of activities going on right now to streamline our
supply chain and our overall manufacturing base. In terms of as this thing plays out over the LRP, we've never been
specific on what the exact royalty stack is, some have estimated it is between 5% and 10%, we've said those are good
estimates. And one of the benefits of that royalty stack is it will be largely removed at the point that we lose exclusivity
on HUMIRA, so that's an important upside for the product when we come to that point in time.
In terms of the impact of international shipments on HUMIRA, obviously that put some volatility quarter-to-quarter in
the ex-U.S. HUMIRA number. This quarter it was about 1% it wasn't huge.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: Debt question?
<A - William J. Chase>: From a debt perspective, what I would tell you is we're pretty happy with our balance sheet
right now, and obviously building cash, we are looking at ways to deploy that cash whether it'd be through M&A or
giving it back to the shareholders as you've seen in our recent announcements. I don't think there is any compelling
reason to necessarily reduce the amount of debt on our balance sheet, so as those maturities come up, obviously we'll
be looking term those things out. But as a whole we think we've got a very, very strong balance sheet.
<A - Richard A. Gonzalez>: This is Rick. On the IL-17, obviously we study every new mechanism that comes into
this market and develop a strategy to deal with that mechanism going forward. We understand the IL-17 very well and
the data that we've seen so far. What I'd tell you is, if you look at many of the other mechanisms that have come into all
the different categories we compete in, whether it's RA or GI, or psoriasis, this is a tough market to break into and gain
significant share, because there is a reluctance to ultimately go to a new mechanism very quickly. These are very potent
drugs that have sometimes unknown side effect profiles until they're in large populations, and that tends to make
physicians more reluctant to switch en masse patients, and so we view IL-17 as a good mechanism. There's no question
it's a good mechanism, and – but we view it early on it will be like other mechanisms that have come into this market.
It will probably be more for failures, TNF failures, and eliminate some of that rotation that would have occurred, but
we don't assume that it's going to have a dramatic impact on our psoriasis share going forward.
