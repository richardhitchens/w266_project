MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by. Welcome to the CVS Caremark First Quarter 2013 Earnings
Conference Call. During the presentation, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Afterwards, we will conduct a
question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, Wednesday,
May 1, 2013.
I would now like to turn the conference over to Nancy Christal, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go

Nancy R. Christal
Thanks, Susie. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'm here with our President and CEO, Larry Merlo,
who'll provide an update on the business. After Larry, our Executive Vice President and CFO, Dave Denton, will
review financials results and guidance. Jon Roberts, President of PBM, and Mark Cosby, President of our Retail
business, are also with us today and will participate in the question-and-answer session following our prepared remarks.
During the Q&A, please limit yourself to no more than two questions so we can provide more callers with the chance to
ask their questions. Just before this call, we posted a slide presentation on our website that summarizes the information

you'll hear today, as well as key facts and figures regarding our operating performance and guidance. I encourage you
to take a look at that. Additionally, we plan to file our quarterly report on Form 10-Q by the close of business today and
it will be available through our website at that time.
During this call, we'll use some non-GAAP financial measures when talking about our company's performance, mainly
free cash flow, EBITDA and adjusted EPS. In accordance with SEC regulations, you can find the definitions of these
non-GAAP items as well as reconciliations to comparable GAAP measures on the Investor Relations portion of our
website. And, as always, today's call is being simulcast on our website and it will be archived there following the call
for one year.
Now before we continue, our attorneys have asked me to read the Safe Harbor statement. During this presentation, we'll
make certain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to
differ materially. Accordingly, for these forward-looking statements, we claim the protection of the Safe Harbor for
forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. We strongly recommend
that you become familiar with the specific risks and uncertainties that are described in the Risk Factors section of our
most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our upcoming Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
And now, I'll turn this over to Larry Merlo.
Larry J. Merlo
Well, thanks Nancy. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. Let me begin by saying that we are very
pleased with the strong first quarter results. As expected, the influx of new generic drugs was a key driver of our
year-over-year profit growth across the enterprise. And that said, both our retail and PBM segments delivered operating
profit growth well above our expectations for the quarter. And this out performance was driven by
stronger-than-expected script volumes due in large part to the strong flu season, strong specialty growth and favorable
purchasing and rebate economics.
Adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter came in at $0.83, that's $0.03 above the high
end of our guidance. And we also generated $1.3 billion in free cash flow and we remained committed to our
disciplined approach to capital allocation, continuing to focus on returning significant value to your shareholders
through dividends and share repurchases.
Now given our strong results in the first quarter and the fact that it is still very early in the year, we are narrowing our
guidance range for 2013 by raising the low-end of the range $0.03. And Dave will provide the details of our guidance
during his financial review. But please note that this guidance takes into account the expected impact on our Medicare
Part D business from sequestration. And it also includes costs in our Med D business associated with resulting issues
that arose following plan consolidation at the beginning of the year.
We now expect to achieve adjusted EPS for 2013 in the range of $3.89 to $4. And with these first quarter results, the
year is off to a great start.
So with that, let me provide a business update and I'll start with the PBM. As it relates to the 2014 selling season, it's
still too early to provide a specific update at this time. From what we've seen to-date, pricing remains competitive yet
rational and we continue to be confident that we are in a great position in the marketplace with our unique products and
services.
Our client interest in our Maintenance Choice offerings continues to increase. We now have about 16.3 million lives
covered by more than 1,200 plans that have implemented or committed to implement our Maintenance Choice
offerings, and that's up from 15.8 million lives at our last update, and up from 10.5 million lives this time a year ago.
Since we've introduced Maintenance Choice 2.0, a majority of this new growth is coming from this new plan option.
And if clients continue to look for ways to manage and control costs, Maintenance Choice continues to be an attractive
option generating savings of up to 4%.

Our flagship clinical program, Pharmacy Advisor is succeeding and moving a significant portion of PBM members to
optimal levels of medication adherence and a recent study showed that about half of members who were non-adherence
before participating in Pharmacy Advisor actually became adherent within a year of being in the program.
In addition, there was a 5.8% decrease in the prevalence of gaps in care for diabetics and we know that improving
adherence to prescription regimens can lead to significant savings and better health. And a recent CBO report late last
year estimated that a 1% increase in the number of prescriptions filled by Medicare beneficiaries would lead to a 20
basis point reduction in overall healthcare costs. And in 2012, we saved clients more than $643 million in their overall
healthcare spend as a result of improved medication adherence for chronic conditions and our Maintenance Choice and
Pharmacy Advisor programs contributed to these improved adherence rates and cost savings.
Now with all the change on the horizon, what are we hearing from our clients? Well, we just completed our recent
client advisory forum a few weeks ago. We had an opportunity to spend time with about 800 clients. Obviously, they're
very focused on the implementation and administration of the changes resulting from the Affordable Care Act, while
continuing to look for innovative ways to both lower costs and improve outcomes.
And with our integrated breadth of assets across retail pharmacy where we interact with 5 million customers a day, our
PBM as well as our MinuteClinics, we can engage with patients through our unique clinical programs to help drive
better outcomes. And we are very well aligned with the goals of health reform and well positioned to be an important
part of the solution.
Our clients are also looking for help in effectively managing the rapidly growing costs in specialty pharmacy. As we've
talked many times, it's projected that spending on specialty drugs will grow 20% annually, double from 2010 to 2016 to
more than $120 billion. And through a combination of technology, process, clinical programs, we are able to provide a
variety of solutions to help our clients effectively manage their specialty spend, while continuing to ensure access to
these medications for the patients who need them the most.
As an example our new specialty medical benefit program aims to apply effective drug management for that portion of
specialty flowing through the medical benefit. This is an area which has been largely unmanaged in the past due to the
lack of transparency and it poses significant challenges to both employers and health plans.
Now we recently acquired a technology platform that helps us identify and capture cost savings opportunities for
specialty drugs billed under the medical benefit and our focused specialty cost management will apply clinical at it,
accurate drug pricing, prior authorization and other targeted recommendations, including the most cost-effective site of
care.
In addition, growing competition in pharma across many of the specialty categories represents another key opportunity
for us to help manage client spend. If you look at categories such as growth hormone, hepatitis C, rheumatoid arthritis,
MS, we have opportunities to manage formularies and rebates so that our clients benefit.
And I'm happy to report that our specialty pharmacy business continued its healthy growth in the quarter with revenues
increasing nearly 20% versus the same quarter last year. And this specialty growth was driven by new PBM clients,
new product launches along with drug price inflation.
Now we've talked about the CMS sanction on our Medicare Part D prescription drug plan during our last earnings call.
We have been working closely with CMS to resolve the issues that arose after plan consolidation at the beginning of
the year. We submitted a plan of action to CMS, and we are making great progress against that plan.
Now, the sanction means that we cannot enroll new individual SilverScript members or market our SilverScript plan to
potential individual members until the sanction is lifted. And the sanction will be lifted when CMS is satisfied that the
issues are fixed, not likely to recur and clearly our goal is to have the sanction lifted before the next open-enrollment
period in the fall. And again, the timing of that decision lies with CMS.
Moving onto our retail business, we had another very strong quarter. Our goal is to retain at least 60% of the scripts
gained during the impasse between Walgreens and Express Scripts. And we are pleased with our results, which are
exceeding our expectations.

In fact, our retention rate has not changed much for the past several months, so at this point we believe we have
essentially achieved our steady-state retention rate and we remain very confident that we will continue to retain at least
60% of the scripts in 2013.
During the quarter, total same-store sales decreased 1.2% and that was largely due to the significant impact from new
generics on the revenue line. Pharmacy comps decreased 2.3%, however, script comps increased 2% when counting
90-day scripts as one and increased 4.7% when counting 90-day supplies as three scripts.
Our new generics had a negative impact of about 925 basis points on pharmacy comps in the quarter. And on the flip
side, we had a notable benefit from a very strong flu season from both flu-related scripts and flu shots, which positively
impacted pharmacy's same-store sales in the quarter by about 90 basis points.
As for the front-store business, comps increased 1.4%. The absence of leap day had a negative impact on the front-store
comps of about 120 basis points, while the timing of Easter had a positive impact of about 65 basis points.
During the quarter, front-store traffic was down slightly, while the average front-store ticket increased notably. And the
latest data shows that CVS has continued to gain front-store market share versus a year ago. When compared to drug
and multi-outlet competitors, our front-store share growth in the first quarter was 120 basis points and 10 basis points,
respectively.
Turning to our real estate program, we opened 52 new or relocated stores closed 9, resulting in 28 net new stores in the
quarter. And this puts us on pace to achieve our 2% to 3% square footage growth target for the year. MinuteClinic
recorded exceptional revenue growth in the quarter. Sales were up 50% versus the same quarter last year and this was
of course bolstered by the very strong flu season that we referenced earlier.
And in addition to treating acute patients in the quarter, we continued to develop wellness programs along with
programs aimed at monitoring chronic conditions and the growth that we've experienced in MinuteClinic's non-acute
services is helping to reduce the seasonality of the business.
We opened 9 net new clinics in the quarter, ending the quarter with 649 clinics in 25 states and the District of Columbia
and our expansion plans call for the opening of 150 clinics this year and to end 2013 with just under 800 clinics.
So, with that, let me turn it over to Dave for the financial review.
David M. Denton
Thank you, Larry, good morning everyone. Today, I'll give a detailed review of our first quarter results then I'll provide
guidance for the second quarter and update our full year 2013 outlook. But before I get to that, I want to highlight how
we've been enhancing shareholder value through our disciplined capital allocation program.
During the first quarter, we paid approximately $277 million in dividends and given our continued strong earnings
outlook this year, we remain on track to achieve our targeted payout ratio of 25% by the end of this year, two years
ahead of our original schedule.
Additionally, we repurchased approximately 7.4 million shares for approximately $393 million, an average price of
$53.24 per share. And we still expect to complete $4 billion of share repurchases for the full year 2013. So, between
dividends and share repurchases, we've returned approximately $670 million to our shareholders in the first quarter
alone and we continue to expect to return approximately $5 billion for the full year.
We generated approximately $1.3 billion of free cash in the first quarter and we've made excellent progress in reducing
our cash cycle. In fact, through the first quarter, we have taken nearly two weeks out of our cash cycle over the course
of the last nine quarters.
The improvement has been greatest within inventory, but all of the drivers have benefited from our increased
commitment from – to extracting value from our balance sheet. We remain committed to further improvements as we

look into the future.
Now given the issues we experienced following our Medicare Part D consolidation earlier this year, we may have some
timing issues with respect to CMS payables and receivables that affect our free cash flow delivery for this year. While
we are maintaining our guidance for free cash flow of between $4.8 billion and $5.1 billion this year, we are working to
offset this headwind to our free cash target and we'll update you on our progress on future earnings calls.
Now turning to the income statement, adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations came in at $0.83 per
share, approximately $0.03 above the high end of our guidance. GAAP diluted EPS was $0.77 per share, and as Larry
mentioned, the EPS beat was driven primarily by the higher-than-expected prescription volumes, due in large part to
the intense flu season, strong growth in specialty and favorable rebate and purchasing economics. These positive
drivers were partially offset by some below the line items, including higher-than-expected interest, a slightly higher tax
rate and more shares outstanding. These were obviously partially offset by the impact of the previously announced
Medicare Part D sanctions and the measures we have taken to resolve some of the issues we experienced following our
Med D plan consolidation on January 1.
Now let me quickly walk you through the results. On a consolidated basis, revenues for the first quarter declined by
0.1% or approximately $35 million to $30.8 billion. Revenues were essentially flat which compared very favorably to
our guidance for revenues to be down 2.5% to 4%. The increase in revenue in the PBM and retail segments were offset
by significant increase in inter-segment activity, primarily driven by the increased adoption of our Maintenance Choice
program.
Within the segments, PBM net revenues increased 0.1% or approximately $11 million to $18.3 billion. This growth
was approximately 180 basis points above the high end of our guidance. The out-performance was driven by
higher-than-anticipated claims volume, again primarily from flu and Maintenance Choice.
Specialty pharmacy was also a key revenue driver, primarily due to new clients, new products and drug cost inflation.
This was mostly offset by the significant impact from new generics. In fact, the PBM's generic dispensing rate
increased nearly 400 basis points versus the same quarter last year to 80%.
Revenues in the retail business increased 0.2% in the quarter or approximately $27 million to $16.1 billion. New
generic introductions also negatively impacted retail sales, with our retail GDR increasing approximately 310 basis
points, versus the first quarter of 2012, to 81%. The heavy incidence of flu and greater Maintenance Choice volumes
drove the out-performance in retail sales.
Now turning to gross margin: we reported 18.1% for the consolidated company in the quarter, an increase of
approximately 155 basis points compared to Q1 of 2012. Within the PBM segment, gross margin increased by
approximately 85 basis points versus the same quarter last year to 4.2%, while gross profit dollars increased
approximately 25% year-over-year. This increase year-over-year was primarily driven by the large increase in GDR,
higher volumes and better acquisition costs and rebate economics. These positive margin drivers were partially offset
by client price compression and costs in our Medicare Part D business associated with the issues that arose following
plan consolidation at the beginning of this year.
Gross margin in the retail segment was 30.9%, up about 230 basis points over LY. As with the PBM, this improvement
was driven primarily by the increase in GDR. Additionally, gross profit dollars increased 8.3% year-over-year within
the retail business. The improved GDR also had an impact on expense leverage, which was optically negative, while
growth of expense dollars was in fact within normal parameters.
Total operating expenses as a percent of revenue increased approximately 60 basis points from Q1 of 2012 to 12.6%,
while total SG&A dollars grew by 4.7%. The PBM segment's SG&A rate was flat to LY at 1.5%. This was primarily
driven by benefits and lower costs from the streamlining effort. Partially offsetting these favorable items were
investments in Med D related to our ongoing remediation efforts.
In the retail segment, SG&A as a percent of sales increased by approximately 85 basis points to 21.3%, while expenses
grew by 4.3%. As expected, this too was mainly due to the deleveraging effect of the growth in generics. Within the

corporate segment, expenses were up approximately $31 million to $199 million, primarily due to increased legal cost.
Now adding it all up, operating margin for the total enterprise improved approximately 95 basis points to 5.5%.
Operating margin at the PBM improved approximately 80 basis points to 2.7%, while operating margin at retail
improved about 150 basis points to 9.6%.
For the quarter, we beat our growth estimates for operating profit in both the retail and PBM segments. Retail operating
profit increased a very healthy 18.5%, exceeding expectations by approximately 7 percentage points. The PBM
business' operating profit was once again very solid, growing 42.9%, nearly 12 percentage points above our guidance
range.
Going below the line of the consolidated income statement, net interest expense in the quarter declined approximately
$6 million from last year to $126 million in the quarter. The debt refinancing we did in the fourth quarter was the
primary driver of this decrease.
Additionally, our effective tax rate was 39.2%, which was slightly higher than we expected. Our weighted average
share count was 1.24 billion shares, also a little higher-than-anticipated. Combined, the variance versus our
expectations and interest, the tax rate, and the share count, offset the over performance of this segment by about a
penny.
Now let me update you on our guidance, and I will focus on the highlights and you can find additional details of our
guidance in the slide presentation we posted on our website this morning. As we stated in the press release, we have
narrowed our EPS ranges to reflect our strong first quarter performance. Our revised guidance also reflects the cost in
our Medicare Part D business associated with resolving issues that arose following plan consolidation at the beginning
of the year as well as the estimated impact on our Medicare Part D business from sequestration.
With respect to sequestration, our understanding is that the 2% cut affects the direct subsidy payment received from
CMS for plan members, including both LIS and EGWP members. However, the cut only impact to our captive, wholly
insured PDP business, which represents about $3.6 million of our SilverScript Medicare Part D lives.
All things considered, we've raised the low end of our guidance by $0.03. We currently expect to deliver adjusted EPS
in 2013 in the range of $3.89 to $4 a share, reflecting excellent year-over-year growth of 13% to 16.5% after removing
the impact in 2012 related to the early retirement, the extinguishment of debt.
GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operation is expected to be in the range of $3.64 to $3.75. We have increased our
top line outlook and now expect consolidated net revenue growth of 1.75% to 3%. This guidance reflects the solid
performance across the enterprise year-to-date and the range is 100 basis points higher than our previous guidance due
to better volumes as well as specialty inflation.
Guidance for operating profit growth in our retail segment has been raised, while we have brought up the low end of
the range in the PBM segment. We now expect retail operating profit to increase 7% to 8.5% year-over-year and PBM
operating profit to increase 11% to 14%.
We now expect corporate expenses to be between $745 million and $760 million, a bit higher than our previous
guidance due to higher legal expenses. However, it is in line as a percent of consolidated revenue to our prior guidance
given the increase in revenue expectations. We are increasing our expectations for net interest expense for the year by
approximately $20 million to account for some capital leases, and we now expect between $495 million and $505
million of net interest expense.
We are increasing our weighted average share count forecast slightly to 1.22 billion shares up from 1.21 billion shares.
And as I said previously, our free cash flow guidance for the year remains in the range of $4.8 billion to $5.1 billion.
However, we are working to manage through some cash flow headwinds largely due to Medicare Part D, and I'm very
pleased with our significant cash flow generation capabilities, which should continue to play an important role in
driving shareholder value both now and well into the future.

In the second quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $0.94 to $0.97, reflecting growth of
16.25% to 20.25% versus the same period of LY. GAAP diluted EPS from continuing operations is expected to be in
the range of $0.88 to $0.91 in the second quarter.
Within the retail segment, we expect revenues to increase 0.75% to 2.25% versus the second quarter of LY. The
revenue increase will be driven by solid volume growth, dampened somewhat by the continued growth in generic
utilization. We expect same-store sales to be essentially flat with guidance for total same-store sales in the range of
negative 0.25% to positive 1%. Script comps are expected to increase in the range of 1.5% to 2.5%.
In the PBM, we expect revenue growth of between 0.5% and 1.5%, also impacted by volume growth that is dampened
somewhat by generics. Operating profit in the retail segment is expected to grow 7.25% to 9% in the second quarter,
while operating profit in the PBM segment is expected to grow 26.5% to 32.5%. So, expect another very solid quarter
as we look ahead.
And with that, I'll turn it back over to Larry Merlo.
Larry J. Merlo
Okay. Thanks Dave. And I think, as you just heard, as Dave described, this was a very solid quarter with strong
financial results across the board. And again, the year is off to a great start. We continue to be excited by the
opportunities to bring meaningful solutions to today's healthcare challenges and we strongly believe we are very well
positioned to do so.
And with that, why don't we go ahead and open it up for your questions?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question coming from the line of Dane Leone with Macquarie. Please
proceed with your question.
<Q - Dane Leone>: Hi. Congrats on a great quarter. Thank you for taking the questions. I was just wondering if you
could put out a ballpark EPS hit from sequestration just to help us understand how that hit flows through the P&L and
the direct reflection into the guidance update that you gave today.
<A - David M. Denton>: Yeah, this is Dave. I can answer that generally. We're not going to give a specific number to
that. I think what's important is that it doesn't affect all of our lives. It only affects those lives that are directly
subsidized by the federal government and part of our capitated program which is about 3.6 million members.
<Q - Dane Leone>: Okay. I guess we can work through the math there. This is more of a high level question, so not to
anyone specifically, but food for thought. We've seen a very tepid employment recovery in the U.S. Sequestration is
posing an additional headwind. We've seen the overall unemployment rate hold steady, but the labor participation rate's
been dropping, essentially implying that there would be more individuals on the [ph] uninsurance (30:29) population
right now and that's actually increasing. When you speak about the 50% rise in MinuteClinic, are you seeing a higher
amount of uninsured come through that clinic that's driving up demand volume there? And I guess maybe any broader
color on how you see the cyclical swings in unemployment impacting the business would be great.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, as it relates to MinuteClinic, actually it's the opposite. We're seeing a growing number of
MinuteClinic visits accompanied by some type of health insurance, which I think is really representative of the fact that
it becomes a high quality, lower cost option for employers, for health plans, and I remember in the early days we had
about 20% of visits that were covered by some type of insurance, that number is approaching – it's not there yet – but
it's approaching 90%.

In terms of the unemployment, I think we continue to see on the retail side a cautious consumer, and we continue to
look for differentiated ways to bring value to that consumer through our ExtraCare program. And I think on the PBM

Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please
proceed with your question.
<Q - Robert M. Willoughby>: Larry or Dave, can you comment just on the renewal process for Caremark's pharmacy
agreements with Walgreens, what's really changed in the dynamics here, what do you bring that's new to that table that
might afford you some leverage?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Well, Robert, I think that while we don't talk about specific contracts, okay, I think that we
have continued to work with all of the providers in terms of bringing value to the overall equation, in terms of
providing access, and at the same time ensuring that we are working on behalf of our clients to make pharmacy care
affordable. And I think that our management team has done a very effective job in that regard.
<Q - Robert M. Willoughby>: Any sense of how big Walgreens is in your pharmacy networks today from a volume
perspective versus three years ago?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah. We don't – we're not going to get into those specifics. We haven't disclosed that.
<Q - Robert M. Willoughby>: All right. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Matthew Fassler with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Thanks a lot. Good morning.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Two quick questions, if I could, on the PBM side. First of all, you maintained your claims
guidance for the year, I think despite a somewhat better first quarter. If you could talk about the drivers there, I don't
think sequestration would really factor into volumes but any color there would be great.
<A - David M. Denton>: Yeah, this is Dave. Sequestration will not factor into volumes. So I think what – as you saw,
we had a very solid first quarter from a volume perspective. I think we're only a few months into the full year, so I
think our trends look promising, but we don't see these trends as changing substantially other than the fact that we had
– again, had a very solid flu season for the first – January, February period.
<Q - Matthew J. Fassler>: Got it. That's helpful. And then secondly, just any updated views on the selling season
to-date and any impact that healthcare reform might be having on your clients as they think about switching, renewing,
et cetera.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah, Matt, this is Jon. And as we talk to our employer clients, they're clearly focused on
the administrative requirements for healthcare reforms. As an example, tracking hours for part-time employees. So, I
think as a result of that, we're actually seeing fewer RFPs in that part of the marketplace than we did a year ago. But

Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Steven Valiquette with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: All right, thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Good morning.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: A couple of questions here. First, just curious on the moratorium on the marketing for Part
D, just to clarify, does that apply just to SilverScript individual Part D or does that potentially impact some of the group
Part D EGWPs as well?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: No, it applies to the SilverScript. And keep in mind that we manage for our health plan
customers, their products, and this does not apply to that segment.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Okay. And then also just...
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: [indiscernible] (36:00) I'm sorry. This is Jon.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: All right, go ahead.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: The other thing I would add is on EGWP clients, they have people aging into their plans
throughout the year, and so we are able to administer that and enroll those people in Medicare.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Oh, sorry. [indiscernible] (36:20) for just a second there. Just a quick question on the
Medicare eligibles within the employer clients, the RDS or Retiree Drug Subsidy conversions to – I'm assuming you
would probably convert either to EGWPs or to individual Part D just given your footprint. But just curious kind of
where we stand on that process, whether most of that may have already occurred by 1/1/2013, or is some of that still
ahead of us for 1/1/2014?
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah, this is Jon, Steve. So, we did see some migration in 2013 to EGWPs. I think with
the advent of healthcare reform, I think employers are going to continue to -or will take a wait-and-see attitude to see
how the exchanges perform, but over time, we do expect to see a subset of the employer market either continuing to
move their members into EGWPs or moving them potentially directly into the exchanges.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Okay. That's helpful. Okay. Thanks.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Steve, just to add one further point of clarity as it relates to your Med D question around
SilverScript. So, we continue to work with employer customers who have an EGWP or who are planning to implement
an EGWP to keep them updated on the status of the sanctions. We cannot market, okay, to those EGWP clients until
the sanction is removed.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: All right. But most of those conversions presumably would happen on 1/1/2014, right, so
as long as you resolve this sometime in the next, call it, three to six months like you've talked about, it shouldn't really
impact the business at all as long as there's a decent lead time before 1/1/2014. Is that the way to think about that?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: That's correct, Steve, and as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we have made great
progress on our plan and that's exactly our goal, working closely with CMS.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Okay. Got it. Okay. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Tiffany Kanaga with Citigroup. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Tiffany A. Kanaga>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I'm calling from Deborah Weinswig's team. What do
you expect for the cadence of share repurchases for the balance of the year in order to hit your $4 billion full year
target?
<A - David M. Denton>: Tiffany, this is Dave. We're very committed to returning significant value to our
shareholders, both in the form of dividends and share repurchases. I think our share repurchases were a tad light in the
first quarter. We said that generally speaking that the cadence would follow the same pattern as last year. So, I would
anticipate if you just looked out and look at last year that cadence and compared it to kind of what's left of the
remaining of this year is probably the best way to model it at this point in time.
<Q - Tiffany A. Kanaga>: And can you give us an update on how digital initiatives are driving top line and margins
and how your strategy is evolving now that you've appointed Brian as Chief Digital Officer?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Sure.
<A - Mark S. Cosby>: This is Mark Cosby. I'll come from a couple of angles. Just overall digital, a number of new
things that have come into play over the course of the last little while. At the end of the last year, we updated our digital
site itself and that's significantly easier to use. We've also done a couple of things from a mobile standpoint that have
been big drivers for us. We launched a five-star rated mobile application towards the tail end of last year that is
performing very well for us.
And then most recently this last month, we came out with a version that's for the iPad, which is essentially a virtual
store. If you haven't used it, I'd encourage you to get on and try it. But it's also coming out with some rave reviews. So,
all of these things in addition to some other initiatives that we have coming forward are enabling personalization.
Digital is just one mechanism that we're using to drive that effort.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Tiffany, I'd just add one point. I think that some of the things that Mark is alluding to has really
advanced our digital capabilities, more from a utility or a utilization point of view versus a product point of view. And
we've gotten very high marks on – from consumers on some of the more recent releases in terms of how this is making
it easier for them to shop, both in the front of store, as well as the pharmacy.
<Q - Tiffany A. Kanaga>: Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed
with your question.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Good morning, guys. Thanks for the questions. Two things, Larry. So, when you think
about the renewal of the wholesale relationships with McKesson and Cardinal, what was the thought process behind
that, [ph] we're doing it (41:20) pretty basic, but the thought process, what you might be doing differently in those
contracts that you weren't before. And then promise of daily delivery; and then whether you're playing around with that
today?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, John, I mean, as you know, we remain one of the largest purchasers of pharmacy in the
country. We essentially buy all of our generics directly from manufacturers and consolidate the vast majority of brand
purchases with our wholesalers and then engage them for deliveries to our stores between – fill-in deliveries from our
own distribution centers. And we're pleased with the results of the wholesaler RFP and as was announced last week, we

have contracts with both Cardinal and McKesson. They both do a great job for us and we feel that we're getting the best
economics this way; it allows us to create, I'll say, the most efficient distribution network. And it also provides for us a
safe, continuous and cost-effective supply chain.
So, we have always looked at ways in which we can provide further innovation. And I'm sure that we've got some
pilots that are in the planning process. And, again, we are always open to ways in which we can take costs out of the
supply chain and we'll continue to push the envelope around that.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Is daily delivery a thing of interest to you?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Well, John, we've experimented with that in the past and we – keep in mind that the
arrangements with our wholesalers provide daily delivery today. And so, quite frankly, we're pretty pleased with the
process that exists today. But, again, we'll continue to push the envelope and look for new ways or perhaps changes in
the marketplace that create new opportunities.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: All right. And then lastly, just on the front end, would it be fair to say front end gross
basically flat and if you then think going forward – because we keep hearing rumblings, competitive activity picking up
a little bit, a lot of people aren't happy with their traffic. What do you see now and where do you think that goes if
traffic remains light for a lot of these guys, a lot of your competitors?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Look, John, maybe I'll start here and then ask Mark to jump in. And the first quarter was – on
front traffic it was probably a little lumpy. We had acknowledged it was down overall. We got some benefits from the
flu season early in the quarter, but that was compromised by a lot of uneven weather patterns and then of course we
were going up against having an extra day last year from leap day. And I'll let Mark talk about some of the things that
his team is working on, acknowledging that we continue to have this cautious consumer who's looking for value.
<A - Mark S. Cosby>: I think the other thing just to add, and Larry had it in his comments, was that the share, you
know we picked up share in both in drug world as well as outside in the multi-unit world. So from that perspective it
was good. And the number one thing we're working on in the front to get traffic into a better place, falls under the
headline of personalization.
I mentioned a few things when we talked about digital earlier, but it's all about providing unique engagement to
customers for all the ways that they use us: from service to product to promotion. ExtraCare is the piece – really the
centerpiece of all that.
As you know, we have a 15-year history with that program. It's very effective and we know through that 15 years that
it's more than just issuing cards. That's the easy part. It's about the data that we use and how we engage with customers
given what we know and been very successful over years, but not resting on our laurels.
We had a couple of programs coming out over the course of the last couple of years that have been effective for us.
This Beauty Club that launched has been very effective. We also just two months ago launched a Pharmacy & Health
Rewards program, which is about encouraging adherence, retention and acquisition. And then the biggest thing that
we're doing that we talked about at Analyst Day was this program we call [ph] Conversion (46:07), which is
customer-specific opportunities to drive frequency basket and profit growth.
Two real drivers there, what we call [ph] Pure Conversion (46:09) is getting customers who are in our stores today to
buy more broadly across the store. And then the other piece that we call Share of Wallet, which is about getting people
to buy deeper within categories that they already purchase in and both of those types of offers started a couple of
months ago and have been extremely successful for us.
As a subset of that, we're looking at ways to deliver more opportunities to our customers. We've doubled the number of
emails that we send out to customers, both from a subscription perspective and in terms of an offer perspective. And
probably the biggest headline is what we're doing with this ExtraCare Coupon Center or what our bloggers call the
magic red coupon machines.

And the reason customers love this program is because they get the coupons before they shop as opposed to after they
shop, which leads to three to five times the redemption of a normal receipt at the end of a transaction and then actually
15 times the redemption of what a normal SSI coupon would drive. And that has led to 40% increase in the number of
offers and engagements of our customers within the store. So all of this falls under the headline of personalization;
that's just a tidbit of what we're working on. But those are the big things that we believe will drive both sales and
profits, provide true differentiation versus what other folks are doing and will allow us to build on it over time.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Hey John, let me just underscore one point because we've gotten a lot of questions because the
loyalty space is a lot more active today than it was a couple years ago. And Mark mentioned that issuing the cards is the
easy part and we know that because we've probably issued more than 300 million cards over the life of ExtraCare. But
what's a lot harder is driving real changes in consumer behavior and I think that Mark outlined an awful lot of activities
that we have underway that really allow us to optimize our promotion and maximize incremental sales to drive share in
a very effective and efficient pattern. And we have not seen any declines in our ExtraCare activity as a result of some
of our competitors getting into the loyalty space.
<Q - John E. Heinbockel>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Okay. Next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Yeah, good morning. Have a couple questions. First of all on the selling season; Jon, I think
you talked about the fact that the overall dollars are up a little this year despite the fact that RFPs are lower. So, can you
talk a little bit more, can you expand on what type of clients are you seeing this year, and yesterday it was reported that
you won BlueCross BlueShield contract. Are you expect to see more movement within the managed care side?
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah, Ricky, so we have seen some health plans early on. I'm not sure you'll see a lot
more moves this late in the season, but CareFirst was a good example of a very sophisticated health plan. Very pleased
to have been awarded the business for a 1/1/2014 start and it's a full service contract for retail mail and specialty. So
that being said, it's still early in the season and we'll have more to say on our next call about how things are going. But
fewer contracts, so I think the contracts that are out there are obviously bigger if the dollars are slightly up.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: So, should we assume that it's just bigger contract or not necessarily, a large employer but
more -
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah. I think you could assume that.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Ricky, I think one of the things that we heard at the client forum that I alluded to, was that
clients are very consumed with input – we're doing all the things that need to be done as part of the implementation of
the Affordable Care Act in January. So, I think we walked away with the sense that maybe there is some – people have
a lot on their plates right now.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay. And then one technical question. When we model the impact from sequestration and
there's the costs that are associated with Part D, how should we think about it kind of like where would it flow through
your P&L? Does it flow through the PBM segment? And if so, should we adjust kind of like the top line for
sequestration and then cost of goods for Part D?
<A - David M. Denton>: It does. Ricky, keep in mind that it was effective I think April 1, so it's really a nine month
effect to it. I would say from a modeling perspective, it's probably – you're probably not going to see it, it's just not big
enough to call out that much.

<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay. So based on the numbers that you gave at the beginning of the call, I mean, we kind
of like, did a back of the envelope and got somewhere around kind of like the $0.02 to $0.05 range. So, are we in the
ballpark or is the impact even more muted than that?
<A - David M. Denton>: Ricky, I can't comment on that. But I think what would be important to do is, kind of go back
and understand the fact that it covers nine months, it affects only the direct subsidy that we receive from the federal
government for our SilverScript plan. And if you just kind of went back and look at the national bid, look at the
member premiums and kind of do the math, you could kind of get into the amount that's affected by the 2%. So, I'd
encourage you maybe to do that math.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - David M. Denton>: Yep. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Ross Muken with ISI Group. Please proceed with the question.
<Q - Ross J. Muken>: Thanks. So, you guys have had a number of sort of new innovative solutions on the PBM side
over the last couple months with the 2.0 program and sort of what you're doing around specialty and specialty retail. I
mean, where are you seeing the most interest from the customer base, particularly on the employer side for some of
these offerings?
And then also on the exchange side, as you think about some of the sort of reform coming down the line, how do you
feel like MinuteClinic is kind of playing into that piece and do you feel like that, that strength there gives you any
advantage for that sort of opportunity?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, Ross, let me start here and then Jon will jump in. But, again, just coming back from our
client forum a few weeks ago, I was very excited in terms of, some of the things that you have mentioned, whether it's
Maintenance Choice 2.0, all of the specialty initiatives that we have underway and as well as the interest in
MinuteClinic, I came back and said, the things that we are working on are very, very much aligned with what clients
are most worried about and looking for solutions. And I will let Jon pick it up from there to get a little more specific.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah, so when we talk to clients on what their priorities are, it's obviously managing cost
for both the plan and the number. So, I think that's why Maintenance Choice has been so embraced by the marketplace.
And Larry talked about the growth from where we were in 2012 up to 16.3 million members in 2013. Combined with
Maintenance Choice we're seeing interest in narrow networks, preferred networks. Again, I think clients are looking for
ways to manage their direct costs.
The other thing that clearly is a top priority is specialty. And we have talked about the trends in specialty, the clients are
seeing that it's becoming a bigger part of their overall drug spend, and half of it is somewhat hidden under the medical
benefit. So, as we talk to clients about our capabilities to manage specialty across both pharmacy and medical, there's a
high level of interest. And we actually have employer clients that are working with us with their health plans to move
programs forward to manage that.
And I think the last thing I'll mention is, employers get the value of keeping their members on medication and lowering
overall healthcare costs. So, that's really our Pharmacy Advisor program and everything we're doing around adherence.
The fact that we've expanded. We now have 10 conditions on our Pharmacy Advisor program. We now have Pharmacy
Advisor in Medicare to help our clients with their Stars programs.
And then just to add to what Larry said around MinuteClinic, for our clients we can offer a reduced co-pay or a zero
co-pay for their members. So, we're able to extend the benefits to their members at no additional cost, make primary
care more accessible for them. So, it's really a win, win, win. But that's what we're hearing from our clients around
what their priorities are.

Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Great. Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Good morning, Lisa.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Larry, I was wondering if could you maybe give us your initial thoughts around ACA from the
drug retail side and maybe if Mark wants to chime in, are you signing early preferred type relationships on the retail
pharmacy side, whether it's with managed care entities or some of the private exchanges? How should we think about
retail in 2014, 2015, as these exchanges are rolling out?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Well, Lisa, it's a great question and obviously there are an awful lot of discussions taking place.
And I would talk about the fact that those discussions are being had at CVS Caremark, that we can do much more than
just provide a retail distribution point for exchanges in their members. And it really picks up where Jon left off in terms
of an awful lot of very robust conversations in terms of the role that retail pharmacy plays along with the role that our
MinuteClinics play when you think about providing primary care and chronic care support. So, I think we're probably
still a little early to talk about anything definitive. But an awful lot of interest in terms of what CVS Caremark can
offer.
I think specifically as you think about retail, I think that if you go back to the implementation of Medicare Part D, I
think pharmacists across the country played a key role in terms of educating and helping seniors enroll in the Medicare
Part D program. And I certainly see a role that our pharmacists can and will play around education and information for
members or potential members as they think about what it is that they're going to need to do to enroll in exchanges.
And we're certainly looking to be very active from an education and information perspective.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: So Larry, would you anticipate that we will see – we have talked to some of the managed care guys
that have said, hey there's 68,000 retail pharmacies, we probably don't need that many. They can envision doing maybe
half of the retail pharmacies and having someone like a CVS as an anchor. Are those the conversations that you're
having at this point and do you think that's the direction it'll move in or is it too early to say, because we're very early in
the discussion?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, I think it's still too early. I think that the discussions that we've had probably across the
gamut of all different possibilities. My sense is that at least for this first year, it's going to be a learning laboratory for
everyone. And I think that there's probably – my sense is that there'll probably be a little more conservatism in terms of
how people think about it until some of those learnings kick in and people can be perhaps a little more definitive in
terms of where the market is headed.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Okay. Great. I guess my second question just would be around specialty. Clearly great growth in
specialty, continues to be something that plan sponsors are looking for. Can you help us understand how many of your
customers buy specialty from you today on the PBM side, so what are the future opportunities? One, is it expansion to
the rest of your PBM customers? Two, opportunities for restrictive networks around specialty? How do we think about
that opportunity over the next couple of years? Thanks.
<A - Mark S. Cosby>: Yeah. So Lisa, I would think about it in two buckets. One is with our employer clients, the vast
majority of employer clients have exclusive arrangements with us around specialty. So, all of their specialty spend is
going through our channel. With health plans, they tend to take an approach of having several specialty providers and
we work with those health plans to make sure that we're getting not only our fair share, but with our capabilities, more
than our fair share. And then, and so they may limit it two providers to half a dozen providers.

And then you have the open market where those numbers can really go really anywhere. And I think that links into
what we're doing with our integrated specialty solution. And we've got people that are calling on these specialty
physicians talking about our capabilities and working with them to get those referrals into our channels, because we're
easy to do business with, for the physician and for the member.
So, I think you are going to see – we think specialty is going to be one of the fastest growing areas, because if you look
at the drug pipeline, in 2016 eight of the top ten drugs by revenue are going to be specialty. That's clearly where
pharma is focused from a pipeline perspective. And I think you're going to see not only new drugs in the same
categories, but I think you're going to see the expansion of drugs into new categories of specialty.
So, I see tremendous growth which is why we are as focused as we are on a holistic approach and solution to specialty,
so that we can manage the member as they progress in their disease state from a pharmacy benefit to a medical benefit
than in managing appropriate care, appropriate therapy and making sure they're getting their specialty meds at the most
cost effective site.
<Q - Lisa C. Gill>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays Capital. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Thank you very much for taking my question. I think I'm still a little bit confused about the
things you expect to happen in Medicare Part D at the end of the year. Obviously, there's sequestration. I think you've
been clear about which of your members will be impacted by it. I guess, I'm a little less clear about the guidance you've
given and how – what that reflects in terms of the sanction from CMS. Is there something in your guidance that is
assuming some probability that you don't get this resolved before the next selling season? Or are there just other costs
associated with that in the numbers?
<A - David M. Denton>: Yeah, Meredith, first and foremost, I think that is largely of 2014 topic as it relates to our
ability to accept auto assignees in the back half of the year. So it's not really more, but it's not really a 2013 issue, it's
more of a 2014 issue.
Clearly, our guidance is comprehensive of all the cost and effort that we think is required to, one, correct the situation,
and two, ensure that the situation will never happen again, and three, go through any remediation effort that we need to
get done to make sure that our members are served appropriately and CMS is satisfied that we are fully in compliance
and we have no issues.
And, finally, it does assume that we're not adding any additional lives, because we at this point in time cannot mark it
from a SilverScript perspective and so there is no lives being added to our book. In fact lives, due to attrition, are
slightly declining month over month.
And it maybe – Meredith, the sequestration question keeps coming up. So maybe I'll take a step back and give you a
little bit of color on that. And just to put this in perspective, sequestration as it relates to our SilverScript insurance
business for the nine months, is probably going to impact us to the tune of $0.01 to $0.02, somewhere in that ballpark is
probably a good estimate at this point in time. As it relates to...
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Well...
<A - David M. Denton>: ...again, that's the effect of government sequestration on our business for this year.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: So, I guess I'm just still struggling to understand. You've had a fantastic first quarter and
congratulations. And guidance for the second quarter is above where the Street is. So, I'm just kind of struggling to
know why the year didn't change. It's not very big impact from sequestration, unless you think the cost in terms of the

sanctions are going to go up substantially. You've obviously had some...
<A - David M. Denton>: Well, Meredith a couple of things. First and foremost, we've said very clearly that our
performance for this year is going to be somewhat front-half loaded versus back-half loaded due to the influx of
generics and the timing of the break-open status of those generics. And so you're seeing that play out.
Secondly, we do – as we said, we do have some costs in the back half of the year and the first half certainly through the
first quarter a lot of that was related to the incidence of flu volume being pretty high, driving volume. We're again just a
few months into the year. I think our outlook looks very solid. But I think it's just too early to predict kind of how the
rest of the year is going to play out. We're very comfortable with where we stand, but we're – I think as you know,
we're one quarter in to a four quarter year and we're going to play this out.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: That's very helpful.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: And Meredith, as you know, we have not raised guidance based on first quarter results, okay,
for the reasons that Dave mentioned in terms of, we still have most of the year still ahead of us. And as Dave
mentioned, we remain very confident in our guidance and outlook for the year. But that's something that we'll continue
to obviously talk about as we get more of the year behind us.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Thank you. That's really helpful. Much appreciated.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Okay. Thanks, Meredith.
<A - David M. Denton>: Thank you, Meredith.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Hi, good morning, and nice quarter.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Thank you.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Dave, just to start off, a quick question for you on the free cash flow guidance. I guess the
tone of your voice sounds like maybe there is a little risk around that, if you can't mitigate the CMS stuff. Is that fair?
Are we talking about a material number or is it small?
<A - David M. Denton>: Well, I think as you know we had – we're not changing our guidance from a cash flow
perspective. I mean, as we said, clearly at the first of the year we had some systems issues that affected our Medicare
Part D business and the result of that is really changing where we anticipated our receivables and payables to be at the
end of this year with the federal government. And so, it's really more of a timing issue as it relates to 2013 versus 2014.
I'd say, we're working hard to offset those and we're optimistic that we can do that, but I just want to make sure that
everybody understands where we stand at this point in time.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Okay. Great. And then Larry, just a question for you on adherence, you talked about the
savings. My question for you is sort of how do you really measure that? How do you market that to clients and actually
get paid for it? Is it just in your scripts or is it in additional PBM wins or is there some other way?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah, Ed, let me start then. Again, Jon will jump in here. But we have built a Pharmacy Care
Economic Model, where we can actually evaluate on a client-by-client basis, looking at claims. The opportunities that
we believe we have to improve adherence and a corresponding benefit in terms of overall healthcare costs. And we're
actually beginning to guarantee savings associated with that. And quite frankly, it's very consistent with what you're
seeing in the Star ratings in the Medicare program, okay, in terms of this aspect of clinical, if you will, being a
component of that evaluation.

<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah, and just – this is Jon. To add to that, PBM traditionally have managed bad trends
and we continue to do that and clients want us focused on that. But they also realized that good trends or having their
members take more medication lowers overall healthcare cost. So, we're able to as Larry said, go into a specific client
and with the Pharmacy Care Economic Model show what – where their members are, what the opportunity is and if we
get them in here what their medical savings are. There's buy-ups for certain programs and we guarantee returns for their
investments.
And clearly, when you say, are we seeing more wins in the market. As the market moves to taking more risk for overall
healthcare costs, we believe this program offers a competitive advantage. And we publish our results around Pharmacy
Advisor in peer-reviewed journals. Troy Brennan, I think has done a terrific job, our Chief Medical Officer, in
validating our activities and publishing those results, so that they are credible from a client perspective. So, I think that
does lead to more wins in the marketplace, particularly for those clients that are assuming more risk with healthcare
reform.
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: And, Ed, I think what we're talking about here is really the beginning of what will be a new, I'll
call it reimbursement model, okay. That really ties to outcomes management, people have been talking about this for
years, but no one's figured out a way to quantify it. And we believe – not believe, we know we're on the leading edge of
actually building the underpinnings with which to do that, okay, as we go forward. And I think that we're probably in
the first or second inning of the nine inning game here, but we believe that this is a big idea in where the market needs
to head when you think about the rising costs of healthcare and what clients are expecting from us. And, quite frankly,
what they pay us to do for them and their members.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Great. Thank you.
<A - David M. Denton>: Maybe, we'll take two more questions, I think.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Tom Gallucci with Lazard Asset Markets. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Tom Gallucci>: Good morning, guys, thanks for sticking around for those of us at the end of the queue here. I
guess, first question is on the purchasing and the rebate economics. I'm not sure I heard you really get into what some
of those drivers were. Are we talking about some of the formulary changes that you made or other benefit design
changes that the clients are making? Can you help us understand where that's coming from?
<A - David M. Denton>: Again, we continue to – this is Dave, and I'll ask Jon to chime in here a little bit. We
continue to push each and every day on how to lower cost for the clients and members that we serve. Part of that is
through how we go back and work with either branded manufacturers or generic manufacturers to lower cost or
increase the rebate yield. And I think we continue to be pretty successful in that area. And this is probably not one
answer at the end of the day. There is a lot of things that are across our business that we're doing. Whether that be
changes in our formulary, whether that be changes in our UM program, whether it be how we tailor our programs to
drive value in this area.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Yeah. And – so, there is two ways to drive value. One is through rebates, which the vast
majority of that value gets passed to our clients and we do that through our formulary strategy, which has been very
successful. And making sure appropriate branded drugs are available, but we negotiate very aggressively with
manufacturers to bring the net cost down for our clients.
The other thing is, with all the generics that have come to the market over the last couple of years, there are now, in
most therapeutic categories, enough generics that provide appropriate level of care. So, we also have available for our
clients, what we describe as a value formulary which limits even further branded drugs that are available and boosts the
overall generic fill rate across that clients book-of-business and deliver savings in that way.

So, we offer programs that have a lot of flexibility that deliver a lot of savings and value for our clients and we continue
to work very hard to bring them new value each and every year.
<Q - Tom Gallucci>: Okay. Thank you. And then another topic, you've touched on a little bit, but I was wondering if
you could go a little more in depth. Hearing a lot more out there especially with some of the competition about sort of
having the medical benefits and the pharmacy benefits under one roof to more effectively manage particularly the
specialty area. I thought it was interesting, I think in CareFirst's release, they talked about your supported integrating
pharmacy data and their data. Can you talk about some of your capabilities and how you sort of sell against the
in-house model in this area?
<A - Larry J. Merlo>: Yeah. So, our capabilities allow us, and I'll talk about CareFirst because we think supporting
our clients in this integrated model makes a lot of sense. And PBM is traditionally managed specialty under the
pharmacy benefit and the health plan has managed specialty under the medical benefit. And as that member moves
across those benefits, there's handoffs that have taken place. So, our capabilities now allow us on behalf of CareFirst, to
manage that specialty part of their spend and those members much more effectively than they were in the past.
I think as a standalone PBM, we can do the same thing and we can integrate with employers' health plans to do the very
same thing. So it really, with large employers they have multiple health plans, so we think our model resonates because
they have one provider managing that overall spend. With the smaller employers that may have a single health plan, we
think partnering with our health plans to provide those same services makes sense for that book of business too. So, we
can support both ways and we think both ways are very effective.
<Q - Tom Gallucci>: Thank you.
<A - David M. Denton>: Let's take our last question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our last question coming from the line of Eric Bosshard with Cleveland Research. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: In your prepared remarks you talked a couple times about favorable rebate economics. I'm
curious, if you could give us a little bit of color, or further color, on what that is referring to. And also interested if the
generic payback period, and where that trend goes from here in terms of the generic benefit, how that should play out
from here as we work through this year and into next year?
<A - David M. Denton>: Well, this is Dave, Eric. Maybe I'll kick it off and ask Jon. Again, I think from a rebate
perspective, again, it's a lot of little things that we're doing across our book of business to drive favorable economics for
our clients. And this gets back to very specifically focusing on the formulary versus specifically focusing on the UM,
leveraging all the programs that we have in place to drive value for our members and the clients.
And that drives again rebate performance, that drives back a little bit to reducing cost of goods sold for our clients. And
we shared some of that. I think from a generics perspective we're in a very heightened time period, which the generic
utilization continues to expand. The generic pipelines do look robust quite frankly for the next several years. We're
working very effectively across our book of business, not only to drive economics in generics, but also improve
performance from a generic contrition adherence perspective. And I think all of those drive value for us and for our
clients.
<A - Jonathan C. Roberts>: Eric, let me just add one point to what point Dave mentioned and it goes back to the
formulary, because we still get questions every now and then. We had a lot of noise two years ago, when we made the
formulary changes that as we've acknowledged many times that the strategy was absolutely spot on and I think that
your question is really an extension of what clients are now experiencing at the benefit of that strategy. I think what we
had acknowledged was right strategy. We needed to do a better job from an execution point of view, largely tied to the
timing of the communication. So the clients have certainty around the new plan year and all the changes that would

take place. So that was a good learning for us. But I think that we're seeing the financial benefits of that as we speak.
<Q - Eric Bosshard>: Great. Thank you.
Larry J. Merlo
So, listen, I'll just wrap up here. And we certainly appreciate everyone's time today, appreciate the questions. I think the
questions have been very much aligned with where we're making investments in the business, investments that are
aligned with our clients' expectations and needs. And while we know we have many challenges ahead of us in the
healthcare space we are certainly excited by the opportunities that we have to bring meaningful solutions. So, thanks
for your time again this morning and we'll talk to you soon.
