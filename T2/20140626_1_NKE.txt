MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Nike's Fiscal 2014 Fourth Quarter Conference Call. For those who need to
reference today's press release, you'll find it at http://investors.nikeinc.com.
Leading today's call is Kelley Hall, Vice President, Treasury and Investor Relations. Before I turn the call over to Ms.
Hall, let me remind you that participants on this call will make forward-looking statements based on current
expectations, and those statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ
materially. These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports filed with the SEC, including Forms 8-K, 10-K and
10-Q.
Some forward-looking statements concerning future orders that are not necessarily indicative of changes in total
revenues for subsequent periods due to mix of futures and at-once orders, exchange rate fluctuations, order
cancellations, changes in the timing of shipments, discounts and returns, which may vary significantly from quarter to
quarter. In addition, it is important to remember a significant portion of NIKE, Inc.'s continuing operations, including
equipment, NIKE Golf, Converse and Hurley, are not included in these futures numbers.
Finally, participants may discuss non-GAAP financial measures, including references to wholesale equivalent sales.
References to wholesale equivalent sales are only intended to provide context as to the overall current market footprint
of the brands owned by NIKE, Inc. and should not be relied upon as a financial measure of actual results. Participants
may also make references to other non-public financial and statistical information and non-GAAP financial measures.
Discussion of non-public financial and statistical information and presentations of comparable GAAP measures and
quantitative reconciliations can be found on NIKE's website, http://investors.nikeinc.com.
Now I would like to turn the call over to Kelley Hall, Vice President, Treasury and Investor Relations.

With that, I'll now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc.'s President and CEO, Mark Parker.
Mark G. Parker
Thank you, Kelly, and hello, everybody. Fiscal 2014 demonstrated a point I often make, and that's when we innovate,
we just don't innovate for the sake of change, we innovate to change the game. And that's what we did throughout the
year. We introduced great products, launched new consumer experiences, expanded our digital ecosystem and
developed engaging retail concepts that drove excitement and energy for our brands in the marketplace.
By staying true to the NIKE spirit, we continued to deliver great results like those we're reporting today. Here are the
fiscal 2014 highlights. NIKE, Inc. revenues grew 10% to nearly $28 billion. Gross margin increased 120 basis points to
44.8%. SG&A rose 12%, reflecting continued strategic investments in our brands and operations. And despite
significant currency pressure, diluted EPS rose 11% to $2.97 for the full year.
We're proud of those results we delivered in fiscal 2014, but more than that, we're proud of the consistent level of
growth we've been able to deliver over the years. As we continue to get bigger as a company, I'm often asked how can
NIKE continue to grow. Well, first and foremost, there's absolutely no shortage of growth opportunities for NIKE. This
has never been as clear to me as it is today.
When I look within and across our five brands, six geographies and eight categories, I see tremendous untapped
potential. And this includes areas where we can build on our current foundation, such as apparel and women's and
Converse, as well as areas where we can extend our current leadership position, such as running, basketball and
football. The key to unlocking this potential is and always has been to focus on the consumer.
Our relationship with the consumer is something we need to earn every day. Increasingly, this relationship is
one-to-one through the lens of their favorite sport. This is why our category offense is such a powerful advantage. The
insights we draw from our deep consumer connections fuel our ability to create new products and services that excite
and engage.
We also know we need to remain nimble to meet the changing needs and expectations of those we serve globally. The
world is becoming increasingly interconnected and consumers expect companies to be able to deliver the same level of
innovation everywhere; and that means continuing to elevate and accelerate our level of innovation in products, in
services, in our supply chain and in our digital ecosystem.
We also know that when we focus on the consumer, we deliver value for our shareholders. We do this by ensuring our
growth is profitable. The strength and diversity of the NIKE, Inc. portfolio allows us to manage the levers in our
business to drive profitability and invest for the future, so we can continue to innovate to meet the expectations of our
consumers. And that is what you saw in our fiscal 2014 performance across all the elements of our business, and that is
the virtuous cycle that fuels our success.
Our unmatched ability to innovate is how we turn insights from athletes and consumers into amazing products and
services that no one else can deliver. Throughout the past year, we used key events and sports moments to launch our

most forward-thinking products.
Together with Kobe, in Los Angeles, we introduced the KOBE 9 Elite, the first basketball shoe to use our unique
Flyknit technology. At the Sochi Winter Olympics, we leveraged significant advances from across our categories to
deliver high-performance apparel, such as the lightweight hockey Game Jersey with Flywire and the Aeroloft Summit
Jacket. In New York, at the Super Bowl, we launched the Vapor Carbon Elite Cleat, our first cleat to take advantage of
the revolutionary potential of 3D printing. At the world's premiere track meet, the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene,
Oregon, NIKE athletes set new U.S. records and world's best times in our performance racing footwear.
And throughout fiscal 2014, we've built tremendous momentum for the business and the brand as we delivered an
unprecedented level of innovation heading into the World Cup. The combination of the world's best players and teams,
our most innovative performance products and new levels of consumer engagement through social media is truly
extraordinary. It sets a new benchmark for NIKE and the industry. There's a lot more to share with you on our
execution at World Cup, but I'll save that for Trevor to discuss.
The products we launched this year were the culmination of an intense period of creativity for us. But make no mistake,
there's much more in the pipeline. In fact, this is the pace of innovation that you should expect from us. We know
innovation is a long-term growth driver, and that is why we've been so focused on extending our investments in this
area, and we're seeing clear returns on these investments.
I recently completed a comprehensive look at our product development taking place in each of our categories. And as
you know, I'm someone who lives and breathes innovation, and I've never seen so much potential. I can tell you that the
scope and the scale of the innovations we will be delivering for our consumers is truly incredible. Our drive to innovate
extends beyond product, into areas such as digital. Our consumers expect us to be digitally connected as they are,
making digital one of my top priorities for the company.
Athletes are demanding more real-time, personalized feedback on their performance. They want easy access to
products and services that will help them improve, and they want to be part of a community where they can share and
compare information, find performance tips and motivate each other. We are building an integrated system of digital
services that will provide seamless access to our products, a full array of services and the most advanced digital tools to
measure, motivate and inspire.
Delivered with the soul of sport, this will be the digital platform for lifetime consumer relationships. Our goal is to
grow the Nike+ community from tens of millions to hundreds of millions of members.
An ongoing two-way dialogue with consumers is also a critical element of our digital ecosystem. It provides us insights
that drive innovation, strengthens consumers' connections to our brands and provides a platform for consumers to
interact with each other.
Through our social media platforms, we leverage the power and passion of sport to deepen our relationship with our
consumers. A perfect example of this is our Risk Everything campaign, which celebrates the energy and enthusiasm of
global football. Two of the campaign's videos, Winner Stays and The Last Game, have set new records for engagement
with over 370 million digital views and growing.
And finally, in e-commerce we've made significant investments in infrastructure, capabilities and geographic expansion
to provide a better experience. We know that when consumers shop online, they want a seamless premium experience,
and that's our goal for nike.com. Our efforts are paying off. Our online business grew over 40% in fiscal 2014, with the
growth rate accelerating every quarter throughout the year.
When all three elements of our digital ecosystem come together, it's a powerful strategy to drive growth and meet and
exceed the expectations of our consumers around the world, and its potential is enormous. It is changing how we
conduct our business, tell our stories and engage consumers. It's a big part of our future and will only get bigger and
better.
Fiscal 2014 has been another strong year for us, and we will take that momentum into fiscal 2015. We've aligned our
leadership and resources to fully leverage those opportunities with the greatest potential for growth. With our deep

consumer connections and our obsessive drive to innovate, we will excite, inspire and, no doubt, surprise. That's what
you should expect from NIKE in fiscal 2015 and beyond.
So thanks, and now here's Trevor to discuss the NIKE Brand.
Trevor A. Edwards
Thanks, Mark. The NIKE Brand had a strong finish to a great year, one that confirms the tremendous confidence that
we have in our long-term growth strategy. Looking at the results, on a constant currency basis, NIKE Brand revenue
grew 13% for the quarter. For the year, revenue was up 11%, with growth across all key categories and geographies.
NIKE Brand DTC revenue was up 27% for the quarter, with 22% for the year, putting DTC revenue past the $5 billion
mark. Results for the year were driven by comp store growth of 10%, new store expansion and online sales growth of
42%. And finally, global futures are up 12%.
As always, these results can be attributed to NIKE's unrivaled ability to understand the consumer, what they need and
what inspires them. That knowledge drives us to identify the biggest growth opportunities and align our resources
against them.
Let me highlight three areas of the business where we've seen significant revenue expansion on a wholesale equivalent
basis, clearly demonstrating the power of our consumer focus. First, I will start with global football, which in fiscal
year 2014 grew 21% to $2.3 billion, and that doesn't even include our football sportswear product.
Now I've visited Brazil many times over the past 20 years. But having just returned from Rio, I have to say, I have
never seen energy like that before. There is a tremendous passion for football across the country. At NIKE, our
connection with Brazil is powerful. We've been there for years and we'll be there long after the World Cup ends.
The enthusiasm we see in Brazil, coupled with our number one footwear market share around the world, is living proof
that our football business has never been stronger. And the power of the category offense continues to fuel growth in
football with superior executions against engaging consumer connections, innovative products and premium retail
destinations.
We bring the game's passion to footballers worldwide by creating meaningful connections with them through unique
events and experiences. A great example is our series of Phenomenal Houses, which combine product trials, athlete
appearances, football tournaments in an immersive NIKE experience. Over the last 10 weeks, the Phenom Houses in
Rio, London and New York and many other cities hosted more than 50,000 fans and thousands more played in our
Winner Stays football tournaments around the globe.
As Mark mentioned, we're incredibly proud of our successful Risk Everything campaign. For years, we've taken
inspiration from the best footballers. And as we always do, we share that inspiration in the stories we tell. That kind of
engaging storytelling energizes current football fans and brings new fans in, growing the market today and into the
future.
We also developed an incredible number of innovative football products this year, which led up to the first match in
Rio. With the most teams in the tournament, we launched 10 new team kits, achieving a new milestone in performance
and sustainability.
We introduced four groundbreaking performance boots: the Hypervenom, the Tiempo V, the Magista and the Mercurial
Superfly. Both the Magista and the Mercurial use our transformative Flyknit technology to take football boots to a
whole new level. The players' response to these boots has been tremendous. There are more players wearing NIKE
boots in the World Cup than all other brands combined, and more than a third of them are playing in the distinctive and
revolutionary Magista or Mercurial Flyknit boots.
And finally, we're seeing great excitement at retail, as NIKE football has helped drive great results in our stores, online
and at football shops with our wholesale partners around the world.

Our comprehensive offense on the pitch and in the marketplace drives our leadership as the world's best football brand,
and positions us for growth in this category for years to come.
Next, I'd like to talk about running, which is also driven by product innovation, consumer engagement and retail
presentation. It's that focus that powers us, growing revenue 10% for the year to $4.6 billion.
Our results were driven by key product innovations like Free Flyknit footwear, Dri-FIT Touch and Aeroloft apparel,
just to name a few. And we're expanding the business by connecting with a new generation of runners. In Q4 alone, we
engaged with over 85,000 runners through events and millions more via the Nike+ platform. That energy directly
translates at retail worldwide in our DTC locations and running destinations like Crosstown Running at JD Sports and
the NIKE Track Club at the Finish Line. The consistent achievement in the running category confirms the strength of
our strategy and points to the massive potential we see for running going forward.
And third, our women's business continues to drive strong growth. For the year, the women's revenue grew 12% to
nearly $5 billion, moving us closer to our goal of $7 billion by fiscal year 2017. Our women's strategy is very clear, to
combine running, training and sportswear into compelling product assortments that women want to run, train and live
in, with key styles like the Legend Tights, the NIKE Pro bras and the Sky Hi dunks, are a must-have for her.
Our goal to elevate women's products distribution this year was a success as we brought the energy of the NIKE
Training Club app to life at retail. We blended three vital components: pinnacle product assortments, premium services
and great shopping experiences that clearly demonstrate that NIKE understands this consumer's needs. The 50-plus
stores where we've executed these concepts have been outpacing comp store growth for the rest of the fleet. Our
success in fiscal year 2014 only hints at the enormous opportunity we see in the women's business, and we're
completely focused on capturing it.
Now let's shift focus onto a few of our key geographies. North America had another great quarter and posted a record
year. Revenues were up 10% for the quarter and the year, helping North America surpass $12 billion in annual revenue.
The geography also had its most profitable year ever, with reported EBIT expanding faster than reported revenue to
reach $3 billion for the year. For the last decade, we've heard that our opportunities in North America are tapped out.
But as we continue to demonstrate, nothing could be further from the truth.
So how do we do it? We expand the market and at the same time we take market share by understanding the consumer
better than anyone else. We extend our leadership on our perennial strengths like the basketball and running categories.
This expertise also gives us insight to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities like in e-commerce and in our
apparel, women's and young athletes businesses, just to name a few. And as we've often discussed, our confidence in
the category offense in North America gives us the roadmap to continue to unlock opportunities in this geography and
around the world.
Now let's turn to the emerging markets which delivered exceptional Q4 results, with revenue up 25%. These results
were very well balanced, with double-digit growth in almost every territory and increased revenues in nearly every key
category. The Q4 results in our emerging markets demonstrated that our brand and products resonate with consumers in
every corner of the globe.
It was a great way to end a year that had some challenges. As we've talked about previously, we had logistics issues in
Mexico in the first half of the year. This, combined with increased macroeconomic headwinds across Latin America,
slowed revenue growth for the geography in fiscal year 2014. We're continuing to closely monitor retailer inventory
and the flow of product into Mexico and across Latin America to ensure the marketplace and our brand stay healthy.
Now onto China, where we had one overarching goal for fiscal year 2014, reset the marketplace for growth. We've
made great progress and we're on track to achieve our goal of returning this market to sustainable, double-digit revenue
growth.
In our DTC doors, we tested and deployed new merchandising concepts, which drove Q4 comp store sales up 22% with
continued increases in profitability. We've also tightened our merchandise assortments for our wholesale partners and
re-profiled hundreds of the NIKE-only stores they operate. As a result, comp store sales and profitability for their

overall fleets are up, with the re-profiled stores significantly outperforming.
And importantly, inventory levels in the marketplace are also down significantly. While we still have work to do in
China, we're making great progress. And we remain confident that we have the right plan in place to achieve our true
potential in this growth geography.
And finally, there is the outstanding results we're seeing in Western Europe. Q4 revenue grew 18%, a truly remarkable
finish to an incredible year, as revenues in this important geography increased 14% to nearly $5 billion for the year,
with growth across all key categories and nearly every territory. The success we're seeing today in Western Europe
stems from decisions we made more than two years ago to align our teams against the biggest growth opportunities
through the category offense.
We fueled growth in fiscal year 2014 by transforming the marketplace with shop-in-shops at JD Sports, Foot Locker
and Intersport, as well as our own retail stores and online, and we've only just gotten started. There are tremendous
opportunities for continued growth ahead. By being focused and decisive, we now lead the market as the region's most
coveted sports brand. NIKE is the number one brand in each of the top 10 cities in Western Europe, and we're the
footwear market share leader in every key country and we're not done yet.
As we start a new fiscal year, we will continue to do what we do best, lead: lead with the world's most innovative
products and services, inspired by the greatest athletes; lead by connecting with consumers who share our passion for
sport; and lead by energizing the marketplace with superior experiences at retail and online across the world. There is
no doubt about it, the momentum surrounding NIKE makes me incredibly excited about what's to come.
Thanks. Now here's Don.
Donald W. Blair
Thanks, Trevor. Our FY 2014 results continue to demonstrate our ability to leverage our diversified portfolio to drive
sustainable, profitable growth. We're able to consistently deliver results like these for three key reasons. First, we invest
effectively to build our business. The category offense is the framework for our growth strategy. As Mark and Trevor
described earlier, we're delivering outstanding value to consumers on each component of that framework: product,
brand and marketplace.
The results were clearly on display in FY 2014. We continue to drive remarkable growth in North America, and we've
significantly accelerated our business in both of our European geographies. Using the learnings gathered in more
developed markets, we're making great progress resetting China while continuing to build our brands and our business
in the emerging markets.
Within all of those geographies, our direct-to-consumer operations are the sharp point, delivering strong growth in
revenue and profits while setting a benchmark for our brand and our business in-store and online. And beyond the
Swoosh, we're continuing to build the Converse, Jordan and Hurley brands, reaching toward the enormous potential
they each offer. The results we're reporting today flow directly from the investments we've made over the past several
years, and we're confident the investments we're making today will continue to drive sustainable, profitable growth
well into the future.
Second, we work hard to maintain balance across growth and profitability, investment and returns, near-term and
long-term results. The breadth and depth of the NIKE portfolio gives us the opportunity to invest for the future while
delivering strong growth and expanding returns on capital. And that's important for us to compete effectively and to
continue to deliver value for our shareholders.
And the third reason we deliver consistent growth is that we effectively manage risk. In FY 2014, we delivered 11%
growth in EPS despite losing eight points of growth to currency headwinds. Our ability to deliver in a volatile
environment demonstrates that we can pull the levers of our business to mitigate unforeseen downsides.

With that context, I'll recap our Q4 and fiscal 2014 results. NIKE, Inc., fourth quarter revenue grew 11% on a reported
basis and 13% on a currency-neutral basis, bringing our revenue to $27.8 billion for the year, up 10% as reported and
up 11% on a currency-neutral basis.
NIKE Brand futures orders advanced 12% on a currency-neutral basis, driven by an 8% increase in units and a 4% rise
in average selling price. Growth was led by continued strength in North America and Europe, even as our futures
window moved beyond the World Cup. On a reported basis futures grew 11%, reflecting weaker international
currencies, particularly in Japan and developing markets such as Brazil, Argentina, Russia and Turkey.
Fourth-quarter diluted EPS increased 3% to $0.78, bringing full year EPS to $2.97, up 11% versus last year. Strong
revenue growth, gross margin expansion and a lower share count more than offset SG&A investments and currency
headwinds to drive EPS growth for the quarter and the year.
As discussed on our previous call, our SG&A was more concentrated in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting demand
creation investments behind the World Cup. We estimate the changes in currency exchange rates, including the impact
on gross margin, other expense and P&L translation, reduced our year-on-year EPS growth by 7 percentage points for
the fourth quarter and 8 percentage points for the full year.
Gross margin increased 170 basis points for the fourth quarter and 120 basis points for the year. The expansion for both
periods was primarily driven by higher average prices, reflecting the power of innovative products and strong brands,
as well as the continued strength of our DTC business. These upsides more than offset downward pressure from
product cost inflation and FX headwinds. Gross margin for the quarter was better than expected, mainly due to the
strong performance of our growing DTC business, a mix shift to higher-margin product and higher margins on closeout
sales.
As we expected, Q4 demand creation spending was higher than last year, driven by marketing investments in the World
Cup and key product initiatives. Full year demand creation grew 10%, in line with our full year revenue growth, largely
driven by an increase in sports marketing expense, as well as marketing for global sporting events and new product
launches.
Operating overhead grew 13% for the quarter and 14% for the full year. This reflected support for key growth
initiatives such as DTC and consumer digital, as well as infrastructure investments to support NIKE's current and future
growth.
Other expense net was $17 million for the quarter and $103 million for the fiscal year, driven largely by foreign
exchange losses primarily from developing markets.
The fourth quarter effective tax rate was 23.5%, higher than last year's 22.9% rate, which benefited from a reduction in
tax reserves related to foreign operations. For the full year, our effective tax rate was 24%, a 70-basis point
improvement over the prior year, primarily due to an increase in earnings from lower tax jurisdictions.
We continued to deliver strong returns on capital in FY 2014, as ROIC reached 24.5%, 70 basis points above last year.
For the year, we delivered $2.1 billion in free cash flow and returned $3.4 billion in cash to shareholders in the form of
share repurchases and dividends.
As of May 31, inventories were up 13%, a somewhat faster rate of growth than revenue or futures. Our inventories are
healthy in most markets, reflecting builds to support the World Cup and to optimize the flow of goods in Europe and
China. We are continuing to work through higher inventories in Latin America, particularly Mexico, as a result of the
distribution center issues we experienced earlier in the year.
Now let's look at our performance by segment. North America delivered a great year as revenues grew 10% to $12.3
billion, marking the fourth consecutive year of double-digit revenue growth. For the fourth quarter, revenue also grew
10%, led by double-digit growth in basketball and global football.
In Q4, DTC revenue grew 21%, driven by an 8% increase in comp store sales and significantly higher nike.com
revenues. For the year, EBIT for North America grew 16% as strong top line growth and gross margin expansion were

partially offset by higher DTC operating costs and demand creation.

a currency-neutral basis. Fourth quarter revenues grew 18%. FY 2014 reported revenue for Western Europe grew 19%,
while EBIT increased 33%, driven by revenue growth, gross margin expansion and SG&A leverage as well as FX
benefits from the stronger euro.
In the Central and Eastern Europe, currency-neutral revenues increased 12% in Q4 and 15% for the year, with growth
in every key category except action sports and every territory except Israel. Football, running and women's training
were the fastest growing categories, with each reporting growth of 20% or greater for the quarter and the year. Russia,
Turkey, Poland and Greece each reported double-digit growth for the year.
On a reported basis, FY 2014 revenue grew 13% and EBIT grew 19%, reflecting revenue growth and expanding gross
margins. In Q4, EBIT fell 10% as stiff FX headwinds and SG&A investments more than offset higher revenues. In
Greater China, currency-neutral revenue grew 2% for the quarter and 3% for the year, led by strong DTC growth.
For the year, reported revenue increased 5% while EBIT was flat as revenue growth and gross margin expansion were
offset by higher SG&A, reflecting investments in DTC and our new headquarters in Shanghai. In Q4, EBIT fell 12%,
largely reflecting the timing of demand creation and operational investments.
As Trevor noted, we're seeing great results from the actions we're taking to reset the China market for renewed growth.
For FY 2015, we expect revenue for the geography to grow at a high-single digit rate. As we've discussed before, we
expect quarterly growth will vary as we fine-tune the seasonal flow of product into the market and given the significant
variations in prior year comparisons. We expect those factors will drive somewhat faster revenue growth in the first
quarter.
In Japan, currency-neutral revenues were flat in Q4 but up 5% for the year, driven by growth in sportswear, football
and basketball. DTC revenues increased 18% for the year, reflecting comp store sales growth as well as the launch of
nike.com. On a reported basis, results in Japan were significantly impacted by the weaker yen. For the year, revenue
was down 12% and EBIT fell 6% on a reported basis.
In our emerging markets geography, currency-neutral revenues grew 13% in FY 2014 despite logistics issues in
Mexico earlier in the year and generally weak macroeconomic conditions across Latin America. Every key category
except men's training posted higher revenues for the year, paced by football, running and sportswear. The geography
finished the year strong with Q4 currency-neutral revenues up 25%, reflecting double-digit growth in nearly every
territory and in most key categories.
On a reported basis, results in the emerging markets were also significantly affected by weaker currencies in a number
of developing markets. FY 2014 revenue grew 3% but EBIT fell 3% as the FX headwinds eroded gross margins and
generated losses on the other expense line. EBIT increased 8% in Q4 as stronger revenue growth was only partially
offset by FX and World Cup demand creation investments.
Converse continues to deliver strong growth with revenue up 15% on a currency-neutral basis for both the fourth
quarter and the full year. The growth was largely organic, driven by mid-teens revenue growth in Converse's direct
distribution markets, particularly the United States, China and the UK, as well as expansion of the direct-to-consumer
business.
For the year, reported revenue grew 16% and EBIT grew 17% as gross margins expanded. Fourth quarter EBIT
increased 6% as higher revenue and gross margins were partially offset by investments in infrastructure, DTC and
demand creation.
NIKE delivered strong growth in FY 2014, and we're beginning the new fiscal year with great momentum across our
portfolio. Our FY 2015 guidance reflects that momentum, as well as continued investments in growth drivers such as
DTC, product innovation and consumer digital, along with the operating capabilities to support our growth.

Overall, our expectations for FY 2015 are largely unchanged from what we shared last quarter. Specifically, for the
year, we expect reported revenue to grow at a high-single digit rate, reflecting low-double digit currency-neutral
growth, partially offset by continued FX pressure from developing market currencies. We expect Q1 reported revenue
to grow at a low-double digit rate, driven by tremendous energy around the World Cup and continued growth in North
America, Europe, China and the emerging markets.
We expect gross margin for Q1 and the full year to expand by about 75 basis points. We expect average selling prices
to increase, driven by our ongoing focus on optimizing pricing and driving our product mix to premium. Growth in our
DTC business should also benefit gross margin, helping to offset increases in product input costs, particularly labor.
As both Mark and Trevor discussed earlier, our growth strategies are working and we'll continue to invest in them. For
Q1, we expect demand creation to grow at approximately 30% as we continue to leverage the energy of the World Cup.
Operating overhead for Q1 is expected to grow in the high-teens, reflecting investments in innovation, consumer
digital, DTC and key operating capabilities. For the full year, we expect total SG&A to grow at a similar rate as FY
2014. For FY 2015, we expect the effective tax rate will be approximately 25%.
As Mark said at the top of the call, by staying focused on consumer engagement and relentless innovation, we drive
value for our shareholders. We're proud of the strong results we delivered in FY 2014 and we're more confident than
ever that we'll deliver sustainable, profitable growth and value for our shareholders.
We're now ready to take your questions.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kate McShane with Citigroup. Your line is open.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: Thanks. Good afternoon.
<A - Kelley Hall>: Hi, Kate.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: Just one quick question on guidance. I think, Don, on the last call you had said for fiscal
year 2015 you had expected slightly below mid-teens EPS growth rate. Is the guidance in the line items you gave today
implying that same guidance?
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Well, Kate, as you know, it's not been our practice to regularly give EPS guidance, but we do
give you parameters on key line items. And I would point you back to the guidance that we gave in the prepared
remarks, and that's where I'd like to leave it for now.
<A - Kelley Hall>: And, Kate, you can give a call into my team, we'll walk you through it.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: Okay, great. And then my second question is on share buybacks. It looks like this quarter
you've bought back more on a dollar basis than you ever have in your history. How should we think about buybacks
going forward?
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Well, overall, our strategy, as you know, is to continuously increase the level of cash returns
to shareholders. And, as you know, we've done that very consistently with our dividend. And we do create our share
repurchase program based upon analysis of value of the company and market condition. So over the long haul, what we
would expect is that we would continue to deliver more cash back to shareholders. The specific timing of that is based
upon our assessment of the marketplace, but we're confident in our ability to continue to generate sustainable profitable
growth. And we think NIKE is a good investment.
<Q - Katharine McShane>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from Omar Saad with ISI Group. Your line is open.
<Q - Omar Saad>: Thanks. Great job on the World Cup so far. You guys seem really visible. Congratulations.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Thank you.
<Q - Omar Saad>: Two questions, one on China, one on the supply chain. When it comes to China, it's really great to
hear that you've got a store format that seems to be really be working. Now that you've got this, kind of this DTC
format that works, are you going to re-profile the partner stores? Are you going to shut down some of the partner stores
there? Any sort of a deeper-dive explanation of what the retail strategy there would be helpful?
And then my supply chain question, on the supply chain revolution really, are you starting to see gross margin benefits
from some of those activities? I mean, Flyknit's really starting to get larger in size or is that really all in the come in
terms of the margin benefits of some of the new supply chain innovations? Thanks.
<A - Trevor A. Edwards>: Okay. Yes. Omar, I'll take the first one. Yes, around China, yeah, obviously, we are seeing
great results in the stores that we've re-profiled. So we clearly feel that the reset strategy is working. What we're
looking to do is continue to expand the number of stores that we actually re-profile, so that we can continue to actually
scale the results. Right now, it still represents a smaller part of our entire business, but we do believe that by
re-profiling more doors we will continue to actually build the business in the right way. So, again, we feel very
confident about where we are today. We will accelerate at a faster pace as we kind of come out, but we certainly feel
very confident in what we've been doing.
<A - Donald W. Blair>: And just to be clear, Omar, when we say re-profiling stores, it's not just a physical format, it's
also the way we assort the stores. And to Trevor's earlier point, this is already in a number of stores with our partners,
not just in DTC; and those partners are seeing great results, both in terms of sales results, as well as margin.
So with respect to your second question, to take the financial part of the question, we are still very early days in terms
of seeing the impact of some of the more transformational approaches to manufacturing. We are starting to proliferate
that into our sourcing base, but we think there's huge opportunity going forward on that.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Yeah. I'll just add, Omar, that we're very committed to modernizing our manufacturing and
really focusing on innovation with some key partners to transform the whole process. There's lots of opportunities I
think to reduce product costs, and we're focused on the ones that we think have the most potential to make an impact.
So we're very selective as to where we can innovate and how we can scale those innovations.
Flyknit, you mentioned, has enormous potential. We're getting tremendous response to that product. We're improving
or extending the scope of Flyknit across multiple categories. I think you will see over the next couple of fiscal years
Flyknit and some of the other investments we're making in manufacturing, innovation, really start to make a more
sizable impact on our product cost reduction; and that'll only continue to get bigger and stronger I think in the fiscal
years to come. We're very bullish on this, and it's a really important part of our strategy to contain product cost and then
advance the innovation in our product at the same time.
<Q - Omar Saad>: Thank you. Very nice job, guys.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Thank you.
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Thank you.

<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Hi. Good evening.
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Hi, Bob.
<A - Kelley Hall>: Hey, Bob.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Hi. The first question I have is around the FX and the currency hedging losses. Don, how should
we model that or think about that? I think it came in a little bit below the expectation this quarter at least, and just sort
of how to think about it for 2015 from a modeling perspective? And I guess similarly on that line, can you just
elaborate a little bit more how you're managing the risk in some of the emerging market volatility that you're seeing
right now from a business standpoint, as well as an FX standpoint?
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Sure. So I'm going to need to leave the conversation around modeling with our IR folks,
because it all depends upon the individual who's doing the modeling. But as far as the way we manage this, we do have
a pretty robust hedging program for the developed market currencies, because normally those are the largest impacts on
our business and it's relatively economical to do those sorts of hedges.
For a lot of the other currencies, we've done quite a bit of work in the last few years developing natural offsets to some
of the exposure by purchasing in multiple currencies. And so, as a result, we've reduced our overall volatility. But
there's a baseline level of volatility, especially in the developing world like Brazil, Argentina, Russia, Turkey, that just
is not economical to eliminate through the use of a hedging program.
So unfortunately, we are going to see some of that volatility flow into our numbers. With that said, we have a very
diversified portfolio of businesses. And just as you saw in FY 2014, we have a lot of levers to pull and we were able to
deliver double-digit growth in EPS even though we absorbed eight points of FX headwinds for the year.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: Okay. And then I guess my second question is, a lot of talk on the World Cup and the product
offering. I just wondered if any of you guys would share your predictions for the winner?
<A - Mark G. Parker>: We just hope that the best teams win.
<Q - Bob S. Drbul>: All right. Thanks very much. Good luck.

And your next question comes from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
<Q - Robert F. Ohmes>: Thanks, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a great quarter. My question is on
North America, I get this question a lot. Can you give us a little bit more of a map on how you are going to keep the
North America momentum going? Is it more price increases, is it an acceleration in store growth, Internet? Is it more
leaning on women's growth acceleration? Just maybe a little more color on how you guys expect to keep that going
through the next year or two?
<A - Trevor A. Edwards>: Absolutely. It's a question that we – we clearly always get that same question. And the
thing that we would continue to say is that, we see great momentum in North America today. Our futures growth of
11% continues to demonstrate that we can continue to leverage the category offense to continue to grow the brand and
the overall market.
One of the key things that we've certainly learned is by drilling down against any of the opportunities in the category,
we can continue to grow. So we see great growth coming from the categories that are currently our perennial
categories, as I talked about earlier, whether that's running, that's basketball. Those are obviously our key categories,
which we'll see grow and we'll see sportswear grow.
In addition, we see great growth coming from the other categories such as our women's business, our young athletes
business, as well as e-commerce. So those are all very under-penetrated opportunities. So we look at the North America

and we see just tremendous growth potential in the marketplace.
Also, we have our focus with our key retail partners around continuing to transform the marketplace, so we can
increase the capacity in that marketplace, which we are certainly seeing great success from doing that today. So all in
all, we still see tremendous ways to grow e-commerce, young athletes, women's, apparel; all of those represent really
great opportunities for us to grow, in addition to the current unexpected businesses where we're doing well today.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: And I'll just quickly add that we have a sizable ongoing investment in DTC, and that's not just
to create more premium points of distribution. It's actually to help us elevate our business and how we manage our
brand in North America certainly and then around the world. We're getting better, I think, at retail presentation,
consumer experiences, storytelling, merchandising, product flow, assortment planning. These are the things that you
have to do to just to be a better brand and a better business. And so, we're leveraging that investment in DTC to really
drive more potential in North America, but then also it's really a blueprint for expanding our business around the world.
<Q - Robert F. Ohmes>: Sounds great. Thanks, guys.

Your next question comes from Dave Weiner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - David Weiner>: Great. Yeah. Good afternoon. So I was looking for a little more color on your long-term gross
margin drivers. So I think the key drivers that you've talked about in the past are a geographic shift outside of North
America, a shift from footwear to apparel and then also a shift to DTC. It feels like the DTC is what's helping them
most right now. Could you just kind of confirm if that's the case? And if it is, maybe provide a little color about when
maybe the shift to apparel and the geographic gross margin shift may start to contribute to the overall gross margin
gains as well, if they're not already? Thanks.
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Okay. Well, let me just start with the biggest drivers. I mean certainly, we start with the top
line. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we have done quite a bit of work around our consumer value equation. And
one of the things that – the strength of our brand and the innovation that's in our products means that there is a great
consumer value proposition at higher price points. So certainly, working to optimize that price-value equation, we think
we can continue to raise prices, particularly around product innovation and brand strength. And then the second thing is
migrating consumers to premium product. So that is definitely a trend we've seen both on the footwear and the apparel
side.
The second one is really making sure that we are working that product cost equation. And as Mark indicated earlier,
there is a whole range of supply chain and manufacturing initiatives in place, all the way from the evolutionary to the
revolutionary. And the objective there is to raise the productivity of labor, to reduce waste of materials and produce
even more premium product. And we're driving hard against those. DTC is certainly a positive driver for us, and our
DTC business has increased significantly in profitability as we've driven our .com business and also as we've gotten
better and better, as Mark indicated, at operating retail. So all of those are key drivers. They were key drivers in 2014.
We expect them to be key drivers again in 2015 and going forward.
<Q - David Weiner>: Great. That's helpful. Thanks.

<A - Kelley Hall>: Hi, Jay.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Hi there.
<Q - Jay Sole>: Mark, just had a question about the reset going on in China. Could you just walk us through the
strategic decision-making process for thinking about whether to prioritize investment and distribution into nike.com
versus investment in brick-and-mortar retail, whether it's your own or retail partners?
<A - Mark G. Parker>: Well, we're actually investing in both. We're, as you've heard us talk about quite a bit, we're
investing in elevating the presentation of NIKE at retail, looking at how we can improve our ability to create a more
profitable, more focused business, raise the level of execution against the categories. It's really imperative that we not
only learn how to do that ourselves in that market but actually help to leverage those learnings through our retail
partners.
So the physical retail investments we're making in China are absolutely critical. I'm really excited about what has
transpired over this past year and then our ability through fiscal 2015 and beyond to start to scale those learnings across
both our own retail and our wholesale partners. Certainly, we're very bullish on .com, .com not only in China but
around the world. We think that that's just going to continue to be a bigger and bigger percentage of our business going
forward. And China is certainly no exception; very digitally connected country, consumer. And that channel for us, that
medium for commerce is absolutely the future. So we're going to be as bullish there as we possibly can.
<A - Donald W. Blair>: Yeah. And the one thing I'd also underline from an economic standpoint is our focus is on
productivity and profitability of retail. So for us, from a return standpoint, this is really driving more revenue, more
profitability through a given size of distribution infrastructure, which is not to say we won't expand over time but the
strategy is not adding lots of new stores in lower-tier cities here. We're really focused on making our existing base more
profitable, more productive for us and for our retailers.
<A - Trevor A. Edwards>: And one other thing too, as Mark just mentioned, in China specifically last quarter we
actually went in and upgraded our entire nike.com site in our China business. And that again is one of those things as
we continue to transform that marketplace using all of the investments that we've put in place, we're now leveraging
that in China specifically. So I think you'll see that play out in the future as that continues to grow.
<Q - Jay Sole>: Got it. Thanks so much.

Your next question comes from Mitch Kummetz with Robert Baird. Your line is open.
<Q - Mitch J. Kummetz>: Yes. Thank you. Trevor, in your prepared remarks you referenced the momentum on the
women's side. I was wondering, is that more of a U.S. phenomenon? Are you seeing that trending elsewhere? And then
in terms of the growth that you're seeing there, is it more on the apparel side and footwear, is it more DTC than
wholesale? Just any color on that would be helpful.
<A - Trevor A. Edwards>: Yeah, certainly. Yeah, no, we absolutely see just great momentum in the women's
business. Actually it's not only in North America but actually across all the geographies. We're seeing great growth. As
we've gone in and certainly we're seeing really a strong brand position, all the work that we've done around the NIKE
Training app has really helped to unlock a connection with our female consumer. We continue to bring really great
products and premium products into the marketplace. And so, she's very obviously excited about that. And then thirdly,
what we're also doing is around distribution. We've been able to go in and work at our DTC doors to use them, as Don
says, the sharp point to better understand that consumer and then roll that strategy out with our wholesale partners.
Now in terms of footwear and apparel, actually we're seeing growth on both dimensions. Certainly, our footwear on
both running – from running, to training, to actually sportswear; and certainly around apparel, we're seeing great
growth in the women's training apparel, as well as in women's running apparel. So, again, just tremendous upside here.

And I think going forward you're going to see us put a lot more focus on this part of the business, because we truly
believe this is an area where we can be very successful and then we see then great opportunity.
<A - Mark G. Parker>: I'll add to this. The women's business on the .com side has been incredibly healthy as well,
and we expect that to continue through 2015 and beyond. And that's a real focal point for us on the women's side is that
.com business. And then the futures on our women's business are actually very, very healthy as well. So we see a lot of
momentum going into fiscal year 2015.
<Q - Mitch J. Kummetz>: Okay. And then real quickly on Western Europe, I mean a lot of momentum there, you've
talked about some of the strategies that you have placed in that market. I'm also wondering how much of a factor is an
economic recovery there? I mean is it mostly that you're taking share with some of these strategies or are you also
benefiting from somewhat of a tailwind from economic recovery?
<A - Trevor A. Edwards>: I think from our side, we're certainly seeing just broad-based growth across all of the
Western European marketplace; and that we truly believe is a function of the reset that we did two years ago when we
decided to really focus against the category offense, as well as have a more centralized approach to the European
marketplace. So we've seen great growth really across all the territories. And even in the Iberia, so the southern parts
where it was struggling, we're certainly seeing strength in those zones coming back.
So we really truly believe our category offense is what's driving that and we're seeing the numbers actually go really
ahead of any economic recovery. So we feel very strong that it's really about our approach in that market, and we think
we've only just gotten started. We think there is just tremendous growth continuing to come through.
<Q - Mitch J. Kummetz>: Okay. Thanks. Good luck.
