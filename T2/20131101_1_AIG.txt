Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Bob.
Robert H. Benmosche
Thanks, Liz, and good morning everybody. And this is another solid quarter for AIG and we clearly have said we're
going to work on making sure that you see consistent and improving earnings of the company over time, and I think
you see that in our operating numbers for the insurance companies in particular. I'd also like to welcome Kevin Hogan,
as you know, we've held the position of the consumer group open under Peter Hancock. We have waited for Kevin to
return, 24 year veteran of AIG, having run much of the consumer businesses over that career, and we're pleased to have
him back. So Kevin, welcome back, and we're looking forward to you talking to our investors next quarter on the
progress you're making on the consumer side.
Before we get into the numbers, first about ILFC. We continue to work with the consortium that has been working with
us over the almost past year. We still feel that, while they're making slow progress, they are making progress, but this
quarter, accounting suggests we have to think about whether this can continue to be a discontinued op and some other
accounting rule. So we're really thinking hard about, if we can't get this transaction closed this quarter, then we may
want to commit to a path of IPO for next year and not continue to carry it the way we're carrying it on our book. So
that's a decision we hope to make in this fourth quarter. However, we still feel that there's a good chance this
transaction can close as-is.
On the aspirational goal comment that I made yesterday, and we want to talk about today, clearly, when we did our
re-IPO in May of 2011, there was some serious concern in the marketplace, could AIG survive and continue to grow
and thrive, and we put together some key points that we felt we needed to all work towards to give you the confidence
that we can in fact return to a very strong company. And we have been committed to those aspirational goals, and we
are still committed to those aspirational goals and this entire company is working towards achieving them. However, as
we get closer to 2015, we feel that comments going forward are more like guidance, rather than a direction that we're
all working towards. And so, we're going to stop making comments on that progress towards the aspirational goals.
And we are still, as I said, committed to them, but we're not sure whether we'll get them done by 2015. And so, once we
get closer and beginning to comment on it, that's where the theory of guidance comes into play. So, I do want you to
understand we are committed to them, we're working hard to get there, and we'll get there as quickly as we can.
So, let me move to page three and talk about capital management and liquidity. You see our liquidity continues to be
strong. We're continuing to focus on our coverage ratio, which is what we said we would do in terms of buying back
debt, but we're also issuing debt where it makes sense for the future, and looking at our future trend lines in terms of
when debt is coming due.
We also declared a dividend for the quarter, so we're back doing that and, in the middle of the quarter, we were able to
start our buyback program after we received authorization to do so. So capital management continues to be strong and
you can see also the dividends flowing into the holding company continue to be strong, as we've said before.
On the Property Casualty front, continued progress on loss ratio when you look at the trend line. Remember, that's not a
linear line and it's a line that will up, down a little bit each quarter. The main thing is to look at its pattern over time,
and it looks very good and continues to look good. We continue to get rate change in the segments that makes sense to
get it.
Our premiums are actually growing in spite of what's reported, because primarily it's reported down because of the
currency exchange between the dollar and the yen, where we have such a big business in Japan. And during the quarter,
while we – are supposed to have big cats, but sometimes we have little cats and we also have severe losses, and Peter
will talk about that. So it was a modest quarter of what I would call catastrophes and severe losses.

The Mortgage Guaranty business continues to show its strength after we redesigned its risk selection model. And so
today, almost 55% of our premiums are in that new model that is throwing off good, steady earnings on the legacy
book. Delinquencies are down slightly. However, keep in mind that almost 75% of those who are delinquent had been
delinquent before, and they sure – it seems that people just can't keep up with the timeliness of their payments. But so
far, they're still keeping up with the mortgage overall.
On Life and Retirement, a very strong quarter of sales, Jay will talk about that. Good net flows as well, very good
pricing on the products that are being offered out there. And so we're feeling very confident on that part of the business
as well. So overall, I think all of AIG is performing well, and that gives us the confidence to look forward to the things
we have to do as a company. So let me turn it over to David, who will take you through some more details.
David L. Herzog
Thank you, Bob, and good morning everyone. As Bob mentioned, our insurance operations delivered solid operating
earnings of about $2.2 billion and we continue to execute on our capital management plans. And our businesses
continue to work towards growing their risk-adjusted returns. As we've said in the past, ILFC remains a non-core asset
and has accounted for as held-for-sale, given our plans to monetize it through a sale or an IPO. We have already written
ILFC down to a fair market value. And this quarter, when ILFC files their results with the SEC, they will have
completed their annual aircraft impairment review. This review resulted in a $1.1 billion impairment from older
out-of-production aircraft, but this impairment has no effect on AIG's carrying value of ILFC.
Further to Bob's comments on the – on our work towards our long-term goals, we've made good progress on deploying
capital. We've deployed $18 billion dollars in capital through equity buybacks, a combination of equity buybacks, debt
capital management, and the reestablishment of our common stock dividend. And importantly, we remain focused on
generating deployable capital, with distributions from our insurance operating companies of about $4.6 billion
year-to-date through the third quarter.
We've made good progress on our expenses, but we still got a lot to do in terms of investing in our infrastructure and
our growth opportunities. We've also made good progress on improving our ROE and are committed to our strategies.
You can see the progress we've made in reducing the accident year loss ratio in Property Casualty, which has declined
roughly three points annually over the last couple of years.
Turning to our financials on slide four. Net income for the quarter was $2.2 billion and included an after-tax provision
of $260 million for legacy litigation matters as a result of current period developments. We also determined that
recently identified tax planning strategies met the prudent and feasible criteria, and we released, through income, about
$900 million of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance relating to our capital loss carry-forwards.
Our capital gains taking program has allowed us to realize roughly 63% of our capital loss carry forwards. In addition,
we also released about $300 million of valuation allowance from foreign DTAs. Our operating ROE for the quarter was
6.2% and was 7.6% for the first nine months. Since our earnings are tax-affected and we are not paying U.S. taxes
given our NOLs, our ROE excluding the DTA would be about 130 basis points higher. Book value per share, excluding
AOCI, was $62.68, up 8.3% from year-end.
Our operating results begin on slide five, and you can see the solid growth in our insurance operating income from a
year ago. Strong fundamentals are driving our business. Property Casualty comparisons are driven by accident year loss
ratio improvements and lower cats, and continued benign prior-year reserve development. Mortgage Guaranty
continues to benefit from improving housing market and risk selection. Life and Retirement earnings were about $1.14
billion, reflecting continued disciplined spread management and lower alternative investment returns, offset by net
favorable DAC unlocking from the annual assumption review. Life and Retirement premiums and deposits were very
strong, totaling $8.4 billion. Peter and Jay will discuss these results further in their remarks.
The Direct Investment book and Global Capital Markets earnings collectively were $139 million in the quarter,
reflecting continued appreciation in the portfolios, albeit at a somewhat slower pace from the first two quarters of this

year. As we have stated in the past, the Direct Investment book and Global Capital Markets results are impacted by
market pricing due to their mark-to-market accounting treatment, and earnings can thus vary significantly from
quarter-to-quarter.
Corporate expenses in the quarter reflect our ongoing infrastructure build-out. A year ago, we benefited from an
expense credit relating to the monetization of the U.S. Treasury stake in AIG, so the comparison is not straightforward.
Our reported operating effective tax rate for the quarter was 18% and reflected a favorable tax settlement and related
discrete items for about $200 million. Excluding this benefit, the effective tax rate was more like 32%, and we expect
our annual effective tax rate to be roughly 31%.
Turning to slide six, you can see the impact of capital management activity year-to-date. In the quarter, we issued $1
billion of seven-year notes at just shy of 3.4% and also in the quarter, we repurchased or redeemed in the quarter, and
thus far in the fourth quarter, redeemed $1.1 billion with an average coupon of about 5.7%. In October, we also issued
$1 billion of 10-year notes. Including the Direct Investment book, when you take into account our year-to-date liability
management and our full-year maturities, we're on pace to reduce our leverage by over $6.5 billion and reduce our
annualized interest expense by roughly $325 million.
On the equity side, we distributed $147 million in dividends to our shareholders and deployed just over $190 million,
repurchasing 4 million shares. We will continue to be opportunistic in our debt capital management going forward, and
we will continue to deploy our existing unused share repurchase authorization in an orderly way.
As you can see on slide seven, our insurance operations remain a source of parental liquidity, as they sent $1.9 billion
in dividends and distribution to the parent and as I mentioned earlier, $4.6 billion year-to-date. These dividends,
combined with the impact of our capital management activities I mentioned earlier, resulted in parent cash and
unencumbered securities of $12.7 billion at the end of the quarter. Included in the parent liquidity is $5.9 billion related
to the Direct Investment book, which is allocated for future debt maturities and contingent liquidity stress needs. As
we've indicated in the past, nearly 80% of the Direct Investment book's liabilities mature by the end of 2018.
So at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Peter for comments on Property Casualty.
Peter D. Hancock
Thank you, David, and good morning everyone. Before I begin my comments on the quarter, let me echo Bob's
comments about Kevin Hogan's return to AIG. Kevin's the right leader to grow our market-leading Global Consumer
business including Life, and I believe they will prosper under his very strong leadership.
AIG Property Casualty results in the third quarter reflect our consistent focus on underwriting improvements and
targeted growth. The current quarter benefited from modest catastrophe losses, our ongoing shift in business mix,
increasing pricing and enhanced risk selection, partially offset by elevated severe losses and alternative investment
returns that were lower than our expectation. As we discuss the quarter's result today, I'll highlight our focus on
balancing growth, risk and profitability.
Turning to slide eight, net premiums written grew 3% on a normalized basis. This growth is consistent with our
expectations for 2013, as we continue to be disciplined in our underwriting and opportunistic in our pricing actions.
The accident year loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, declined by three points from the year-ago quarter, reflecting
continued progress improving our business mix and risk selection. We've said in the past that there would be quarterly
volatility in the accident year loss ratio and this quarter, we experienced severe losses of $211 million, which are
concentrated in seven property losses largely outside of the United States. We continue to expect improvement in our
underwriting results.
Pre-tax operating income of over $1 billion included lower catastrophe losses of $222 million versus $261 million a
year ago. Catastrophe losses related to multiple perils around the world, including Colorado flooding, wildfires and
European weather events, but no major U.S. windstorms. Our reserves remain stable and net adverse development was
$72 million in the quarter, compared to $145 million a year ago, a benign level given our $63-plus billion of reserves

overall.
Turning to slide nine, Commercial Insurance continued to progress in reshaping its portfolio across products and
geographies. Excluding Casualty, top line growth was 9%. And as you know, we've been re-underwriting our Casualty
book, thus overall Commercial top line growth was a net 2%. We grew in risk-adjusted profitability accretive lines, or
RAP accretive lines and regions, including Property, Financial Lines and Specialty, while continuing to reduce
exposure to U.S. Casualty and certain European liability segments.
Rate increases globally for Commercial lines with 3.4%, and the North American market continues to lead rate
improvement with a 5.5% rate increase in the quarter. U.S. Casualty led with a 7.3% rate increase, while U.S. Financial
Lines increased 5.8% and U.S. Property increased 3.9%. we've also used highly differentiated rate to improve our
retention strategies, and as a result, retention is higher among our higher quality risks. Our Commercial accident year
loss ratio, excluding catastrophes, was down four points from the prior year to 66.2%, despite a $91 million increase in
severe losses, as we see a sustained benefit from our enhanced risk selection, pricing discipline, exposure management
and claims management. The sequential trend was impacted by severe losses, which demonstrates the volatility within
any one quarter.
Turning to slide 10, Consumer net premiums written grew by 4% on a normalized basis. Consumer growth was driven
by momentum through multiple distribution channels. Accident & Health net premiums written reflected declines in the
U.S., offset by growth in Asia, while Personal Lines grew 7% on strong growth in the U.S. Profitability in the quarter
was negatively impacted by retail warranty losses in the U.S. We've taken actions to improve rates and amend terms
and conditions, which should return margins to target levels promptly.
Slide 11 illustrates our investment portfolio mix and quality, while the low interest rate environment and alternative
investment returns affected net investment income in the quarter, we continue to be pleased with our overall returns and
are satisfied with our strategic asset allocation. In the quarter, we made a $716 million dividend payment to the parent,
and expect to contribute our planned dividends for the remainder of the year. As we look at our nine-month
performance, our continued focus on balancing growth, risk and profitability has delivered almost $1 billion of
high-quality additional operating profit from a year ago.
Turning to slide 12, our Mortgage Guaranty business reported operating income of $43 million, which represented
another quarter of improving profitability and growth in new business. Mortgage Guaranty continued to benefit from its
proprietary risk selection model and an improving housing market, with 55% of earned premiums generated by
high-quality business written after 2008.
Delinquency fell to 6.4% at the end of the quarter, for a one-third reduction compared to the third quarter of last year.
UGC continues to be strongly capitalized and holds an investment portfolio that's highly liquid, with 85% of the
investments rated A or better. As a leading U.S. mortgage insurer, UGC currently ensures 780,000 mortgages across
the country.
Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Jay to discuss Life and Retirement results.
Elizabeth A. Werner
Jay, I think your line may be muted.
Jay S. Wintrob
Thanks, Liz, and thank you, Peter, and good morning to everyone. I'm going to begin on slide 13, where you can see
that AIG Life and Retirement delivered another strong quarter from both a top line and bottom line perspective.
Operating income was $1.1 billion in the third quarter, up 38% from a year ago. The year-over-year comparisons were
impacted by several items in each period, including a net positive unlocking of assumptions in the current quarter,
versus a charge in the year-ago quarter primarily related to our GIC portfolio and other liabilities.

Even after adjusting for these items, we delivered bottom line growth in the quarter, with positive comparisons across
the majority of our product segments. Strong fundamental trends, including variable annuity fee income growth and
continued enhancement of profitability through active spread management, were key contributors to our favorable
earnings comparison.
The third quarter highlighted the strong cash generation capacity of our business. As David mentioned, AIG Life and
Retirement distributed $1.2 billion to the parent this quarter, bringing our year-to-date dividends and loan repayments
to more than $3.1 billion. This reflects both our solid capital position and the strong profitability of our businesses
across multiple product segments. And even after the payment of dividends, we grew shareholders' equity, ex-OCI, by
$2.2 billion since year-end 2012, ending the quarter at $33.8 billion in shareholders' equity ex-OCI.
We continue to experience strong sales momentum, and this quarter achieved our highest level of sales in Life and
Retirement's history. Innovative product design, favorable market conditions, and increasing effectiveness of our
distribution strategy, all contributed to a 118% increase in retail premiums and deposits from the year-ago period. Sales
increased across all retail investment products from both the prior quarter and the year-ago period. Surrender rates also
declined sequentially across all product lines.
Individual variable annuity and retail mutual fund sales momentum continued, reaching $2.4 billion and $1.6 billion,
respectively, for the quarter. We also saw meaningful acceleration in fixed annuity sales, which reached nearly $1.2
billion in the quarter. Growth in institutional premiums and deposits was driven by a mid-sized pension buyout case
and a large group retirement planned takeover in the quarter. Additionally, we closed on $5.3 billion of stable value
wrap business in the quarter, bringing total stable value wrap assets under management to approximately $19 billion at
the end of the quarter. Net investment income declined 5% in the quarter, largely due to lower-than-expected
alternative investment returns and the continued impact of reinvesting at rates below our current portfolio yields.
However, while reinvestment rates were lower than current portfolio yields, they have increased sequentially for the
past two quarters. We continue to be opportunistic in our investing strategy, and seeing attractive opportunities across
various asset classes.
Operating income benefited from the increase in fee income, as well as our ongoing strategy of active crediting rate
management to enhance profitability in both our Retail and Institutional spread businesses. Additionally, a net positive
adjustment of $118 million, related to the review of gross profit assumptions and an associated positive unlocking, is
reflected in operating income for the quarter.
Assets under management increased 10% from a year ago as a result of growth in both the Retail and Institutional
businesses, demonstrating the value of our diversified business model. Sales momentum and strong equity markets
contributed to growth in Retirement Income Solutions, Retail Mutual Funds and Group Retirement assets. Net flows
from these products and our Fixed Annuities business were $2.5 billion in the quarter, or an increase of nearly $3
billion versus the year-ago quarter. All product lines contributed to this favorable trend, with the majority of the
improvement driven by the increase in Fixed Annuity sales and continued strength of Variable Annuity and Retail
Mutual Fund activity. In the institutional markets, as previously mentioned, the development of the stable value wrap
business added over $19 billion in AUM over the past year, all with contractual fees and investment limitations on the
wrapped assets well within our targeted pricing and terms. With the quarter's rise in interest rates, we did see the
unrealized gain position in our invested asset portfolio modestly decline. This decline partially offset a portion of the
increases in AUM we experienced from the improved net flows. Overall, we're pleased with the growth in AUM we are
seeing across our portfolio of businesses.
Slide 14 highlights the diversity and scale of our businesses. Retail operating income increased 54% versus a year ago,
primarily due to growth in fee income on separate accounts, as well as crediting rate actions, which together
contributed approximately $100 million of the increase in earnings. Retail earnings also benefited by $198 million from
net positive adjustments related to our review of gross profit assumptions, principally due to differences in our yield
and mortality assumptions versus our models.

Institutional operating income increased 7% and also benefited from higher fee income on separate accounts and
crediting rate actions. These positive trends in our Institutional business were partially offset in the quarter by lower net
investment income, as well as an $80 million negative unlocking adjustment related to our Group Retirement business
as a result of lower investment yields than previously assumed in our DAC model. The comparison to the year-ago
period is also affected by a $110 million charge related to our GIC portfolio that we took in the third quarter last year.
Our sales trends continue to reflect strong consumer demand and increased distribution penetration for our investment
products. In Fixed Annuities, crediting rates have risen in line with market interest rates, making this product more
attractive when compared to competing bank and short-term fixed income products. Consequentially, we are seeing
volume growth while continuing to achieve increases in our target return.
Our $1.2 billion in Fixed Annuity sales is a high for the past seven quarters and is consistent with the improvement in
the market overall. Fixed Annuity sales moderated with the recent pull-back in market interest rates in October, but
continue to be at levels higher than the first and second quarter of this year. We're pleased with current pricing
conditions and look forward to continued Fixed Annuity sales momentum, assuming a modestly rising interest rate
environment.
Our Retirement Income Solutions business continues to grow profitably, and we remain comfortable with our sales run
rate. By offering a product to the consumer that is competitively priced and meets their income and investment needs,
with terms and conditions conservatively designed to enable us to manage our risk effectively, we've been able to grow
our book of individual variable annuity business in a controlled and profitable manner. At quarter-end, our variable
annuity account value, including both fixed and separate accounts, was $35 billion in our Retirement Income Solutions
business, and over $54 billion in our Group Retirement business.
And as an update to last quarter, of our $25 billion of VAs with guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits, 63% are in
benefits with strong de-risking features, such as VIX indexing of fees, volatility control fund requirements and required
minimum allocations to the fixed account. So the combination of a relatively small legacy block and enhanced risk
controls in our current features has allowed us to capitalize on opportunities when competitors have chosen or been
forced to pull back from the market.
Finally, slide 15 and 16 depict our investment portfolio composition, returns and yields. Overall base yields declined
slightly in the quarter as a result of the impact of investment purchases made at yields lower than the weighted average
yield of the existing portfolio. The same time, we've actively managed down crediting rates over the course of the year,
which is reflected in the lower cost of funds for both our Fixed Annuities and Group Retirement businesses. Overall,
spreads expanded for both Fixed Annuities and Group Retirement from the prior year. At the end of the third quarter,
about three-quarters of our Fixed Annuity and Universal Life account values were at minimum guaranteed crediting
rates, and we remain focused on managing spreads actively.
Sum it up, we're pleased with our solid earnings, strong sales, improving net flows, and level of cash distributions to
AIG through the first nine months of the year. We remain focused on executing our growth strategies by leveraging our
strong relationships with distribution partners to increase profitable sales of our broad product portfolio across all
channels, while continuing to look for opportunities to grow our business where we can achieve the most attractive
risk-adjusted returns.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Liz to open things up for Q&A.

Of course. [Operator Instructions] And we'll hear first from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: Thanks. So I guess one question, Bob, maybe on ILFC, I guess. If that does – if it's not
resolved immediately, does that imply it could come back on the balance sheet, and could that complicate the SIFI
review process at all?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: I don't think it would complicate any SIFI process whatsoever. I think it's a non-core
asset. We would continue to divest and deconsolidate it, and we'll do that in as rapid a time as it makes sense
financially for the company to do it. We know what the value of that company is, we know what's been accomplished,
and when you refinance almost $20 billion of debt and do it in a way that gives us a very tight match between cash
flows and debt maturities and so on, I think it's a property that we can divest of, but I'll have David talk about the actual
accounting.
<A - David L. Herzog>: Yeah, thanks Bob, and good morning, Mike.
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: Hi, Dave.
<A - David L. Herzog>: Hey. There're two things. One on the balance sheet held-for -sale. That's one, quote,
accounting judgment, and then there's another judgment we make with respect to discontinued operations, and those are
two different judgments – connected, but they're two different judgments. In the held-for-sale treatment is pursuant to
our plan. We have a plan. We are pursuing the plan. It includes pursuit of the jumbo transaction, but there are other
interested parties, as we've said, as well as an IPO alternative. So there's a solid basis for the held-for-sale. Then the
question is on discontinued operations, depending upon the ultimate disposition path, we need to make a determination
whether or not we will have significant continuing involvement, and that will be a facts and circumstances judgment
that we'll make and we'll continue to evaluate facts and circumstances. So it's – the held-for-sale, it's not going to come
back on balance sheet, and so now, it's just a matter of how we go about divesting it.
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: Great. Thank you. And maybe David, on partnership returns, you noted in your disclosure
that returns were impacted negatively by equity markets, but I'm just – I was trying to remember the lag, I think you're
either three months or one month, depending on the investments. Equity margins have been pretty strong. I was trying
to understand, even not relative to last year, but just relative to sort of a run rate, the returns look low. I'm just trying to
get a better understanding for how we should think about that? Thanks.
<A - David L. Herzog>: Sure. And, I'll comment. Bill, if you want to add anything, the partnerships are a quarter lag
and hedge funds are a month lag. Yeah, private equity – private equity partnerships are a quarter lag. Bill, anything to
add?
<A - William N. Dooley>: Yeah. Mike, as far as the year's concerned, first of all, these returns aren't linear each
quarter, so they're a little lumpy. We're – our mark is somewhere between – or our goals are somewhere between 8% to
10%. And, already this year, we're close to our annual goal on the return on these assets. So, even though this quarter
was lighter than the previous quarters this year, we're still very confident in it. And, as David said, the hedge fund part
of the portfolio is in the books already. We just don't know what it is, because we need the information flows to come
in, and the hedge funds have one month to go. And, there is a correlation between that and the markets. And you guys
can judge, from where the markets are today, how the quarter's going to wind up. But I think that asset class is certainly
performing the way we expect it to.
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: Okay. Just to – quick on that, if we did that math backwards though, I guess, we wouldn't
quite get there. I wonder, is the 8% to 10% return goal against the backdrop of a market that has risen as much as equity
markets have risen this year, I would – and this could be just a wrong assumption, but that would kind of gradate with
the underlying return in the equity markets, not be a fixed return threshold.
<A - William N. Dooley>: No, it's not a fixed return threshold. As I said before, these returns aren't linear, and the type
of funds that we invest in, depending on the volatility of the fund, the risk associated with the funds, we try to maintain
the 8% to 10%. And as I said, we're in good shape, through the first three quarters, to attain those goals.
<Q - Michael S. Nannizzi>: Thank you.

And now we'll take the next question from Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: Hi. Good morning. Well listen, thank you for taking the call. A question for Peter, if I may.
You've made a lot of progress in Commercial Lines in particular. I'm wondering if we could talk a bit more about
Consumer. When I think about these business, most of them are structurally more attractive than your Consumer Lines:
lower elasticity, lower risk and not really as broken. But you haven't thus far been getting a ton of margin momentum,
and recognize this is partially you're investing in growth and maybe some other just getting the team in order. I'm
wondering if you can walk us through a bit more granularity, what you guys intend to do to actually drive the
Consumer combined ratio to a low 90%s number, and what a realistic trajectory of that would be, to play through.
Thank you.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Thanks. Thanks, Josh. I think that the first thing to remind everybody is how much of our
Consumer business is in Japan. And so, what's going on there is a major merger integration effort between Fuji Fire and
Marine, AIU and an integration of many capabilities which will improve the expense picture on the, by far, the largest
Consumer operation we have. So that is certainly progressing well, and we expect that to improve the margins in what
is a large and stable book-of-business, but it's not growing that fast, obviously, with the demographics in Japan as they
are. The one exception there is the excitement we have about Fuji Life, and so we see good growth there as we rebuild
the Life business, taking advantage of the aging population in Japan.
The other dimension is the investments that we're making in building a firm foundation for growth, scalable growth, in
emerging countries. And I'd say that there are three large emerging countries which we've been investing quite heavily
in over the last year, where we have taken perhaps a little longer than expected to build the platform that we wanted
and get the sales kicked off at the rate that we'd like. But we have still a high degree of confidence that those platforms
will perform fairly promptly. So, slightly delayed start-up in three large emerging markets which we're investing in.
And then, the U.S. A&H story, somewhat negative for a variety of reasons that are kind of one-offs, but we've got other
quite good growth momentum on the Consumer side, especially on the extended warranty side, despite the short-term
profitability issue that we talk about, in this quarter, on one of the – one particular extended warranty program.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: That's helpful. Thank you. Bob, if I could switch this over to a bigger topic, I get that – we all
get that you don't want to provide guidance. And the aspirational goals were stretch goals back in 2010, but you've
since made a lot of progress against them. And so, when you say – I think I'm getting this right – that we're not sure
we'll get them done by 2015, investors just wonder what to expect. And recognizing you're not going to give guidance,
too, I think were fundamentally three big pieces to the aspirational goals: driving ROE 10%, returning capital, $25
billion to $30 billion, and investing to get some growth and rebuild the franchise. I'm wondering if you could at least
give us a directional color on, which have you think – which of these big pieces you think may be at risk?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: I don't think – first of all, you're assuming it's at risk. What we're saying is that, once we
get closer to the time, we need to give you some – maybe a range around it. We've discussed a whole lot of things one
would have to do, once we get closer. Because look, if I could tell you exactly what I could be at exactly a point in
time, I think I would have problem with some of the people in Washington in the enforcement group, because you can't
run this business with that degree of accuracy, and you all know that. What's important is, we look at how we're
running it, what are our focuses on different things within this company. And we have said we're focusing on expense
and we've been investing a lot of money to get our expenses down. So we had to spend to eventually see the savings.
We've talked about our investment portfolios and the things we're doing there. We've talked about making sure we
understand our cost of capital for the businesses and the risks we're taking, and we want to earn more than our cost of
capital, especially in the Property Casualty business, where there's been a big focus. So that we are capital-light on the
things that make the most sense for us. So, we're continuing to do all of that, and it all comes together, including capital
management.

So it's not a question of anything other than, as you go through all of these things – when we get closer 2015, you're
going to ask us to be a little bit more specific and it becomes more of an – instead of an aspiration, it becomes, we will
achieve something around this in this period of time, and that would be guidance and that's what we're concerned about.
So we're focusing on all of it. And we're proud of the progress we've made, and we're putting a lot of energy to achieve
all of it by 2015. But what I'm saying to you today, well in advance of that time, is, we may not get there by 2015, it
might be a little later. And that's about all the comment we can make on the whole subject. But I think you need to look
at our progress every quarter, look at the trends every quarter. And I think you'll see continuing, improving
organization here.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: Okay. So, we'll have to keep doing our jobs each quarter. Thank you.

And now we'll hear from Adam Klauber, William Blair. Go ahead please.
<Q - Adam Klauber>: Good morning. Thank you. The ramp-up in some of the Life and Retirement products is very
good to see. I guess two questions, do you think it's the earlier part of the ramp-up, in other words, can it continue to
accelerate? That's number one. And number two, how should we think of the returns of that business today, particularly
the Fixed Annuity business today, compared to what they've been more recently and historically?
<A>: Jay?
<A - Jay S. Wintrob>: Sure. I'll take that one. First of all, in terms of the ramp-up, I think that the potential demand
for the products we're selling, based on demographics, greater concern about longevity risk, outliving your savings and
such, is definitely there, as well as the continued movement of money from defined benefit pension plans into defined
contribution plans and ultimately to IRA accounts where the money moves from, in effect, institutional management to
retail management and more personal control. I think that primary driver, though, of the kind of quarter-to-quarter
growth is going to be – have a lot to do with market conditions, the equity markets, certainly rates, the shape of the
yield curve and such. But I think the underlying demographics and the basic demand growth will continue to be there,
but market conditions will have an overlay that's going to play a big role in quarter-to-quarter results.
You saw, for example this quarter, a very significant increase in Fixed Annuity sales based on rate movements in – we
generally follow the 10-year Treasury, assuming spreads – credit spreads are the same quarter-to-quarter. You saw the
kind of movement, not only for our company, where we were able to take advantage of that, but really for the industries
I mentioned in my comments. At the same time, the pricing continues very strong. We continue to target pricing for our
fixed annuities in the roughly 11% to 12.5% return on equity, internal IRR basis, and we continue to get that pricing,
we believe at the time we're writing those – that business. So pricing is actually very good in this environment. Market
conditions will depend a lot on rates and spreads, and I think we'll be ready to go, with our low cost operating platform
and our very strong distribution organization, to take advantage of that, or any other product segment that grows going
forward.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: I'd just like to add to what Jay just said, and it's a fact that people wonder about the
businesses, keeping them together, and the diversity of risk and the diversity of dividends to the holding company and
so on. But a startling number that just keeps hitting me is that, over the next 35 years, there will be four times the
number of people over 65 than there are today. So forget about percentages and numbers and all the other stuff, that is
four times the number of people in that age category. And that is the area where we do a lot of business, where we deal
with protection and life and other products. So, we see the opportunity, not only in the U.S. market, but you have those
statistics, maybe even more exaggerated, in China. So this is a great growth business for us over time. So, it's not only
quarter-to-quarter in the markets, but it's also about client need.
<Q - Adam Klauber>: Thanks a lot.

Next we'll hear from Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Gregory Locraft>: Yeah, hi, good morning. Just wanted to get a little more detail on – the tax rate we were
expecting was in the low 30%s, you put up an 18%. You mentioned the credits in the commentary. Can you go into the
timing around that, what they were, and whether there's any more like that coming forward?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Good morning, it's David. Again, we'll address discrete items in any particular quarter as they
occur, and we'll give you plenty of disclosure around that. And so, the 31% rate that we expect going forward is really a
reflection of the ongoing operations. As you know, we've, over the last couple of years, we've done some portfolio
rebalancing in Property Casualty to reduce our holdings of tax-exempt securities, so that certainly affected the effective
tax rate. So again, I'm not going to give you any specific guidance as to what to expect. Again, the 31% is really sort of
a normalized rate. And then we'll break out the discrete items that we do, and then we'll let you know when those occur.
<Q - Gregory Locraft>: Okay. Okay. All right. I guess what I'm wrestling with, and I know you mentioned it earlier,
but it's just the difference between – I don't know – the definition of aspirational and guidance. I mean to me, they're
the same thing, and in the quarter where the pre-tax miss was pretty sizable, why choose now to suspend guidance
effectively going forward.? And I appreciate you guys are aiming for 10% plus; but even then, I thought that the plus
would have covered you, you know, from – you don't have to give decimal point accuracy, so to speak. I just don't
know why, right now, you would be suspending guidance.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: It's very simple. We're getting too close. We could – it's all in – you want to wait till
next quarter or the quarter after? Sooner or later, we're going to face this issue, and so the feeling is that guidance is
something that, I believe, from what we've looked at, we have a likely chance to achieve. Aspirational says that, as we
look at this company and all the things we need to do over a five-year period, we believe that we could get to this kind
of target. And so, the word aspirational and why we used it was to say to you that we don't have a plan specifically that
says you can get there. We haven't gone through the details, but we knew that directionally, if we do a whole lot of
things and it began to take hold, we could get into that ballpark. And so, it's – we're going to get to a journey, we're
going to get to Southern New York. Now you're going to ask me, well, are you going to make it to Westchester, are you
going to make to Putnam, are you going to make it to Manhattan? That's guidance.
<Q - Gregory Locraft>: Okay. Okay. Lastly, just for Peter maybe, on the pricing outlook in P&C. I don't know if
you've given a lot of color on where you think it could be. But it's decelerating a little at the margin; it's great to see the
gains, but how do you think this thing plays out going forward, from a pricing perspective on the Commercial side?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: I'll actually pass that one to John Doyle. So why don't you pick that up, John?
<A - John Q. Doyle>: Thanks, Peter. Hey, Greg. Rates were up for us in the U.S., where rate is needed the most, by
5.5% in the quarter, a little down from the second quarter. Casualty rates in the U.S. remain fairly strong. The property
market seems to have gotten a bit more competitive, we've been observing that over the course of the last several
months. But I expect the same factors driving pricing improvement in Casualty in the U.S. to continue over the near
future.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: I'd like to also – and John's answer is very correct, but underneath that answer is
something that many of you would not know and that is the amount of analytics going into understanding what is our
account quality index, thinking about the quality of clients, the quality of the risk, and so on down the line and make
sure we've segmented that in a much more refined way. We're now looking at brokers and what the broker quality
index is. So we know the kind of businesses being brought to us by brokers, some of them looking for – taking a shot in
the dark and hoping [inaudible] (50:52) you will write it, versus somebody who really prides their business with AIG
and tends to bring us very good risks and very well field underwritten. And so, when we talk about price increases, we
actually look at it by these segments, and we're going to get more refined by these segments.
So we have very good retention in our best clients and very little rate increase, but we're getting pretty good retention in
some of our lower quality clients, where you need the rate because of the performance of those accounts. And so, it

isn't just following the market anymore. We're becoming much more scientific in where in our client base or
brokerage-brought business do we want to begin to add rate, and that would be independent of what's actually
happened in the market. So it's not just the old, everybody's up and down by the tide. So I'm very impressed and very
optimistic about what John's been doing in particular in the whole Commercial business with Peter. So that's a different
level of detail behind that answer.
<A - John Q. Doyle>: Yeah, Bob. I would add, beyond the tools that we're building to help making better judgments at
the – at the underwriter's desk, we made big investments in the claim side as well, in people and process and in
technology, that are enabling better results for us, to reduce the cost of risk once the claim hits, and so that's an
important part of the improvement as well.
<Q - Gregory Locraft>: Okay. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks a lot, guys.

Now we'll take a question from Joshua Shanker, Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Good morning, everyone. My first question is for Jay, in terms of the amortization of the
DAC on the Life business, interest rates were kind of stable during the quarter, but you got a benefit there. Can you talk
a little bit about – thinking about what went into this quarter's change in the DAC and what we might see happen in
future quarters if rates go up and when – and when that actually hits the P&L?
<A - Jay S. Wintrob>: I'm going to actually – Mary Jane Fortin, our CFO, is with me, I'm going to let her take that
question.
<A - Mary Jane Fortin>: Yes. Thank you. So, in terms of the DAC, you're right in terms of the Fixed Annuity
business. What we saw there were really two things, the yields on the portfolio supporting the book were better than
what we had modeled, as well as, you know, Jay has talked to you about the crediting rate actions we've been taking
and really managing the overall spreads, that benefited us in terms of the actual spreads coming through versus what we
had assumed in our model. Our model, if you go back a year ago, still is anticipating a continued pressure around yield
and spreads, and we've been able to really manage through that by both the investing side and actively managing the
crediting rates.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: This might sound somewhat naïve, but I would have probably thought that would happen
more likely in 2Q, and we didn't see it then in 3Q?
<A - Mary Jane Fortin>: Well, we do our annual review of the critical assumptions on an annual basis, and so we are
tracking our actual experience quarterly, but we do do a detailed review. And we also want to make sure we see the
patterns emerge over time. And so this is really, since last year, the first time that we did a detailed review of where the
yields and spreads were coming in, and therefore adjusted in the quarter, across the whole Life and Retirement
portfolio.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: Okay. Thank you. Very clear. And on share repurchases, what told you you had about
capacity for $200 million of repurchasing during the quarter, and I'm wondering if you were blacked out for any
periods in the quarter otherwise?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Brian, why don't you go ahead and give Josh some color on that?
<A - Brian T. Schreiber>: Sure. We received authorization midway through the quarter, in August. So we didn't have
a full quarter, and we also have a blackout date that started on September 15. So we're really only in the market for I
guess 27 days. We didn't have $200 million of capacity. That's how much we did, because we wanted to be just
disciplined in how we were deploying the authorization.
<A - David L. Herzog>: Yeah. We have – our capacity, Josh, was $1 billion. We have the authorization for $1 billion,
we used $190 million, and so we'll again, as I said in my remarks, we'll remain committed and disciplined around

deploying that capital.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: And is it reasonable to say you get about 25 days a quarter that you can be in the market?
<A - Brian T. Schreiber>: No, it depends – yes, but again, it depends on when we get the authorization, where in the
quarter it is.
<Q - Josh D. Shanker>: That's true, right. This quarter you already have the authorization, so you have more days.

And now we'll hear from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Yes, thank you. Two questions on the Property Casualty side. The first is you had some adverse
development in the primary Casualty business, more so than we've seen in the past. And I'm wondering what's going on
there, what drove that? And then secondly, just explain what happened in the Retail Warranty business, what drove
those losses? It wasn't quite clear from the press release.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Why don't you take the first question, John? And I'll take the second.
<A - John Q. Doyle>: Hey, Jay. The adverse [inaudible] (56:10) we experienced in Primary is related primarily to
construction defects, and really what – we saw some increased frequency, we accelerated a review that had been
scheduled for a later period. And really, impact of prior major cat events, as well as the expansion into some new states
that historically hadn't been troubling in this regard. We had historically tracked a couple of different states that –
where CD had been a challenge for us, we saw again some increased frequency in some new states, accelerated a
review. And I would also say, beyond the impact of any major cats in the United States, also the impact of the credit
crisis. Now we're observing a tail that's longer than what we had expected. And the issue moving into, into some other
states. So again, we accelerated a review and dealt with it in the quarter. Warranty?
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Great. And the Warranty business?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Yeah. On the Warranty business, this is working with one or two large retailers, and in
particular one. So, this a program where the profits and the risks are shared with the retailer. And there is a mechanism
to true up, through rate change, historical profitability. So while, in any given quarter, you can have fluctuations, which
we've had, we have confidence that we can recoup those adverse results within a very prompt period. So, it really is a
partnership with the retailer, and there's not as much risk transfer as the numbers would suggest.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: What kind of underlying products are we talking about, is white goods, computers?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: All of the above, but in particular, mobile phones in this quarter.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Okay. Thanks.
