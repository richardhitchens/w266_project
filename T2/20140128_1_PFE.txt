Pfizer Quarterly Corporate Performance – Fourth Quarter 2013, which is located in the Investor Presentations section
in the lower right-hand corner of this page.
Before we start, I'd like to remind you that our discussion during this call will include forward-looking statements and
that actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could
cause actual results to differ are discussed in Pfizer's 2012 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in our reports on Forms
10-Q and 8-K.
Discussion during the call will also include certain financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Reconciliation of those non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly
comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in Pfizer's current report on Form 8-K dated today, January 28,
2014.
With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ian Read. Ian?
Ian C. Read
Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everyone.
We finished 2013 with a solid fourth quarter, and the overall financial performance for the year was strong. Looking at
the quarter, we delivered good operational performance. Revenues in emerging markets grew 9%. Established Products
revenues grew 6%. Oncology revenues grew 29%, and Consumer Healthcare grew 2%.
We also had strong quarterly revenue performance operationally from key inline products such as Lyrica which grew
14%, Celebrex which grew 9%, and Enbrel outside of North America which grew 8%.
We continue to see positive progress with our recently launched products, Eliquis and Xeljanz. For Eliquis, in the last
two quarters of 2013 we saw definitive momentum across key metrics, resulting from the actions that we implemented
together with our partners BMS.
While we are starting from a small base, the trend we are seeing on sales growth for Pfizer is significant. Specifically,
we saw a 124% increase in sales globally in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to the third quarter. And TRx volume
in the U.S. for Eliquis increased 68% from the third to the fourth quarter of 2013.
For Xeljanz, we continue to see a steady increase in U.S. scripts, with a 28% growth in TRx volume in the fourth
quarter compared to the third quarter of 2013. Physician feedback continues to be positive. To date, nearly 3,500 HCPs
have prescribed Xeljanz and nearly 80% have repeat prescribers.
Now turning to highlights for the year, we met or exceeded every element of our financial guidance. We drove
operational growth in key products, including Lyrica, Celebrex, and Enbrel outside of North America.
Looking at how our business performed operationally, emerging markets reported solid single-digit growth of 6%.
Oncology grew 29%, and Consumer Health business grew 5%.
We saw advancement in our pipeline across the portfolio. We achieved approval in the U.S. for Duavee for the
treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause and prevention of postmenopausal
osteoporosis. We expect to launch next month. And the FDA approved a Prior Approval Supplement for Embeda
extended-release capsules.
We initiated a Phase 3 program which includes pivotal outcome studies for bococizumab, the proposed generic name
for our PCSK9 monoclonal antibody to lower LDL cholesterol. We initiated two Phase 3 studies of palbociclib in
advanced breast cancer and began enrolling patients in a third Phase 3 study with a German Breast Group in patients
with early breast cancer at a high risk of recurrence.

We initiated a Phase 3 program with our partner Merck for ertugliflozin, our SGLT2 inhibitor for the treatment of Type
2 diabetes. We've included a Phase 2 study for our staph [staphylococcus] aureus vaccine, which showed encouraging
signals that our vaccine elicits positive immune response. We expect to present this data at a medical conference this
year.
We completed a Phase 2a proof-of-concept study with a novel PDE-5 inhibitor in diabetic neuropathy, which showed
an encouraging clinical profile, warranting further exploration in Phase 2b. We conducted Phase 1 proof-of-concepts on
biosimilars of rituximab and infliximab, which concluded with positive outcomes on their relevant study endpoints.
And for Xeljanz in Europe, where we received a negative opinion last year for our rheumatoid arthritis indication, we
are continuing to pursue registration and are actively engaging discussions with regulators and the development of
additional data to support a refiling, although we continue to expect this will result in a several-year delay.
We reduced our total adjusted cost of sales, SI&A, and R&D expenses on an operational basis by approximately 3%,
which is about an $850 million reduction versus 2012 levels. We completed the separation of Zoetis and generated
approximately $17.3 billion in after-tax value. We returned nearly $23 billion to shareholders in dividends and share
repurchases. And we put in place and are operating in our new commercial structure. Each business has strong
leadership in place. And we believe that by having a sharper focus, we can better maximize the performance of all our
businesses.
In terms of financial transparency, we will provide a management view of profit and loss for each business starting with
the first quarter results this year.
To sum up the year, we strengthened our innovative core by advancing key R&D programs, created significant value
for shareholders through disciplined capital allocation, and our commercial businesses performed well during a time of
transition and difficult market dynamics.
Three years ago, we laid out the priorities and strategies for how we would create value for each of our businesses and
address our R&D productivity challenges. Over the course of the last three years, our priorities and our strategies have
not changed, and I believe we're showing strong results. Again in 2014, you can expect us to remain intensely focused
on maximizing the opportunities within each of our commercial businesses, continue to advance science, innovation,
and our pipeline, and prudently deploy our capital.
We see distinct opportunities for each of our commercial businesses this year. The global innovative Pharma business
will focus on accelerating the uptake trajectory of newly launched products Xeljanz and Eliquis and driving growth
from major inline brands like Lyrica, Enbrel outside of North America, Viagra in the U.S., and Chantix. The Vaccines,
Oncology, and Consumer Healthcare business respectively will capitalize on the Prevnar 13 franchise, concentrate on
the recently launched oncology products Xalkori, Inlyta, and Bosulif, and launch over-the-counter Nexium in Europe
and in the U.S. provided it receives FDA approval.
The global established Pharma business will focus on maximizing key peri-LOE brands, namely Celebrex, Lyrica in
the EU, and Zyvox. We will also support continued growth for important legacy off-patented brands such as Lipitor
and Norvasc in emerging markets, build on local partnerships like those with Mylan, Teuto, and Hisun, and advance
growth opportunities within the sterile injectables and biosimilars portfolios.
Building on the pipeline advances achieved in 2013, there are several potential milestones for 2014. We expect to
report in the near future the top line results for Phase 2 study of palbociclib in patients with postmenopausal
ER-positive advanced breast cancer. The results for the CAPiTA trial for Prevnar 13 for adults aged 65 and older are
expected to read out during this quarter. And if supported, we expect to discuss the data with the Advisory Committee
on Immunization Practices, ACIP, in the U.S. and other regulatory authorities.
Along with our partner Bristol-Myers Squibb, we are seeking approval for Eliquis VTE prevention in orthopedic
patients in the U.S. and DVT treatment in the U.S. and Europe. We have two pivotal trials in the Xeljanz Phase 3 oral
psoriasis program that are anticipated to read out in the second quarter. For the staph aureus and the meningitis B
vaccines, we anticipate sharing results from Phase 2 studies at medical congresses this year while advancing the

late-stage development of both assets.
Last week we announced the top line Phase 3 results for ALO-02, an investigational agent of oxycodone hydrochloride
and naltrexone. It met the primary efficacy endpoints in patients with moderate to severe chronic low back pain,
demonstrating a statistically significant improvement compared to placebo.
Yesterday we announced top line results for two Phase 3 studies, BR.26 and ARCHER 1009, that evaluated
dacomitinib in two different populations of previous treated patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. While
we are disappointed that neither study met its primary endpoint, we will continue to evaluate the full data set from both
trials to understand if molecularly defined subgroups of patients may derive benefit from dacomitinib.
In order to continue to develop a robust pipeline of highly differentiated molecules and vaccines that have the potential
to be either first or best in class, such as the therapies I just noted, requires ongoing R&D investment. In 2014, we will
continue to be prudent stewards of how we allocate capital and will balance the need for incremental R&D investment
with the need for delivering overall shareholder return. As we've done in the past, we will continue to use business
development opportunities as an enabler of strategies to create value for our shareholders.
In summary, we start 2014 with a sound strategy and a strong business. We will build on our performance in 2013 by
continuing to create a sustainable high-value pipeline and establishing strong commercial businesses. By executing on
our new product launches, growing key inline products, delivering on the potential at all phases of the pipeline, and
effectively deploying our capital, we will further strengthen all of our businesses. Our top priority and commitment is
to develop and to bring to patients innovative medicines that meet their needs and that together with other actions will
generate and enhance shareholder value.
Now I'll turn it over to Frank to take you through the details of the quarter and our financial guidance for 2014.
Frank A. D'Amelio
Thanks, Ian. Good day, everyone.
As always, the charts I'm reviewing today are included in our webcast. I want to remind everybody that as a result of
the full disposition of Zoetis on June 24, 2013, the financial results of the Animal Health business are reported as a
discontinued operation in the consolidated statements of income for full year 2013 and fourth quarter and full year
2012.
Now let's move on to the financials. Fourth quarter 2013 reported revenues were approximately $13.6 billion, which
decreased 2% year over year and reflect operational growth of approximately 1%, driven mainly by strong performance
of Lyrica, Celebrex, Inlyta, and Xalkori globally, Enbrel outside of North America, and Xeljanz and Eliquis primarily
in the U.S.
These were more than offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of approximately $397 million or 3%, the
expiration on October 31, 2013 of the collaboration agreement for Enbrel in North America, continued erosion for
branded Lipitor in developed Europe and certain other developed markets, the ongoing expiration of the Spiriva
collaboration in certain countries, other product losses of exclusivity in certain markets, and decreased government
purchases of Prevnar in certain emerging markets, among other items.
Adjusted diluted EPS of $0.56 increased 22%, primarily due to the operational decrease of adjusted SI&A and R&D
expenses, an increase in other income due primarily to the sale of a portion of our in-licensed generic sterile injectables
portfolio to Mylan, a lower effective tax rate on adjusted income, and substantially fewer weighted average shares
outstanding due to our continued share repurchases and the impact of the Zoetis exchange offer.
Reported diluted EPS was $0.39 compared with $0.85 in the year-ago quarter, driven by the significant negative impact
of the non-recurrence of income from discontinued operations attributable to the Animal Health and Nutrition
businesses, including the gain on the sale of the Nutrition business in the year-ago quarter.

In addition to the previously mentioned factors, reported diluted EPS was favorably impacted by a lower effective tax
rate, primarily due to favorable audit settlements, lower charges related to asset impairments and legal matters, and
lower acquisition related expenses.
During the fourth quarter, biopharmaceutical revenues in the BRIC-MT markets increased 6% operationally, driven
primarily by strong volume growth in China, especially for Lipitor. In these BRIC-MT markets, volume growth of 6%
was partially offset by foreign exchange of 3% versus the year-ago quarter. Revenue from all emerging markets
increased 9% operationally in the fourth quarter, with China growing approximately 19% operationally.
If you exclude the portfolio of products whose rights were transferred to our joint venture in China with Hisun, in the
fourth quarter we would have had operational revenue growth of 10% in our overall emerging markets business, 9% in
the BRIC-MT markets, and 27% in China compared with the year-ago quarter.
Foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter revenues by $397 million, or 3%, and positively impacted
adjusted cost of sales, adjusted SI&A expenses, and adjusted R&D expenses in the aggregate by $251 million, or 3%.
As a result, foreign exchange negatively impacted fourth quarter adjusted diluted EPS by approximately $0.01.
As you can see, in 2013 we met or exceeded all components of our financial guidance, including exceeding our
adjusted diluted EPS guidance.
Now I'd like to comment specifically on a few of the elements of our 2014 guidance. First, we expect adjusted revenues
to be in the range of $49.2 billion to $51.2 billion. I want to point out that this range reflects an anticipated $3 billion
negative impact due to declining alliance revenues specific to 2014, notably the Enbrel collaboration in North America
and the ongoing expiration of the Spiriva collaboration in the U.S. and other developed markets; and the loss of
exclusivity of certain products in several geographies, including Viagra in EU, Japan, and Australia, Detrol in the U.S.,
and Aricept in major developed markets.
I also want to point out that our 2014 adjusted revenue guidance also reflects an additional $1.4 billion negative impact
due to the year-over-year difference in actual foreign exchange rates in mid-January of 2013 compared with
mid-January 2014, mainly driven by the movement of the yen against the U.S. dollar. So had we applied the rates for
mid-January of 2013 to our 2014 guidance, the adjusted revenue range would have been $1.4 billion higher.
We expect cost of sales as a percentage of revenue to be in the range of 19% to 20%, an increase from the 18% we
recorded in 2013, driven by the significant decrease in alliance revenues. It's important to remember that these alliance
revenues were recorded at 100% gross margin because there is no associated cost of sales. Consequently, the
significant decrease in these revenues will also negatively impact our cost of sales as a percentage of revenue in 2014.
We expect adjusted SI&A expenses to be in the range of $13.5 billion to $14.5 billion, which reflects spending in
support of key product launches as well as the benefit of our continued cost reduction and productivity initiatives. We
expect adjusted R&D expenses to be in the range of $6.4 billion to $6.9 billion to support Phase 3 studies initiated in
late 2013 and early 2014. We also expect adjusted other deductions to be approximately $100 million. I want to remind
everyone that the recognition of profits from the Enbrel collaboration in North America has shifted from alliance
revenue to other income as we have moved to a royalty structure.
We expect our tax rate on adjusted income to be approximately 27%.
Finally, we expect adjusted diluted EPS to be in the range of $2.20 to $2.30. This range includes anticipated share
repurchases of approximately $5 billion this year, which will more than offset some expected dilution related to
employee compensation programs. It's important to note that our 2014 adjusted diluted EPS guidance absorbs an $0.08
negative impact resulting from the previously mentioned difference in actual foreign exchange rates for mid-January
2013 compared with mid-January 2014. As always, we will continue to monitor foreign exchange fluctuations and will
update the potential impact, if any, on our 2014 expectations.
So moving on to key takeaways, we achieved or exceeded all elements of our full-year 2013 financial guidance in a
continuing challenging environment. In 2013 we completed the separation of our Animal Health business and created a
new commercial structure that we successfully implemented at the beginning of this year. We provided full-year 2014

financial guidance, which reflects the negative impact of $3 billion due to declining alliance revenues and expected
product losses of exclusivity. In addition, our guidance for adjusted R&D expenses reflects our investment in several
Phase 3 studies initiated in late 2013 and early 2014. We will continue to mitigate the impact of product losses of
exclusivity and declining alliance revenue with growth from certain other products as well as expense discipline and
share repurchases.
We continued to create shareholder value through prudent capital allocation. In 2013 we repurchased $16.3 billion or
563 million shares. Overall in 2013, we returned almost $23 billion to shareholders through dividends and share
repurchases. Over the past three years, we've returned almost $53 billion to shareholders through dividends and share
repurchases. And in 2014, we expect to repurchase approximately $5 billion of our common stock. Finally, we remain
committed to delivering attractive shareholder returns in 2014 and beyond.
With that, I will turn it back to Chuck.
Charles E. Triano
Thanks, Frank and Ian as well. With that, operator, if we could, please poll for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Tim Anderson from Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Tim Minton Anderson>: Thank you, a couple of questions, please. You've no doubt seen various analyst reports
predicting what the financials for the three divisions will look like, and I know you're planning on providing those
details on your Q1 call. But can you give us your preliminary thoughts on what you've seen thus far from the Street?
Do you think we'll end up being surprised by how the numbers fall out between the different divisions, or do you think
the analyses you've seen look reasonable?
And then on palbociclib, any updated perspective on the likelihood of being able to file on the final Phase 2 results? I
know that day is approaching. I would imagine you've already had some discussions with the agency, or at least at a
minimum have some thoughts on the matter.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay. Thank you, Tim. I'll ask Frank to answer the question that you posed on the financial
divisions and when you'll see the results, and then I would ask Albert Bourla to comment on palbo.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: So, Tim, clearly we've looked at several models that have been put together relative to
what the new businesses will look like. I think the rhythm of those numbers is directionally correct is how I would
describe it. And obviously, we'll come out with our own numbers for our first quarter 2014 results. But I think
directionally correct is how I would describe it, and I don't expect that what we publish will create any big surprises.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Frank.
<A - Albert Bourla>: Tim, on palbo, as you alluded, our discussions with FDA are productive and they are ongoing,
and this is particularly true given the Breakthrough Therapy designation we have received from them. Now these
discussions will continue after the Phase 2 analysis becomes available. Therefore, the exact regulatory path forward has
not yet been determined. Now having said that, we can envision a scenario where, depending upon the strength of the
final Phase 2 data, there may be a pathway to file with the FDA based upon these Phase 2 results. However, as you
know, the acceptance of any filing is ultimately an FDA decision.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Albert.

Your next question comes from Gregg Gilbert from Bank of America.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thanks. Just sticking with the palbo theme, could you comment on the competitive landscape in
light of Novartis's and Lilly's progress and what differentiation you could speak to at this early stage? And for Frank,
can you talk about – can you put a little more meat on the bones on the gross margin commentary? What are the drivers
for lower gross margin in 2014 and whether those items are trends or blips? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: So, Albert, palbo again.
<A - Albert Bourla>: Yes. As you are aware, there is very limited information in the public domain on these
compounds from this company. So it's really difficult to differentiate palbo at this point until we see some more clinical
efficacy and safety data from them. On palbo, on the contrary, we have seen data and we are encouraged by the
magnitude of the clinical activity we have seen in our patient population. So we are really looking forward to our final
Phase 3 results.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Frank?
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: So, Gregg, on the gross margin, let me walk through this, and I'm going to bridge this
because I think it will be helpful. So let me run the numbers first. We printed 18% for the full year 2013. We're
providing guidance for next year of 19% to 20%. So now let me build the bridge. If we remove foreign exchange, the
positive impact foreign exchange had last year on cost of sales because it lowered cost of sales, that 18% becomes
18.5%, so 18% to 18.5%. Then if you did the accounting for Enbrel in 2013 the way we're going to do the accounting
for it in 2014, which is don't show it as alliance revenues but show it as royalties, that 18.5% would become 19%. So
now 18% became 19%, and then that 19% to 20% in 2014 is really a result of the other alliance revenue declines,
primarily Spiriva, and then some of the product LOEs. And one key point to make here is the big decline year in
alliance revenues is in 2014. So that's the way to think about the rhythm of the numbers.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thanks, Frank; next question please, operator?
Operator
Your next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum from ISI Group.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys, thanks a lot for taking my question, also congratulations on a great P&L
management in 2014.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you.
<Q - Mark Schoenebaum>: I know a lot of people were nervous about the alliance revenue lines and everything, so
well done. I just want to ask a question that you probably get a lot, but I thought I'd ask on the call. And that is, is there
a scenario that you can envision, Frank or Ian, where you might sell your established products unit or at least your
generics unit in some kind of tax-advantaged way prior to 2017?
And then just the only other question I had, if I might, is if my calculations are correct, R&D plus SG&A crept up a
little bit as a percentage of revenue at the midpoint versus 2013, and I was just wondering. I know you're not going to
give guidance beyond 2014. But in general, are you comfortable with where our analyst models are? Should we expect
that trend to continue, or is that a 2014 blip? Thanks a lot.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. I think on the R&D, our R&D spend has been responsive to late Phase 3 assets that we
high comfort and we want to invest in, and that's basically where the flex is. So I think we will fund where you would
expect us to fund the Phase 3 assets, to the extent we see great opportunity for them. And we will continue to do that,
but we will continue to manage our overall P&L as we do that.

On the potential sale of our Established Products business, we are managing all three businesses to create value for the
company. And I think the immediate focus of this is to get these businesses with very strong management teams, which
they have, to focus on the different ways of delivering value and to drive value for Pfizer shareholders. There are also
several data requirements which restrict our ability to enter into any transaction, even assuming we wanted to at this
stage, and I'll ask Frank to talk about that.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: So, Mark, it's a lengthy answer, but let me try to work through this, which is it depends on
the type of transaction. So if it's a public transaction – so what's a public transaction: a partial spin, a complete spin, a
Reverse Morris Trust, a partial IPO, a partial IPO followed by a spin or a split. Three years of audited financials are
required. That's a requirement. If it's a private transaction, a partial sale of the business, a complete sale of the business,
formation of a joint venture where we have a minority interest or where we have a majority interest, no audited
financials are required. However, a significance test is required, the results of which may require audited financials.
Let me rip through the significance test. There are three tests that make up the significance test. There's an asset test, an
income test, and an investment test. And basically it's the target's results for each of those tests as a percentage of the
acquirer's results. So think about income would be the target's income as a percentage versus the acquirer's income.
Now, the way the results work or the tests work is if all three tests are less than 20%, no audited financials are required.
If any one test is greater than 20% and lower than 40%, between 20% and 40%, one year of audited financials is
required. Between 40% and 50% any one test, two years of audited financials; and in any one test greater than 50%,
two years of audited balance sheets, three years of audited P&Ls, cash flows, other comprehensive income and
shareholders equity statements. So that's basically what's required and why it's required. That's a summary.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Frank. As you can see, Mark, we have thought a lot about this issue. And I would say
that we want to create optionality and the best way to create optionality is having strong results and transparency on
these results over the next few years, and that's what we're focused on. Thank you.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thanks, Ian, and thanks, Frank, for the detail there; next question, operator.

Your next question comes from Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. Just to follow up on that, Ian, if you could talk about the Value business, which is what
I think we're all focused on here, the emerging markets and Established Products businesses. That's a huge part of the
overall Pfizer story. And while we appreciate that you are going to focus on driving value out of each of these
businesses, maybe you could talk about how you think about the margin and growth potential of this business. What are
the true durable earnings performance that you see from this business? Because from what we see, the growth of
Established is really just coming from shifting products that go generic into that business, and then the emerging
markets piece is obviously very difficult to predict. So maybe, if you can, provide your view on how you see this
business as a standalone performing over the next three years or so.
And then just as a follow-up to the breakup scenario, Frank, you said three years of financial audited information is
required. So if we're starting to get the data in the first quarter this year, does that then mean that the earliest you could
contemplate a full breakup would be end of 2016? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Jami. Obviously, as I said, the Established Products business is not a homogeneous
business. It's a heterogeneous business with many different opportunities. And we have very strong management teams
in all our businesses. So I'm going to ask John Young to answer your good questions over how we will manage the
Established business for growth. And on the last point, I think yes, we're indicating that we would have three years of
financials by the end of 2016.
<A - John D. Young>: Okay, so thanks for the question, Jami. So maybe just to say a little bit about what this business
is, I think certainly we believe this is not only a very large business, to your point about its contribution to Pfizer
overall, but actually a very attractive, a very diverse, and a very profitable business with actually some unique

opportunities across different portfolios and geographies. So let me just walk you through a little bit of what this
business really comprises, and broadly we think of it as in four buckets. There's a peri-LOE business in developed
markets that include some of the major brands that currently are pre-LOE such as Celebrex, Zyvox, Lyrica in the EU.
Certainly we're going to be very focused in that segment on maximizing the profitability of those brands, both sides of
the LOE spectrum in leveraging some of the capability from EP that we think has really done a pretty good job with
some of the recent LOEs such as Lipitor compared to market proxies.
The second segment of the business is really our legacy EP business that comprises mature off-patent products in
developed markets. That business is declining, but we're very focused on maximizing profitability through targeted
investments in certain brands in that portfolio that present opportunities for growth.
The third piece of the business is really what comprises probably a little more than 70% of the emerging market
business today, and that business is growing pretty strongly. You've seen our results from the fourth quarter for the
emerging market business overall. We believe that portfolio and actually the fit of the mature products in the global
established Pharma portfolio is a great fit, actually, for a lot of the healthcare needs that we see in some of the key
emerging markets such as China and Brazil and Mexico. That is growing today, and we envisage that that will continue
to grow in the future.
And then the last component of this business really is what we think of as growth opportunities. Now, some of those
growth opportunities will be medium-term growth opportunities such as the biosimilar portfolio. We think we have one
of the leading biosimilar portfolios in the industry with five assets in different stages of development. But we actually
have a number of other opportunities, two or three areas of growth, such as some of the partnerships that you're already
aware of with Teuto, Hisun, Mylan, all of which we're very pleased with and performing well. And we're going to be
very active in looking for additional partnerships in targeted markets where we think there's an opportunity to add
shareholder value, opportunities for continued growth of sterile injectables, and some targeted opportunities in certain
markets for some reformulated branded generic products as well.
I think probably the last point to make is this is really not a commodity generic business. In fact, less than 10% of our
revenues would come from what you traditionally think of as being a generic business. So there's no doubt that we'll
see some pressure on revenues over the next few years, driven by some of the LOEs that everyone's well aware of from
some of those big peri-LOE brands. Actually, this is a business where we believe in the medium term that it will
plateau. And we believe that we can then have a number of significant opportunities for growth with this business in
the medium to longer term.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, John. Frank, do you want to make a comment?
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Just real quickly, I just want to punctuate what Ian said, which is three years prospective
financials, as I've said previously, so that would be 2014, 2015, and 2016 financials. And then obviously the 2016 10-K
wouldn't be done until the end of February 2017; so actual optionality, if we decided to do so, would be sometime in
2017.

Your next question comes from Chris Schott from JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Great, thanks very much. Just staying on the Established Products side, I recognize the
near-term focus in that business unit is working on the performance. But when you consider the long-term options for
that business, I guess first of all, would you agree with the statement that this is the division where a larger merger
could make the most sense for Pfizer? And following on to that, can you walk through the pros and cons of a larger
merger for that division as you consider your options relative to either running the business on your own or looking at
tuck-in deals?

And then my second question is, just as we're thinking about capital deployment, is there any changes in the way you're
thinking about share repo versus higher dividend payout or other opportunities in light of the new business structure?
Does that change at all, or is it just that you want to have either more cash available as these business units look at their
various options as you consider your structure, et cetera? Is there anything we should be thinking of there? Thanks very
much.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Chris, I think on the Established Products business, our focus is the creation of value. So we do
have a quite impressive portfolio and a geographic presence across the emerging markets. Your question is will further
scale be useful. I think it depends very much on the opportunities that arrive, and we have to be opportunistic about
that. Clearly, if we can add broader portfolio and specific scale in specific countries, we'd be interested in it, which is
why we've been doing our JVs on a country-by-country basis. And we'd be open to other alternatives, as we always are,
that will create shareholder value. But priori, we're going to focus right now on running that business, producing the
value and open to various BD alternatives to create more value.
On the second question, the capital structure, I think as we've seen in the last three years, our capital structure and the
way we manage our capital has been focused on ensuring we produce the best return for our shareholders. We continue
to manage that mix, and I would ask Frank to make some more specific comments.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Chris, I think the short answer is our priorities have not changed. Maybe I'll embellish a
little bit. So clearly, dividends, buybacks continue to remain important parts of our capital allocation. Investing in the
business, you see that in 2014 with our capital deployment for R&D, for launch costs in support of our new products.
Obviously, business development remains a priority, so the priorities haven't changed. And if you look at what we did
with our dividend in December, we increased the dividend from $0.96 to $1.04, an 8.3% increase. We just announced
another $5 billion in repurchases of our shares, so the priorities have not changed. They remain the same.
<A - Ian C. Read>: I would just add to Frank's comment there is I think we see ourselves in a position of well
balanced with optionality and in many directions given our capital structure. Thank you, Frank.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thanks, Ian; operator, next question please.

Your next question comes from Steve Scala from Cowen.
<Q - Stephen M. Scala>: Thank you, two questions. First, I believe there's a pending court decision. So does your
2014 guidance bracket a scenario where generics to Celebrex launch in May of this year, or do the guidance elements
not consider this scenario? And the second question is I know FDA was aware of CAPiTA's design very early on. But
what discussions have you had with ACIP on the design of CAPiTA, and are they comfortable that it did not compare
Prevnar to Pneumovax? Thank you very much.
<A - Ian C. Read>: So, Doug, do you want to comment on the Celebrex situation?
<A - Douglas M. Lankler>: Sure. Obviously, so we have our reissue patent on Cele that takes us through December 2,
2015. And our trial to defend that patent is scheduled to commence on March 19 of this year.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. Do you want to add anything to that?
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Yes, our guidance assumes we have a full year of Celebrex.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you; Albert, on discussions with ACIP?
<A - Albert Bourla>: Yes, as you can imagine, once we have the results, we will determine the best approach to
present the data to ACIP and request a recommendation. We have been in discussions with the CDC and members of
ACIP to ensure their understanding of the protocol and the potential outcomes. So when they have the data, they can
move quickly. The ACIP meets three times per year. I cannot speculate in which meeting they will make a vote.

As regards to your question for how would they compare it with Pneumovax, again, I cannot speculate on that. But if
you look at current practice in immune-compromised adults age 19 years and older where there is a recommendation,
ACIP has recommended routine use of Prevnar 13 administered in addition to Pneumovax.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Albert.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Excellent; next question please, operator.

Our next question comes from Alex Arfaei from BMO Capital Markets.
<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Good morning, thank you for taking the questions and congratulations on the performance. I was
wondering if you could provide us more color on the powering assumptions for CAPiTA. And do you believe there is
still enough residual disease among U.S. adults given that Prevnar 13 has been available for four years and there's
probably significant herd effect? And finally on palbo, is the Phase 2 sufficiently powered to detect a significant
difference? Is there a significant survival difference between the two arms? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you for that question. I believe the CAPiTA design was powered for three endpoints and
would have been designed well aware of the herd effect. So I would ask Albert just to talk through the three endpoints
of CAPiTA. And really the response of ACIP will depend on those endpoints, and that's why we have to wait for the
trial to read out. But I believe it was a very well designed trial powered to achieve – show the results if the product
performs as we expect. And then on the Phase 2, Albert, could you discuss the powering vis-à-vis overall survival?
<A - Albert Bourla>: Yes, as you said, CAPiTA is a large, complex trial. We have 85,000 healthy volunteers. And the
three endpoints are a primary endpoint to demonstrate the efficacy of the product in prevention of first episode of
pneumococcal CAP, community-acquired pneumonia, of course, for vaccine type. And the secondary endpoints are to
demonstrate the same efficacy, in the first episode on non-bacterimic non-invasive CAP, and in invasive pneumococcal
disease. And as you said, the study is very well designed, taking into consideration – everything about study was
post-registration, post-approval obligation with the FDA, so we have consulted with them for the protocol. Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: On the Phase 2, do you want to talk to that, Mikael, perhaps?
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Absolutely, I'll just add one comment. On the herd effect that Alex asked about, actually in
2013 there has been some very useful publication from UK and U.S. that have studied the epidemiology of various
pneumococcal strains. And they have clearly shown that in the adult in particular the older adult population that is
highly vulnerable to pneumococcal, there are a number of Prevnar 13 strains still occurring linked to disease. And
actually, even Prevnar 7 strains are occurring. So it suggests that the older population is more prone to pick up those
strains. And interestingly, some strains that are not causing disease in younger population can cause substantial disease
in the older population, where we also see substantially increased morbidity and also fatal outcomes. So we do believe
that the recent data will favor the view of an existing unmet need in this population. And as Albert alluded to, pending
the read of CAPiTA, this would be the only available study of this size that would show an effect in this population.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Mikael. It's good questions and good to speculate. We'll know by the end of the
quarter and then we can discuss it in more detail; Albert, on the overall survival elbow?
<A - Albert Bourla>: Yes, data for overall survival is event driven, so therefore it's difficult to predict when the final
overall survival data will be complete. Apparently, the study is well powered to catch any differences. We do anticipate
preliminary overall survival data that could be presented at a medical conference in the first half of 2014 together with
the other data.

Your next question comes from John Boris from SunTrust.
<Q - John T. Boris>: Thanks for taking the questions. I just have two. Just on Prevnar 13, you indicated that there are
three times the ACIP meets. What's the earliest meeting, and have you asked the ACIP yet to be a part of the agenda of
any one of those three meetings yet?
And then secondly on palbociclib, if you look at your binding affinity for CDK4 and CDK6, most notably on a cyclin
D1 and D2, for CDK4 it's 11-nanometer and 9-nanometer. In cyclin D6, IC50 is 15-nanometer, which suggests a high
degree of affinity and strongly correlated to efficacy. Is there any way you might be able to contrast that to the activity
of the Novartis and Lilly compounds? And then the second part of that question on palbo is there are some off-target
effects that occur on greater than 30 other kinases. Has the FDA asked you to try and characterize any of those
off-target effects on palbo? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, John. Prevnar 13 ACIP, I think there are three meetings, one in February, one in June,
and one in October. I would find it doubtful we would make the February date. And then when we have the results
we'll immediately engage with ACIP if they can review the results at the earliest point possible. And one would expect
their willingness to do that will depend on the results in many ways. Mikael, there was a comment on John's very
scientific question there on palbo.
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Yes, John, so I'm impressed with your detailed understanding of this kinase inhibitor. And as
you very well articulated, we designed an inhibitor that would have potent activity against both kinases, which I do
think is somewhat unique for palbociclib. All kinases have some off-target activities, but we do believe that the
therapeutic window for palbociclib favors the on-target profile. And if you look at efficacy and tolerability we have
seen so far, the main adverse events related to neutropenia that has been well manageable is very much compatible with
on-target effect for this type of drugs.
<A - Ian C. Read>: And we don't really have enough detail on the competitive products to make any comparisons. Is
that correct?
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Yes, we tend not to comment on other products. That's why I use the term that our inhibitors
are well balanced and have a unique profile in that sense. And I think at this stage of clinical development, as Albert
very well alluded to, we need to understand more from the competitive products and stay advanced in development.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you.

Your next question is from Vamil Divan from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Vamil K. Divan>: Yes, thanks for taking the questions. I have two on the pipeline. For palbo, just you've started
quite a few studies now outside of breast cancer, where I think most of the focus has been. Can you just talk at this
point where you see palbo having the most potential outside of the lead breast cancer indication?
And then second on the PCSK9, just any comments there; you're going into Phase 3. Obviously, it's a large study, a lot
of investment needed there. Given some of the changing guidelines, maybe less of an emphasis on LDL and HDL
target levels, how do you see the value of a PCSK9 program? And would you consider maybe partnering that with
someone just given the amount that you would need to invest there? Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: So good questions. Palbo, Albert, outside of breast cancer you may want to discuss a little bit
about what we're doing there, and then Geno will do the PCSK9 reply.

<A - Albert Bourla>: Vamil, expanding palbo beyond breast cancer is a top priority for us. And given the potential of
this franchise, we are very focused on progressing in other tumor types. There's melanoma, for example. There is an
ongoing Phase 1/2 study of palbo with Zelboraf. And this is conducted by the National Cancer Institute of France, and
this is for BRAF mutations. Also in addition, I'm sure you have seen a recent announcement. We are working with
GSK to evaluate palbo with a MEK inhibitor, in metastatic melanoma this time without BRAF mutations. And this trial
should begin in the first half of the year of 2014.
Now if we look beyond melanoma, we are working with academic centers, including the Dana-Farber Cancer Center,
to evaluate palbo in non-small cell lung cancer, and to have numerous other collaborations and programs in other tumor
types, including squamous non-small cell lung cancer and head and neck cancer.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Albert. Geno, PCSK9?
<A - Geno J. Germano>: On PCSK9, we've initiated our Phase 3 program. It's a broad program, as you can imagine,
with multiple lipid-lowering studies. And we've decided to go into two fairly large outcome studies as well with the
intent to provide the broadest base of data of any of the PCSK9 programs in the patient populations that we believe can
benefit from this therapy. We believe that outcomes trials and the results of the outcome trials are going to determine
the place for these agents in management of patients with cardiovascular risk factors and high cholesterol levels. And
our programs are designed to read out in a similar timeframe of the competitive programs as well. So we're excited
about the program. We're off and running with our Phase 3 program. And we're, at this point, going it alone.

Your next question comes from Andrew Baum from Citi.
<Q - Andrew S. Baum>: Good morning. First on palbo, should I assume that in the absence of any significant OS
benefit from Phase 2, you would not file under accelerated approval? And then in addition, you made some comments
about the manageability of neutropenia. Should I assume that's still the case; i.e., the profile hasn't changed from the
early patient experience? And then finally, you obtained the rights to both tremelimumab and your anti-CD40 together
with use with the vaccines. Do you have any vaccines close to entering clinical development in combination with either
of these two assets? Thank you.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, Andrew. Look, on palbo, I don't think we can assume anything on the path forward
until we see the results, and then we will be in conversations with the FDA. And as you say, overall survival is
event-driven and may take a longer time, but we'll just have to wait for the results and have in-depth discussions with
the FDA. Mikael, do you want to talk about the profile with neutropenia and also then also discuss tremelimumab and
the CD-40?
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Yes, so the type of profile we have reported, which is very well compatible with what you will
see with these type of drugs has been very well manageable in the clinic and seems to be much more tolerable than
previous experience with the drugs used in solid tumors when it relates to hematological suppression. So we feel very
comfortable with the profile and for what has Ian alluded to, to see the final results. And clearly at this stage of
development, it's progression-free survival that will be the dominant endpoint to look for.
In the vaccines area, you're right. We retained use for tremelimumab. Particularly, I would like to underline; that
antibody is part of the platform we are exploring together with unique prostate vaccine antigens and a very
comprehensive delivery method of the vaccine to boost the immune response. Our initial focus is on prostate cancer,
and we aspire to be in human studies by 2015. At that time point, you will actually see a number of Pfizer cancer
immunotherapy approaches move forward based on a panel of different monoclonal antibodies.

Your next question comes from Tony Butler from Barclays.
<Q - C. Anthony Butler>: Thanks very much, good morning, just a brief question. As you late last year made
references to splitting out the units into three different business units, you focused on oncology and vaccines, claiming
that there was the need for laser-like focus on these areas because they clearly are growing substantially above the
corporate rate. That's clearly understandable. You included Consumer at the time. And as I seem to recall, it was either
Frank or you, Ian, made the reference that it was because the manager of the Consumer business would then be the
manager of both. Now that Albert is head of that, does it not now make sense that Consumer be split apart, again
because of this laser-like focus on vaccines and oncology? Thanks very much.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thanks, Tony. I think that structure is important but not overriding. What's overriding is having
really good leaders running the oncology and the vaccine business, having transparency on their results, having
somebody good running Consumer, and then having an overall President who has done tremendously good work in the
Established Products and the Value business and somebody who is a seasoned leader. So I don't really think it's
important vis-à-vis small tweaks in the structure because of changes in leaders, but thank you for the question.

Your next question comes from Seamus Fernandez from Leerink.
<Q - Seamus C. Fernandez>: Thanks a lot. Thanks for the questions. And, Frank, thank you for the incredible detail
on the P&L structures. That was great. But separately, you mentioned that staph aureus showing some preliminary
evidence of efficacy. Can you just give us maybe a little bit of color as to what you were looking for in terms of the
quality of the immune response? Should we anticipate some threshold of real evidence of oxidizing antibodies actually
showing, since it's my understanding that that's what's necessary to really eradicate or fight the disease?
And then separately, as we think about some of the products in earlier stages of development, would you mind just
maybe giving us a little bit of color as to the products in Phase 2 outside of the products that were mentioned on the call
today that might be particularly exciting, particularly as we think about the prospect for combinations in your cancer
portfolio? Thanks a lot.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Okay, thank you, really good questions. So, Mikael, you're a popular man today.
<A - Mikael Dolsten>: Okay, so thank you very much for your interest in staph aureus vaccine. That's based on some
very thorough science that we invested in over the last couple of years. And we identified four different antigens, both
polysaccharide and proteins, that we have shown elicit a high level of antibodies in the [ph] H (58:05) relevant
individuals. And as you discussed, these induced antibodies will both induce what you call opsonization, clearance of
the antibody by the immune system. But also they will interfere with the bacterial function, which is based on some
unique science that we have done for this particular vaccine.
We saw very nice levels of induced antibodies, rapid onset, with really the profile you would like to see before you
vaccinate individuals to go into a surgical environment where they may be stressed and with difficult infection. And I
would like to underline that antibodies cross-react with the large majority of staph aureus strains, including the
multi-resistant strains that can cause devastating outcome of post-[indiscernible] (58:55). So we are very encouraged by
the data and we have shared it with both European and U.S. regulators and we are now in dialogue around a Phase 2b
study that we will invest in to show event reduction of infection in a pre-surgical population.

Concerning your interest in our Phase 2 pipeline, I would like to underline that we have a rich pipeline with a lot of
momentum behind the near-term excitement around palbociclib and [ph] antofloxacin (59:30), just a few highlights.
We have started multiple Phase 2 for our smoothened inhibitor in blood cancers and related blood disorders, an area
that we are very excited about. And we're also moving a gamma secretase inhibitor into triple-negative breast cancer,
where we have seen some very interesting and favorable profiles so far.
In the Xalkori space, we are now dosing patients with a full-on drug that is targeting all known mutations and we think
can have a very exciting profile. We've already moved one antibody drug conjugate into the clinic, and we have several
more that will move into the clinic this year.
In inflammation immunology, we have readouts this year of our best-in-class IL-6 antibody across numerous immune
conditions similar for our MAdCAM antibody and also for our small-molecule dissociated glucocorticoid receptor.
And then in vaccine, we also have noticed favorable Phase 1b data for clostridium difficile, and we are moving forward
with one of our formulations towards Phase 2 initiation this year.
And Ian alluded briefly in his introductory remarks to some extent of the work we're doing into renal diseases, where
we have seen positive Phase 2a data of our novel PD-5 inhibitor. We also moved a second drug, a CCR-25
dual-inhibitor into diabetic nephropathy and diabetic macular edema, underlining the important opportunity, medical
and commercial, we see in this disease.
You may have also noted some other highlights, including a dual-acting inhibitor of uric acid for gout therapy that we
recently acquired through a licensing agreement with Kissei. So I think you will continue to see great momentum
through internal and external partnerships in this area. Thank you for your interest.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you, and of course on top of that we do have the Phase 3 [ph] tofacitinib (1:01:40) and the
Xeljanz data coming out and meningitis B. And so I think it's a strong pipeline across all phases. Thank you, Mikael.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Next question please, operator.

Your next question comes from David Risinger from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Thanks very much. Frank, I appreciated all the detail that you provided. I just wanted to
follow up though. Some potential acquirers of the Established Products business have implied or suggested that Pfizer
can indeed retroactively audit going backwards. And so could you just settle the debate? Could you talk about why
Pfizer cannot retroactively audit going backwards and just explain whether there's any gray area there? That would be
great. Thanks so much.
<A - Frank A. D'Amelio>: Sure. So, Dave, I mentioned before that three years audited financials, and I used the word
prospective. The reason I used the word prospective was if not prospective, then it would have to be some portion of
retrospective. Remember, if you're doing something retrospectively, it's not just an income statement. It's also a balance
sheet. It's a cash flow statement. And these are businesses that in their new construct didn't exist previously to 2014. So
it's the complexity involved in their not existing and the full suite of financial statements required, which is why I said
prospectively.
<A - Charles E. Triano>: Thanks, Frank, and our last question please, operator?

<Q - Damien L. Conover>: Great, thanks for taking the questions, just two quick questions. First on Eliquis, The
Lancet in December published a meta-analysis that looked at the different anticoagulants and really showed little
differentiation among them, obviously better than warfarin. But I wanted to get your sense of the marketing effort and
if you're finding ways to market Eliquis and get a better response over Xarelto and Pradaxa.
And secondly, just a question on the potential breakup of the company. If you look forward to patent losses beyond the
breakup, I'm just trying to get an understanding of how assets might stay within companies or shift companies. For
example with Lyrica, I think the patent loss is 2019. How would something like that – would that stay with the branded
company, or would it shift to the established company? I'm just trying to get a sense of how that strategy might play
out. Thanks.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you. I'll take the second question first and then ask Geno to comment on differentiation and
the confidence one can have in meta-analysis compared to randomized projective trials. So look, I think the way you
see we've set up our divisions now and the transfer of assets is probably similar to what we would do if there was a
separation, but it would depend upon what type of separation it was. Clearly, you would have to operate to maximize
the value initially of Pfizer's shareholders at that time.
And then there would be commercial considerations on how you ensure continuing LOEs get well managed by an
organization that is capable to maximize it. So I think your question is all hypothetical at this time without knowing
exactly how we would, if we do, do any type of breakup or separation. Whether it would be selling to another company
or a spin, that would clearly change the nature of the transactions, et cetera, et cetera. In all cases, we would be focused
on doing what was right for our shareholders and ensuring maximum value. Geno, do you want to add any comments?
<A - Geno J. Germano>: Just to comment on our data sets, our Eliquis data set is really an outstanding data set of
randomized, prospective, controlled clinical trials demonstrating superiority across three important efficacy and safety
endpoints. It's an extremely strong database. Frankly, having randomized trials with those results is the strongest form
of evidence that we could possibly have.
What we're doing with that that's really helping us in the competitive field is taking it to, frankly, the clinicians that can
understand and appreciate the data the best, and that's the specialists, the cardiologists. We've increased substantially
our medical education, our focus on the cardiologists. And as a result, we've seen a nice response. In fact, we use as a
leading indicator new-to-brand prescriptions. And we're watching new-to-brand prescriptions; these are prescriptions
where a patient is getting a new brand. And across all of the business, we're now at over 25% and among cardiologists
we're at about 30%. And we've surpassed Pradaxa and we're growing at a more rapid rate than Xarelto. So we think
we've got good momentum going here, and it's on the back of the excellent data set that we have.
<A - Ian C. Read>: Thank you.
Charles E. Triano
