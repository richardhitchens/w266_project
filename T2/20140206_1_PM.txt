MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, and welcome to the Phillip Morris International Fourth Quarter 2013 Full Year Earnings Conference Call.
Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Phillip Morris International management and the
question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
I will now turn the call over to Mr. Nick Rolli, Vice President of Investor Relations and Financial Communications.
Please go ahead, sir.
Nicholas M. Rolli
Thank you. Welcome. Thank you for joining us. Earlier today, we issued a press release containing detailed
information on our 2013 fourth-quarter and full-year results. You may access the release on our web site at
www.pmi.com.
During our call today, we will be talking about results for the fourth quarter and full-year 2013 and comparing them to
the same periods in 2012, unless otherwise stated. References to PMI volumes are to PMI shipments. Industry volume
and market shares are the latest data available from a number of internal and external sources. Net revenues exclude
excise taxes. Operating Companies Income, or OCI, is defined as operating income excluding general corporate
expenses and the amortization of intangibles, plus equity income or loss in unconsolidated subsidiaries, net. Our OCI
growth rates are on an adjusted basis, which excludes asset impairment, exit and other costs.
Data tables showing adjustments to net revenues and OCI, for currency, asset impairment, exit and other costs, free
cash flow calculations, and adjustments to earnings per share, or EPS, as well as reconciliations to U.S. GAAP
measures are at the end of today's webcast slides, which are posted on our website.

Today's remarks contain forward-looking statements and projections of future results. I direct your attention to the
forward-looking and cautionary statements disclosure in today's presentation and press release for a review of the
various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from projections or forward-looking statements.
It's now my pleasure to introduce André Calantzopoulos, our Chief Executive Officer. Jacek Olczak, our Chief
Financial Officer, will join André for the question and answer period.
André?
André Calantzopoulos
Thank you Nick, and welcome ladies and gentlemen.
As expected, we finished 2013 with a strong fourth quarter. While our cigarette volume declined by 1.9%, excluding
the Philippines, our net revenues and adjusted OCI increased by 2.5% and 12.7%, respectively, excluding currency.
Most importantly, our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew by 19.4% on an ex-currency basis.
Our results were strong across all four regions. Adjusted OCI excluding currency increased in the fourth quarter by
2.6% in the EU region, 22.5% in EEMA, 7.4% in Asia and by 34.9% in the Latin America and Canada region. On a full
year basis, EEMA and Latin America and Canada grew adjusted OCI at a double digit rate in 2013, excluding currency.
For the full-year 2013, our reported diluted EPS reached $5.26. This includes the $0.10 charge for the restructuring of
our business in Egypt, which we announced last week, as well as $0.04 in charges that we had previously disclosed.
Consequently, our adjusted diluted EPS was $5.40 in 2013.
Excluding the unfavorable currency of $0.34 per share, this represents a growth rate of 10% compared to the previous
year's adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.22. Currencies, particularly in emerging markets, continue to be
extremely volatile. At prevailing exchange rates, we project $0.71 in unfavorable currency in our EPS guidance for
2014. Emerging markets account for nearly 60% of this total. The fact that we are currently hedged for approximately
60% of our forecast sales to Japan, with an effective rate of ¥95 to $1, is included in this projection.
Our results confirm that our business fundamentals are robust. However, as I outlined in November, we expect to
continue to face specific challenges in 2014 that also affected our full-year 2013 results. Furthermore, we intend to
make significant investments in and increase expenditures behind our reduced-risk products in preparation for city pilot
tests later this year and our first national launch in 2015, as well as additional investments behind our current portfolio.
Our reported diluted EPS guidance for 2014, at prevailing exchange rates, is in a range of $5.02 to $5.12, versus $5.26
in 2013.
Our 2014 guidance corresponds to a growth rate, excluding currency, of approximately 6% to 8%, compared to our
adjusted diluted EPS of $5.40 in 2013.
Japan is projected to remain a challenging market for us in 2014. The government is increasing the consumption tax in
April from 5% to 8%. The related retail price pass-on is around ¥14 per pack. We have applied to the Minister of
Finance for approval to increase the prices of our Marlboro, Lark and Philip Morris brands by ¥20 per pack and other
brands by up to ¥10 per pack.
Subject to approval by the Minister of Finance, the new prices are expected to take effect on April 1. The new prices
are expected to result in a slight acceleration of the total market decline to around 3% to 3.5% in 2014, compared to 2%
decline of 2013.
Our overall market share declined in 2013 from 27.7% to 26.7%, and to 25.9% in the fourth quarter. This was driven
principally by the success of new competitive products in the menthol segment and was somewhat distorted by the
pipelining of competitive product launches in the fourth quarter.

Marlboro remains resilient and it should be boosted by the roll-out of the Don't Be A Maybe, Be Marlboro campaign,
has been successful in numerous markets in the European Union and other regions. We also have plans to introduce
various new product offers under the Marlboro and Lark trademarks. Barring any unforeseen adverse competitive price
actions, we expect that these launches, coupled with increased spending to support them, should enable us to stabilize
our market share during the year. However, we do expect that our 2014 average share will be below the 2013 average.
The second challenging market in Asia is the Philippines. We estimate the local manufacturer Mighty Corporation is
producing about double the volume that it declares to the Bureau of Internal Revenue. This has prevented us from being
able to operate on a level playing field and continues to result in a significant tax revenue loss for the government. The
planned implementation of a system of fiscal stamps in the second quarter this year will hopefully help to address this
issue.
We are continuing to encourage the authorities to act decisively and welcome the decision of Congress to hold hearings
on this matter, as well as the decision of the Bureau of Customs to suspend the license of Mighty Corporation to
operate a customs bonded warehouse.
Since the end of November, we have seen the Mighty brand stick price gradually rise from PHP1 to PHP1.50 and the
Marvels brand stick price rise to PHP1.25. This is a positive development.
However, their Marvels brand is still selling at a wholesale price of PHP183 per carton, which is below the PHP190
required merely to cover the new excise tax and VAT in force as of January this year. We do not know at this stage
how Mighty Corporation intends to reflect the new tax levels.
On the demand side, the good news is that, while tax-paid industry volume was down by 15.6% to an estimated 86.3
billion units in 2013, Nielsen data indicates that there was only a minor decline in actual consumption. Adult smoking
incidence and adult daily consumption remained at similar levels in the second half of 2013 to those that prevailed in
2012.
In light of the significant tax-driven price increases incurred by Marlboro and Fortune, total consumption was sustained
by adult smoker down-trading to the then PHP1 per stick price segment. This super-low price segment increased its
share from 17.1% in the fourth quarter of 2012 to 41.2% in the same period in 2013, mainly at the expense of our
premium and mid-price brands. While we have enforced our segment participation, our overall market share in the
fourth quarter declined by 14.9 points to 72.3%.
Our ability to enhance our profitability through higher prices remains constrained by the flexibility that Mighty
Corporation derives from its tax under-declaration. In the meantime, the investments we are making to defend our
business are shared with our partner. We continue to hold a clear leading share in a market where annual adult
consumption is estimated at around 100 billion units and we have the brand portfolio and the national distribution to
take advantage of the planned future tax equalization. We thus remain optimistic that, once the current hurdles are
overcome, the Philippines will be a significant contributor to our profit growth in the region.
While discussing Asian markets, let me provide an update on Indonesia, where total industry volume increased by 1.9%
in 2013 to an estimated 308 billion units. The slower industry volume growth can be in large part attributed to the
economic slowdown and the impact of higher fuel and food prices on lower-income adult consumers. In fact, during
2013, the volume of premium and mid-price cigarettes increased by 5.2% and 3.4%, respectively, while the volume of
low-price brands declined by 6.6%. In 2014, we expect industry volume growth to moderate to around 1% due to the
weaker economy and expected significant price increases in the low-price category following the introduction of a new
regulation restricting the preferential tax treatment of so-called sister companies.
In 2013, our market share grew by 0.5 points to 36.1%, driven by the strong performance of our lighter-tasting,
machine-made kretek brands Sampoerna A and U Mild, as well as by Marlboro in the white segment. In the fourth
quarter, their share growth was more than offset by a weaker performance of our hand-rolled kretek brands Dji Sam
Soe and Sampoerna Kretek, due to the segment's decline and the fact that they both sell currently at disadvantageous
price points compared to competitive brands.

In 2014, we expect to benefit from the continued growth of the lighter-tasting, machine-made kretek segment, which
increased by 1.9 points to 40.5% last year and in which Sampoerna A and U Mild had a growing 46.4% segment share.
In addition, we are gaining share in the full-flavor machine-made kretek segment with Dji Sam Soe Magnum. Finally,
we believe that the government's introduction in January of a regional tax of 10% should be manageable as it equates to
a pass-on of between 3% and 6%.
Let me now turn to the European Union region. In the fourth quarter, cigarette industry volume in the region declined
by 5.8%, a rate of decline similar to the third quarter, reflecting a tangible moderation compared to the trend we
witnessed in the first half of 2013. Illicit trade appears to have stabilized, albeit at a high level. The expansion of the
fine-cut category has slowed given the compression of the tax and price differential with cigarettes.
Finally, while still expanding in some markets, such as France, Spain and the UK, the growth in demand for electronic
cigarettes in the region as a whole has decelerated. We therefore expect cigarette industry volume trends to show an
improvement compared to the 7.5% decline in 2013 and are currently forecasting a decline in 2014 in a range of 6% to
7%.
The improvement is taking place in an environment where excise tax increases have been reasonable and structural
improvements continue to take place. The one market of concern is Italy, where the predominantly ad-valorem
structure is encouraging the growth of a super-low €4 per pack price segment and eroding the tax revenue base of the
government. We hope that the Italian government will rapidly address this issue and implement the necessary tax
reform. Until this materializes, we will prudently balance the delicate price, volume and profit equation in Italy.
In 2013, we increased our overall market share in the European Union region by 0.5 points to 38.5%. This was driven
by the strength of our brand portfolio with Marlboro, L&M, Chesterfield and Philip Morris, all gaining share in the
region. We expect this momentum to continue as our market share grew further to 38.6% in the fourth quarter.
Our share gains are very broadly based. We increased our market share in each of the six largest cigarette markets by
volume in the full year 2013. Our continued share momentum positions us well for 2014, when we expect to be able to
again outperform the industry.
I would also like to highlight our strong performance in the EEMA region, notably in Russia.
Our strong pricing actions enabled us to continue to significantly expand our profitability in 2013, even though
cigarette industry volume declined by an estimated 7.6%.
Despite the slower implementation of new retail prices by some of our competitors, we recorded only a modest share
decline of 0.3 points to 26.1%. This was achieved in particular by the continued outperformance of above
premium-priced Parliament.
In January this year, the government implemented the next planned and largest excise tax increase, resulting in an
average pass-on of RUB8 a pack. In anticipation, we increased most of our maximum retail selling prices by RUB9 per
pack in December last year, though prices will only go up at retail later this month.
For the full-year 2014, we expect to continue to expand our profitability at a high single-digit rate, even though
cigarette industry volume is expected to decline by between 9% and 11%, reflecting price elasticity, illicit trade and a
weaker economy.
Cigarette industry volume in Turkey was impacted by significant trade loading at the end of 2012 and by an increase in
illicit trade in 2013. As a result, industry volume declined by an estimated 7.6% last year, while we estimate that the
underlying decline was approximately 3.5%. Provided there is no further increase in illicit trade, we expect underlying
cigarette industry volume to stabilize in 2014.
Our share has remained resilient in the face of increased price competition in the low and super-low price segment,
with a decline of just 0.2 points to 45.5% in 2013. We successfully line-extended Chesterfield into the super-low price
segment and continued to improve our mix, thanks to the success of Parliament in the premium and Muratti in the
mid-price segment.

This January, the government increased the specific excise tax and the minimum tax, while maintaining the ad-valorem
rate unchanged. This resulted in a pass-on of around TRY0.28 per pack at the retail level. We increased the prices of
our brands by around TRY0.50 on average, thus boosting our unit margin.
We achieved strong results across our Latin America and Canada region with share gains in Argentina, Brazil, Canada
and Colombia and a stable 73.5% market share in Mexico.
Looking at our top 30 OCI markets worldwide, we increased our share in 2013 by 0.5 points to 34.9%. Our market
share grew or was stable in 23 of these markets, further emphasizing that our underlying business remains strong.
Marlboro has been a key driver of this excellent share momentum. In 2013, excluding China and the Philippines,
Marlboro gained share in all four regions, with particularly strong performance not only in the EU region, but also in
the Latin America and Canada region and across North Africa.
Our strong market share momentum should enable us to improve our volume performance in 2014 and outperform the
industry. In 2013, we estimate that global cigarette industry volume, excluding the USA and China, declined by 3%.
This year, we are forecasting a decline in a range of 2% to 3%.
Pricing was the key driver behind our income improvement, excluding currency, in 2013. We achieved a pricing
variance of $2.1 billion. This was above our historical average, reflecting the timing of tax-driven price increases and
unusually large gains due to inventory movement, most notably in the Philippines. In 2014, we expect these gains to be
lower. Consequently the first quarter's EPS growth rate, excluding currency, is expected to be below our average for the
year.
Please note that, as of today, we have implemented or announced almost 60% of the pricing that is built into our 2014
earnings per share guidance.
While revenue growth remains the key driver of our business growth, we continue to be very focused on cost controls
and productivity gains. Our adjusted OCI margin increased by 0.6 points in 2013, excluding currency, from 45.4% to
46%.
This is in part attributable to the successful completion of cost savings and productivity improvement programs, which
generated over $300 million in 2013. We target a further $300 million in annual productivity gains in 2014, which
should moderate inflationary input cost increases.
We have recently completed four business development projects that will be accretive to earnings in 2014. We
repurchased the remaining 20% shareholding from our business partner in Mexico. We took a 49% participation in
Arab Investors-TA, which is involved in the manufacturing and distribution of international brands of cigarettes in
Algeria. We purchased a 20% shareholding in our Russian distributor, Megapolis, and finally, we have restructured our
business in Egypt to enhance our growth and income potential in this 80 billion unit market.
These business development projects are expected to have a net positive EPS impact of approximately $0.10 in 2014.
In 2013, we increased our free cash flow, excluding unfavorable currency, by 11.8% to $9.4 billion. As foreseen, the
growth rate exceeded that of net earnings, driven largely by a reduction in working capital.
In 2014, we expect free cash flow to be unfavorably impacted by currency and a foreseen increase in working capital at
the end of this year attributable to the timing of excise tax increases and related inventory movements.
We remain committed to generously rewarding our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share
repurchases. In September last year, we increased our dividend by a further 10.6%, bringing the cumulative increase
since 2008 to 104.3%. Our target dividend pay-out ratio remains an attractive 65% and our dividend yield last Friday
was 4.8%.
Last year, we spent $6 billion to repurchase 67.2 million shares. We also spent over $2 billion on the four business
development opportunities that I described. As a result, and given both the projected significant unfavorable currency

impact on our reported results in 2014 and the fact that we are approaching the high end of the ratios supporting our
credit rating, we are scaling back our target share repurchases in 2014 to $4 billion. Please note that the rating agencies
use different methodologies, some preferring to use gross rather than net debt measures and some weighting the
company's cash position differently from others.
As we emphasized last November, 2014 is going to be a pivotal year for reduced-risk products, our greatest growth
opportunity. Last month, we announced that we are building a new manufacturing facility near Bologna, Italy, that,
along with a pilot plant in the same area, will provide an annual capacity of up to 30 billion units. The associated
capital expenditures of up to €500 million are within the previously disclosed range of €500 million to €600 million.
This year we will obtain the results of the clinical trials that we started in 2013. The data from these studies will be an
essential part of our evidence package to substantiate the use of our Platform 1 product results in a biological impact
profile close to that of cessation. During the first half of this year, we will continue with our perception and behavioral
studies and finalize the packaging and labeling in anticipation of planned city pilot tests in the second half of 2014 and
our first national launch in 2015. In addition, we plan to enter the electronic cigarette market during the second half of
2014.
As previously disclosed, we will increase our reduced-risk product related expenditures in R&D, operations and
commercial activities by more than $100 million this year in order to meet this accelerated schedule.
In conclusion, 2014 will be a very important year, as we increase our investments behind both our conventional and our
reduced-risk products. The outlooks for the Philippines and for the EU region as a whole is improving, while Japan
remains a significant challenge. We enter 2014 with robust fundamentals and good market share momentum behind our
superior brand portfolio led by Marlboro. In addition, our profitability will benefit from the four business development
projects that I outlined. However, currency volatility in emerging markets has increased significantly and we are only
one month into the year.
Our expectation is that we should be able, as of 2015, to meet our annual currency-neutral net revenues and adjusted
OCI targets. Of course, the level of our share repurchases will depend on the impact of exchange rates, the interest rate
environment and corporate tax reform here in the U.S.
There are a number of important factors that underpin our belief: sequential improvements in the performance of
challenging markets, in particular the Philippines; further structural improvements in excise tax systems, notably in the
EU region; our superior brand portfolio, led by a re-invigorated Marlboro; strong pricing power based on our brands;
an increased focus on cost controls and productivity gains; and our commercialization of reduced-risk products.
Finally, our strong free cash flow will be used to reward our shareholders through generous dividends and share
repurchase programs.
Thank you. Jacek and I will now be happy to answer your questions.
Q&A

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of David Adelman with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Hi, André.
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Hi, David.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: A couple of quick things, André. First, on the dividend, it's obviously a board decision, but
do you think there is a willingness this year to further take the payout ratio above the 65% target so that there could be
dividend growth?

<A - André Calantzopoulos>: I mean, David, you said it yourself, it's a board decision. However, the board takes into
consideration a number of factors, 65% target being one, and clearly, if you look at our history, we have a history of
rewarding generously our shareholders even in turbulent times, that's all I can tell you.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Okay. And then, André, in the Philippines, you gave a lot of statistics and data, but could
you explain – if you don't look necessarily at declared tax volume by your competitor, what really ultimately matters to
you is what's being reflected in the marketplace in terms of competitive pricing. And if you were to benchmark
Mighty's price point versus Marlboro or Mighty's price point versus Fortune, how much progress has there been made,
how much more evident does it appear as if there is competitively reflecting reality?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: David, clearly there is an improvement, as I also said my remarks. Clearly, we have
seen the price of the Mighty brand that represents 70% of the portfolio of Mighty Corporation going up to PHP1.50,
although the price per carton does not yet reflect the second excise tax increase, if we speak about reasonable
economics returns. What has also happened is that they left behind one of their brands called Marvels that represents
30% of their portfolio and roughly 6% to 7% of the market. And until this brand also goes to the right price point and
price gap, clearly, we're also obliged to maintain some presence in this segment. Okay?
So in summary, this is all about achieving the right price gaps, as I have previously explained. But in general, to fix the
price gaps, either you do it from the top or from the bottom. It appears that some progress is made to achieve this from
the bottom. We need to wait until the new tax is reflected across the Mighty Corporation portfolio, and then, as I said,
there may be some upside in there.
Now, they're still under-declaring from what we understand, based on Nielsen and their tax stamp, controls a very large
part, roughly half of their volume which helps them subsidize the lower price. So, there is progress, there is increasing
pressure on them. There are hearings in the Congress and also the fact that they lost their bonded warehouse, which we
understand they are used to kind of declare that the products or the raw materials are for export, but essentially been
used locally, so the pressure is mounting. So we are kind of optimistic, but we will know better as the year unfolds.
Also to say, if we look at the outlook for next year, clearly, I think in terms of Philippines, probably will reach the
bottom of the negative impact, and we can only grow better next year, both in comparative but even in absolute terms.
<Q - David J. Adelman>: Great. Thank you.
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe was Stifel.
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Hi, Chris. Hello?
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Good afternoon. Can you hear me okay?
<A - Nicholas M. Rolli>: Yes. We can hear you.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. Thank you. I wanted to ask you first, André, in relation to the Philippines and
having the government pressuring the company and obviously the price point still being too low, but can you give us
information about the warehouse being shut down or taking the license away, is that not forcing like a more immediate
movement by the company to raise prices at retail, if that's not happening as quickly as maybe you thought it would?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: A difficult question to answer. Yes. The pressure should be there, because it's
becoming extremely visible to the general public and the media. So we should expect some move, but we need see this
move, that's all. Okay?
Now the other limitation on the Philippines, I explained in previous times, is that as, over the long term the tax system
clearly is relocked in our favor because it closes the gaps top to bottom in a normal operating market, and also allows

us as the two tax years equalize to unleash a bit more pricing power of the mid-price brands, because today, the
mid-price brands are bound by the way the excise tax or the price of the different excise tax layers is calculated, which
as you take the retail price, your remove VAT and the excise tax and the government ignores completely the retail
margin, which as we know is pretty hefty, it can get up to 20%. And that's the price, the net ex-factory price that
determines the price tier in which you are classified.
And we have to be very careful of how much pricing we can take for Fortune for example not to jump in the upper tier.
As the two tiers close over time one or two years then you have much more pricing power from that perspective.
Another development also that is positive in the Philippines, good, at least, is that there will be tax stickers
implemented towards the end of the first half of the year. We have to see how this impacts Mighty, but definitely is
another positive. So that's why longer term, we're very optimistic about the Philippines, but still, this year, it has the
impact I described on our profitability was about one growth point.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. That's color, thank you. I just had a quick follow-up question for you on Japan. I
understand that you are calling it still a significantly challenged market was the term you used. It seems like you're
going to get some pricing through – I just want to be clear is that going to be more than the tax increase? And if that is
the case even if volumes declined a little bit more than the 2% underlying rate, wouldn't that make for a better Japan in
2014 maybe than what you assumed before?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: This is very early days in Japan. We have submitted our request to the Ministry of
Finance, but it is subject to approval by the Ministry of Finance. If that holds, and we hope it will, yes, it will give some
positive pricing in Japan. However, we need to put this in the context of – and that depends also what other competitors
are doing of some additional potential impact on our share, and also the fact that we may need to put some promotional,
additional money to support that price level. So again, it's early days, it's subject to approval by the Ministry of
Finance, but there is some small upside over there.
<Q - Christopher R. Growe>: Okay. Thank you very much for the answers.

Our next question comes from line of Judy Hong with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Thanks. Hi, everyone.
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Hi, Judy.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: So, André, we can appreciate the fact that you're willing to invest some more into the business in
2014 to compete more effectively in some of your challenged markets. If I take a step back though, one of the drivers
that's causing you to perhaps spend a little bit more is maybe the emergence of some of the newer competition whether
it's the local discount player like Mighty or JTI getting more aggressive in Japan or you've got the illicit trade that's
picked up. So, I just want to get your perspective on why you think you're confident that the spending you're making in
2014 is really enough to put you in a position to compete more effectively to drive the company to grow in line with
your long-term target in 2015 and beyond?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Okay. First of all, the investment as we described is, one part is growing behind our
reduced-risk product. Okay? And clearly, this is longer term as we will start seeing some volume in these products at
the end of 2015.Now, regarding the existing business, of course, there is need for investment in Japan, and that is also
to support our product introductions, maybe Marlboro campaign and other initiatives that I described. And some other
markets where business needs are ramping the investment, for example, Indonesia, that's part of our normal business
spending. Now clearly, the investment in the Philippines is another type of investment. It's not a promotional or
marketing investment, it's more investing in our margins by holding the right price gaps, and that's where the big
investment is. As I explained, this one, I believe this year clearly we see the bottom of the problem, and we can grow
significantly out of this, just remaining flat year-to-year in the Philippines in terms of profitability will increase by 1%

growth, it's a swing of two growth points, okay?
I think also that for 2015, one element is that our cost base in terms of manufacturing costs will gradually improve.
Already, if we see the growth of our manufacturing costs, it was 3.8% in 2013. It went down to 3.2% – it's going down
to 3.2% this year and will further decrease next year, and that's a positive addition. The conditions in Europe, I think
will slightly improve. We still have strong price base, and we have a number of portfolio initiatives, including new
initiatives on Marlboro that I will describe in more detail in CAGNY. All that makes me fairly confident that as of 2015
we can reach our revenue and operating company income targets.
And I don't even take into consideration Japan, which can certainly improve compared to the impact we have this year
as we are lapping the years, where the actual product introductions happened in Japan and where Japan Tobacco got
their fair share of excitement, which, I remind everybody, they were not existing before. Thank you.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Okay. And then just on the share buyback outlook for 2014, I can appreciate you are sort of
looking at the rating agencies and the metrics that they look at. We also looked at your stock price and valuation and it
seems like really an opportune time certainly if the fundamentals are improving, as we expect them to, that it might be
more of an opportune time to get more aggressive on the buybacks. So I would just want to understand kind of your
thinking process on the moderation in terms of the buyback. Is it really the currency issue, are you willing to take on
more U.S. dollar denominated debt to kind of fund the buyback? What's sort of the thinking process there?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: I mean, currency clearly plays an important role here. Different agencies look at ratings
in different ways. As I said, ranging from total debt to EBITDA to net debt or adjusted net debt. And one element in the
adjusted net debt is that rating agencies start taking cash [indiscernible] (41:15) at a discount because I mean, applying
a theoretical, say corporate income tax rate if that cash were to be repatriated in the U.S. So that reduces the capacity.
And you can do the math very easily yourself.
The currency impact, we just announced at prevailing rates if that is to stick for the year, it's one point at the cash flow
level is roughly $1.1 billion, and at your EBITDA level is $1.35 billion, $1.4 billion. So that takes a lot of share
repurchase capacity out. And as the year unfolds, we need to reevaluate the situation. So the other thing we need to note
is we have $2 billion of business development projects that we just accomplished. And frankly speaking, they're much
more accretive to the shareholders than the share buybacks.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: The $2 billion – that's the $0.10 accretion that you called out in the...?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: It is net.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: It's the net, okay.
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: It's the net of the impact it has on the lesser share repurchase.
<Q - Judy E. Hong>: Understood. Okay, got it. Thank you.
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: It's much better than share repurchase.

Our next question comes from the line of Jon Leinster with UBS.
<Q - Jonathan S. Leinster>: Good afternoon, gentlemen. Just to follow on, just to clarify, again I apologize for this,
on the share repurchase, when you say getting towards the high end of your ratios with the credit rating agencies, do
you mean that by the end of 2014 you will be toward the high end and/or currently and therefore, in essence you are
flagging that perhaps in 2015 that they will have the cash returns or – will have to be more in line with cash flow and
leverage held sort of more flat in 2015. Is that a reasonable assumption?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Well, first of all, our current ratios are already at close the upper end, and had we
continued with the $6 billion share buyback, we would've exceeded ratios during the year if the currencies remain

where they are today, okay? So this is one of the reasons, because where we reiterated that we want to absolutely
maintain our rating, we had to moderate our share repurchase program.
Now, looking at 2015, is a bit early days to say exactly what the target share buyback is going to be. I mean I would
like to see how the situation with the currencies unfolds during the years, and then we'll take a decision later on. It's a
bit very early to call it. Clearly, we are committed to share buybacks, and the corridor in which we operate is on one
side a credit rating upper limit, and on the other side, 100% cash outflow to our shareholders through dividends and
share buybacks, and we will always operate within that corridor in the future, okay? And that depends on currencies,
interest rates, and longer term tax reforms in the U.S., I'm stating the obvious, okay?
<Q - Jonathan S. Leinster>: But you are going to maintain that credit rating?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Yes.
<Q - Jonathan S. Leinster>: Okay. Secondly, the Latin America and Canada region in the fourth quarter looks very
strong profit performance in the fourth quarter. Is there anything, can you detail anything in particular that's behind that
– in particular market or...?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: It's a bit across the market, okay? And it's also depending on the timing of price
increases Argentina, as you know, Argentina is an inflationary environment, and we need approval from the Ministry of
Finance all the time, Minister of Economy. So sometimes you have a delayed approval and that's partially what
happened also in last quarter, we got the approval later and so we had to time differently the price increases. That's
nothing to point.
<Q - Jonathan S. Leinster>: Right. And lastly, just on the EU, I mean if the EU volumes are down sort of 5.5% or
thereabouts in the second half of 2013, why do you expect to get somewhat worse in 2014 sort of 6% to 7%?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: This is the best we can see to-date, okay? There's still some pricing that has to take
place. The situation clearly looks slightly better these last two quarters, and I hope it's going to be confirmed in the first
quarter of 2014, okay? So that's the forecast to the best of my knowledge today.
<Q - Jonathan S. Leinster>: Right, but there is no change in terms of – there is no obvious signs that the governments
particularly in Southern Europe are cracking down on illicit or something has changed in the market?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Look, we don't have the latest, latest figures of the global survey in the European
Union, but what I hear from the different markets, it seems to have stabilized. Clearly, it has improved in Italy. Slightly
up in France. We see stability, although the base remains high, so I think that if this doesn't get lost during the year, and
frankly, we don't have disruptive taxes or – in the European Union, maybe we'll be slightly better. But today, I cannot
confirm that. I want a quarter more to be in a position to confirm.
<Q - Jonathan S. Leinster>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from line of Erik Bloomquist with Berenberg.
<Q - Erik A. Bloomquist>: Hi. Good afternoon. Firstly, with respect to the foreign exchange headwind, could you
break apart in that 13% or $0.71 how much is transactional and within that, how much is related directly to Japan? And
then with respect to the transactional component, at prevailing rates, is it fair to think that that would disappear in
2015?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Okay. Look, I can't give you the absolute precise number for the breakdown, but
between translation and transactional, I think we're 80% to 20%, but Jacek is here, he can give you the breakdown.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: No, you're right. André is right, last year, it's about 80% of our impact was coming from the
translations and the remaining 20% was the transactions. With regards to the impact in our $0.71 per share, currency

impact, about a 30% of the $0.71 versus the last year is coming from the yen and the 70% is essentially across all
currencies, and then there is a strong impact coming from Indonesian rupiah, ruble, Turkish lira and a number of other
currencies.
<Q - Erik A. Bloomquist>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Jacek Olczak>: Thank you.
<Q - Erik A. Bloomquist>: And then with respect to the plain packaging, I was just wondering if you could comment
on an article that appeared in The Scotsman, suggesting that PMI was suggesting if plain packaging was passed in
Scotland, that country could be liable for n500 million in compensation for the intellectual property. I was wondering
what does that imply then if plain packaging goes forward in markets like Ireland and the UK, can we gross up the
amounts that might be expected based on the volumes there? And then I was just wondering what the status was of the
WTO challenge and the BIT arbitration? Thank you.
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Okay. The article you are referring to, Erik, I have no idea. Frankly speaking, it's pure
speculation, because I haven't seen or articulated any related number, okay? First of all, we are far away from being in
this situation, as you know, both in the UK and Ireland, it's just political talk for the time being and I don't see any new
evidence that has appeared in the horizon to justify even the UK reopening the issue. I mean, now coming to the real
concrete case we have in front of us, which is Australia, okay?
If you look at the facts in Australia, is that plain packaging has no impact on prevalence or incidence after a year it is in
the market, okay? And I don't know where you can find stronger evidence about the impact. And, yes, we see a little bit
of down trading, but we had foreseen this and that's part of what we explained in the BIT case. Regarding the cases,
WTO is proceeding, and the BIT case, if I'm not mistaken, a first hearing after submissions of written arguments from
both parties is towards the end of February, actually this month, so we'll see how this unfolds. But as we always said,
this is not a process that is going to take months. It's going to take a year and a half, two years, okay?
<Q - Erik A. Bloomquist>: Okay, thank you. My last question then was with respect to illicit and I was just wondering
– I appreciated the comments on illicit in Europe, but how would you characterize it globally for PMI's markets? And
related to that, what are the prospects for recapturing illicit volume and what are the factors necessary for that? Thanks.
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Look, the only outburst of illicit is clearly the Philippines, okay? And I think I have
explained lengthily the situation. We're all aware of the problem. But that's illicit trade in a different form. And that's a
form we see increasingly in some places. And that's probably the form that is the easiest finally to address, because it
takes action from the government. A painful process in the Philippines, but that can be addressed. For the rest of the
illicit trade, which is essentially illicit-wide, I think we're making very good, we always said that the best way to
address this is through the supply chain and especially [indiscernible] (52:55), and I think we are making very good
progress in that area.
Not yet done, but the progress, the awareness amongst the companies that produce [indiscernible] (53:07) and their
efforts, I'm fairly confident and hopefully that by the end of the year, we'll see tangible results. And that's one of the
best ways to tackle the illicit trade. I think that our prospects to reduce the illicit trade our objective is over the next one
to two years to stabilize it, and we're working with many governments as you know around the planet to achieve this.
And then gradually reduce it, but even stabilizing it is a great thing to achieve.

<Q - Thilo Wrede>: André, I think at this time last year you had already 75% of the pricing that you needed for your
guidance take and you just said that you are now at 60%. Can you give us a few details why it's so much lower?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Just timing of things. There's nothing particular that I can point to, okay? As we said
last year, we had a bit more of inventory movement in the Philippines. That was lower this year because the tax
increase was lesser, okay? That's one thing. And the rest is pure timing. Indonesia is every year the same, we start with
the tax at the beginning of the year and gradually increase, so nothing particular to worry about.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: So we shouldn't read into it that you are maybe taking a more cautious approach to your pace of
price increases?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: No. I think our pricing policy is very simple. We take a lot of factors into consideration,
affordability, price gaps, excise tax, and our pricing is, as every year, very strong, and I think I explained in my
remarks, slight differences compared to this year.
<Q - Thilo Wrede>: Okay. And then the other question I had in your conclusion of your prepared remarks, you
pointed out that you expect to get back to your normal growth rate for revenue and operating income in 2015. You
didn't mention EPS, is there a reason for that?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: It is that EPS depends on our share repurchases, okay? And that's the bridge. And I
explained what are the driving factors behind our decisions in share repurchases. So in any given time, we may be
slightly above or slightly below that bridge. And as I said, it is too early to call next year, okay?

Our next question comes from line of Michael Lavery with CLSA.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: Hello.
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Hello, Michael.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: We've covered the Philippines fairly well, but I just wanted to get one more question on
that about the Marlboro Flavor Code launch in Mindanao. Have you seen that have a big impact there? Is it helping
drive share? What's your thinking about how that's positioned and how it's working so far?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: It's early days, and the launch is both tactical and strategic. So it's not meant yet to be
expanded, so we'll see how it reacts there. But that's kind of hedging also the price gaps in the Philippines.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: Thank you. That is helpful. In terms of margins or the cost structure, how different is it
and what kind of impact is it to the mix of your business?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: I can't answer about the margin. The margins are not very different, but, look, this is a
very small volume, okay? So I don't think that impacts our margins. We have bigger cats to skin in the Philippines, as I
said, by maintaining artificially low price for a period of time, brands like Jackpot, for example, where we have to
subsidize to a large degree the excise tax. And that's much more impactful. And if we correct this, that will swing the
profitability much more than Marlboro Flavor Code.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: Okay, great. Thank you. And then just looking at Indonesia in 3Q when the inflation
pressure on the consumer was the strongest and the category growth was the weakest, you gained share sequentially
and year-over-year even despite having such a premium skew to your portfolio. Can you describe what changed in 4Q
that it would have gone down and what does it look like going forward, if there are some new competitive launches that
are driving it or what are the big factors there?

<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Well, I think the important thing is the performance, as I said in my remarks, of Dji
Sam Soe and Sampoerna A the two hand-rolled kretek brands that crossed during the middle of the year the price
points, and competitive brands in the same category have not yet crossed that point. I don't know exactly their pricing,
but logic says that during the second half of this year, they should cross that point. And that should help our share,
okay? For the rest, the other brands in the portfolio are doing very well. And as I also said, we're increasing the
marketing support of the brands, so I'm fairly optimistic about the share situation in Indonesia.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: But is it likely to have pressure in 1H 2014 driven from those two brands until the price
gaps – until the price points on competitors cross some of the same thresholds?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Sorry, I didn't hear the question?
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: You said that the competitors' price points are likely to catch up crossing some of the
same thresholds in the second half of this year. So is there likely still a lot of pressure in the first half? How do you see
that playing out?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: I don't know how competitors are pricing. I cannot predict this obviously. But
Indonesia, in general, has – the tradition is, as I explained previously, that at the beginning of the year, your price is
covering the excise tax increases, and then you get net pricing during the year. You always have gradual pricing in
Indonesia during the year, okay? So as the year unfolds, we have our plan for pricing. I would expect also given the
excise tax and continuous pressure from the clubs that other manufacturers are going to have a similar approach. So,
yes, we will be probably under some pressure for the next few months, but overall, we can see moderate share gains
during the full year.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: Okay. No, that's helpful. Clove prices I know were an issue last year. They are not –
there is not a whole lot of visibility on those, but it does look like they are down from the peak levels pretty nicely.
How are you positioned there? Is that a tailwind in 2014?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: I wouldn't say they're lower in rupee terms, clearly with the devaluation in dollar terms
they have come in a little bit down. Now [indiscernible] (61:31) in the market. We are quite, I would say lucky this
year that we had a second year of a very decent crop, but if you look at the impact on us, we had a very big impact on
our costs in 2012. 2013 is going down and as we annualize the inventory replenishment, the impact is going to be even
lower in comparative terms next year. So we see rather price stability rather than price going down.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: Okay, that is great. Thanks. And then just back to Japan pricing, could you give a sense
– I know you talked about how it looks like that the applications you have put in should give some net pricing. What is
the split in the portfolio? Is my math about right that that would be around a 4%-ish increase? And if so, how much of
that do you see maybe being at risk of trading down? What kind of net – if your applications are approved, what kind of
net pricing do think you might realize?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Yes. Day one, if you do the math, it's around 4%, all right? But then the way also the
Minister of Finance is looking at it is, what's the end result is going to be including share some down trading from that
portfolio. So, as I said previously, there will be some share movement, and as I also said, we will put some additional
promotional money for a period of time, but overall, if these prices are accepted, we will have some net positive.
<Q - Michael Scott Lavery>: Okay, great. Thank you very much.

<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: My first question has to do with Indonesia. I think it seems reasonable enough to expect
that that market will decelerate a little bit further into 2014. But can you offer a little bit more detail about kind of how
you are thinking about the macro landscape in that market just to give us comfort on that plus one given the challenges
you had with guidance in that market last year? And specifically, are you expecting a reduction in the subsidy for fuel
because there are some chatter about that in the market?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Okay. Look, the positives about Indonesia is, it has positive demographics. And also, I
think long-term, the country has a lot of potential and we've seen that there is up trading this year – the last year, and I
expect up trading to continue this year. We have some particular issues. The first one is the disappearance of the low
tax tier, in shortcut we call the sister companies. That has a 3 billion cigarette impact on us and would discontinue these
brands, actually. But as our competitors are much more effected, and, clearly, it's either you discontinue these brands or
you take very substantial price increases, which I think is reasonable to assume it will have some impact on total
market this year, okay?
This is one of the key factors why we have predicted, it's a prediction, 1% total market growth. The other one is the
devaluation of the currency is bringing inflation and many of the goods in Indonesia including fuel are important, so we
are seeing some inflation happening that again unfortunately hits the low end consumers. So if we see some
deceleration is at the low price segment and these are the factors that I can describe today, but long-term, as I
explained, I think the country has tremendous potential.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Understood. So just to clarify, embedded in your guidance is there no expectation for a
change to fuel subsidies, it's just the inflation?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: I mean, to be honest with you, Vivien, I don't take the fuel subsidies...
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Sure.
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: ...actions because I don't know how to factor them in.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Yeah.
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: But try to bake in all these factors I described, and that's the best guess we have.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Okay, that's reasonable. Yes, it's complicated math to be sure. Turning to Russia really
quickly, you called out price elasticity is one of the factors driving the 9% to 11% and I just wanted to clarify is it just
normal price elasticity or is it a change in price elasticity in Russia that's causing your outlook for a down 10% for
industry volumes at the midpoint?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: I think we – if I recall correctly, we took a slightly higher price elasticity given the
magnitude of the increases, we need to look at the history of Russia where – with a tax plan, which is very welcome,
because it gives us predictability. We have three subsequent years of very substantial tax and price increases. So it's not
only one year, it's three years, and I think it's reasonable to assume some higher elasticity.
Now whether 9% to 11% is the final number, we'll see as the quarters unfold, okay? I want to remind you two things.
First, that this is the last year of large tax increases, and we should be looking at a better tax environment, although
continuously predictable as of 2015 and beyond. And secondly, despite this projected quite large volume decline, we
also, as I said my remarks, foresee a pretty substantial profitability growth in Russia due to margin improvement.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Understood. A follow-up on Russia, embedded in that outlook, are you seeing any negative
impact of volumes from the implementation of wave one of the indoor smoking bans in that market?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Marginally, it's always the case. We have put this in our guidance, obviously, okay?
And we also have, as I explained previously, this year the disappearance of some of the kiosks where although difficult
to say that this will have an impact on total consumption. We'll have to see also what it really does in terms of impact
on consumers. But all this is part of our estimate.
<Q - Vivien Nicole Azer>: Wonderful. Thank you very much.

Our final question comes from the line of Ryan Oksenhendler with Bank of America.
<Q - Ryan Eric Oksenhendler>: Good afternoon, guys.
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Good afternoon, Ryan.
<Q - Ryan Eric Oksenhendler>: André, a question I guess going back to the long-term targets in 2015 and I guess
even beyond that, in November you laid out the potential adult user base and margin potential for reduced-risk product.
When thinking about your growth targets for OCI because I guess EPS will be impacted by FX, but is getting back to
the target growth rate contingent upon the success of reduced-risk product or is that incremental?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Look, if we look at 2015, clearly, the contribution of reduced-risk products is rather de
minimis. And we will be in investment mode because of the expansion or the introduction of reduced-risk products for
the next two, three years, okay? So reality is for the time being, the investment is going against our numbers. So at least
once we come even and breakeven on this, the rest is incremental clearly. But for the time being, we're negative on
reinvestment and we appreciate that, so.
<Q - Ryan Eric Oksenhendler>: You feel comfortable about your targets in 2015 and 2016?
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Yes.
<Q - Ryan Eric Oksenhendler>: Got it. I'll leave it there, guys. Thanks.
<A - André Calantzopoulos>: Okay.

That was our final question and I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing
remarks.
