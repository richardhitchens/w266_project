MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to Devon Energy's second quarter earnings conference call. At this time all participants are in a listen only
mode. After the prepared remarks we will conduct a question and answer session. This call is being recorded.
At this time I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Vince White, Senior Vice President of Communications and
Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Vincent W. White
Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to Devon's second quarter earnings call and webcast.
Today's call will follow our usual format. I'll cover a few preliminary items then our President and CEO, John Richels,
will comment on the quarter. Following that, Dave Hager, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide the operations
update; and then we'll have a financial review by our CFO, Jeff Agosta. We'll follow that up with a Q&A session. And
I'll point out that our Executive Chairman, Larry Nichols; as well as Darryl Smette, who is the Head of Marketing,
Midstream and Supply Chain, are both with us today to join in the Q&A. We'll conclude the call after one hour.
During the call today we're going to update some of our forward-looking estimates based on the actual results that
we've seen in the first half of the year and our revised outlook for the second half of 2013, but we are not planning to
issue a new 8-K. We will, however, post any updated estimates that we provide during the call today on the guidance
page of our website. If you go to our website, you can just click on the guidance link within the Investor Relations
section and all of our guidance is summarized there.
All references today to our plans, forecasts, expectations and estimates are forward-looking statements under U.S.
Securities Law, and they are, of course, subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties. Many of these are

beyond our control and I'll point out that these are not statements – these statements aren't guarantees of future
performance. You can see a discussion of the risk factors relating to these estimates in our Form 10-K.
Also on today's call we will reference certain non-GAAP performance measures, and when we do that, we're required
to provide certain related disclosures. Those can be found on Devon's website.
Before I turn the call over to John, I'll point that out both earnings and cash flow for the second quarter significantly
beat Street estimates. Our non-GAAP earnings climbed to $1.21 per diluted share. That's more than double the earnings
we reported in the year-ago period and it exceeded the Wall Street consensus by about 30%. Cash flow climbed to $1.4
billion for the quarter, the highest level in the last six quarters, and that also comfortably beat Street expectations.
Overall from both an earnings and cash flow perspective, it was an excellent quarter for Devon.
At this point I'll turn the call over to President and CEO, John Richels.
John Richels
Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone.
As Vince just mentioned, we had an outstanding second quarter. In addition to benefiting from the substantial
improvement in realized prices during the quarter, we exceeded the top end of our production guidance. At the same
time, our year-to-date cost metrics are tending towards the low end of the forecast range. This is all strong evidence of
the successful execution of our business plan as we continue to grow our high margin oil production.
Let me begin today by reviewing some of the highlights of the quarter. In the second quarter, we increased
company-wide oil production 14% compared to the second quarter of 2012 and 4% compared to last quarter. This
growth was driven entirely by high margin, light oil production from our U.S. assets, which increased a robust 36%
year-over-year. With the success we've had in growing our oil production, we now expect liquids production to exceed
45% of total volumes by year-end. That's up from just 30% just a few years ago.
In the second quarter, total company-wide production from our North American asset base hit an all-time record
averaging 698,000 equivalent barrels per day. This exceeded the midpoint of our guidance by 3% and topped the upper
end of our forecast range by 8,000 barrels per day. Based on the results of the first half of the year, we now expect our
full year 2013 production to be near the top end of our guidance range for the year. Jeff will cover the production
guidance in a little more detail later in the call.
When you examine our operating results in greater detail you'll find that we had terrific execution across all of our core
focus areas. The most notable growth in the second quarter came from our massive 1.3 million net acre position in the
Permian Basin where oil production increased 32% year-over-year. In fact, this momentum is continuing into the
second half of the year as our oil production in the Permian will surpass the 50,000 barrel per day milestone.
We've also had success expanding our drilling inventory in the Permian. You may recall, in the first quarter we doubled
our Bone Spring inventory from 350 to 700 locations. Today we're once again doubling our Bone Spring inventory
from 700 to 1,400 locations. This represents more than 1,000 future locations that we've added over the past year alone,
boosting our oil development inventory in the Permian to nearly 4,000 risk locations. This low risk development
inventory will provide significant light oil growth in the Permian for many years to come.
In Canada, our portfolio of world-class thermal oil projects continues to generate industry-leading results with total
production from our Jackfish project averaging 53,000 barrels per day in the quarter. Upon start-up of Jackfish III next
year, we expect aggregate free cash flow from our three Jackfish projects to approach $1 billion annually. Furthermore,
our development schedule remains on track to increase net production from our oil sands leases to at least 150,000
barrels per day by the end of the decade.
Also, today we're announcing some exciting results from our new Woodford oil shale play in the Mississippian trend of
North Central Oklahoma. To date we've identified 1,000 risk locations in this light oil resource play. Dave will provide
more details later in the call.

Finally, our Cana-Woodford and Barnett shale positions continue to rank among the top shale plays in North America.
Currently our activity is directed to only the most liquids-rich portions of these plays. Aggregate oil and NGLs
production growth from these two plays rose nearly 40% year-over-year in the second quarter. These assets and their
midstream infrastructure will produce about $1 billion of free cash flow in 2013.
In addition to our strong operating results, we benefited from the sharp rise in natural gas and Canadian oil prices.
Average second quarter gas price realization nearly doubled compared to the second quarter of 2012. And Canadian oil
price realizations improved by more than 50% just from the previous quarter. We also delivered strong cost discipline
in the first six months of 2013. While our production is trending above initial expectations, as I mentioned earlier,
capital expenditures and pre-tax cash costs remain comfortably within our full-year guidance ranges.
On the liquidity front year-to-date we have moved $2 billion of foreign cash back to the U.S. at an estimated tax rate of
approximately 5%. In addition, we've moved $500 million to Canada on a tax-free basis to fund our growth projects.
To provide some perspective on the significance of this achievement, recall that after divesting our international assets
in 2010 and 2011, we guided toward taxes of about 20%. The lower actual tax rate on the amount repatriated to the
U.S., and the tax-free transfer to Canada has resulted in an incremental $400 million benefit to Devon shareholders.
That's the equivalent of about a $1 a share.
Another positive development is the approval by our Board of Directors of a plan to form a publicly traded midstream
MLP. We expect to file a registration statement with the SEC around the end of the third quarter. Now as you're
probably aware, pre-offering rules prevent us from providing any additional information at this point. But we believe
there's a great opportunity to unlock the value of our midstream assets for Devon shareholders.
In addition, we recently signed agreements to sell our Bear Paw assets in central Montana, our Thunder Creek
midstream assets in Wyoming, and some other minor E&P assets for nearly $300 million. Estimated full-year cash flow
from these divestiture assets is less than $15 million, and the associated production is essentially all dry gas, averaging
around 20 million cubic feet per day. As you can see, the sale prices for these mature, lower-margin properties are at
valuations far superior to that of our current trading multiples, or the multiples we could potentially obtain through an
MLP. These divestitures and our recent midstream MLP announcement are just a couple of examples of our continuing
efforts to unlock value in our asset base, when we can do so on an accretive basis.
Of course, evaluating options to highlight unrecognized value has always been, and continues to be a priority. However
any action we take must create long-term value for our shareholders. We'll continue to provide you updates on this
front as warranted.
At this point, I will turn the call over to Dave Hager for a more detailed review of our quarterly operating highlights.
Dave?
David A. Hager
Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone.
Let's begin with a quick recap of our second quarter capital expenditures. Exploration and development capital for the
second quarter came in at $1.2 billion, bringing our total for the first half of 2013 to $2.7 billion. Based on our planned
activity for the second half of 2013 we're on track with our full-year E&P capital guidance of $4.9 billion to $5.3
billion.
As John mentioned, our teams delivered excellent execution in the second quarter across our entire North American
onshore portfolio. Let's take a closer look at some of these high points. Starting in the Permian, our production
averaged a record 76,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter. Looking specifically at our Permian oil
production, it grew 32% over – year-over-year. Light oil now accounts for 60% of our Permian volumes. The execution
of our Permian development program through the first half of the year has been outstanding, and we remain on track to
drill more than 300 wells this year.

Our Bone Spring horizontal program in the Delaware basin is a key driver of our Permian oil growth. We currently
have 12 operated rigs working in the play. In the second quarter we brought 29 Bone Spring wells online, with average
30-day IP rates of 675 barrels of oil equivalent per day, of which more than 65% was light oil. These results are about
15% better than our type curve expectations. Our continued drilling success in Eddy and Lea counties, combined with
our ongoing geological evaluation has once again allowed us to increase our inventory. As John mentioned, we are
doubling our inventory for the second time this year to 1,400 Bone Springs locations. Given this success, our 2014
program has the potential to double our current year activity to about 200 wells, further accelerating growth of this
top-tier light oil play.
Shifting to the Midland Basin, we continue to see positive results from the Wolfcamp shale in the southern portion of
the Midland Basin. During the second quarter we spud 34 horizontal Wolfcamp wells, and brought 19 online, with
initial 30-day production rates as high as 1,000 BOE per day. Landing and completing these wells in the lower
Wolfcamp is yielding positive and consistent results. We believe our fracs in the lower Wolfcamp are extending up
through multiple intervals allowing us to extract additional resource.
In addition, pad drilling in this play is resulting in greater efficiencies and lower costs. In fact, our number of days from
spud to rig release has improved nearly 60% since the first quarter of 2012. Today, we are able to drill our wells in just
11 days, trimming nearly 10% off our budgeted well costs. We have approximately 800 undrilled locations in this light
oil resource play and will be active here for the foreseeable future.
With the recent industry focus on the Wolfcamp and in light of our 1.3 million net acre position in the Permian Basin,
we have fielded multiple questions regarding our total Wolfcamp exposure. Based on our testing across the basin and
industry results to date, we have exposure to the Wolfcamp on over a quarter of a million net acres across the Permian.
Beyond our Wolfcamp shale focus in the southern Midland Basin, we have tested other acreage with Wolfcamp
potential across the Permian. For instance, in Ector County, where we historically drilled vertical Wolfberry wells, we
have completed two horizontal Wolfcamp wells. Each of these wells had a peak oil rate of about 800 barrels of oil per
day.
In addition, we are currently drilling a horizontal Wolfcamp test on our Delaware Basin acreage in Ward County,
where industry activity has recently heated up. As we continue to de-risk our acreage position throughout the Permian,
we believe our total exposure to the Wolfcamp will likely expand significantly. Our massive acreage position in the
Permian Basin coupled with the multiple pay zones of the Wolfcamp provide us with significant resource upside.
As John mentioned, we are today unveiling an exciting new opportunity on our Mississippian trend acreage. We have
completed 29 wells to date in the Woodford oil shale with very positive results. Second quarter Woodford results were
highlighted by 10 wells with initial production averaging 840 BOE per day and 30-day IPs of more than 500 BOE per
day. We are excited about our Woodford potential for several reasons.
First, unlike the Mississippi lime, the Woodford is a shale formation with resource play characteristics. It sits just
below the Miss Lime and can be up to 150 feet thick across portions of our acreage. It is the source rock for much of
our Miss production. The Woodford is less geologically complex and therefore should have a much higher drillability
factor and deliver more consistent results than conventional formations.
Second, the type curve emerging for the Woodford oil shale looks very similar to our original type curve for the Miss
Lime with 30-day IPs of about 300 BOE per day and EURs of about 350,000 BOE. Furthermore on a program basis the
drill and complete cost for these wells should run about $3 million each.
Third, initial production is about 80% oil on these Woodford shales. While the EUR is expected to be about one-third
gas and about one-third NGLs, this high initial oil content greatly enhances the economics in today's commodity price
environment.
And finally since the Woodford's geographic footprint overlaps our Miss Lime acreage, the sharing of 3D seismic,
surface facilities and power and gathering infrastructure will significantly enhance the economics of both plays. On our
acreage in the Mississippian Woodford trend, we have placed about 100 miles of pipeline in service to date and expect
an additional 400 miles in service by year end. This critical midstream infrastructure will reduce our operating costs

and well backlog allowing a ramp-up in our production.
The evaluation of our Woodford potential has also included a successful four-well pilot on 160 acre spacing. These
four wells achieved average 30-day IP rates of roughly 400 BOE per day. The Woodford's ease of drilling also allowed
us to drill and complete our first 10,000-foot lateral on the trend. The McNeil 6/7H was brought online in the second
quarter with an average 30-day IP rate of nearly 700 BOE per day.
Based on our positive results to date, we have recently added 60,000 net acres with Woodford potential to our leasehold
position in the area. To date we have de-risked about 100,000 out of roughly 400,000 net acres prospective for
Woodford oil shale development. This 100,000 net acres represents about 1,000 risked undrilled locations.
Combining our Woodford oil shale and Miss Lime results, our second quarter production across the trend averaged
5,000 BOE per day, a 73% increase from the first quarter this year. While we have spud over 200 wells to date,
infrastructure limitations, flaring restrictions and wells awaiting completion have limited our production history to 89
operated wells, of which 60 are completed in the Miss Lime. Our results in the Miss Lime continue to vary depending
on geographic location, reservoir quality, landing zones and completion techniques with our best wells far exceeding
our type curve. The seismic we have acquired thus far has allowed us to avoid structural geo hazards such as faults and
karsts and has allowed us to improve well orientation within the reservoir.
Additional analysis is ongoing to identify correlations between production and the various seismic attributes that can be
related back to the geology. As we further refine our reservoir models with the integration of 3D seismic raw data and
well results, we're confident we can improve our overall consistency. Inside our joint venture area, we saw an 80%
increase in Woodford 30-day IP rates from our wells drilled with the benefit of seismic. To date, we have acquired 3D
seismic over roughly 50% of our acreage inside the joint venture area and plan to have the remainder of our seismic in
this area shot by early next year. On our acreage to the north, we have a minor amount of seismic already in house, and
our acquisition of additional seismic in this area will continue through 2014.
For the remainder of the year, we expect to run 14 operated rigs on our joint venture acreage where we have the benefit
of 3D seismic and one operated rig testing our leasehold to the north. This rig count will keep us on pace to participate
in approximately 350 wells for the year. Given the strength of our Woodford oil shale results and the fact that
Woodford wells secure acreage for the Miss Lime formation as well, we will focus our second half activity on drilling
Woodford wells. This level of activity combined with the progress we've made in building out infrastructure, will allow
our net production to approach 15,000 BOE per day by the end of 2013 for the Miss Lime and Woodford oil shale
combined.
So in summary, we are excited about the progress we're making in the Mississippian Woodford trend and believe these
plays will provide the next leg of large scale, highly economic oil growth for Devon.
Shifting to our thermal oil projects in northeastern Alberta, second quarter production from our two Jackfish projects
averaged roughly 53,000 barrels of oil per day net of royalties. Most importantly, the significant improvement in
Canadian oil prices boosted our Jackfish operating margins by nearly 300% quarter-over-quarter. Jackfish 1 production
averaged 32,000 barrels per day during the quarter and continued its trend of excellent plant reliability and efficiency.
We reached project pay out at Jackfish 1 in June resulting in a step up in royalty rates to the Alberta government going
forward.
As a result, in the third quarter we expect Jackfish 1 production after royalties to average between 26,000 to 28,000
barrels per day. To further improve output at our Jackfish projects we're testing a variety of technologies aimed at
enhancing and reservoir productivity – enhancing plant and reservoir productivity. While it's still too early to comment
on the results of these pilot programs, industry participants including Devon expect that over time improvements in
SAGD technology will lead to step changes in efficiency, ultimately boosting production rates well above our name
plate capacity of 35,000 barrels per day.
At Jackfish 2 second quarter production continued to ramp up averaging an all-time high of 21,400 barrels per day net
of royalties. To further assess – assist the ramp up of this project, an additional well pad has been drilled at Jackfish 2,
is currently being tied in and remains on schedule for first steam later this year. Looking ahead to the third quarter we'll

bring the Jackfish 2 plant down for scheduled maintenance beginning in mid-August and expect the maintenance to
take about three weeks. When we restart the plant it can take up to four weeks to restore production to full capacity.
Accordingly our net third quarter Jackfish 2 production is expected to range in the – average in the order of 13,000 to
15,000 barrels per day.
At Jackfish 3 we're ahead of schedule and remain on budget with nearly 70% of the project complete. We now expect
first steam in the third quarter of 2014, which is roughly one quarter sooner than we had originally expected.
Also during the quarter, our Rockies oil program in the Powder River Basin continued to gain momentum and deliver
excellent results. In the second quarter, we brought seven high impact oil wells online targeting the Turner and
Parkman formations. Initial 30-day production from these seven wells averaged 675 BOE per day of which more than
90% was light oil. Our Powder River Basin results have driven our overall Rockies oil production up 27%
year-over-year to 11,000 barrels per day. This recent success in the Powder is attributable to the integration of
additional 3D seismic data, coupled with improved completion techniques. To date, we have identified approximately
600 risk locations across our Powder River Basin acreage and we expect further good news as we head into the second
half of this year and into 2014.
Moving now to the Cana-Woodford shale in western Oklahoma, second quarter production averaged 322 million cubic
feet equivalent per day with oil and NGLs comprising nearly 40% of production. This represents an impressive 48%
increase in liquids production year-over-year. During the second quarter, we spud 28 new horizontal Cana-Woodford
wells, but because of timing issues related to pad drilling only three were brought online. We are currently in the
process of bringing several new pads online, expect to see strong third quarter production growth at Cana of roughly
10% sequentially.
In addition, we continue to improve drilling efficiency at Cana. Over the past two years, we've managed to reduce
drilling days by more than 40%. As a result, we now believe that only 10 operated rigs are required for the second half
of the year to complete our 150 well program in 2013. Our plant expansions at Cana and in the Barnett are now
complete and fully operational. Both facilities reached record daily inlet volumes and NGL production late in the
second quarter. As John mentioned, and it's worth repeating, our Cana and Barnett assets combined with their
midstream infrastructure will produce around $1 billion of free cash flow in 2013.
So in summary we had an outstanding execution in the second quarter across our entire North American onshore
portfolio. With solid production results and a growth of inventory of opportunities, we are poised to deliver impressive
oil and liquids growth in 2013 and beyond.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff for the financial review and outlook. Jeff?
Jeffrey A. Agosta
Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Today I will take you through a brief review of the key drivers that
shaped our second quarter results and where called for, provide updated guidance.
Beginning with production as John detailed earlier, our record setting production averaged 698,000 barrels of oil
equivalent per day. This was driven by growth in light oil production from the Permian Basin coupled with the
Mississippian and Woodford oil plays in north central Oklahoma. Total second quarter production exceeded the
midpoint of our guidance range by nearly 3% and topped the upper end of our forecasted range by 8,000 barrels per
day.
Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect to continue to demonstrate year-over-year growth in our oil volumes with
average daily oil production ranging from 165,000 to 170,000 barrels per day. This implies a year-over-year growth
rate in the high teens. Driving this strong oil growth in the third quarter is an expected 40 plus percent increase in oil
production from our U.S. operations, far surpassing the impact of higher post payout royalty rates at Jackfish 1 and the
planned turnaround at Jackfish 2 that Dave discussed earlier.

Overall on a BOE basis, after accounting for growth in NGLs and declines in natural gas, we expect production in the
third quarter to range between 680,000 and 695,000 BOE per day. Due to the out-performance of our core development
assets year-to-date we are increasing our full-year production target. This is in spite of selling non-core properties. We
now expect our full year 2013 production to range from 250 million to 254 million BOE. An increase in the midpoint
of our full year forecast of four million barrels.
Breaking down our 2013 outlook by product, high margin oil production is the most significant growth driver where
total company oil production remains on track to increase at a rate of 16% to 19% over last year. NGL growth is also
strong and on pace to increase at a rate in the low teens for the year.
Lastly our operating teams have done a very good job optimizing base production from our natural gas assets. We now
expect 2013 natural gas declines of only 7% compared to our 8% to 10% forecast.
Looking now at our revenues in the second quarter, significantly-improved natural gas and oil price realizations
combined with higher oil production drove our E&P upstream revenue to $2.2 billion, 37% higher than the year-ago
quarter. Oil sales, not including NGLs, once again accounted for more than 50% of our E&P revenue in the quarter.
In the second quarter, our regional pricing by product was generally in line with expectations. One noteworthy
exception was the dramatic improvement in Canadian oil realizations. For the second quarter oil price realizations in
Canada came in just above the top end of our guidance range at 66% of WTI or roughly $62 per barrel. This represents
a 52% increase compared to the first quarter. This price recovery resulted from higher takeaway capacity provided by
improved flow rates on key export pipes, new rail capacity, higher refinery demand and some delays in production
supply growth from industry. Based on what we have seen so far in July and August, we expect third quarter Canadian
oil realizations to range from 65% to 75% of WTI. However, supply and demand dynamics for Canadian crude remain
tight, so any disruptions in refining or takeaway capacity could negatively impact pricing.
Looking at natural gas, the only notable change to our guidance is a minor adjustment for the recent widening of AECO
differentials in Canada. We are now projecting third quarter natural gas realizations in Canada to be between 70% to
80% of Henry Hub. For natural gas liquids we expect our third quarter realizations to range between 26% to 28% of
WTI.
Turning now to our Midstream business, in addition to our strong upstream performance our marketing and midstream
operations also delivered a solid quarter. Our midstream operating profit came in at $121 million in the second quarter
enhancing our company-wide margins by nearly $2.00 per BOE. The improvement in natural gas prices and higher
utilization of our fractionation facility at Mont Belvieu were the key performance drivers for the quarter. This resulted
in second-quarter midstream profit exceeding the top end of our implied guidance range. With the first six months in
hand we now expect our full year marketing and midstream operating profit to come in between $450 and $500 million,
an increase of $25 million from our previous guidance.
Shifting now to expenses; we have continued to do a good job of controlling costs across our entire portfolio. For the
first half of 2013, most expense items have trended toward the bottom end or even below our guidance range including
LOE, G&A, taxes other than income and DD&A. For the second quarter the company's pre-tax expenses totaled $1.7
billion. On a unit of production basis, pre-tax expenses declined 2% from Q1 and increased only 1% year-over-year. By
achieving significant scale in core operating areas, coupled with our consistent focus on cost management, we are
positioned with one of the better cost structures in the industry. This is especially impressive given our shift to oilier
projects, which are delivering much higher rates of return but are generally more expensive to operate.
Looking ahead to the third quarter for those of you who model Devon, we expect the payout at Jackfish I and
turnaround related expenses at Jackfish II to increase our LOE to a range of $9.00 to $9.50 per BOE. However, our full
year guidance remains unchanged.
Before we open the call to Q&A, I will conclude my remarks with a quick review of our financial position. During the
second quarter our cash flow after adjusting for balance sheet changes and repatriation tax, totaled $1.4 billion, a 31%
increase compared to the second quarter of last year. This cash flow allowed us to comfortably fund our capital
demands, while maintaining excellent financial strength.

Additionally, we've reduced our debt by $2 billion using offshore cash balances. We continue to have one of the best
liquidity positions in the E&P sector, with cash and short-term investments of $4.2 billion. Of these cash balances,
approximately $3.6 billion resides in subsidiaries outside North America. Depending upon how our 2013 tax position
evolves, and once we firm up plans for 2014, there is the potential to bring another sizable amount of cash back to the
U.S. at a tax rate in the mid-single digits.
In summary, it was a solid quarter for Devon both operationally and financially. We posted strong oil production
growth. We expanded our margins through growth in light oil, higher priced realizations, and strong cost controls, and
we maintained our solid financial position.
So with that, I will turn the call back over to Vince for the Q&A. Vince?

Operator, we're ready for the first question.
Q&A
Operator
Our first question in queue comes from the line of Arun Jayaram from Credit Suisse. The line is open for you now.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - John Richels>: Good morning.
<A - David A. Hager>: Good morning.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: Jeff, kudos on the repatriation. I know that's been a lot of effort for you and your team. So
congrats on that.
<A - Jeffrey A. Agosta>: Thank you.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: My first question is regarding kind of the Woodford play, Dave. Understanding it's early in this
play, but I was wondering if you could just comment a little bit on the consistency of the well results thus far, perhaps
the initial rates of return versus the Mississippian program and bigger picture, what do you think this could do for
Devon if you can prove this position out?
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, we're pretty excited about this opportunity overall. Because I think the – by the nature of
being a shale play, and the fact it is a source rock, actually for the vast majority of the Mississippian play, by the nature
of it, shales tend to be more consistent in nature, so that has led to greater consistency in well results already. We're just
at the beginning stages of really characterizing the overall play. So we are seeing more consistent results.
There's obviously some variability. Some of the keys we're looking for where we can enhance the permeability through
fracturing. You see some variability depending on the thickness of the reservoir. But overall, it is a consistent play that
produces strong economic results. You can see where we're using essentially for right now, the same type curve as
we're using for Mississippian, but it's going to be little bit lower well costs. So that's obviously even going to enhance
the economics a little bit more. And as I highlighted, we're very confident we de-risked 100,000 acres, and we see the
potential for up to 400,000 acres of Woodford potential across our 650,000-acre position in the Miss trend. So it's an
exciting play. If it works out to scale, you can do the math but it's going to – it can add a lot to our light oil story.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: And do you have, Dave, the same water issues that you have in the Miss Lime?
<A - David A. Hager>: No. You don't have near the water issues you have in the Miss Lime.

<Q - Arun Jayaram>: Okay. John, one for you. I wanted to ask you just around strategic alternatives or potential
strategic alternatives beyond the MLP, thoughts on other things, such as Canada, thinking about strategic alternatives
around Canada to unlock some of the value there of your oil sands position.
<A - John Richels>: Sure. We're not getting into any of the specifics. We're always looking at ways that we can bring
the value forward. And I think our history proves that we're not afraid of doing that, and making bold moves. However,
a lot of things that you would talk about and reflect from on the outside don't necessarily add long-term value. So we're
very conscious about that, and we're looking at any opportunities available to us. We've always said we're always
considering how to bring value forward, and we're not leaving any stone unturned in that analysis. We're only going to
do the things that add long-term value and not take action simply for action's sake.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: Fair enough. Thanks a lot, gentlemen.
<A - Vincent W. White>: Operator, next question
Operator
Certainly, Sir. Next in queue we have Doug Leggate from Bank of America. Your line is open for you now.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks. Good morning, everybody, a couple of questions.
<A - John Richels>: Hi, Doug.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Hi. Dave, first to you perhaps, so the Mississippi Lime and the Woodford, are we now basically
seeing the Woodford as a primary target for your acreage there? And could you talk about what the implications are in
terms of development plan, rig count activity or rather, I guess, well activity and ultimately how you might change
capital allocation associated with this play? And I've got a follow-up, please.
<A - David A. Hager>: Sure, Doug. We like both of them. I think that's the key. We like the Woodford and we like the
Miss Lime. This is not necessary – this is not negative on the Miss Lime. It's just we have additional potential here in
the Woodford. I think that's really the key. The Woodford is a little bit deeper and so by drilling and has some of these
additional qualities that we've described of being a shale probably with more consistent results, a little easier to drill,
lower well costs. All of which are very positive for that. In addition to being deeper, when you drill a Woodford well
you hold all rights above that. So we're going have a tendency to drill more Woodford wells here in the short term to
make sure that we get our acreage secured through the Woodford.
But ultimately it's going take the rest of this year, I think really, to – that's what I've been trying to say consistently that
it's going to take the rest of this year to really get a clear understanding of what the full potential is on both the
Woodford and our Miss acreage. But, it's starting to emerge pretty positive, I can tell you. And it looks like we
certainly have a strong leg for our next oil growth within Devon. So I like where we are, bottom line. It's just nice to
have an additional formation such as the Woodford to really bolster that growth.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks. I don't know if you want [indiscernible] (40:44) my follow-up, but it's related to the
carries. I mean clearly the success in the Powder, the Permian and the Miss. Can you help us with how are you
allocating the – and I guess what's the remaining capital carry you have in the two joint ventures that you have with
Sumitomo and Sinopec? I'll leave it there. Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey A. Agosta>: We should – Doug, we should benefit to the tune of over $1 billion this year and $1 billion
next year.
<A - John Richels>: And that's the two JVs combined.
<A - Jeffrey A. Agosta>: Yeah, the two combined. But as far as the specific to the Rockies and the Miss, that's got to
be upwards of $700 million, $800 million per year.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Great. Okay. Thanks very much.

Your next question in queue comes from the line of Joseph Allman from JPMorgan. Their line is open for you now.
<Q - Joe D. Allman>: Thank you. Hi, everybody.
<A - John Richels>: Hi, Joe.
<A - David A. Hager>: Hi Joe.
<Q - Joe D. Allman>: So on the Miss Lime, production increased by about 2,200 barrels a day from the first quarter to
the second quarter and you drilled 44 wells in the second quarter, 34 in the first quarter. These are gross wells. So why
is the production not ramping up faster there?
<A - David A. Hager>: Yeah, it's important to remember that, so far, we've only brought a total of 64 wells online in
the Miss, a total of about 90 or so for the combined Miss and Woodford. And so we have currently as we speak we're
building out our infrastructure. We'll be continuing to build out that infrastructure throughout the third and fourth
quarter. So as we get the infrastructure built out, as we complete these additional wells, then we're going to see the
ramp-up in production even further.
<Q - Joe D. Allman>: Okay. And then in the Miss Woodford, I think your press release indicated that so you exited
the June quarter at 7,000 barrels a day. You exited the March quarter somewhere in the neighborhood of 3,500 barrels a
day. You brought on 36 wells in the second quarter and you mentioned that 10 that average 840 or so BOE per day. So
that would imply that the other 26 wells actually had a very low rate. So I was just working the math. So I'm just trying
to understand what the average of those other 26 was?
<A - David A. Hager>: They're varied. And it's important to remember – and this is – I'll go back to what I said
previously here, that we are still in the testing phase of this. We are landing in various zones within the Miss. And we're
experimenting throughout our acreage. An additional point I need to make is the working interest in a number of these
wells, we're talking about gross wells. And so the working interest in a number of these wells is very low. So you really
can't do the math I think you're trying to do to figure out the rate. But we are seeing a lot of variability right now. And
we'll continue to see that as we evaluate our acres throughout the rest of this year. Then we'll really be focusing in on
what we think are the best parts of the play.
<Q - Joe D. Allman>: Dave, could you give us the average working interest for the Miss Lime and for the Woodford
because I thought it was actually pretty high with about a 20% royalty?
<A - David A. Hager>: I think it's averaging about 30% or so.
<Q - Joe D. Allman>: 30% working interest average?
<A - David A. Hager>: Yeah, correct. Yeah.
<Q - Joe D. Allman>: Okay. And then, John, just on the strategic alternatives...
<A - David A. Hager>: I might also mention just to follow up on some of these wells too, we can produce for about 30
days and then we can't produce them any further because they have – there are the flaring restrictions we have. So
we've had to actually shut-in some of these wells. There's a lot of complicating factors that factor into why it's taking a
while to ramp. Once we have our facilities in place that we're talking about building out here in the second half of the
year, that won't be an issue anymore.
<Q - Joe D. Allman>: That's helpful. And, John, just on the strategic alternatives as a follow-up, it sounds as if, from
the language, it sounds as if that process has slowed down somewhat internally. Because I think you were looking at
options for the midstream business and you already announced those. But it sounded previously that as if you were

looking at – I think you said everything was on the table. Now it sounds as if that process has slowed down internally.
Is that proper interpretation?
<A - John Richels>: I don't think it's slowed down Joe. I said everything was on the table. Everything's still on the
table. If we can see opportunities that create long-term value and that makes sense and that are accretive, then we'll
look at them. But I just want to make the point that just doing – undertaking activity for activity's sake doesn't make
sense unless we think it's really something that's going to add some value to the stock. I wouldn't say that we changed
our view on that.
<Q - Joe D. Allman>: Got you, makes sense. Thank you. Very helpful.
<A - Vincent W. White>: Operator, next question?
Operator
Certainly sir. Your next question comes from Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - John Richels>: Good morning.
<A - David A. Hager>: Good morning, Brian.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: Shifting to the Permian. Can you talk in more detail about what's driven the increase in your
Bone Spring locations? How much of that is due to incremental Bone Spring zones working, versus you've tested a
wider acreage, versus spacing versus EURs or anything else?
<A - David A. Hager>: Hi, Brian. This is Dave again. Yeah, let me give you a little bit of an idea for what is going on
here. It's primarily as we test additional acreage. That's the answer. To give you a little bit of color on the details on
this. When you look at the logs of this first and second Bone Springs, they are what we like to typically call railroad
tracks, which really means that we see very little indication of deflection of the SP curve or the resistivity curve which
you typically see in productive formations. And so what this really means is that these are pretty fine-grained reservoirs
and so you can't just look at a log and say for certain that these wells are going to be productive. You have to actually
go in and test new areas and then you find out oh, it's working. So based on that fact then you step out further and you
step out further and you say that area's working too.
So that's what we're really doing, is we are stepping out and testing new areas because it's just not obvious from the
well data that it's really going be productive. And what we're finding is that these areas that just don't look that
impressive by traditional log analysis techniques when we go out and test them, they're working really well.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: That's great. That's helpful. And my follow-up goes back to some of the earlier questions.
Does the emergence of the Woodford oil opportunity in the Mississippi Lime area, is that meaningful enough where it
reduces your appetite for considering or adding oil resource via acquisition from some new play elsewhere?
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, we're always going be very disciplined I think. I'll just try that if we're looking at any
acquisitions. And so we're going to I think continue to look to see if there are any meaningful. But obviously we haven't
made any deals yet because we're being very disciplined from a value standpoint. I think it's always in our best interest
to look. But we're certainly excited that this adds a lot of strength to our internal oil growth story as well. I wouldn't say
we're going to stop looking because we always look to see if there's something meaningful out there but it certainly
gives us a lot more confidence on our internal story.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: Thank you.

Operator
Certainly, sir. Next in queue we have Hsulin Peng from Robert Baird. Their line is open for you now.
<Q - Hsulin Peng>: Good morning. This is Hsulin. So a quick clarification question about Woodford oil. Is this part of
your Sumitomo JV? And also, what is your drilling plan – what is your plan actually for developing this play in 2013
and 2014? Could you use part of the drill carry from the JV?
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, this is – we have 650,000 acres throughout the Mississippian trend. About 150,000 or so
of that acreage is within the joint venture, not with Sumitomo, but with Sinopec. Where we're drilling the bulk of our
wells right now is on that acreage that's within the Sinopec JV. That has a lot of the – probably the bulk of the de-risked
acreage for the Woodford right now. We see additional prospectivity outside of the joint venture acreage with Sinopec,
that we could – that we're going be de-risking here throughout the remainder of 2013 and 2014.
So right now it's part of the Sinopec JV, and it's part of the overall plan. It's part of the 350 wells we talked about that
we'll be drilling overall in the play, and it's within the budget that we're working with, with Sinopec in the JV.
<Q - Hsulin Peng>: Okay. Thanks. Sorry I misspoke, it was Sinopec. And then the second question is, regarding
Powder River Basin. Given that you are – the well results there seems to be pretty good from Parkman and Turner, and
you also have 600 risk locations. I was just wondering is this going to become a core area for you guys? Is there any
permitting issues to develop this play here?
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, we're excited with the results we have, and we're looking at ways to increase our well
activity as we move into 2014. It is BLM land, for the most part, not entirely, but for the most part. There is a longer
permitting process involved in that. So we need to get ahead of the curve as far as permits. We do see the scope for
increasing rig activity in 2014. Is it going to grow to the size of the potential that we see in the Miss or the Permian?
No. I don't think so. But is it still going be a meaningful part of the growth story? Yeah. It can be a significant
contributor, I think. It's still, it's probably not going be of the scale of the Permian and the Miss, though.
<Q - Hsulin Peng>: Okay. And then my last question is, do you have any update for us on Klein in the Permian?
<A - David A. Hager>: Yeah, on the Klein, we decreased our rig activity right now. We've seen a lot of variability on
the Klein. And we certainly have our concerns about the Klein, but we're also getting additional 3D in there. We're
looking at our completion techniques. For the short term, we've decreased down to two rigs in there, both of which are
going to be doing what I'd call mini-developments in Sterling County, seeing how low we can get the well costs to have
economic developments there. In the meantime, we're studying the well results we have to date. We're getting 3D. As I
said, the results have been pretty mixed so far. So we need to do some studying here before we go back out there with a
significant program.
<A - Vincent W. White>: Operator, we'll move to the next caller now.
Operator
Certainly. Your next question comes from John Herrlin from Societe General. Their line is open for you now.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Yeah, thank you. A couple for Dave. With the Woodford Mississippian trend that you
discussed, Dave, you said that you had variable thickness in the Woodford shale. How variable is it areally when you
look at all this acreage? Or is it relatively uniform?
<A - David A. Hager>: What we see – it's reasonably variable. We have some areas, John, where we're not including
in our acreage – prospective acreage at all because it's not present. And so we've seen positive well results, in down to
as low as 40 to 50 feet of Woodford shale. We've seen very good well results when it's up to 150 feet thick in other
areas. So there is some variability across the play. There's no question about it. But that's why – but again, we've had
positive results down to 40 to 50 feet. So that's why we see a lot of it as being prospective.

<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Great. When do you think you'll hit an HBP mode in terms of capturing all the acreage? This
year?
<A - David A. Hager>: We won't have it all captured this year. It will take on into 2014, particularly to the acreage to
the north. The bulk of the acreage within the joint venture area will get HBP this year, but it will be 2014 to really do
the acreage to the north.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay. Next one from me is on the Permian, Dave. Have you hit a stage where you're in a pad
mode debt? I mean you've talked about your drilling times improving.
<A - David A. Hager>: Oh, yeah. We're doing pad drilling throughout the Bone Springs, throughout the Wolfcamp
shale. We have been for some time. That's, frankly, why some of the ramp-up of production has been pretty
inconsistent, I guess you'd say. To give you an idea, though, here too, just to fortify our production growth in the
second half of the year, to give you one example here, in our Wolfcamp shale area, we fracked about 25 wells in July.
They're coming on here in August. We're going to frac another 25 wells in August. They'll come on in September. So
that's what's – the cause, it's really because of the nature of the pad drilling our – that the growth has been a little
lumpy. But now that we're getting all these wells drilled, completed and on production, that's what gives us the
confidence we're going to have the kind of ramp-up we're forecasting for the remainder of 2013. We're also pad drilling
in Bone Springs and same issue there.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Okay. Given the results in the Bone Springs wells, are you going to increase your EURs there?
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, they're running about 15% above the type curve right now. I don't know. I'll have to talk
to the guys and see if they feel confident in doing it all the way. You understood the issue I talked about before.
They've got to convince themselves those railroad track-looking logs are really going to deliver even more.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Yep.
<A - David A. Hager>: So we'll see if they can get that confidence. But we're getting outstanding results.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Vincent W. White>: Operator, we're ready for the next caller. It looks like it's Rehan Rashid.
Operator
That is correct. The next in queue we have Rehan Rashid from FBR. Their line is open for you now.
<Q - Rehan Ahmed Rashid>: Thank you. Just a quick question on Jackfish 2. So once we have the turnaround and the
incremental pad in, what should we think about as the run rate? And I have a follow-up.
<A - David A. Hager>: Yeah, we're probably going to get an incremental on the order of about 8,000 barrels per day
or so from the next pad. So once we're fully back ramped up, I'd say 30,000, 31,000 barrels per day, somewhere in that
order.
<Q - Rehan Ahmed Rashid>: And this should be by what, middle of next year? Or?
<A - David A. Hager>: Yeah, yeah, somewhere around there.
<Q - Rehan Ahmed Rashid>: And just broadly speaking, your thoughts around further exploration efforts ongoing
within the enterprise? Some broad thoughts on that front, what should we be looking forward to? Thank you.
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, we're always out there looking. And we have a lot of ideas internally. Frankly, this has
been a year where we had captured a lot of acreage and we felt as the year to evaluate that acreage. Given the success
that we're having on that acreage right now, I think it's an open question as to how much additional acreage we need to
add because we have a lot of growth we're identifying right now from the acreage we've already captured. If we see
some that we think are truly outstanding, we may not go out and try to capture those. But we have got a lot of growth

already from what we have captured.
<Q - Rehan Ahmed Rashid>: Thank you.
<A - Vincent W. White>: Operator, we've got time for one last question.
Operator
Certainly, sir. Your last question in queue comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Their line is open
for you now.
<Q - Charles A. Meade>: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for taking my question. I was wondering if we
could turn to the Midland Basin Wolfcamp. And those looked like some pretty good results that you have there. But,
I'm curious. I know that at least one of those two Ector wells you did in 2012 was a relatively short lateral. I want to say
it was around 3,000 feet. I wondered if you could add some detail, first on what your lateral lengths were on these wells
that you reported with this quarter? And second, if you could give a breakdown of the 250,000 net acreage that you
have prospective for the Wolfcamp, how much of that is Delaware and how much is Midland?
<A - David A. Hager>: Yeah, on the lateral lengths for the wells in Ector County, we're currently drilling those about
5,000-foot laterals. Not quite as long as the ones we're doing in the southern Midland Basin. The breakdown of the
Wolfcamp shale acreage that we have is about 140,000 acres or so that we think is prospective in the Delaware basin.
Then we have about 65,000 acres or so, I think, prospective down in the southern Midland Basin. And then the rest of it
is up in Ector County, and then some other smaller, scattered acreage.
<Q - Charles A. Meade>: Thank you for that added color, Dave.
<A - David A. Hager>: Yeah.
<A - Vincent W. White>: Okay. John, do you have any closing remarks?
John Richels
Yeah, folks. So just let me summarize. Our annual production's going be at the top end of our guidance, with our U.S.
light oil production up 36% year-over-year. Really importantly, too, year-to-date cash costs are at the bottom end of the
guidance, and our capital expenditures remain comfortably within our original guidance. We're going to continue to
expand our high-margin light oil drilling inventory in the Permian, and we're very excited about the new Woodford oil
shale play that Dave has discussed a lot today.
So as we move forward, we are going to continue to be disciplined with our capital. We're going to continue to preserve
our financial flexibility. We're going to continue to pursue our top strategic objective of maintaining long-term growth
and cash flow per adjusted share. So thank you very much for joining us today. And with that, I guess we're done.
