MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to JPMorgan Chase's fourth quarter 2014 earnings call. This call is
being recorded. Your line will be muted for the duration of the call.
We will now go live to the presentation. Please stand by. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to JPMorgan
Chase's Chairman and CEO, Jamie Dimon, and Chief Financial Officer, Marianne Lake. Ms. Lake, please go ahead.
Marianne Lake
Thank you, operator. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to take you through the earnings presentation, which is
available on our website. Please refer to the disclaimer regarding forward-looking statements, which is at the back of
the presentation.
Starting on page one, the firm reported net income of $4.9 billion, an EPS of $1.19, and a return on tangible common
equity of 11% on $23.6 billion of revenue for the quarter. Included in our results was total legal expense of $1.1 billion
or approximately $1 billion after tax, in large part an incremental amount for FX.

As we go through the presentation, I will call out other notable items. For your reference, we've included the EPS
impact of those here on the front page. In total, they contributed a net positive $0.12 to EPS. So adjusting for legal
expense as well as these items gives net income of $5.5 billion and an EPS of $1.33, reflecting solid core performance.
I'm going to skip over page two and we're going to go straight to the full-year results on page three. The firm reported
record net income of nearly $22 billion and record EPS of $5.29 and a return on tangible common equity of 13% on
nearly $98 billion of revenue. Excluding legal expense, which remains elevated, net income for the year was $24
billion and return on tangible common equity 14%. You can see on the page at the bottom that adjusted expense was
$58.4 billion, in line with guidance and down $650 million from the prior year, despite the impact of incremental cost
of control as well as continuing to invest in our businesses. A final couple of points for the year, core loan growth was
strong at 8% year on year. And net capital distributions for the year were approximately $10 billion, including record
dividends of $6 billion.
Turning to page four, the firm's fully phased-in advanced CET1 ratio was 10.1%, flat to last quarter, with earnings and
portfolio runoff offset by capital distribution and an increase in risk-weighted assets, predominantly driven by higher
counterparty credit risk. In terms of 2015 outlook, we expect to add 50 basis points or more to this ratio. Similarly, the
firm's fully phased-in standardized ratio, not on the page, also remained flat at 10.5%. The firm's SLR was 5.6%, and
the bank's SLR improved to 5.9%. And given the recent FSB proposal, we've added our best estimate of TLAC at
approximately 15% excluding buffers, which will be refined as the rules are finalized.
Moving on to page five, before we move into each of the businesses, this quarter we've changed the presentation of
preferred dividends in our lines of business and show the impact here on the page. For the company, preferred
dividends were and continue to be below the line. However, we've historically allocated the cost of preferred stock to
the businesses as a net interest expense or contra-revenue, with a corresponding positive impact in corporate NII.
In order to have cleaner trends and better peer comparability, we're now presenting preferred dividends below the line
for each of our LOBs, which is particularly important given recent increases in preferred issuance. You can see on the
slide that the change in methodology has no impact on firm-wide financials nor on LOB returns on equity, while LOB
revenue, net income, and overhead ratios improve. And additionally, the adjustment affects the comp to revenue ratio
in the CIB. So from here throughout this presentation and also in the supplement, all numbers in all periods consistently
reflect this change.
Moving on to business performance, on page six the Consumer & Community Bank, the combined businesses
generated $2.2 billion net income for the quarter and an ROE of 16% on nearly $11 billion of revenue. Excluding the
impact of losses related to non-core portfolio exits in Card, the ROE was 18%. Consumer & Community Banking
continues to deliver strong underlying performance, maintaining our number one ranking in customer satisfaction
among largest banks for the third year in a row by ACSI. And in addition, we continue to deepen relationships with our
customers. Average deposits were up 8% year on year, with growth across regions and markets. Record client
investment assets were up 13%. Our active mobile customer base was up 22%, and credit card sales volume was up
10% on strong new account originations. Across CCB, we have outperformed our expense targets for the year and have
reduced head count by 12,000 this year, exceeding Investor Day guidance by roughly 4,000. And over the last three
years, head count is down approximately 32,000 across the consumer businesses.
Turning to page seven, Consumer & Business Banking. For the fourth quarter CBB generated net income of $861
million, up 8% year on year, and an ROE of 31% on improved operating leverage. Net interest income was relatively
flat year on year but down slightly quarter on quarter on lower deposit margin. For the first quarter of 2015, we expect
continued spread compression in CBB deposit margin, driven by lower reinvestment rates, will drive a modest decline
in NII quarter over quarter. Non-interest revenue continued to grow, up 6%, across investments, debit, and other fees,
with the addition of approximately 700,000 net new households. And expense was relatively flat, with efficiencies
self-funding investments.
Finally in Business Banking, the momentum we have seen in recent quarters continued, with loan originations for the
quarter of $1.5 billion, up 18% year on year. Businesses remain relatively optimistic and banking – banker performance
continues to improve.

Mortgage Banking on page eight, overall Mortgage Banking net income was $338 million for the quarter and a 7%
ROE. We reduced expenses for the year by $2.3 billion, outperforming our $2 billion target. Moving to the top of the
page, production pre-tax income excluding repurchase was slightly positive for the quarter, which was better than
guidance on higher volumes and revenue margins. The origination market was more robust due to a strong rate rally,
but we estimate it was down about 5% quarter on quarter seasonally; against which our originations were $23 billion,
up 8% quarter on quarter, reflecting correspondent share gains in jumbo and conventional. So this quarter we increased
volumes, we gained approximately 100 basis points of market share estimated, and realized higher revenue margins.
Expenses were flat quarter on quarter despite the increase in volumes, as we continue to focus on controlling costs.
On to servicing, net servicing related revenue of $624 million was down slightly quarter on quarter on lower balances,
with servicing expense of $560 million also down slightly. On real estate portfolios, we continued to add high-quality
loans to our portfolio. We added another $10 billion this quarter, up from $7 billion last quarter, recorded net
charge-offs of $111 million and reserve releases of $100 million in the non-credit impaired portfolio. Lastly, head
count was down over 7,500 for the year and approximately 22,000 over the last three years.
Moving on to page nine, Card, Merchant Services & Auto net income of $980 million was down 7% year on year, with
an ROE of 20%. If you exclude reserve releases, net income was up 2%. The strong momentum in our business
continues, with very strong spend as well as card balance growth of $3 billion in the year. Revenue of $4.5 billion was
down 4% year on year but up 1%, adjusting for losses related to portfolio exits that went through the quarter's results,
with an adjusted revenue rate for card, shown on the page of 12.2%, in line with our guidance. Strong loan and sales
growth was offset by spread compression and higher acquisition costs, as we continue to add more customers. In 2015,
expect the revenue rate to remain at the low end of our target range of 12% to 12.5%. Expense was down 6% year on
year, predominantly driven by remediation costs included in the prior period.
In Card, we led the industry for the 27th consecutive quarter, gaining nearly 500 basis points of share during the same
period. And this quarter we saw sales growth of 10%, driven by enhanced client acquisition and reward strategies.
In Merchant Services, volume was up 13% year on year, driven by continued strong sales performance. And in auto,
results continued to reflect steady growth in new vehicle sales as well as stable used car values. This was the 13th
consecutive quarter of loan and lease growth, with average balances up 5% year on year. And coming into this year, the
pipeline is strong, which reflects continued strength in the auto market.
Finally on Credit, in Card we continued to see improvements in early delinquencies, and we released $150 million of
reserves this quarter. You can see the net charge-off rate adjusted for portfolio exits was down slightly at 248 basis
points. In 2015, expect the charge-off rate to decline modestly. For auto, credit losses were higher on balance growth
and as the charge-off rate starts to trend up from historical lows.
Now moving on to page 10 and the Corporate & Investment Bank, CIB reported net income of $972 million and an
ROE of 5% on $7.4 billion of revenue for the quarter. Adjusting for legal expense, ROE would have been 11% for the
quarter and 13% for the year.
In Banking, IB fees were $1.8 billion, up 8%. We continued to rank number one in global IB fees per Dealogic, number
one in the U.S., and we moved up to number one in EMEA this year. Record debt underwriting was driven by
M&A-related financings. Strong advisory fees for the quarter contributed to the full-year increase, up 24%. And equity
underwriting fees were down from a strong quarter last year but in line with the overall decline in market issuance. We
continued to put on more deals than any other firm for both the quarter and the year. And the fee pipeline continues to
be strong into 2015, with a favorable environment generally across most products.
Treasury Services revenue was up 3%. And lending related revenue of $264 million was down $129 million year on
year, given mark-to-market gains in the prior year.
Moving on to Markets revenues of $3.6 billion, down 13% year on year, but as guided excluding business
simplification; the core business was down 5%. Fixed income was $2.5 billion, down 14% excluding business
simplification, driven primarily by lower results in credit-related and securitized products and with rates markets

remaining challenging. However, currencies and emerging markets had a strong quarter, with higher volatility leading
to increased client activity. And our remaining financial commodities business is doing well.
In equities, we saw strong performance for the quarter, up 25% year on year at $1.1 billion. Derivatives was very
strong, one of the best fourth quarters in recent years, largely driven by Asia as client activity increased on central bank
actions. Cash was solid, driven primarily by EMEA on the back of strong ECM results.
With respect to Markets revenues for the first quarter of 2015, business simplification will continue to drive a negative
year-on-year variance, for the quarter approximately $500 million or 10%, with a corresponding expense decline of
approximately $300 million.
Security Services revenues of $1.1 billion was up 6% year on year, including higher NII on higher average deposits.
Assets under custody were $20.5 trillion, flat year on year, with market appreciation largely offset by a significant
client exit. Credit adjustments and other showed a loss, driven by net CVA losses as well as the inclusion of
non-recurring DVA/FVA valuation adjustments totaling approximately $200 million.
Moving on to expenses, total expense is up 14% year on year. Compensation was down 6% from the fourth quarter of
2013 and down 4% for the year, with a comp-to-revenue ratio for the year of 30%. The increase is driven by non-comp
expense, primarily by over $900 million of legal expense, as well as higher control-related expenses, with those being
partially offset by business simplification.
Moving on to Commercial Banking on page 11, this quarter saw net income of $693 million, with an ROE of 19% on
$1.8 billion of revenue. Revenue was up 4% sequentially and flat year on year excluding the one-time proceeds of
approximately $100 million from a lending-related workout that was included in the prior year. Continued yield
compression in our lending book as well as the impact of business simplification is being offset by higher loan and
deposit balances.
Quarter on quarter, revenues increased on better fee revenue, and it was an incredible story for Investment Banking this
quarter, with record gross revenue of $557 million, up 11% year on year and quarter on quarter. For the full year,
Commercial Banking clients generated $2 billion of Investment Banking revenues for the firm, reaching our goal.
Expense is in line with guidance, slightly higher year on year and flat quarter on quarter due to the ongoing investment
in controls.
In loan balances, we saw an increase of $4.7 billion, our best quarter of growth since 2011, driven by strong
performance in our commercial real estate businesses as well as growth in the C&I portfolio this quarter. Our CRE
book has now grown for 15 consecutive quarters and for the quarter grew 4%, ahead of the industry. C&I loans grew
3% this quarter, in line with the industry and with pipelines remaining solid.
Finally, in terms of credit performance, an exceptional year, another single-digit net charge-off rate for the quarter at
eight basis points and a slight net recovery position for the full year.
Moving on to page 12, a solid quarter in Asset Management, with net income of $540 million on $3.2 billion of
revenue. Last year included a mark-to-market gain of approximately $100 million. Adjusting for that, revenue was up
4%. Expense of $2.3 billion was up 3%, and net income up 5% on positive operating leverage. This quarter marked the
23rd consecutive quarter of long-term net inflows at $10 billion, driving AUM of $1.7 trillion, up 9% year on year. And
we achieved the number one ranking in 2014 for global net inflows in active long-term mutual funds. We continued to
see strength in our multi-asset and fixed income flows and although smaller, equity inflows outpaced the industry.
Banking had record loan balances, up 11% year on year, with growth coming from both U.S. and international markets,
and record deposits, up 6%. As reported, client assets of $2.4 trillion were up 2% both year on year and quarter on
quarter; while excluding business simplification, client assets would have been up 8% year on year.
Lastly, for the full year, we saw continued strong investment performance. This was the second consecutive year of
long-term net inflows of over $80 billion, driving a fifth year of record revenue and a second year of record net income,
with 23% ROE and 29% pre-tax margin. AUM loans and deposits were also records for the year.

Turning to page 13, Corporate and Private Equity, Private Equity reported $107 million of net income, primarily driven
by Private Equity gains of approximately $450 million, partially offset by a little over $200 million of related goodwill
impairments. This past Friday we completed the spinout of One Equity Partners, and the investment professionals have
formed a new independent company, OEP Capital Advisors. At the same time, we closed on the sale of a portion of our
private equity portfolio to a group of private equity firms. OEP Capital Advisors will continue to manage both the
investments we sold as well as the investments we've retained. And closing this transaction had no significant impact to
fourth quarter financials.
Treasury and CIO reported a net loss of $205 million, but remember this is after the impact of the change in how we
allocate preferred dividends. Firm NII was $11.3 billion, flat quarter on quarter.
And finally in other corporate, net income was $645 million. Included in this result were tax-related benefits of
approximately $500 million, partially offset by a contribution we made to our foundation of approximately $150
million and close to $100 million pre-tax of legal expense.
So to wrap up, 2014 was a record year for both net income and EPS, with a 13% return on tangible common equity
despite elevated legal expense and despite headwinds from Capital Markets, mortgage, and the low interest rate
environment. We maintained excellent customer satisfaction results and we gained share in many of our businesses,
delivered on our commitments, including business simplification, controls and expense discipline. And we also met our
capital targets for the year while returning $10 billion of net capital to shareholders.
So with that, we'll open up to Q&A. Operator, if you can, open up the lines. Operator?
Q&A
Operator
Your first question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Hi, Betsy.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Hi, okay, so a couple of questions. One is on the GSIB proposal. Obviously, it looks
like you're at the 450 basis points over the 7% minimum. And I know we can't exactly see because we don't have all the
rules around the short-term wholesale funding rule. But I'm wondering where you line up in that bucket, if you're close
to the low end of that range. Is there anything that you could do to move down a bucket?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So, Betsy, obviously two things. The first thing is that the most important time period when
this is going to matter is when it's in full compliance and through the transition period in 2017 and 2018. So the result
in the 450 basis points bucket, as we understand it, is based on 2013 results, so we have to work over the course of the
next three years to make sure we're maximizing every basis point of GSIB and every dollar of capital to the fullest
extent to deliver returns. So I'd rather say that to move down a bucket just in general terms is a fairly significant thing
to do just given the types of things that are driving the overall score, but we're not complacent about it. We've worked
in extreme granularity to make sure that from the very first basis point that we're certain we're maximizing the return
opportunity for that within the context of the bucket we're in. So it will not be a trivial exercise to move down, but
we're focused on making sure that we're optimizing the resources that is our most binding constraint.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: It's a bit of a challenge because it's relative to global peers? So how do you run the
business? The follow-on question is how do you run the business when you've been used to trying to gain as much
market share as you can, but now gaining market share works against you on this G-SIFI?
<A - Marianne Lake>: I think it's probably worth mentioning that while we were in the – or looked like we might be
in the highest bucket relative to our peers, there were peers that were in higher buckets, and they're not constrained by
GSIB but by CCAR. So it's likely to be the case – we continue to believe it's likely to be the case that you're going to

see the differential in required capital for a variety of reasons not being as wide as might be implied by the GSIB. And
so the key question is whether we're delivering the right shareholder value on the incremental capital, which we clearly
think we are and can continue to do.
And so we are trying to thread the needle, as you say, about making sure that we are as focused as we can on
maximizing the use of that scarce resource. But within the bucket that we end up being, wherever that might be, that
our key priority is to deliver the highest ROE and shareholder value we can, particularly in a world where others may
be more constrained by balance sheet or leverage. So it is a fine dance and it's what we're working through. We'll
obviously keep you updated as we continue to progress our plan.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Okay, I assume we'll hear more on it at Investor Day.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes.
<Q - Elizabeth Lynn Graseck>: Thanks.
Operator
Your next question is from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Hi, John.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Yes, hi, Marianne. Just following up on Betsy's questions, your hope is to grow – or I
guess your expectation is to grow the common equity Tier 1 from the 10.1% today to, did you say 50 basis points this
year you hope to add to that?
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, 50 basis points or possibly more.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And I guess could you give us some sense of what the assumptions embedded
in there are in terms of RWA mitigation, I guess Street estimates and earnings and some expectations for capital return?
And I guess is that pace enough to get to what you see as the new GSIB buffer, where it looks to us you might have to
be at 11.5% – 12%? Is this just a timing question that you have time to get to 11.5% to 12%? If you can walk us
through that, it would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Okay, so let me start at the beginning, which is if you look at our Basel III advanced RWA on
the slide, it's just a little over $1.6 trillion. When we were at Investor Day last year, we said that we expected to be able
to provide reductions to that by the end of 2015 to get the number closer to $1.5 trillion on the back of model-related
benefits, et cetera. It's still the case that that's the direction we will move in. Whether we get to exactly $1.5 or slightly
over will depend on the timing of some of those benefits, but that's directionally where we're going. So call it from a
little over $1.6 trillion to a little over $1.5 trillion, and we'll give you an update at Investor Day.
With respect to the assumptions, at the end of the day we generate a lot of capital. And if we need to comply more
quickly than we intend to do, then we can clearly pull those levers. But we have always over the last couple of years
had the approach of wanting to have a reasonable sense of urgency but a measured pace to getting to where we need to
be over the course of a transition period as well as preserving the optionality to continue to increase dividends and do
buybacks, and that continues to be generally our philosophy. And if you take – I think I said this before, and don't read
anything into this with respect to capital ask or anything else. But if you take analyst estimates for the next two to three
years, take $1.5 trillion or even slightly higher RWA basis, you can continue to add 50 basis points of capital a year as
well as have meaningful buyback and capital distribution capacity. And 50 basis points a year from a little over 10%
over three or four years gets you to the other side of 11.5%. So that's just an illustration of the capacity we have, not
necessarily a sort of commitment in terms of glide path. But that's the basis upon which we feel like we'll be able to add
50 basis points this year, which is on a fully phased-in advanced basis, which is we think an appropriate glide path.
<A - James Dimon>: And we haven't really started managing G-SIFI, which we're going to do too now.

<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then just a follow-up on that is on TLAC. You mentioned in some of the
notes here that you might fill any potential shortfall to the current TLAC with additional common equity Tier 1, which
I assume you mean as opposed to debt issuance or preferred. I'm just wondering why you think that would be the best
approach since you might already be building CET1 for a GSIB buffer.
<A - James Dimon>: John, she didn't say that. We're going to meet our common Tier 1 with a buffer we think is
appropriate, and we're going to fill the rest of TLAC with the debt, subordinated debt or preferred we need to.
<A - Marianne Lake>: I think, John, if there's something you're looking that we've confused you, I apologize for that.
For the purposes of clarity, we expect to grow into our GSIB buffer, which will be excluded from TLAC with common
equity. And whatever the gap may be when the rules are finalized on TLAC, somewhere between nothing and
something more meaningful, that's likely to be in debt issuance.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay, got it. That's what I thought. I was just looking at that footnote 10 on page 20.
Maybe just we could take a look at that afterwards.
<A - Marianne Lake>: I apologize. We'll take a look at that.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay, thanks.
Operator
The next question is from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning. I just wanted to talk about expenses and initially focus in on the litigation
charge of $1 billion after tax. It's pretty clear, as you said, that the bulk of it goes to the Investment Bank and that it's
FX, as you said. But should this give us a sense that you now feel that it's reasonable, that you have reasonable and
probable basis to think in terms of what your settlement would be say with the DOJ, or are there other elements that
drove the increment?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So, Guy, what the reserves that we've taken in the quarter represent is our best estimate based
upon facts and circumstances as we know them at the end of the quarter with respect to ongoing dialogue and
investigations, but they're not concluded. So as much as we would like to, we can give you no assurances with respect
to the final conclusion. And that's really all we can say about where we are on the FX matter.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. And then more broadly on expenses, just given that we've seen another decline in net
interest margin, that we've got a flattening yield curve environment and quite a bit of sluggishness elsewhere, and of
course all the regulatory capital requirements that continue to build, should we expect that you'll revisit your $58
billion-ish expense target in some way to bring that meaningfully down?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So just one quick thing on NIM before I talk about expenses. We don't manage to NIM. NIM
can be reasonably volatile purely as a feature of the amount of cash that we have on our balance sheet. What you saw
this quarter in terms of NIM, which was a five or six basis point decline whether you're looking at firm or core, is in
very large part driven by incremental cash balances of close to $50 billion.
<A - James Dimon>: Which literally are there for days.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Right, some of which is there for days, some of which is accretive from an NII perspective,
albeit modestly. So I think the more important measure for us anyway quarter over quarter is that our NII was flat. And
then just in terms of the flattening yield curve, we are more geared towards a short-end rate move, and we're still
expecting that to happen in the second half of the year. And so what really matters for us is the funds rate
notwithstanding the overall yield curve.
With respect to expenses, yes, we will give you more updates at Investor Day. But I can continue to reiterate what we
said in the past, which is we would continue to expect to push our adjusted expense absolute dollars downwards over

the course of the next several years and, in combination with hopefully an improving economy and better interest rates,
move towards the 55% plus or minus, a 55% overhead ratio over the medium term. So you should expect our adjusted
expenses in 2015 to be down. But we continue to have – albeit that we've reached a peak in the second half of the year,
we continue to have elevated cost of controls, and some of that leverage will be more in 2016 and 2017 than in 2015.

Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Good morning, Mike.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. I'm following up on the expense question. If you look at slides two and three, it looks like
your adjusted efficiency ratio of 61% in the fourth quarter and 60% for the year got worse from 59% either the prior
quarter or prior year, so it's gone the wrong direction. And I thought you said that you had some peaking costs in
midyear. And I hear what you're saying about guidance at Investor Day and adjusted expenses in 2015 down. But can
you give any more ins and outs on why you think the efficiency ratio on a core basis should improve?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So a little bit of what's driving the efficiency ratio in the second half versus the first half is
seasonality in revenues, and year-on-year revenues were down slightly. So obviously, it's a little bit elevated relative to
a 59% to 60% ratio, but obviously the absolute dollars are on a downward trend. Hopefully, what we're going to see in
combination over the course of the next year or two is we will continue to look at efficiency in our control spend. As I
say, we're going to be looking at that in 2015 relative to the exit 2014 rate, but you're going to see more of that leverage
in 2016 and 2017. We'll continue to bring mortgage costs down, costs within the branches down. But offsetting against
that, hopefully we'll have stronger performance in some of our businesses and show some expense growth. So overall
trending down, but revenues are part of the story, and they were down slightly year on year.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: It's been three years of stalled progress with overall efficiency. I know you have some of your
reasons with regulatory costs, and you mentioned 2016 and 2017 benefits. But can investors see improvement in
efficiency, expenses to revenues, in 2015?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So, Mike, we'll give you the lowdown of that at Investor Day. You will see absolute reduction
in dollars, and we'll give you the outlook for the efficiency ratio then.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right, thank you.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Thank you, Mike.

Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Good morning.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: You had some good loan growth in consumer and in particular credit card in the
fourth quarter, and I'm just wondering. How much of that is normal seasonality versus maybe some strength in the
underlying demand for the consumer?
<A - Marianne Lake>: I would say a bit of both actually. So obviously, as you articulate, we do see seasonality, but
we did reach an inflection point during the year where we're starting to see a little bit more demand anyway for credit
extension. But I would say our outlook for credit card outstandings growth for 2015 is modest low single-digit growth,
not higher than that. So a little bit of both, but we are flattened by seasonality in terms of the fourth quarter.

<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay. And then just separately in terms of the sharp decline in energy in general
and I guess oil specifically, how do we think about some of the puts and takes with your customer base? Obviously, it
should be good for the consumer, maybe mixed for corporates and institutional. There might be risk to certain
countries. How should we think about this holistically and how do you try and stay on top of this?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So at JPMorgan, taking it in three pieces, yes, we think it's very good for the consumer on
balance and also for the economy on balance despite the strengthening dollar, so we think that the consumer spend,
consumer even credit extension is likely to be positive as a result. From a trading perspective, there are pluses and
minuses. The oil price volatility contributed to the softer quarter in the credit space, but was helpful as it related to the
currency and the commodities space, so in fact net-net neutral to maybe even slightly favorable. And then with respect
to our traditional credit exposure to the sector, it's about 5% of our overall credit exposure. It's well secured top of the
capital structure, where it's a name-by-name analysis that we do, and we feel comfortable with where we are right now.
It's a cyclical business and we're expecting downgrades, but we're not facing any meaningful issues in the face right
now.
<Q - Matthew Derek O'Connor>: Okay.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Overall, oil, a reasonable positive for the economy and consumers, and so for JPMorgan from
a financial perspective, a modest issue, positive or negative.

Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Yes, good morning. My primary question is, there has clearly been a lot of angst build
recently and conversations again about a potential breakup of JPMorgan, especially relative to the higher capital buffers
that could come from the Fed. And I guess, Jamie, could you remind us of how you're thinking about the benefits of
keeping the franchise consolidated for the shareholders versus some of the conversation that investors are having today
about breaking up or shrinking the bank in order to step down on your capital buffers?
<A - James Dimon>: So first of all, I dispute the fact that it's some investors. There are some people who wrote about
it as a possibility because of excess capital. And it's true; you have to hold more capital. All things being equal, it
would reduce your returns. But even the people that wrote about that talk about the superior franchises, the benefits of
synergies, the good things the company brings to bear. So the first way to look at a business first and foremost has been
and always will be what you do for customers, not what you do for yourself and your own returns, et cetera. And on the
customer franchise, in every business we're gaining share. We have good returns. We've got good market shares. We've
got good customer sat levels. The synergies are huge, both expense and revenue synergies, et cetera. And some, not all,
disappear under various schematics of a breakup or something like that. That's number one.
And the question is now that you're bearing extra capital, how bad is that relative to that. And for the most part, we've
been able to manage that. We've talked about products repricing and managing G-SIFI and managing CCAR and
managing LCR and managing SLR, and we're going to maintain the franchise manage it and we still think we can get
good returns. There is a point at which the capital drag will be so high that you may want to consider alternatives, but
just remember they're not simple. Like anything you do, every company has to have cash management, global trade
ability. Every company needs general ledgers and HR things and data centers and mirrored data centers and cyber
security. It isn't that type of process. But so far, the company has earned good returns in all of its businesses throughout
this crisis, and I'm going back to 2010, 2011, 2012, and that's a sign of stability. In fact, even Mike Mayo had a report,
which there's a slide in it that shows the volatility of returns and that we were among the lowest with the better returns.
So that is proving it; that the model works from a business standpoint. And yes, we'll have to carry more capital and
we'll manage that over time.

<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Great.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Erika, just to add to that, we're still in a period of flux as it relates to broadly rules, larger
capital rules, and we're in a period of flux as it relates to the competitive environment. And it would be, for us it would
be premature to take these strategic decisions that we don't think would add shareholder value in what is a very
challenging influx and cyclical low for the environment. So we preserve optionality. We think we're generating
significant shareholder value, significant synergies, and any discount could erode regardless.
<A - James Dimon>: And remember, the capital stuff is not – what they're doing now is not a size of riskiness. This
company has been a fortress company. It has delivered to clients, and its diversification is the reason why it's had less
volatility of earnings and was able to go through the crisis and never lost money ever, not one quarter. And so in a
real-life crisis, we did fine. In any future crisis, we're going to do fine. There is a reason you have big global
multinational banks, and they serve big global multinationals, including governments. This company moves $6 trillion
to $10 trillion a day. You're not going do that as a small bank and you're not going to syndicate out a $20 billion bridge
loan, and you can't do certain things globally in 20 countries if you aren't in 20 countries. So you've got to figure out
what model you have and does it make sense, and it's not necessarily comparable to all other companies. So our model
makes sense because we've seen the returns in it.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Understood, and just a follow-up question to that. Marianne, if we look at the GSIB scoring
process, not the proposed Fed process, and we think about the five pillars that drive the buffers, it seems like if we look
at publicly available data that where JPMorgan really sticks out is under the complexity pillar.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Right.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Is there any way to move that down without giving up significant or meaningful revenue?
And is that the bucket of focus in terms of potentially managing buffers from here?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So you're right. The complexity bucket does stick out. Just for what it's worth, we're looking at
each bucket and we're looking at it at a very granular level because obviously we need to look at the whole thing in
combination. And the complexity bucket, Jamie said it I think earlier. If he didn't, I'll just repeat it. OTC derivative
notionals drive a large chunk of it. Clearly, we're going to do everything we can in terms of netting and housekeeping
and everything to reduce that. But to reduce that meaningfully is to have a meaningful impact on our clients' flow
business. Level 3 assets is the second piece, and obviously to the degree that those things are – by definition they're less
liquid. And so as a result...
<A - James Dimon>: That does not make them bad.
<A - Marianne Lake>: That does not make them bad; they're just less liquid. And as result, we obviously will take a
look at whether or not there's opportunity to reduce that. But again, it's also relative to market size. And then finally,
our AFS portfolio, which to have that in a complexity bucket is not intuitive to all of us; and over time, that may
reduce, but right now it's a very core part of how we think about structuring the interest rate risk management of our
balance sheet. So we're going to look at it but we're going to get very, very granular and there's no silver bullet.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Got it.
<A - James Dimon>: I would just add that over a year we can drive it down without damaging the franchise.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Right. It's about looking at the first 10 to 20 basis points, not the last three or four basis points.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Understood, thank you for taking my questions.

<A - Marianne Lake>: Hi, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hello. Can we revisit the energy conversation for a sec? In my experience, when any asset
class falls this much so quickly, it's usually pretty bad. And I heard your comments, and I completely agree that it's
great for the consumer and net-net positive. But am I doing the math right? If it's 5% of your outstandings, is that on the
$743 billion of loans?
<A - James Dimon>: That's commercial. You mean commercial.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Commercial, okay. Because what I want to get at is you made a comment. It's 5% of
outstandings; a lot of it's secured. I'm sure you have some reserves against it. It just seems like an odd thing. I know it's
early and we'll see if it stays down here, but it seems like a big deal, and yet it doesn't seem like a big deal to you guys.
So I just want to make sure that we talk about what your exact exposures are and why you feel better than most people I
talk to.
<A - Marianne Lake>: So our exposures are about $46 billion, about 5% of our traditional credit portfolio. About 70%
of it is investment-grade. About two-thirds of it is in the CIB, o these are large, well capitalized companies. The other
third is in the Commercial Bank. Name by name we understand what that looks like. These are asset-based loans, top of
the capital structure, names we know. And we're going to see downgrades, and we're not suggesting that there isn't
going to be some stress and we don't know where oil may bottom. But yes, we do have reserves. We have reserves that
are based upon a long history of data that includes cycles. We've seen cycles before like this, and so we'll take
downgrades. We may need to take more reserves, but it doesn't feel like it's a very significant issue or an imminent
series of charge-offs right now.
<A - James Dimon>: For us. There will be companies that are more invested in oil that may have different issues. And
then there are the secondary effects, which obviously you all can predict like Russia, Venezuela. So Russia we have
exposure, Venezuela virtually none, and other countries.
And then there's another secondary effect if you talk about commercial or even consumer real estate in Dallas, Denver,
Houston, as you saw in 1986 to 1989, and those are all slight negatives. But again, for us they're not going to be
material. We're very well diversified. And for us, you have the other side. General consumer credit will be better, not
worse. And you can argue, and I don't want to spend too much time on it, that even retails will be better. There are a
whole bunch of other beneficiaries of this change of credit. So some will be worse; some will be better. So net-net for
us, it's not that big of a deal. It's a perfectly legitimate thing for you all to be concerned about for companies which are
very concentrated in oil or even commercial real estate companies concentrated in oil areas. That's not something that
we need to worry about.
<A - Marianne Lake>: So we're watching it closely. To Jamie's point, we're paying attention to our real estate
portfolios in those geographies. So there's going to be overall sector and geographical differences to how this plays out,
and we're paying attention to that.
<A - James Dimon>: This is an example of diversity that helps. It really helps, yes.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: I appreciate that. The only related follow-up I have is I don't know if the same thing is
happening in oil. I know in and around October 15 when we had the wild swings in the 10-year, people talked about
less liquidity at the banks being a partial contributor. I'm curious to see if you think there's something to do with that on
the oil side too because everybody has been downsizing commodities. And then the bigger question is does anybody
care about it? Are the regulators watching and paying attention? And do you think some of this is contributing to the
bigger volatile swings we're seeing?
<A - Marianne Lake>: On the first point, I think there's probably some truth to less liquidity but it's more about
oversupply and lack of global growth stimulating demand than it is I think a liquidity story from a capital markets
perspective. Sorry, Jamie, you were going to...

<A - James Dimon>: I would just add that when you look at – I'm surprised that people are so surprised when
commodities move like this. Commodities moved like this my whole life. And obviously, there's supply and demand
imbalance. And Marianne mentioned that the United States supply has gone up 5 million barrels a day over the last five
or six years. People are a little surprised at the production that was positive out of Libya and Iran and Iraq and some
other places. A lot of people need oil revenues.
But the other thing that surprised people was the slightly increased demand, and I'd say slightly out of China and some
other places. And the other one that surprised people is OPEC. Instead of OPEC making some kind of move to reduce
supply, they didn't. But to me, oil – all commodities have that kind of volatility, and oil has got even more volatility. So
in the oil business, you've got to prepare for something like that. That is the way it's going to be and that's the way it's
going to be for the rest of your life. And yes, speculations, inventory, and all those things may affect it in the short run.
Remember there is a fulcrum point at which oil, the marginal dollar is going to be reduced and I think our economists
say it's about $75 oil deep drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and around the world. And one day it will recover to that
because the world still will use more oil and need more oil, et cetera. And in the meantime, you've got to manage
around the volatility.
I don't think any of that had to do with trading, none of it. It had to do with fundamental supply/demand imbalances and
people getting prepared for it and taking views on – and not us, I'm talking about oil companies. And you've read about
countries who hedged it and countries who didn't and companies who hedged and companies who didn't. And I think
there is a legitimate concern about liquidity and markets that when we have volatile markets or violent markets how
much liquidity will remain. But I think there you're talking more about what you saw a little bit in Treasuries, but more
about credit. And it's possible. We just don't really know. We're a little worried about it. But we'll be there hopefully
making healthy margins for our clients when the time comes.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay, thanks both.

Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Good morning. Marianne, I just wanted to follow up on some of the regulatory
discussions that we've had. You mentioned back in December that you felt that even though at the 11.5% buffer, there
may not be as big a difference in terms of capital requirements between you and some of your U.S. peers as the initial
numbers may initially indicate. It sounded like that may have been a focus on the short-term wholesale funding buffer,
which obviously hasn't been released. You mentioned in December you felt that that would be around 50 basis points in
terms of at least a starting point for you all. Is it your sense that there could be calibrations above and below your level
of 50 basis points, or do you think at this point it could be a blanket number across all of the big banks?
<A - Marianne Lake>: No, obviously we need to get clear on what the final rules and calculations look like. I don't
see it being a blanket number. I think it's pretty evident that it's intended to be at least measured relative to the size. It's
the one measure that's not measured relative to market share but relative to the size of your operation. And so
consequently, depending upon how the math works out, it could be a differentiator for other people. But my comments
were not necessarily driven by whether or not somebody else was going to be more punitive or more penalized by
short-term wholesale funding, but by the fact that GSIB hasn't been and is unlikely to be the binding constraint for
some of our competitors. For some of those it's CCAR stress; for some it's leverage under CCAR stress. And as a
result, they already are running at or above the levels that may be implied, and that may continue to increase.
So here we have a situation where the transition period, the glide path is a four-year period. We're at 10.1%, looking to
put a glide path together that measures all of our objectives over the next few years where others are at or approaching
11%. So we'll see obviously how that plays out in the medium term – or in the short term, I should say. Certainly in the
short term, we have a reasonably level playing field. The competitive landscape is changing, and we're working very
hard to make sure we're maximizing the return on every dollar we have.

<A - James Dimon>: And the reason it went from 2.5% to 4% wasn't because of short-term funding. It was because it
basically doubled the number under the new methodology. I think when you spoke about 50 basis points of buffer, you
aren't talking about a short-term wholesale funding buffer. You're talking about a buffer over the required number to
handle volatility.
<A - Marianne Lake>: So the buffer, yes, totally volatile, it's mainly AOCI driven. The 50 basis points is the best
estimate of what the short-term wholesale contribution...
<A - James Dimon>: Added to it, yes. That is the GSIB requirement added to the buffer.
<A - Marianne Lake>: But we'll see. My view is it's not a blanket though, so you could see some people differentiated
in that sense.
<Q - Matthew H. Burnell>: Fair enough. And then, Marianne, just for a follow-up, in terms of your outlook for GDP,
I think in December you also mentioned that you expected around 3% GDP growth as your operating assumption, a
little stronger in the second half than the first half. Given your comments on when you think rates are going up, it
doesn't sound like that has changed very much. But given your conversations about oil and some of the other growth
numbers that have come out, has that changed very much?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So obviously if you get granular...
<A - James Dimon>: We moved it to 3.1%.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Obviously, if you get granular to different specific countries, we may have a different answer;
but as a general matter, no. As a general matter for the U.S., 2015 over 2014, we're calling for 2.5% and globally closer
to 3%.

Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Thank you, good morning. Jamie, you were very clear on the success of the global franchise
that you guys have built and the success that you've been having with it. Is there any evidence that you're seeing some
pricing increases or you can generate some pricing increases because of this franchise? And if not yet, what do you
think it's going to take for you to be able to really get some better pricing because of the value of the franchise that you
present to your customers?
<A - James Dimon>: It's a tough question to answer. We have seen some pricing changes in trade finance, a little bit in
Prime Broker, not really in Credit, but I do think you're going to see some of it in Credit. And so over time, remember,
that's not because of JPMorgan. That's just because the market is going to reprice some of these things because they're
more expensive to do, and we do expect that will happen somewhat over time.
And remember, the other thing which is really important is we manage this by client. So you can actually do a better
job under LCR, G-SIFI, CCAR by client and not change pricing, just change mix. And so we're working 100 different
ways to figure out how to get good returns to shareholders while doing a good job for clients. And remember, we have
more options to do that. So whenever we talk to a client, they're going to want some of our balance sheet capability and
they may be willing to do other business with you to make sure they get it. Even if the pricing doesn't change, it might
be good for us.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: And then as a follow-up, in the Corporate & Investment Bank, the world now has been
operating under the Volcker Rule since July of 2014. Can you share with us? Is there any secular trends that you're
seeing because of that? And I noticed that your compensation expense as a percentage of revenue was a real low 27%
versus 35% a year ago. Is that reflective of the changes because of the Volcker Rule?

<A - James Dimon>: So the Volcker Rule in general, we have accommodated the Volcker Rule, which we have to do
in private equity and investments in hedge funds. And Marianne mentioned that we closed the sale of a couple billion
dollars of private equity stuff. And even the CLO issue is a very temporary thing. The only question with CLOs is
should people be forced to sell it because they're all going to run off in three to seven years. So there are questions at
the bank – and that is not a material issue to us. We're going to accommodate that.
The other thing that's important about Volcker is now the remaining one, how it affects market making. And obviously,
there the clients are going to be concerned. Do you have good market making? There are all these rules around it. We're
accommodating those, reporting client demand, aged inventory, different ways of reporting volatility in trading, and
now you have capital liquidity. So all the trading is to try to make it safer but also so people can make markets. And we
hope at the end of the day that will happen. If there needs to be adjustments, it's really because you clients are going to
say this isn't working for us.
The other thing I wanted to mention about liquidity, spreads are the same in credit, but the size you can trade is much
smaller, which to me is an early indicator if something goes wrong, you're going to have a gap out in spreads quicker
and wider than you might have had before. So at the end of the day, we hope to be able to be a good market maker,
earn fair returns for shareholders. And obviously, we have to apply Volcker and all the other regulations to it.
<A - Marianne Lake>: I think the other thing to think about when you look at the comp to revenue ratio, just for the
purposes of clarity, is that if you look at the fourth quarter of last year, excluding DVA and FVA it was about closer to
26%, so closer to in line year over year. And that's evident when you look at the full-year ratio last year of 31% to 30%.
So we're at the low end of our range of 30% but within the range relative to the performance. And there was a big
negative impact in the CIB on a revenue basis last year with the FVA/DVA.
<A - James Dimon>: And I should say that we've always allocated capital to the Investment Bank, and we've had FVA
adjusted returns and stuff like that. So as you allocate more capital, all things being equal, that number comes down a
little bit because we've been disciplined in trying to do that properly.

Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Good morning.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: So the first question I have is on actually the Debt Capital Markets business. Clearly, the
results were quite impressive in the quarter, certainly better than what the public proxy suggested. I was hoping you
could give some additional color as to what drove this strength and then maybe how that informs your outlook in 2015
given that on the last earnings call, Marianne, you noted that there could be some pressure on that business certainly
going into next year or now this coming year.
<A - Marianne Lake>: I think if you look at the 2015 dynamic, there are going to be three principal things. 2014 was a
year of larger deals. 2015 has still got a good pipeline. So we're expecting to have a reasonably strong at least start to
the year and probably a strong year. And it's very driven in the fourth quarter and likely to continue to be so by M&A
related financings. So the downside we talked about is just less maturities to be refinanced, but nevertheless some. But
we're going to continue to have support from the M&A space, which we expect to be fairly strong in 2015. So you've
got some puts and takes, but what we think is going to be a solid to good year in 2015, maybe not a record, but
certainly a good year.
<A - James Dimon>: And so JPMorgan maintained number one share in global investment-grade, number one share in
global high-yield, number one share in loan syndication, which we hope to maintain next year too, and those are very
powerful positions to have.

<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: No, certainly. And switching gears for a moment, just back to the capital discussion, I just
wanted to get a better understanding as to what drove the RWA inflation in the coming quarter. It sounded as though it
was really primarily a function of counterparty credit risk inflation. I just wanted to get a better sense as to whether that
was driven by some of the pressures on the corporates in the oil and energy space; and also whether your $1.5 trillion
target that you reaffirmed, whether that does contemplate the potential risk for further inflation in the coming quarters
if those pressures continue.
<A - Marianne Lake>: First of all, I think to put it into context, I think that RWA growth was $12 billion, so
nevertheless growth but not a huge number. A chunk of it was regular way CVA, which yes, in part has got to do with
just normal market dynamics right now and spreads wider and volatility higher. But a chunk of it is unrelated to that.
And as we look forward to the end of next year at $1.5 trillion, which just to be clear, I think I said $1.5 trillion or
maybe slightly higher, but nevertheless in the law of big numbers at the same trajectory, it's more at risk from just the
timing of our ability to execute on granular segmented models, model approvals internally and with the regulators than
necessarily any market dynamics, notwithstanding that will factor in. So I would say the bigger risk to achieving that
are less the market pricing impacts on CVA but more the ability for us to, get the right timing of those model benefits.
<A - James Dimon>: And then I think like two-thirds is models and one-third is runoff of stuff we know that's going to
happen. And the other thing, as Marianne mentioned, the advanced where we're 10.1%, the standardized we're at 10.5%
and yet the advanced will change. If spreads gap out, the advanced will go up, but standardized won't. Eventually, we
think standardized is going to be the binding constraint, not advanced.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay, understood. Thank you for taking my questions.

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Thanks, good morning. My question was on the Consumer & Community Banking
business. There are a couple of moving pieces this quarter with the sale of the card results, but also underneath it
looked like a couple of the fee-related areas might have been a little soft. I'm just wondering if you can try to
disaggregate that for us. And was there anything that was also more one-time in nature or seasonal about those
businesses this quarter.
<A - Marianne Lake>: So obviously, we talked about the cards portfolio exits driving some revenue decline and also
some elevated credit charge-offs. We've been experiencing – and I think we guided to the low end of our 12% to 12.5%
revenue rate range. We guided to that last quarter or the quarter before, and at 12.2% we're in that range. And what
we're experiencing is spread compression is largely offsetting the strong interchange and other fee growth from the
volume.
But when you acquire new customers and you pay the premium to acquire new customers, that gets amortized through
your results in the first year. So in years when you're net acquiring new customers, you will have a small net drag on
your fees and on your revenue rate resulting from amortizing those premiums for the benefit of those strong
relationships and the increased outstandings and spend sales volume you get in future years. So we've been on a
journey for the last two years and we continue to be on it, where there is some impact associated from the fact that we
are net acquiring new customers, each of which we believe returns hurdle for us or more than hurdle for us, so it is
accretive over a period.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Okay, so it's a today versus tomorrow thing. And then on a follow-up, coming back to the
energy discussion, you mentioned that it would be net to the consumer business, and I just wanted to ask you to flesh
that out for us. As you think about the benefits that you would expect to get from the decline in oil prices, is it growth?
Is it spend? Is it credit? How would you disaggregate that? And give us an understanding of either magnitude or just
time to see that benefit.

<A - James Dimon>: I wouldn't spend too much time trying to build this into your models if I were you. But it is quite
clear that when you add $800 a year to the consumers' cash flow statements that the consumers on average spend most
of that. And I think you're seeing it in spend, and you're seeing it in car sales and you're seeing it in retail spend. You're
seeing it. And it's also quite clear it helps consumers. It helps their credit, I mean broadly. We're not going out and
saying that we're going to reduce credit costs in auto, card, and a bunch of stuff by 10 or 15 basis points. I'm just saying
you know it's going to be there, just like you know it was there on the flip side, where people spend a lot of time talking
about how much gas prices are hurting consumers and why sales are down at Walmart and Family Dollar Store, et
cetera. This is just the flip side of that.
<A - Marianne Lake>: If you just look at the consumer spending statistics, if you look at four-quarter annualized up
4.7% is the best consumer spend data since 2003. So it's already taking effect in consumer spend. And disposable
income is, as you say, we're all expecting new car sales to grow next year, but all of this is just going to support the
continued strong trends we've seen in consumer.
<Q - Kenneth M. Usdin>: Okay, thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Hey, good morning. I just want to follow up on the card fee income discussion. If you look
at your new accounts opened year over year, you were flat. It seems like you're starting to lap that higher amortization
of acquisition costs. So is it fair to assume that we are at least getting closer to an inflection point where we're going to
see fee incomes track more closely with growth in spend, or is there something else going on here?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So you're right. We're close to lapping the acquisition cost dynamic, not this quarter but in the
near future. But what you are going to continue to see is that we have a portfolio that's in runoff. And as those loans run
off, they were loans that were higher APR, higher rate loans than the ones we're originating right now. And as a result,
you're going to continue to see some spread compression in 2015, against which you're going to see strong interchange.
So I would say yes, ultimately and in the fullness of time you're going to start to see the interchange growth outpace the
spread compression, but for a period of time they're going to be somewhat of a wash.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Right. But I was just speaking specifically to the fee income where you were down I think
7% year over year. I would think that would start to turn positive at some point.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay, fair enough, and maybe just one quick question on the expense side. You talked about
the simplification impact on revenues and expenses. You're still a net negative about $200 million pre-taxes. Should
that get closer to zero? Is it just it takes a little longer to get the expenses out versus the revenues, or is that going to be
a permanent drag?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So overall, the way to think about it is it's not ultimately going to be necessarily zero. But
when you think about it in the context of the capital and the relative returns, it was not accretive to our returns. And so
we have the differential between $500 million and $300 million. For the full year, it's still not zero. There is a slight
lag. Clearly, the slight lag is taking out the expenses. But there's still an overall small net income impact; but for
overall, neutral to positive benefit on the return.
<Q - James F. Mitchell>: Okay, got you. Thanks.
<A - Marianne Lake>: And regardless of that, remember that our rationale for business simplification included a
bunch of different reasons. It included activities that weren't core to our core clients, activities that were outsized in
terms of operational or other risks, as well as those that weren't returning hurdle. So there are other reasons to simplify
your business and they will have other ancillary benefits

Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Good morning, a quick question on derivatives and equities. You guys highlighted the
strength there. Were there any one-timers in those results because it certainly seemed like 4Q was volatile? Also, did
the uptick in equities VaR have anything to do with the revenue trends there?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So no specific one-time items in the equity derivatives performance. The uptick in VaR has to
do generally speaking with higher levels of volatility than it does with anything in terms of risk direction.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay.
<A - James Dimon>: Equity derivatives was largely Japan and Europe and Asia.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes.
<A - James Dimon>: The increase.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Largely Asia, yes.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: And that's true across...
<A - James Dimon>: It's an example where volatility did actually help.
<A - Marianne Lake>: If you look at equities in total, particularly in the prime space, there was a small one-time item
but not in the derivatives space.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Got it. And that change in VaR due to volatility was across the board in the buckets, not just
in the equities VaR?
<A - Marianne Lake>: It's not a significant increase in VaR, but yes, you see an increase in CPG VaR, on spread
widening and volatility increase in equities. Just year over year and quarter over quarter, we've seen an increase in
volatility.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. And then sticking with Capital Markets, thinking about how we're starting the current
quarter, it does feel a lot like déjà vu here in the beginning of the fourth quarter, where the markets are beginning with
some pretty unconstructive volatility. I know we're very, very early going. But is that a fair comparison to make, and
are we starting off on a pretty tough foot here? Obviously, there is a lot of road to hoe here, but any comments on that
would be helpful.
<A - Marianne Lake>: This quarter more than any quarter, it's like really honestly too early to make any comments of
any note regarding trading performance, particularly given that the holiday fell midweek. So the reality of the situation
is thematically nothing has changed from the end of the fourth quarter, but there's no big new news in the first few days
of trading.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Great, last small cleanup one on Capital Markets. I know you mentioned that there's going to
be a lag from business simplification. But was any of the decline in comp in CIB tied to business simplification here?
I'm just trying to think about how much of that drop might have been due to some other items aside from that.
<A - James Dimon>: It was year-end cleanup. It had nothing to do with business simplification.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Perfect, thanks.
<A - Marianne Lake>: And I think if you look at our revenues excluding FVA/DVA, year over year they're down
reasonably, in line with comp.

Thank you your next question is from the line of Paul Miller with FBR.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Yes, thank you very much. On the mortgage banking side, you're definitely picking up market
share from probably – you were shedding market share up until probably the second quarter of this year. And one of the
chatters out there is that you've gotten more aggressive in the correspondent markets. And the comment you made,
Jamie, back in I think June of this year was that you wanted to get out – maybe not get out of but lessen your exposure
to those low FICO, high LTVs; i.e., FHA loans. I was wondering if you're still trying to lower your market share in
FHA loans. Can you make some comments about being more aggressive on the correspondent side too?
<A - James Dimon>: I think they're two different issues. One is the correspondent business properly done is fine, and
obviously we do look at their credit underwriting because we've had a backup over the last five or ten years.
Correspondents are no longer in business. And if they did a bad job, we had to pay for that. So you want to be careful
and do business with the proper people. We have reduced our share of FHA loans just because of the ongoing – two
reasons. One is the ongoing liability on the production side where the insurance was worthless over time. And the
second is just the cost of servicing FHA loans when they go in default, and they have a much higher chance of going
into default than not. So those are two reasons to do less. And maybe that will change over time, but we're still in the
same place on that.
<A - Marianne Lake>: And just on the share gains, they are in jumbo and conventional conforming loans, not in the
government space. So yes, we are competing aggressively on price, but with the right capital allocation, with the right
hurdle. And these are loans that are very high quality that we are willing to put on our balance sheet, done with
correspondents that we have confidence in the financial status of.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And some of the rule changes, to follow up, some of the rule changes you're seeing coming out
of GSEs have tried to spur I guess loan demand as you're seeing the GSEs starting to do 3% down payment loans. Is
that something that JPMorgan would go down underwritten correctly, or is that just too risky?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So look, the GSE, you could always get loans up to 97% in the government space. You could
get it in the agency space with mortgage insurance. We've seen movement up on the FHA on GCs and mortgage
insurance premiums, all of which I think is intended to try and help credit availability, which we would generally
support. It doesn't change our strategy, however, which is that we are much more focused on originating in the very
high-quality jumbo and conventional conforming space. But yes, properly underwritten, we will do agency loans in the
programs that they have available.

<Q - Eric Edmund Wasserstrom>: Sorry, I naturally had muted myself. Good morning, just a couple of follow-up
questions. Marianne, you talked about some of the loan growth that you've experienced and expect to continue to

your GAAP balance sheet given that a portion of the RWA reduction sounds like it is coming from runoff?

<A - Marianne Lake>: Look, we have – over the last I think two years and a quarter, two-plus years or so, we've seen
an inflow of cash of between $300 billion and $400 billion on our balance sheet. And so our balance sheet size has
grown slightly over the course of the last several quarters and the last year. But the vast majority of the growth is driven
by incremental cash, and there are two principal reasons for that. One is we have been looking to become compliant
with our own and with U.S. rules on liquidity, which we are compliant with at this point and have been for a while. But
the other is also that we've been receiving increased non-operational cash, predominantly from wholesale clients.
And so to the degree that that cash is accretive from an NII perspective and that we are balance sheet or leverage
constrained and it's a key part of a relationship with that client, that may not be a bad thing. But to the degree that it's
not a key part of the relationship, we're going to be disciplined about trying to manage that balance. So I would say
underlying that, we would expect our balance sheet to not be growing, certainly not significantly, but cash can be the
volatile factor.
<Q - Eric Edmund Wasserstrom>: Sure. I guess I was thinking about it more from the perspective of the loan
portfolio. It sounds like the expectation is...
<A - Marianne Lake>: We saw loan growth year over year 8% core, 3% reported. We feel pretty good about the
demand for loans across our businesses, particularly those that have been performing strongly now consistently like
business banking, like prime mortgage on the portfolio, commercial real estate, even auto. And we continue to be
optimistic about C&I and even card. So yes, we would expect to see robust loan growth into next year, hopefully on the
back of a continued improvement in the economy.
<Q - Eric Edmund Wasserstrom>: Got it. So if I were to summarize all of the guidance that you gave today with
those comments, it sounds like the expectation is for modestly higher net interest income, fee income reflecting
whatever volatility we suffer from in the capital markets space, an absolute decline in operating expense, but likely
some increase in the provision. Is that generally correct?
<A - Marianne Lake>: I'll do the NII one for you. On the back of robust loan demand and rising rates in the second
half of the year, which is our current central case, then we would expect NII to be up in the second half of the year,
flattish in the first half of the year. Obviously, if those two things don't play out, then that wouldn't be the case. I'll let
you draw your own conclusions on the rest of it.
<A - James Dimon>: You're using the implied yield curve effectively. So if that changes, then obviously it will affect
the second half of the year.
<Q - Eric Edmund Wasserstrom>: Sure, great. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Christopher M. Kotowski>: You've been consistent about the issue of dividing the firm up into constituent
companies, about the strategic benefits of it all. But I wonder if you've done any contingency planning on what if it
ever came to the fact that it was too much of a drag to keep it all together. And I guess the question I have is, is it even
possible to unscramble the egg? Specifically, the issue I'm wondering about is you've got over $160 billion of debt at
the parent company level. If you were to break the company up into a consumer bank and a wholesale bank and an
asset management business, just for argument's sake, is there a way to fairly allocate that debt to the three various lines
of business, or how would one even go about that?
<A - James Dimon>: The unscrambling would be extraordinarily complex, and it would be extraordinarily complex in
debt, in systems and technology and people and where certain things go. And the businesses would start competing
with each other right away, which I think is pretty reasonable if they were separate and standalone.
Look, we're very conscious of the narrative which has become out there about this, but it is far more complex than that.
The right way to look at it is we have these great franchises. We have a lot of time to manage through this. And that is

our objective, not unscrambling the egg. We're going to manage through it and we can manage almost every single part
of it. Think of over a long period, like five or seven years. Don't think of it over six months or a year. There's nothing
we couldn't set a limit, drive down, sell, manage, and that would probably be far easier than the alternative, even if it
led to lower growth, but it wouldn't necessarily lead to lower returns.
So just keep in mind that obviously we're going to do the right thing at the end of the day for the shareholder. It might
be lower growth and better returns and managing through that and not doing certain things at all. Marianne mentioned,
for example, the amount of deposits we take in. It might be that we limit and restrict the amount of deposits we take in
at quarter-end. We do it to accommodate clients. But all those non-operational deposits go directly into the Federal
Reserve. That's what Marianne said we do and maybe make some spread, gain 25 basis points there and you're maybe
paying the client something. There are some clients which aren't charged to take their quarter-end. They don't do
enough business with us and we don't want their quarter-end balances. So we have a lot of levers. We have a lot of
time. And we're going to do it very intelligent over time. We're not going to damage this franchise just because of a
current narrative.
And the other thing I want to point out about the current narrative, which surprises me that people don't mention, when
you all talk about P/Es and sum of the parts, P/Es are temporary. P/Es change over time. And the real question you
should be asking is, is the E going to be much higher or much lower under scenario A or B, not just what the P/E is
going to be because I can give you a lot of scenarios where your E is going to be a hell of a lot lower and that dwarfs
the effect of P/E change. And the Ps themselves are temporary. JPMorgan is already earning its cost of capital, and
you're comparing the Ps to a lot of guys who aren't earning their cost of capital. People expect them to have a dramatic
growth in earnings, which they will.
And so you've really got to have a much more full looking view of what P/Es will be, what values will be, what
earnings will be, what the franchise will be than just sum of the parts breakup based on current P/Es and false
comparisons. Some of the people out there people are people comparing it to – they are not real comparisons. We're not
in the same business as those people. But we are very shareholder conscious. That's not to say we're not going do the
right thing for shareholder return. We will. There are other ways to do it.
<Q - Christopher M. Kotowski>: Okay, thanks.
<A - James Dimon>: Another thing which I think is important too is that we compete globally. Remember, we have to
be very cognizant of who we're competing with and what they're going to do over time. And my guess is you're going
to have some very large, very tough global competition over the next 20 years. They are not going away. They may
have currently lower G-SIFI charges, but I'm not sure that's going to be true 10 years from now. Particularly the
Chinese banks get bigger and bigger and some other global competitors decide they want to be in the global businesses.
<Q - Christopher M. Kotowski>: Okay, thanks.

your disclosure in the 10-K, but can you say anything about whether there are other cases or buckets of cases out there

you a sense for the things that are outstanding. We will obviously update it and refresh it in the 10-K, but we're not
going to discuss specifically all of the remaining cases.
<A - James Dimon>: David, I think again, the way people – I know we cause problems with you all because we have
this lumpy quarter-by-quarter type stuff. I wouldn't look at this as a quarter-by-quarter issue. If you owned 100% of this

couple billion before we get to normal, what I call more normalized legalized basis.
We disclose all that stuff in the 10-K. I think the RPL if you ask me is actually fairly decent way to look at what those
might be. And we give you an RPL number, which is something that has not gone through the P&L, which is possible.
And we can't make something which is lumpy not lumpy, and we can't make something which we wish we can bucket,
and if we could, we would put up all the reserves now and say we're done. We can't.
<Q - David B. Hilder>: Understood, thanks very much and for your comments on the...
<A - James Dimon>: It's a number. And the important part as a shareholder is I want to deal with that, acknowledge
our mistakes, try to have a fortress controlled balance sheet, try to stop stepping in dog shit, which we do every now
and then, but build a customer franchise is the important part. When you have a market cap of $230 billion, I want to
make that worth $500 billion 10 years from now. The several billion dollars that we're going to have to pay for legal
stuff, we want to fix it. It's unfortunate we do this to you all, but it's unavoidable right now.
<Q - David B. Hilder>: All right, I would agree with all of that. Thanks very much.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Nancy Bush with NAB Research.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Good morning, two questions. Marianne, we had some numbers last week that indicated
rising delinquency in auto loan portfolios, and I think your commentary about your losses this quarter confirm that. Are
the numbers right now aberrational, or is this a seasoning trend, or how do you see this?
<A - Marianne Lake>: I can talk J.P. Morgan very specifically that we are seeing the charge-off rate. Remember,
we've had charge-off rates for the auto business that have been relatively low for an extended period, and now we're
seeing them revert back to something more normal. And when we think about pricing the business, through the cycle,
we contemplate a more normal level of charge-offs, so this isn't surprising to us.
Having said that, what we're also seeing in terms of just the broad competitive space is it's not irrationality necessarily,
but longer duration, higher LTVs, more subprime origination. At JPMorgan, we are lower LTVs than the industry and
very concentrated on the near and super-prime space. So there's part of that that we're just not participating in. But even
for our own portfolio, you're going to see some of those charge-off rates trend up to something a bit more normal, but
that's how we think about the business through the cycle.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Do you feel confident that this is not the canary in the coal mine with regard to perhaps
other consumer segments?
<A - Marianne Lake>: I hate to say I'm confident about anything, but that's not our expectation.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay. And second...
<A - James Dimon>: It's a very good question because of we all went through in the mortgage thing where subprime
was an early indicator, for even prime. And so when we look at credit card, we don't think it's an early indicator credit
card.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Right, okay.
<A - James Dimon>: We're going to be very conscious. As Marianne said, auto did unbelievably well through the
crisis, shockingly well we all say. So maybe it's a return to norm but we're going to be paying a lot of attention to it.
<A - Marianne Lake>: And the loans that we're originating now, they're very far to the right side of 700 FICO loans
with LTVs lower than the industry, lower than 100%.

<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay, Jamie, one final – hopefully, final question on the breakup issue. We all listen to
what you say about the strategic value of your businesses and the complementary nature of the businesses, et cetera,
and it all sounds very logical. But in Washington, there is still a belief that your company in its present form is a danger
to the global financial system. In your view, is there any level of capital that is going to mitigate the too big to fail
issue, or does it go beyond that?
<A - James Dimon>: Nancy, views and facts are completely different. This company was a port in the storm in the real
crisis in 2008 and 2009, and that was after we bought Bear Stearns and WaMu. We had no issues whatsoever. We have
a lot more capital now. We're more conservative now. We've got less credit exposure as a percent of the balance sheet.
We've got less risk as a percent of the balance sheet. We've got more long-term debt. We've got more liquid assets.
We've got more. So it's even more true today. The fact is the company is an extremely powerful thing. People, when
they talk about risk, they're just talking about – a lot of people just look at size, and it scares them. I completely
understand that. But that isn't the determinant, and I don't think we should be making shareholder decisions based upon
views of people who we don't necessarily really know.
And so if the regulators at the end of the day want JPMorgan to be split up, then that's what will have to happen. We
can't fight the federal government if that's their intent. Or maybe their intent is what it is. If you're going to carry more
capital and you've got to modify your business model over time to carry capital, that one we think that we can earn a
superior return still versus other banks and carry the higher capital and modify our business model over time without
taking drastic action.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay, thank you.
<A - James Dimon>: And remember, again, you've got to look forward in this. America has been the leader in global
capital markets for the last 50 to 100 years. It's part of the reason the country is so strong. I look at it as a matter of
public policy. I wouldn't want to see the next JPMorgan Chase be a Chinese company because someone is going to be
serving the global multinationals around the world and all the things that that means about knowledge and experience
and research and capabilities. And so I think if you look ahead 10 years, you're going to have large global companies
who compete. And we may have to be slightly smaller than we otherwise would have been, but so be it. If we can do
that and do a good return for shareholders, we should do that.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Thank you, well said.

Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Thank you. Marianne, can you tell us? Obviously, you built up your HQLA in the quarter
and your net interest margin came down. How much of the margin pressure was due to the increase in the HQLA?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So I will tell you that, to answer the question maybe just slightly differently but with the same
basic point, that we saw an increase in cash of about $45 billion or a little more than $45 billion in the quarter, and that
drove the vast majority of the five to six basis point decline in NIM.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: And are you guys – I noticed that the deposits of the central banks, as you pointed out, grew
very largely in the quarter. Is this a level that now you're satisfied with? And also connected with that, what as outsiders
should we look at that will drive the LCR ratio either higher or lower in terms of your calculation that you're going to
be doing on a quarterly basis going forward?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So what dictates what we have on deposit with the central bank or any deposit that we have
that is excess operating or non-operating that we don't think has any significant or any liquidity value to the company.
On the whole, those are all on deposit with the central bank earning a very small amount of net interest income and
there's some passed to the client net-net for something slightly accretive. And so that's what's driving the amount of
cash to a degree that we have more non-operating cash that will drive that. We're compliant with LCR under the U.S.

rules with an appropriate but modest buffer right now. And that's based upon what we think is a fairly forward-leaning
point of view about what true operating deposits really are.
So as we think about what the cash is in customers' accounts that they really require to operate their businesses and no
more. So we think we've got a forward-leaning point of view on that. So I think the rules for the U.S. are final. I think
our ratio for U.S. LCR right now will be stable for a period of time. And then if there are any changes either to the U.S.
rules, which we don't have any line of sight on, or if we are required to make changes or decide to make changes to our
own internal liquidity framework, that could cause us to add to liquidity. But that's something that we'll inform you of
as we go through time.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: And one last issue on – yeah.
<A - James Dimon>: If you look at our balance sheet, forget all this rules stuff. We have almost $500 billion in central
banks around the world. We have $300 billion-plus of AA+ securities of very short duration. We have $300 billion of
repo and stock borrow which is all securitized by top credits with proper haircuts and stuff like that. And with our
capital base of equity capital of $200 billion, preferred stock of $30 billion, TLAC debt of $150 billion-plus, our loans
are $700 billion, which has always been the riskiest part of our balance sheet, and derivatives receivables like $70
billion. And so this balance sheet of this company is unbelievable.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: I totally agree. One last thing on those deposits at the central banks, I know some of the big
custody banks indicated that they were going to charge their customers that have euro deposits because the ECB is now
charging for the deposits at the ECB. Did you guys do that in the quarter? And if so, how did the customers react when
you passed on that cost to them?
<A - Marianne Lake>: So for financial institutions, so banks and non-banks and financial institutions, yes we passed
on the overnight rate to our customers, and it's basically on their operating cash. So it is what it is. All we're doing is
passing through the cost. It's operating cash for their business, so in other words...
<A - James Dimon>: In euros.
<A - Marianne Lake>: Yes, in euros, so there was no significant reaction at all. It's a market cost.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Great.
<A - James Dimon>: It's very hard. You're not going to be taking deposits at a loss that are just very temporary to help
our clients. So I think everyone understands that.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Thank you.
