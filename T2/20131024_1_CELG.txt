Robert J. Hugin
Thank you, Patrick, and thank you everyone for joining us this morning. I appreciate the opportunity to review the
outstanding results of the third quarter and the sustained progress achieved on critical corporate objectives. This quarter
Celgene teams across the globe produced exceptional commercial and operating results, leading to outstanding
financial performance, which again supports raising our full year financial guidance for adjusted earnings per share.
We achieved important milestones during the quarter, including the approval of pomalidomide in Europe for relapsed
refractory myeloma and the launch of ABRAXANE in the United States for pancreatic cancer. We also advanced
important initiatives that position us for a strong finish to 2013 and to deliver on the promise of 2017 and beyond.
Our commercial performance in the third quarter was excellent, with our REVLIMID teams producing impressive
results in markets around the world. The strong ABRAXANE trajectory that began with the lung cancer launch late last
year has accelerated with the introduction of the pancreatic cancer indication in the United States.
POMALYST launch momentum continued in the second full quarter on the market and we're now beginning our
commercial efforts in Europe and are encouraged by the early results. Several important clinical and regulatory
developments also strengthen and enhance our hematology/oncology portfolio. We're pursuing regulatory approvals for
ABRAXANE in pancreatic cancer around the world to extend access to this important therapy to patients in need. In
Europe, we expect a CHMP opinion by the end of the year.
As we continue to learn more and more about the potential of ABRAXANE, we're expanding our clinical trial
programs in multiple indications, including triple negative breast cancer and adjuvant pancreatic cancer. We also
expect final overall survival data from our Phase III trial in metastatic melanoma in the coming months. And the ASH
annual meeting in December will again be a highlight for Celgene. Mark will provide his perspective on the important
body of critical data from the Celgene portfolio expected to be presented in New Orleans.
An important part of today's presentation will be Scott Smith's update on the very positive developments our
inflammation and immunology franchise. Our team is working hard to prepare for an expected first quarter launch of
apremilast for psoriatic arthritis in the United States. We're accelerating the build-out of our organization in the U.S.
and beginning to expand our operations overseas in time for expected approvals in 2015. Though we have much to do,
the expertise and commitment of our new team and the extensive preparations to ensure a world class launch are
impressive. Our clinical and regulatory teams are meeting all expected timelines for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis
applications around the world.
We hope to see some of you at the American College of Rheumatology Conference in San Diego starting this weekend,
where important new data will be presented on apremilast in psoriatic arthritis and Behçet's disease, further
strengthening the value proposition of this very promising new therapy.
We're expanding the clinical profile of apremilast in additional indications, specifically our Phase III trial on
ankylosing spondylitis is now fully enrolled and we expect top-line data in the first half of next year. And we're also
beginning trials in additional areas of unmet medical needs. Scott will provide more detail on the developments and

potential of apremilast in a few minutes.
During this quarter, we continued to strengthen our prospects for sustained long-term growth by advancing our internal
pipeline and portfolio of external collaborations. We're confident that our strategy of investing in internal programs
with disruptive potential and complementary external programs that leverage our competitive advantages positions our
franchises to deliver transformational therapies for patients.
We're energized by the significant promise of our innovative portfolio. As we look to 2014 and beyond, we're excited
about the opportunities for Celgene. We're focused on our strategic imperatives, maximizing the full potential of our
hematology franchise, expanding our oncology business, building a global I&I franchise and advancing our innovative
early pipeline. Our business model has extraordinary potential to deliver exceptional near-term results and long-term
growth.
Let me now turn the call to Jackie.
Jacqualyn A. Fouse
Thank you, Bob, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on our call. 2013 continues to be a great year
for Celgene and the third quarter provided further evidence of our strong commercial and financial momentum.
Year-over-year product sales growth accelerated again and reached 18% for Q3. REVLIMID growth was 12%
propelled by volume growth and total hematology franchise sales are benefiting from the rapid uptake of POMALYST
in the U.S. as it had its second full quarter of sales, as well as the launch of IMNOVID in August in Europe. Excellent
ABRAXANE growth continues in the U.S. and non-small cell lung cancer and now in pancreatic cancer post our
September approval for that indication in the US, while the product marches upward outside the US.
Our P&L metrics remain positive and we grew earnings per share by 21%. Our operating margin for the quarter was
down 20 basis points versus last year as a result of our investments in launch activities. But year-to-date, Q3 compared
to the same period last year, we have increased our operating margin by 150 basis points to 49.3%, and we did this
while investing in our emerging inflammation and immunology franchise.
Through Q3 of this year, we have bought back over $2 billion of our own shares, and during the quarter we entered into
several new research and development collaboration agreements as part of our ongoing unique strategic approach to
accessing leading-edge science and ensuring our long-term growth potential.
With the 18% year-over-year growth, total net product sales for the quarter were $1.644 billion and total revenues
reached $1.674 billion. All major products are contributing to our growth and our portfolio is becoming ever more
diversified based on new products, new indications, and new geographies.
The net product sales growth of 18.4% came from 19.3% volume growth that was negatively impacted by foreign
exchange of about $16 million or just over 1 percentage point. Price was essentially flat globally. The 19.3% volume
growth is our strongest volume quarter so far this year.
With 21% year-over-year earnings per share growth for the quarter, we continue to deliver faster EPS growth than
revenue growth and we're doing this while making important investments in product launches this year and while
building our inflammation and immunology franchise, as Scott will speak about in a moment. The $0.27 absolute
increase in quarterly earnings per share year-over-year came from a $0.23 increase via operating income growth and
only a net $0.04 in increase from all financial drivers combined. This means that 85% of our earnings per share growths
is operationally driven, with the added value from financial contributors being the icing on the cake.
Taking a look at individual product sales, REVLIMID's very solid commercial momentum was apparent yet again this
quarter as the product posted 12% year-over-year growth and 4% sequential growth for the quarter. The U.S. came off
of a very strong 10% sequential growth rate in Q2 and put up 1% sequential growth in Q3, a pattern consistent with last
year. International sequential growth was strong at 7% and with was demand-driven.

VIDAZA was impacted in the U.S. by the long-awaited entry of generic competition and Mark will speak more about
our tactics for addressing that category in a moment. The product remains on very sound footing outside the U.S. and
international growth of 13% fueled the quarter's 4% global sequential growth.
Year-over-year ABRAXANE growth of 60% and sequential growth of 10% comes from the product's continued strong
non-small cell lung cancer performance in the US, from building momentum now in pancreatic cancer in the U.S. and
from very solid performance in breast cancer globally.
POMALYST in the U.S. and IMNOVID in Europe are driving outstanding sales results globally in relapsed and
refractory multiple myeloma, and global sales of these products totaled $90 million in Q3. These products are still early
in their long-term growth trajectories.
REVLIMID's year-over-year 12.3% growth for the quarter came from 11% volume growth and a net-positive
contribution of 1.3% from price and foreign exchange.
Our positive income statement dynamic and operational leverage story remain robust. Gross margins improved 20 basis
points for the year-over-year comparisons for both the quarter and Q3 year-to-date. Research and development expense
as a percentage of revenues is running at just over 22% and was down 90 basis points for the quarter comparison and
230 basis points year-to-date. This percentage can fluctuate up or down in any given period depending on the time lines
for our clinical trials and the timing of collaboration milestone payments.
SG&A expense as a percentage of revenues is running around 24%, but peaked during Q3 and should trend downward
in Q4, following spending on multiple product launches earlier this year. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of
revenues of 150 basis points this quarter and 110 basis points year-to-date is driven by a combination of launch
expenses and selective investment in our global hematology and oncology franchise commercial infrastructure, along
with new investment spend in our inflammation and immunology franchise. Even with all of these investments, our
year-to-date adjusted operating margin has improved by 150 basis points to 49.3%.
Our effective tax rate is running at 16.8%, slightly above last year's 16.5% due to our revenue mix.
To the point of improving operating margins, a look back at the last five years and 2013 through Q3 shows our track
record of sustained improvements in margin as we leverage our global business model. This data also reveals the power
of our model to generate the P&L capacity that allows us to make appropriate new or incremental investments in both
our research and development and commercial capabilities to ensure our long-term growth profile while we also deliver
faster profit growth to our shareholders today.
To complete the picture on our financial metrics, we have an objective to improve our return on invested capital over
time. On this slide, we show you both the most conservative measure of ROIC based on total invested capital, including
cash, and U.S. GAAP income as well as return on invested capital excluding cash balances.
As a result of the debt raise we did back in August and the higher cash balance we carried as of Q3, our gross ROIC
dipped slightly in the third quarter on a 12 months trailing basis, but you can see the positive momentum in the net
ROIC calculation driven by our operating profit performance and our returns focused long-term investment approach.
As we continue our strong operating performance on a go-forward basis and as we maintain and enhance our capital
structure strategy, we expect positive trends for both of these ROIC metrics.
Our strong business model produces strong cash flows that allow us to reinvest for the long-term health of our business
and simultaneously return funds to shareholders. Cash generated by operations in Q3 was just over $570 million and
year-to-date, we have repurchased $2.05 billion of our stock. We have also deployed over $500 million to investments
in various strategic business development opportunities this year.
To wrap up my section today, I'm pleased to provide you with some updates to our full-year 2013 financial guidance.
We now expect our total net product sales to exceed $6.2 billion and we expect REVLIMID sales to be in the middle to
upper end of our guidance range of $4.2 billion to $4.3 billion. We continue to expect operating margin to come in
around 49%.

We now expect full-year adjusted earnings per share to be in a range of $5.90 to $5.95, assuming a full-year weighted
average fully diluted share count of 430 million and an effective tax rate between 16.5% and 17%. As compared to
prior periods, the fourth quarter of this year will reflect the impact of the generic VIDAZA U.S. entrant.
In addition, investments in our inflammation and immunology franchise will accelerate in Q4 in advance of our first
expected apremilast approval early next year and as we build that franchise into an engine for future growth.
Thank you for listening and let me now turn the call over to Mark.
Mark J. Alles
Thanks very much, Jackie. Good morning, everyone. We had an excellent quarter. Third quarter total net product sales
grew 5% quarter-on-quarter and 18% year-on-year to $1.644 billion, a very positive reflection of the disciplined
execution of our integrated clinical, regulatory and commercial operating plans.
Our hematology and oncology franchise made substantial progress in the third quarter towards achieving the four key
objectives that we established at the beginning of this year: to capitalize on our clinical and commercial strength in
hematology; to build our global oncology franchise; to deliver strong product sales growth; and to accelerate the pace
of scientific innovation to provide new and significant long-term opportunities.
Our multiple myeloma business is well positioned for its next phase of growth. REVLIMID demand fundamentals were
strong in the third quarter. MM-020 met its primary endpoint. POMALYST is launching in the United States and now
in Europe and we established new drug development collaborations with the biotechnology companies MorphoSys and
Acetylon to expand our myeloma therapies to include monoclonal antibodies and new HDAC inhibitors.
REVLIMID sales were driven by the combination of duration, global share of the myeloma market above 50% and
prescriptions in the new indications mantle cell lymphoma in the United States and MDS deletion 5q in Europe.
REVLIMID sales grew 4% quarter-on-quarter and 12% year-on-year to $1.090 billion.
Third quarter POMALYST sales grew 35% quarter-on-quarter to $90 million. In the United States, POMALYST
continues to rapidly gain market share in the third and fourth lines of therapy for myeloma. The launch results remain
above plan. In early August, we received European marketing authorization for pomalidomide with the trade name
IMNOVID and we immediately launched in Germany. We are pleased with the pace of sales in France and the use of
IMNOVID in the United Kingdom is now being reimbursed from a special cancer drug fund prior to formal review by
NICE.
We are confident in the value proposition IMNOVID provides for patients and for payers. Our market access teams
have started reimbursement negotiations in every European market and we expect to achieve broad patient access
throughout Europe by the second half of 2014. With regulatory approvals now in both the United States and Europe,
and the clear unmet medical need of patients in this clinical setting, POMALYST/IMNOVID is on track to become our
next hematology blockbuster.
Sales of VIDAZA in the third quarter were $220 million, 4% quarter-on-quarter growth and flat year-on-year. While
we did see the launch of generic azacitidine in the United States during the quarter, we remain committed to optimizing
the full potential of VIDAZA in Europe and other international markets. Top-line results from our Phase III study of
VIDAZA in elderly AML are expected by the end of this year or early next year. And we are advancing two Phase III
registration track studies for CC-486 in AML and MDS. Our MDS/AML business continues to represent a multibillion
dollar potential and Celgene is committed to remaining the scientific leader in this specialized segment of hematology.
Third quarter ABRAXANE sales were $170 million, representing 10% quarter-on-quarter growth and 60%
year-on-year growth. Sales were driven by increased use in both histologic subsets of non-small cell lung cancer,
steady demand in metastatic breast cancer, early adoption in metastatic pancreatic cancer and increased sales in Europe
and in Japan. In the United States, ABRAXANE is emerging as a cornerstone therapy for the treatment of multiple
solid tumor cancers.

The FDA approval in September of ABRAXANE in combination with gemcitabine for the treatment of patients with
metastatic pancreatic cancer expands the commercial opportunity for ABRAXANE to three major indications, breast
cancer, non-small cell lung cancer and now metastatic pancreatic cancer. FDA approval of this important indication
represents the first of what we expect will be a series of international regulatory marketing approvals, starting with the
expected CHMP opinion in Europe by the end of this year.
We are driving a paradigm shift in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Just last week, the results of the Phase III
CA-046 study were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. We are confident that this ABRAXANE
regimen has the potential to rapidly become the global standard of care for the treatment of this incredibly challenging
disease.
In late 2012, we described the significant and clinically meaningful progression-free survival advantage demonstrated
by ABRAXANE over dacarbazine in a Phase III study of patients with metastatic melanoma. We expect the final
overall survival results to be available during the fourth quarter. These data will inform our regulatory strategy and we
will submit the final study results for presentation at a medical meeting next year.
To further expend the clinical and commercial potential of ABRAXANE, we initiated the Phase II/III study in first line
triple negative metastatic breast cancer during the quarter. Additional Phase III studies in adjuvant pancreatic cancer
and squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer should begin by the end of this year.
Every year the American Society of Hematology meeting provides an important opportunity to present the results of
the latest research featuring our therapies and our promising pipeline drugs, and the 2013 meeting will continue this
tradition. We are aware of at least 160 abstracts that have been submitted to ASH on Celgene therapies. There are
approximately 100 abstracts on REVLIMID alone, a strong signal of its evolving clinical profile in multiple myeloma
and MDS and its emerging profile in other hematological malignancies.
Important abstracts on POMALYST in relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma will provide additional clinical
information that should help hematologists to further define their use of this novel therapy. Initial data from the
separate Phase I studies of CC-122, CC-223 and CC-292 will also be highlighted.
I would like to briefly summarize three important abstracts on the use of REVLIMID in newly diagnosed multiple
myeloma. First, updated results from the MM-015 study will be an oral presentation. This abstract focuses on mature
overall survival data in elderly patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. The presentation will also include an
important analysis of progression free survival 2. PFS2 is a validated surrogate endpoint for overall survival and it is an
important endpoint with respect to European regulatory guidelines recognized now as a clinical benefit endpoint. As
you know, assessment of PFS2 is measured from the time from initial randomization to the time of second progression
after the next line of therapy or death from any cause.
The second abstract is an important and robust meta-analysis conducted by hematologists at the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minnesota, of randomized trials testing REVLIMID maintenance in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.
This abstract was also selected for oral presentation. We expect the results to highlight the overall benefit-to-risk ratio
of REVLIMID use continuously to maintain long-term disease control in patients with newly diagnosed multiple
myeloma.
Third, the ASH Program Committee has selected the abstract summarizing the initial results of the Celgene sponsored
international Phase III MM-020 study for presentation during the scientific plenary session. The plenary session is
scheduled during the afternoon of December 8. You will recall that in July, we announced that MM-020 met the
primary endpoint of superior progression-free survival for the combination of REVLIMID plus low-dose
dexamethasone used continuously until disease progression compared to standard melphalan, prednisone and
thalidomide for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are not eligible for stem cell
transplantation.
The plenary presentation of MM-020 is expected to review analyses of final progression-free survival, interim overall
survival, PFS2, response rates, timed response, duration of response and safety including second primary malignancies

across all three arms of the study. Achieving global regulatory approvals for REVLIMID for the treatment of newly
diagnosed multiple myeloma is one of our most important corporate objectives and it is the most important objective
for our hematology franchise.
Meetings with regulatory authorities to discuss our submission plan for REVLIMID in this indication have progressed
and are ongoing. We are working expeditiously to submit our regulatory dossiers to the CHMP in Europe and to the
FDA in the United States and expect to submit these applications in the first quarter of 2014.
Our hematology and oncology franchise is generating strong operating momentum. We're on track to exceed our
full-year 2013 sales target to advance the significant near-term sales catalysts and to unlock new opportunities for
growth. I would like to thank and recognize my colleagues in clinical, in regulatory, and in commercial for their
extraordinary dedication our vision and to the mission to discover and develop therapies that extend and improve the
lives of people with cancer. Our results and our products are making a positive difference.
Thank you very much. I'd like to turn the call over to Scott Smith for an update on apremilast and our inflammation and
immunology franchise.
Scott Smith
Thank you, Mark, and good morning to all. 2013 has been a year of tremendous progress and momentum within the
I&I franchise. We've been focusing on four key strategies as we move the franchise forward, targeting markets with
high unmet medical need, precise execution of the clinical development plan as evidenced by six positive Phase III
trials in psoriasis and PSA, hiring experienced leadership with deep therapeutic knowledge to lead our global launches
and advancing the important programs in our early clinical stage pipeline.
Our regulatory plans for apremilast remain on track. Our discussions with the FDA on a PSA application have been
progressing well as we move closer to the March 2014 PDUFA date. We are on track with our apremilast psoriasis
NDA filing for the FDA later this year. In addition, we expect to submit the combined psoriasis PSA authorization
application to the European authorities before the end of the year.
During Q3, we completed an enrollment in our 500-patient Phase III POSTURE trial of apremilast in ankylosing
spondylitis. AS is a form of arthritis primarily affecting the spine. It is estimated to affect over 2 million people in the
United States and Europe and there is a tremendous need for new treatment options for this disease. We expect to see
top-line results from POSTURE-1 trial in the first half 2014.
Earlier this month at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology Annual Meeting there was a deeper
look at the ESTEEM-1 data. The positive and robust scalp and nail psoriasis could be very meaningful to patients and
physicians. More than half of psoriasis patients have scalp or nail involvement which can be debilitating and difficult to
treat. An effective oral option for these patients could be an important addition to the treatment armamentarium. Also
presented at EADV was an abstract that demonstrated that apremilast improves psoriasis patients' quality of life as
measured by improvements in DLQI and other key secondary endpoints.
We're also very excited about the upcoming ACR that will start later this week in San Diego. You can see from the
slide there will be a tremendous amount of apremilast data being presented including 52-week results from both the
PALACE-2 and PALACE-3 trials data on the effect of apremilast in the important disease manifestations of PSA such
as dactylitis and enthesitis as well as swollen and tender joints in pooled safety and laboratory data. These data show
that apremilast offers patients robust responses that continuing to improve over time, reaching ACR-20 scores in the
50% to 60% plus range by week 52 as well as deep and clinically meaningful responses in numerous key secondary
endpoints. The pooled safety and laboratory data show a consistent and highly differentiated safety profile that
confirms our belief that laboratory monitoring for patients will not likely be necessary.
In addition to the data listed above, I'm excited to announce the acceptance of a late-breaking abstract of our
PALACE-4 trial of apremilast monotherapy in DMARD-naive patients. An abstract on the use of apremilast in Behçet's
disease from a recent Phase II trial was selected by the ACR to be a plenary presentation confirming the importance of

this data and the need for new treatment options for patients with this serious disease.
Finally, there will be some interesting data on our new immunology-specific [indiscernible] (29:28) compound
CC-220, which will begin Phase II trials in the near future. We will be summarizing all these data as well as
highlighting our launch readiness at an investor event at ACR on Sunday, October 27 at 6:30 p.m. Pacific Time. This
event will also be available via webcast.
In summary, a lot of progress has been made since we last spoke. We are very confident about the emerging profile of
apremilast based on the robustness and consistency of the data, including the 52-week results. Our launch planning has
continued to accelerate and we will be prepared to execute a high impact launch early next year.
Joining our team recently have been a number of very talented experienced commercial and medical affairs leaders that
are finalizing an implementing launch plans as appropriate. We are now actively recruiting a rheumatology sales force
in the United States. The response and caliber of candidates has been tremendous.
It's a very exciting time. A lot has been accomplished. There's still a lot yet to do. Our team is working passionately to
ensure that we can bring this potentially transformational treatment option to patients worldwide in the near future.
Thank you. And I'd like to turn it over to Bob.
Robert J. Hugin
Thank you, Scott, and thank you, Jackie and Mark. Third quarter performance was truly outstanding. We're encouraged
by these operating results as we look forward to the promise of the coming quarters. Our teams are focused on
discovering and delivering innovative therapies, and are well-positioned to sustained long-term growth. I want to thank
all my colleagues from around the world for their dedication to improving the lives of patients every day. We look
forward to updating you on a number of occasions before the end of year including at the American College of
Rheumatology meeting this weekend in San Diego and at the American Society of Hematology meeting in early
December in New Orleans. We believe these meetings will highlight the exceptional potential of the Celgene portfolio.
Thank you for joining this morning. Operator, please open the call to questions.
Q&A

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Geoffrey C. Meacham>: Good morning guys, congrats on a strong quarter and thanks for taking the question.
I've got one for you on 020. What was the driver to push the EU filing [ph] throw to (31:57)? Was it just data
maturation or was it the request of the regulators? And just another one related to ABRAXANE. You guys talked about
last quarter acceleration mostly due to lung cancer approval. And was that also the case in the third quarter, did you
guys see some early signals of pancreatic uptake? Thanks a lot.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Geoff, hi, it's Mark, and of course Jackie and Bob, please if you want to add any comment, do
that. Geoff on MM-020, we have great clarity on where we believe the dossiers need to evolve in terms of collecting
the data we have, organizing it well and submitting with the best dossier as possible. So when we look at the timeline, it
pushes it into Q1, just to be sure that everything is exactly right and that when the submissions go in, they're lined up
with what the regulators have talked to us about and that the process is smooth and complete.
With respect to what's happening with ABRAXANE, the dynamics are very interesting. We still see as I said good
penetration in the lung cancer markets and we remain excited about that opportunity. But there is no doubt we saw
uptake in pancreatic cancer and I think it's consistent with the idea that remember the panc data were presented first
early this year at ASCO GI, but then again featured at ASCO and I think that the marketplace is getting used to the idea

<Q - Geoffrey C. Meacham>: Okay. Thanks.

Our next question comes from Rachel McMinn with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
<Q - Rachel L. McMinn>: Thanks very much for the question. Jackie, I know it's a little bit early to ask for 2014
guidance specifically. But can you help us a little bit with the SG&A expense line? For 2013, it looks like you're on
track for more than 20% growth in that line item. Is there a lot of new infrastructure that's going to come in in 2014
with marketing for apremilast and infrastructure there? And then as a totally separate question, I'm curious on your
R&D perspective for the need for a JAK inhibitor just following the ruxolitinib data there and some of the evolving
landscape with a lot of companies placing bets on JAK inhibitors. Thanks.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, Rachel. Thanks for the question. So you're not going to trick me into giving you 2014
guidance today. But, so when you look at the targets that we have laid out, going back to earlier this year and 2013,
2015 and 2017, obviously you can look at the trajectory there and we've also I think laid out on a couple of occasions
how we see the P&L dynamic evolving and how we can deliver faster profit growth than revenue growth, even when
we're making these investments. And we always talked about 2013 and 2014 being the incrementally largest investment
years in terms of building the inflammation immunology franchise.
So you see what we've done so far in 2013. When you look out at how we've talked about 2015 and 2017, where we
say that we would go to around 52% operating margin by 2015 and 55% by 2017, it's not going to be a linear
progression. But as we've talk about, we will still deliver leverage in 2014, even while we invest in mostly the I&I
platform from an incremental standpoint. So what we took the opportunity to do in 2013 is invest appropriately and
ahead of the launches so that you've seen the trajectories in the launches and the demonstration of the execution from
the commercial teams there both in the U.S. and in Europe with POMALYST/IMNOVID, MDS, REVLIMID and
ABRAXANE and others. And now we start seeing a bit of a shift in more spend going to the I&I platform and we'll see
that continue in 2014. So, but we'll deliver the P&L leverage at the operating profit level despite that.
When we think about R&D, as long as there's something getting to the end, the timing on that will be dependent on the
timelines for our clinical trials. You've seen us talk about adding some new trials for ABRAXANE. We have a big
portfolio now where we do get some turnover as things come down and some new things come into the mix and then
whether we have collaboration milestones or not. So we've seen that percentage of revenue has been a little bit lower
this year than we thought. But it's just because the nature of this large portfolio.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: And Rachel, it's Bob. Generally, we're very pleased with the performance of our internal
pipeline and the progress that our collaborators are making in programs that will help support our pipeline and broaden
and deepen our pipeline over time. And clearly, the marketplace has embraced some of those collaborators in terms of
the opportunity to even raise more capital over the last few months. And so we feel very good about where we are. So
we don't see a need to do anything at this time. We feel very good about where we're positioned.
We always are looking at the landscape for partnership opportunities and products that have a good value proposition.
And if there is an opportunity to bring something in this complementary and to our products, we certainly do that. We
look very closely. And even if we don't bring the products into our specific portfolio, we very actively look at clinical
collaborations, whether that's in combination or sequential to ensure that our products are combined with the best
products to give the best outlook for patients. But I can't comment on anything specifically. But there's nothing
dramatic that we're looking at right now and we'll continue to look at the landscape.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Geoffrey Porges with Sanford Bernstein. Your line is
open.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Thanks very much for taking the question and congrats on the quarter and the progress.
Mark, just to follow-up on the question about the filing for MM-020. We're not seeing an update on IFM or CALGB at
ASH and you didn't comment specifically on that this morning. Could you tell us whether the filing is going to include
all four of the frontline trials, IFM, CALGB, 015 and 020, or is it really now focused on 020? And should we anticipate
that the label includes both transplant and non-transplant patients, frontline and maintenance or is there going to be
some subset of that? Thanks.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Thanks for the question, Geoff. First, our intent is to get the broadest possible label for newly
diagnosed myeloma, period. Second, the IFM-0502 study will be at ASH. There is an update planned. The reason that I
didn't speak about it directly is because it's a trial that we'd be part of. This goes to your question about the
comprehensive nature of the application. It is a trial that will be included in integrated safety summaries that we do as
part of our submissions, without doubt. So we're looking for a broad label. We're looking for the safety data from all of
the REVLIMID and the MM studies, and then of course MM-020 with 015 would be the pivotal studies that would
make up the bulk of the dossier.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: And country by country can have very different outcomes on the label and the indication, but
we're very encouraged by the discussions and we're moving as quickly as possible.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Okay. Thanks very much.

Our next question comes from Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Terence C. Flynn>: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Was just, noticed your comments, Mark, about PFS2 and
it was just, that's the kind of the first time I've heard about this. Was just wondering how we should think about that in
the context of overall survival data here? And then one in the longer term multiple myeloma market, just would love
your thoughts on the potential for PD-1 drugs here? Thanks.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Thank you for the question. I think the first thing is we really should congratulate regulatory
agencies. When they look at these diseases like lymphoma, myeloma, etc., and overall survival as a primary endpoint,
it's so difficult to achieve because of the ability to treat these diseases long-term. It is very important for us to say PFS2
as a validated surrogate endpoint is quite important. What that allows us to do is a priority study progression as an
endpoint that is extremely valuable. We know that from PFS in the initial way of looking at our data. But now even
after crossover, one is able to measure the effect of the drug from randomization all the way through the second
progression.
I think the regulatory agencies are moving with the science, the biology and the therapies in the space. The way I think
about it is that we will always now, in lymphoma, leukemia and myeloma, be looking to build in PFS, PFS2, and then
of course as a secondary endpoint, overall survival. I think with respect to PD-1, it's interesting because I think it's a
very, very flexible mechanism and I think we just have to wait and see a little bit. I think it's pretty clear what's
happening in the market generally. But we have thought about that a lot, and in fact in our discussions about antibodies
generally, it has come into our scientific debate.

Our next question comes from Yaron Werber with Citi. Your line is open.
<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my question. I just had a question. Jackie, just a little bit,
when you look at your share count, I mean this year you've done about $2 billion in stock buybacks last year. The share

count went down pretty significantly throughout the year. And I'm trying to kind of get a sense, and last year you did
essentially the same amount of stock buybacks. What difference this year or do you think the share count will go down
dramatically? Is there a catch-up effect in Q4?
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, Yaron. Yeah, it's mostly related to the fact that the stock price is a lot higher now than
it was a year ago. So again, we stick by the assumption that we have underlying our targets which is a flat share count.
And if we have a lower share count than that in the future, obviously that give some upside potential from the financial
drivers, so.
<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: Okay, but the option expense has been pretty much consistent. I guess that's just to clarify
the question.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Yeah, I mean you get a little bit more dilution when the share price is higher and then it
depends a little bit on the activity of the employees there, so.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: Expense is higher as the stock price rises.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Yes.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: ...was restricted stock, but it's really just a function of the stock price.

Our next question comes from Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group. Your line is open.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys. Thanks a lot for taking my question. Can I just clarify Geoff's question on
the filing? Can you just confirm for clarity's sake that you'll be filing both for the transplant eligible population as well
as the transplant ineligible population when you file in the U.S. and Europe?
And then on pomalidomide if I might or POMALYST, possible to give us a couple, some metrics such as perhaps share
in the U.S. in the target market? And I assume, Mark, since you used the word blockbuster, I know you used that before
with pomalidomide, that I would assume that you would encourage us to not view this drug as anywhere near its peak
potential right now. There are lots of growth that's ahead. I just want to make sure I understood your, not over-reading
your comments. Thanks a lot.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Hi, Mark. Thanks for the question. So just to clarify again on our filing strategy. The intent is to
use a comprehensive data set, yes MM-020 is key to that in all markets around the world. 015 is also part of that.
Remember that in 015, lenalidomide maintenance was used after MPR's induction. So, this gives us a lot of flexibility
market-to-market and with different regulators to seek the broadest possible labels for newly diagnosed myeloma. By
definition, that would allow for us to look for the transplant ineligible as well as have discussions about eligible
because a label for the treatment of myeloma could then be considered inclusive. So it's all of the above. Not one or the
other at this point. And we're moving as quickly as we can to make sure these dossiers are comprehensive, line up with
the regulatory agencies' expectations and include the very important safety data that is part of the overall set of
induction, maintenance, eligible, ineligible patients.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: So will CALGB and IFM trials be in the package? Sorry to interrupt.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: There's no question that these data on maintenance, CALGB, IFM, will be part of at least the
integrated safety summary for the brand. Now with respect to pomalidomide and the blockbuster status, I think it's clear
to us that the brand – and I know that everyone has modeled this – has $1 billion plus potential in its core indication.
So, that's the context of the comment.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: And just when you think about the trajectory, I mean look, we're only in the second full
quarter in the US. The product's doing extremely well. We just launched the product in Europe where we're well ahead

Our next question comes from Michael Yee with RBC Capital. Your line is open.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Hi, thanks. Good morning. A question on guidance. Actually, when you gave your 2017
guidance, you didn't have your MM-020 results. So given the importance of that study, does that change how we
should be thinking about your hem/onc guidance over the next few years? Has that changed probabilities? As then as a
related question, when you present that MM-020 data and when you submit it, what is the maturity of events on PFS
and OS? Thanks.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Let me start with the first question. So, when we gave the 2017 targets and the 2015
targets for that matter, we did not have the visibility to 020 that we have today and some other things as well. So the
way that I would look at that is maybe a couple of, from a couple of different perspectives. First of all, you can take the
targets that we've laid out there and consider that they are highly achievable and that we have significantly derisked the
assumptions necessary to get to those targets the over the course of this year. So, if for anybody who is still doing their
analysis to come to a conclusion about how they think, what they think about our range for apremilast, since that's the
newest thing that's in there now, and we still have to get out there and get the approvals and execute on that, or whether
you think about the potential for upside to those targets based on where you are in your analysis, I think you that can
come at it from both of those different ways. But there is a significantly lower level of risk to our achieving those
targets today versus when we gave them 10 months ago.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Yes, I would just follow up that question with the data. We're encouraged about MM-020 and
we're really looking forward to reviewing it at ASH. The abstracts will come out in early November, and I think
together we can look at the data after the scientific plenary session. But we're very, very optimistic about the impact of
the data.

Our next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<Q - Alethia R. Young>: Great. Thanks for taking my question. This is
Alethia on behalf of Robyn. Congrats on the good quarter guys. So a question on 020 again. Just I guess wanted to get
your thoughts on how it could impact the U.S. trends. And if I could sneak another one in, do you think that apremilast
will require a panel?
<A - Mark J. Alles>: I think – this is Mark. Thank you for the question about MM-020 and impact. The important part
of the newly diagnosed multiple myeloma trials that have been ongoing, whether it's [indiscernible] (49:39), MM-020,
other studies, I know there will be a lot at ASH, is that the constant themes, continuous REV/dex is highly effective at
producing progression-free survival, trends in overall survival. We've seen overall survival in many studies. So the nice
opportunity here is to reinforce duration of therapy matters in the treatment of myeloma. So, we look for opportunities
and we think the data will start by increasing duration of therapy, even above the pace it's on today. Beyond that, I
think there is a market share opportunity but that would come largely from the approval and the first time that our full
U.S. commercial organization is able to promote REVLIMID's benefit for newly-diagnosed myeloma. So it's kind of
two stages, duration in the short term, share in the longer term.
<A - Scott Smith>: And this is Scott. Relative to the apremilast adcomm question, at this time we do not anticipate an
adcomm but the regulatory process is ongoing.

Our next question comes from Eric Schmidt from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
<Q - Eric T. Schmidt>: Thank you. Question for Mark on REVLIMID. It looks like maybe for the first time in about a
year you saw a nice quarter-on-quarter increase in the international business there. Just wondering if there is a different
trend in Europe or if that's coming from some other new markets you may have penetrated. Could you give us a little
more detail?
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Sure. So as you know, different markets will come in and out of the picture. But Europe was
quite strong. We were very, very happy with the performance of Europe in general. And then we saw some strength in
Japan. Canada and Australia quarter-by-quarter are very strong. So when you add it up, you see that nice performance
in the quarter. Very balanced.

Our next question comes from Howard Liang with Leerink Swann. Your line is open.
<Q - Howard Liang>: Thanks very much. Just regarding ASH data for MM-015, are we going to see survival data
with more than 50% of events? And also what data are we going to see from the CD38 antibody and how much
[indiscernible] (51:55) get an update on CC-292. Thanks.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: So Howard, CC-292 is really just an ongoing update of the Phase I profile. As you know, there's
combination data with REVLIMID. My guess is that we would see some of that in the presentation. With respect to
015, the maturity of the survival events continues, but what is the feature of the 015 study is the pre-specified plan to
look at progression-free survival. So, this is the initial PFS2 result, which could be considered final.
<A - Robert J. Hugin>: But we have not yet hit the 50%.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: That's correct, right. So we're still maturing on overall survival, but PFS2, one can consider that
mature.

Our next question comes from Mike King with JMP Securities. Your line is open.
<Q - Michael G. King>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question and let me congratulate you as well on the
excellent execution. Just a simple question regarding the guidance for the remainder of the year. It seems rather
conservative because if you just do the math real quick, it looks like you're guiding to a flat to down fourth quarter.
Historically your fourth quarters if anything have been the most robust of the year. So I'm just wondering if you can
help us think that through.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: Hi, Mike. Thanks for the question. So the way that we're looking at Q4 is we are factoring
in the impact of the generic VIDAZA entrant in the U.S. where we would have all of that in the fourth quarter. As you
know, that came very late in Q3, so there was little or no impact on either the top line or the bottom line in the third
quarter. So we would have the first full quarter impact of that. And then we're also looking at an acceleration in the
expense investment in I&I. At the same time, we'll be coming off a bit on the hematology/oncology side of things
because of the launch expenses that we've had up to now. So I would expect percentage of revenue to SG&A to come
down a little bit. I think that when I look at where everybody is for the quarter, I think we've got a little bit higher
estimate for R&D expense in the quarter versus the rest of you. But let's see where we come out. I feel very, very good
about our ability to hit the new raised guidance that we've given for the full year, so.

<Q - Thomas A. Wei>: Hi, thanks. I just wanted to ask on this PFS2 endpoint, how should we think about the
regulatory or marketing value of an endpoint like that when the protocol does not pre-specify that patients in the control
arm receive REVLIMID on progression. I don't quite know how to think about that, I guess especially from a
regulatory standpoint. And then just separately, any update on the I&I marketing strategy and what you're planning to
do on the dermatology side?
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Thanks for the question, Thomas. It's Mark. So, the way that conversations have gone with the
academic key opinion leaders and then more generally with the regulatory authorities is that while we wait for mature,
that is greater than 50% or 75% of the survival events, PFS2 becomes a surrogate and now it is recognized in the
EMEA guidelines as an endpoint that will be substituting for a final overall survival advantage and it of course
calculates in a PFS continuum from time of randomization all the way through the benefit of, in this case the
experimental arm of a study. So I think it's acting as a long-term view as to how disease control from the first treatment
through the impact of crossover and then prior to survival benefits patients and it is a very, very good surrogate.
So the way we're thinking about it from a regulatory endpoint is it completes the discussion about risk benefit from
progression-free survival in the setting of, in our case, this question about long term exposure and SPMs that develop or
don't develop as a consequence of treatment. So the general way to think about it is as a surrogate for benefit/risk prior
to having final overall survival. I&I was your second question.
<A - Scott Smith>: Yes, it was around derm marketing strategy. We're moving forward and preparing strongly for a
second half of the year 2014 launch in the dermatology space with psoriasis. We are in selected geographies to get us
some certain patient segments having some discussions around partnering, but we're definitely preparing to do it and
manage it ourself in that space. We think there's tremendous potential in the derm space. We're also looking at some
potential [indiscernible] (57:18) type approaches from the targeted perspective once we get into 2014 or 2015. But
we're moving strongly towards market in the second half of the year next year.

Our next question comes from Joel Sendek with Stifel, Nicolaus. Your line is open.
<Q - Joel D. Sendek>: Thanks a lot. So I just have a question about the strength in your myeloma business in the past
quarter. So first to follow up on Eric's question. You said for REVLIMID ex-US or in Europe, you're particularly
strong. I'm just wondering if that's driven by duration, off label use. If you can give us any view on that. And then
Kyprolis in the US, I'm wondering the same question there. Is that driven by duration or sequencing ahead of, or
relative to Kyprolis for pomalidomide. Is it due to sequencing ahead of Kyprolis? If you can give us any detail on that.
Thanks.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Thanks, Joel. It's Mark. So with respect to Europe, we saw market share gains in the second and
later lines of therapy where REVLIMID is reimbursed for second line therapy. In the UK, it's later lines but very, very
good market share growth. Duration was the biggest driver in the quarter for Europe and I think the dynamic continues
where now with POMALYST coming into the market, one would imagine as we've seen in the US, a lift of
REVLIMID because now the drug can be completely exhausted prior to moving to a salvage setting, which in Europe
of course would be POMALYST only, IMNOVID, not Kyprolis.
So this is why we when we talk about blockbuster status, Europe has a very different dynamic than the U.S. where
POMALYST is competing with, day in and day out in the salvage market, Kyprolis. Today we can tell you that the vast
majority of POMALYST patients are either coming directly from a REVLIMID containing regimen so a direct
sequence, or this is a patient getting REVLIMID – I'm sorry, POMALYST instead of Kyprolis. So it's really not a
dynamic between Kyprolis and POMALYST in the market. It's more where and how was a patient treated before a
decision's made to use pomalidomide or carfilzomib. And you can see the dynamic is favoring in the short-term more
POMALYST.

<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: So we've got a few questions still left in the queue. We're going to try to get at least to
those of you who haven't gotten to ask a question yet. So operator, please, next question.

Our next question comes from Ying Huang with Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Ying Huang>: Thanks for fitting me in. So the first question is given the long-term follow up of the apremilast in
psoriatic arthritis, what is your updated thinking about pricing and also after you've seen what XELJANZ has done in
the market. The second one is without knowing the PFS curve separation before ASH, what is your base case
consideration here? Does that impact your guidance for 2017 if you only get fixed cycle 18-month REVLIMID on label
in Europe for frontline? Thanks.
<A - Scott Smith>: So first, the question relative to apremilast pricing relative to 52-week data, we have 52-week data
for PALACE-1 at ACR. We'll have the full 52-week data for PALACE-2, 3 and 4, so there will be a fuller picture of
what that 52-week data looks like. Relative to the effect on pricing. I think what we want to do is we want to make sure
we price apremilast in a position which is in accordance with where we see the utilization. We see most of the
utilization being in the pre-biologic space and before initiation of biologic therapy, so we will price according to that.
There was also a question on XELJANZ and certainly we take a look at their strategies and things but I don't want to
comment on them.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: And just on the 2017 guidance and what we've assumed in there for newly diagnosed,
there are a number of assumptions in there around shares and durations in the different geographies and all sorts of
things, but we also got assumptions in there around the timing of approvals, launches, as well the issue that came up
earlier around the patient population that might or might not end up in the label. So we've been quite conservative in
that regard with respect to what we've assumed in the financial model for non-stem cell transplant versus stem cell
transplant.
So again, you'll see the data at ASH, but between that and the way that we built the financial model for 2017, I feel
very, very good about our 2017 target in general and specifically related to the newly diagnosed piece of that.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Just a quick add-on. If part of the question was about a cap on the use of REVLIMID when it's
approved for newly diagnosed myeloma, I want to just remind you that arm A, which is the continuous REVLIMID
dexamethasone arm was superior to MPT and that the overwhelming data set generally for REVLIMID is continuous
treatment until disease progression. This benefit/risk profile continues to favor by far the use of continuous treatment.
So we don't expect capping in the label.
<A - Jacqualyn A. Fouse>: That's correct. And in the financial model, we're not anywhere close in 2017 to where
durations could go when we look at the assumptions that we made for where duration is at that point in time.

Our next question comes from Ravi Mehrotra with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Ravi Mehrotra>: Hey, thank you for taking my question, which regards to MOR202, your CD38. There's
obviously a lot of increasing interest in this target. Can you tell us why you think 202 is best in class? Related to that,
can you run through the synergies that you can see return to with potentially REVLIMID and confirm when we get the
Phase I/II data at ASCO rather than ASH. Thank you.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Thanks for the question. It's Mark. We like MOR202 a lot. We looked at daratumumab long
before it was licensed to another company and looked at different synergies with IMiDs. Of course we're doing the
Phase I program with MOR202. But our view was that overall we saw a different antibody that was a little bit more
specific to the target, the infusions, scheduled administrations was very different and favorable than daratumumab and

so we think about controlling the development of IMiD antibody through Phase I and into our overall program with
REVLIMID and then of course with pomalidomide in the relapse setting. But I think generally, we think this is a better
asset. But of course, it's going to be used in combination and we're going to build it that way.

Our next question comes from Jim Birchenough with BMO. Your line is open.
<Q - Jim Birchenough>: Yes, hi guys, two quick questions. Just on 020, will we have enough events in the over 75
year old age group to have some statistical conclusions on overall survival? And then the other part is just on
apremilast, could you give us some sense of the ankylosing spondylitis market relative to psoriatic arthritis and maybe
talk about a strategy to get into the bigger market of axial spondyloarthropathy. Thanks.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Thanks. Mark. So I apologize. We're just not able to get into the data. There are two
opportunities. One is when the ASH abstracts are available online and in publication, which is November 7, 8. And
when those data are available, of course we can have discussions about the abstract. And then of course, this is a
plenary session presentation. So a lot of the questions, for example the proportion of patients above or below a certain
age, this will be part of the plenary presentation. We just can't comment.
<A - Scott Smith>: And relative to ankylosing spondylitis, very interesting market for us. The trial, the POSTURE trial
enrolled well ahead of schedule, which is always a good sign. I think if we get positive data there, there's a tremendous
opportunity. There's very little oral therapy that's been effective, if any, in the space. Biologic utilization is relatively
low. There's approximately 1 million ankylosing spondylitis patients in the United States, and somewhere 2.2 million,
2.3 million U.S. and Europe. So, it's significant from an epidemiology standpoint.
And on to your to broader axial, the spondyloarthropathy question, that is a much bigger market than you see with [ph]
AS as AS (66:46) is probably the major subset of that. But in that group, there's probably 2.5 million patients in the
United States alone, and so it's a tremendous market opportunity with very little there, nothing from an oral perspective.
The general strategy would be to get the indication in AS first and then move it to a broader patient group as we go
forward.

Our next question comes from Mara Goldstein with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
<Q - Mara Goldstein>: Thank you very much for taking the question. On ABRAXANE in the adjuvant setting, can
you just confirm when you think first patient will be enrolled in that trial and when you might expect the first data point
from it? And just quickly on apremilast, can you just remind us the size of the field sales force for apremilast?
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Mara, hi, it's Mark.
<Q - Mara Goldstein>: Hi, Mark.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: So I heard two questions. One was about ABRAXANE pancreatic cancer. We're making great
progress with the protocol and believe that we will have sites initiated in the early part of 2014. And the demand for the
trial based on our discussions with key opinion leaders is quite high. They want to enroll patients in that controlled
setting with the combination [ph] emerge (67:58) a curative intent. I also want to make sure that we repeat that the
triple negative breast cancer study opened at the end of Q3 and we're seeing early signs of adoption with patients
approved already.
<A - Scott Smith>: I don't want to give specific numbers around the exactness of our particular field forces, but you
can think about these sales forces in the rheumatology space, the general size of the sales force in the 70 to 100 person
for the U.S. range. Dermatology, a little bit bigger, maybe 20% bigger than that to cover it. But, so relatively small
numbers, especially focused on the sales force. But 80 to – or 70 to 100 on the rheum side and a little bit more on the

Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
<Q - Brian C. Abrahams>: Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in. You mentioned that we'll see second primary malignancy
data from 020 at ASH. I was just wondering what your sense is as to which aspect of that data is going to be most
important to regulators. Is it continuous first fixed durations, dex first alkylating containing regimens or overall rates in
this study versus historical studies? And then just on a related note, how different are regulatory views of this PFS2
endpoint in the U.S. relative to Europe? Thanks.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: I'll start with the latter. PFS2 has gone through European regulatory review and it's now part of
the guidelines. FDA, other agencies are aware, but they're in a slightly different place in terms of adopting it as a
formal clinical endpoint for review and approval. My expectation is this will evolve over time where it will be widely
recognized as part of clinical research.
With respect to your inquiry about SPMs, please don't take this to be cute, but everything you mentioned in your list of
things that would be important about second primary malignancies is inclusive of what we're prepared to discuss. So
we believe that the issue is well characterized. The benefit/risk is well characterized. But as we put together our
dossiers, we want to anticipate any question that we might get with respect to SPM. So it could be all of the above or
none of the above because of the totality of the benefit data. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Gene Mack with Brean Capital. Your line is open.
<Q - Gene C. Mack>: Thanks for taking the question. I know you guys don't comment specifically on duration. But
I'm wondering if you could just give us some sort of qualitative guidance or your thoughts where things are relative
between U.S. and EU in terms of duration, how much behind is EU from U.S. right now. Any sort of comment you can
give us on the average duration. Thanks. Oh, for REVLIMID.
<A - Mark J. Alles>: Yes I'm glad you qualified because with POMALYST, we're just too early to know. I assumed
you meant REVLIMID. So let me start with Europe. So the European Union all-in with second, third line therapy, the
duration is approaching very nicely that year plus mark. And we like that because the reality of that is we see a lot of
upside. Again, when POMALYST is available for salvage, where today some physicians will stop prematurely. They
have disease control. They want to optimize the product and it just creates a lot of confidence in the ability to continue
to use REVLIMID while other drugs like POMALYST are available at progression.
With respect to the US, we're quite encouraged by the duration effect. But we still know, and again in U.S. the duration
is a magnitude of order better because what ends up happening of course is that there are different segments of patients
in the US, some newly diagnosed. We have the maintenance feature after transplant that's part of the duration curve in
the U.S. and that's quite long. So it's a very different dynamic. You can think of these markets as totally different with
respect to duration. But what you can say is that across the board and around the world, duration in sequential quarters
continues to improve.

So with that, thank you everyone for joining us on the call today. We look forward to seeing many of you, hopefully all
of you over the course of the next couple of months between the ACR meeting that we've got coming up with the I&I
team starting this coming weekend and into the first part of next week and then at ASH in December. So looking
forward to seeing you. Thanks again. See you soon.
