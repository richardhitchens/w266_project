Today's presentation may contain non-GAAP financial measures. The reconciliation of such measures to the most
comparable GAAP figures is included in our financial supplement, which is available on our website, www.AIG.com.
At this time, I'd like to turn over our earnings call to our CEO, Bob Benmosche. Bob?
Robert H. Benmosche
Thanks, Liz, and good morning to everybody. If you turn to page three, let me start off with capital management, which
is really important.
As you saw, we announced a dividend increase and we've added to our share repurchase another $1 billion. So we're
sitting here with about $1.4 billion available for share repurchase at this time. And this reflects the strength not only of
the fourth quarter but the entire year and actually the last several years, as we look at being able to stress our company
to see what would happen under adverse situations and making sure we have the capital and liquidity to meet a stress
event and continue maintaining our strong ratings and improve those ratings, in fact, over time. So this was in line with
that. In addition to that, we continue our debt management, as you've seen.
And most important in the quarter, we were able to sell ILFC and close out any doubt about that transaction. And so we
expect that to close in the second quarter of this year. That was, as you know, the last major non-core asset that AIG is
selling.
Peter will talk to you about our Property Casualty business. The underlying results continue to be very strong, in my
opinion. This has been a dramatic turnaround from the company and how it has been designed in the past to where we
are today. Peter will take you through the details, but strong top line. Accident year loss ratios continue to improve. But
remember, this is not a linear business. It's a zigzag. I know that's a technical term for some of you. So it goes up and
down and it doesn't go straight. And so you're seeing that, but the trends I feel are very strong.
Our Mortgage Guaranty business continues to do well, a dramatic turnaround from where we were five years ago, but
that's part of the strong risk selection model that was put in place as well as recovery in the market.
Jay will talk about our Life and Retirement business. We've had very strong sales. That business is really doing
extremely well and continues to do well across all of its product sets. So I'll let Jay bring you up to date on the detail
there.
So let me turn it over to David, who will give you the highlights of the financials, and then we'll take you through the
other key businesses. David?
David L. Herzog
Thank you, Bob, and good morning, everyone.
As Bob mentioned, we saw strong performance of our insurance operations, with operating earnings for the quarter in
excess of $2.5 billion. For the full year, our insurance businesses collectively generated in excess of $10 billion of
pre-tax operating earnings. Looking ahead to 2014, we'd expect continued progress in expanding our risk-adjusted
returns through growth and capital efficiency.
The sale of ILFC, as Bob mentioned, to AerCap is on track for closing in the second quarter. The transaction was
valued at $5.4 billion upon announcement, using a $24.93 share price for AerCap. And any adjustment in that value on
closing will reflect the change in the AerCap share price and will be recorded as a non-operating gain or loss on sale.
Upon closing, AIG will receive net cash of about $2.4 billion, which will be held at the parent company available for
general corporate purposes. Our retained 46% interest in AerCap will be held at the holding company and will be
accounted for under the equity method of accounting, with the equity earnings from AerCap included in our other
segment operating results. The lock-up expiration on AerCap shares begins to phase out nine months following the
closing date. We will be prudent in maximizing our value, as you have seen in our past dispositions of invested assets.

As part of the ongoing focus on capital management, as Bob mentioned, our board approved the 25% increase in our
quarterly dividend to $0.125 a share and authorized the repurchase of additional shares with an aggregate purchase
price of up to $1 billion. This gives us $1.4 billion of capacity.
Turning to our financials on slide four, net income for the quarter was $2 billion. That included several largely
offsetting non-operating items detailed on page six of our financial supplement. One such item footnoted on page six of
the financial supp relates to an impairment charge on our investment in life settlements totaling about $832 million
before tax. This charge was prompted by the continued underperformance relative to our mortality assumptions.
Accordingly, we revised our future mortality assumptions and discount rates for valuation purposes. Overall, we expect
this $3.6 billion portfolio to have a mid-single-digits return.
Our operating ROE for the quarter was 7.3%, in line with our full year of about 7.5%. Since our earnings are tax
affected for purposes here and we are not paying taxes to the U.S. government given our NOLs, our ROE excluding the
DTA is about 190 points higher than that. Book value per share excluding AOCI at $64.28 grew 11% from year-end
2012.
Our operating results begin on slide five, and you can see solid growth in our insurance operating income from a year
ago, and Peter and Jay will speak to their respective businesses. The direct investment book and global capital markets
earnings collectively were strong at a little over $600 million for the quarter and reflect market pricing due to their
mark-to-market accounting treatment that can create some volatility from period to period. We expect these earnings to
moderate over time as the portfolio winds down and the investments approach their expected recovery values. In
addition, we continue to proactively and opportunistically reduce the direct investment book's footprint.
During the fourth quarter of 2013, we repurchased about $466 million worth of DIB-related debt. And during the first
quarter of 2014, we reduced the direct investment book debt by a little over $2 billion through both a make-whole call
that we announced in December and open market purchase transactions, all of this using cash within the direct
investment book specifically allocated for this purpose. At year end, we had roughly $7.9 billion of net asset value in
the direct investment book in Global Capital Markets.
Corporate expenses totaled about $213 million for the quarter, down from a year ago due to lower data center
restructuring costs and other related expenses on restructuring costs. We expect corporate expenses would run at about
a $225 million to $250 million quarterly run rate in 2014. Other expenses included a severance charge of about $265
million related primarily to the Property Casualty business, and relates to our migration toward shared service centers,
which Peter will speak to in his remarks. Also reported in other were $170 million of gains related to AIG real estate
sales transactions.
Our reported operating effective tax rate for the quarter was about 32%. Our current outlook for 2014 is an annual
operating effective tax rate of somewhere between 31% and 32%.
Slide six presents a summary of our DTA, which totals a little over $21 billion at year end, up from just shy of $17
billion a year ago. While our tax attribute related DTAs; i.e., the net operating loss carry-forwards and the foreign tax
credits, have declined by about $1.4 billion through the utilization of the NOLs, our net other DTLs and DTAs
increased by almost $6 billion. The increase relates to the sale of securities with gains, transactions that resulted in tax
basis step up, and a reduction in the unrealized appreciation of our AFS securities.
In the fourth quarter we recognized another $540 million of income related to the release of the valuation allowance on
the capital loss carry-forwards. In aggregate, we have utilized roughly 86% of the capital loss carry-forwards. For the
ROE calculation that normalizes for the tax attribute DTA, we subtract about $17 billion from stockholders' equity.
Turning to slide seven, you can see the impact of our capital management activity in 2013. During the quarter we
issued $1 billion of 10-year notes at a little over 4% interest, and we've repurchased some debt at the parent company
and DIB totaling a little over $1 billion, that had an average coupon of about 7.5%. Including the DIB, when you take
into account all the things we've done in 2013 with respect to our liability management and maturities, we've reduced
our leverage by over $7 billion and reduced our annualized interest expense by roughly $350 million.

On the equity side, during the quarter we distributed about $147 million in dividends to our shareholders and deployed
just over $400 million towards the repurchase of 8.3 million shares. While the ILFC transaction impacted how active
we were in the market during the quarter, we remain focused on continued execution of our repurchase authorization.
We will continue to be opportunistic in the future going forward towards our debt capital management as well.
And as you can see on slide eight, our insurance operations remain a source of parental liquidity, as they sent $4.3
billion in dividends and distributions to the parent in the quarter, including $90 million of dividends from Mortgage
Guaranty, its first dividend since 2010. For the full year, dividends and distributions totaled $8.9 billion, well above our
expectation of the $4 billion to $5 billion we've talked about in the past.
I would point out that the full-year dividends from Life and Retirement included about $800 million related to litigation
settlement proceeds received by Life and Retirement that were remitted up to the parent company. Additionally, $1.5
billion in the fourth quarter dividends from Property Casualty resulted largely from some restructuring activity that
we've been working on for quite some time. Our expectation for 2014 is to have dividends and distributions from the
operating companies somewhere between $5 billion and $6 billion.
In addition to these dividends, we expect tax sharing payments from the insurance companies to parent of
approximately $1 billion in 2014 and roughly $2 billion in 2015, as the local insurance companies statutory NOL DTAs
are utilized. These dividends combined with our capital management activity, as I mentioned earlier, resulted in parent
cash, short-term investments, and unencumbered securities of just over $13 billion as of the end of the quarter. Included
in parental liquidity is $5.9 billion related to the direct investment book in Global Capital Markets, which is allocated
for its future debt maturities and contingent liquidity stress needs. As we've indicated in the past, nearly 80% of the
direct investment book's liability will mature between now and the end of 2018.
So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Peter for comments on Property Casualty.
Peter D. Hancock
Thank you, David, and good morning everybody. Today, I'd like to discuss the highlights for the quarter and the year as
well as our outlook for 2014.
Let me begin by saying the year marked significant accomplishments that we believe are indicative of our future
direction. Our balanced approach to growth, risk, and profitability drove our business mix shift, our underwriting
actions, and our capital management achievements. We're pleased with our progress and look forward to continuing on
our path toward increasing returns.
Turning to slide nine, in the fourth quarter net premiums written grew 6% from a year ago on a normalized basis, with
growth coming from each of our major business lines. For the full year, net premiums written were over $34 billion or
up 4% on a normalized basis.
In the quarter, commercial lines delivered net premiums written growth of 7%, with improvement in each product line.
This is the first quarter in 2013 with a comparable top line comparison for Casualty, as there's no longer an impact from
the global excess casualty quota share entered into in 2012. Specialty delivered the strongest top line improvement on a
normalized basis from a year ago, with noteworthy growth in the Europe and Asia-Pacific regions.
Property also developed strong growth both in the fourth quarter and full year. Our Global Property business is
benefiting from significant international growth as we leverage our recently expanded in-house engineering capabilities
and execute on our global approach to capital allocation.
Looking ahead to 2014, we expect continued growth across our businesses, including Casualty, where the
re-underwriting of our book is largely complete. We remain focused on retaining our highest quality business and see
positive rate increase in the United States.
Pricing continued to be positive and largely exceeded loss cost trends. Global commercial rates increased 2.6% in the
quarter. And the U.S. market continued to lead rate improvements with a 5% increase in the quarter. U.S. Casualty led

with a 6.5% increase, followed by U.S. financial lines, which we're up 4.2%, and U.S. Property at 3.7%. Continued
favorable underwriting trends were offset by increased severe losses in the fourth quarter. Improved underwriting
results in the quarter and the year were the result of our pricing actions, enhanced risk selection, technical underwriting,
and investment in claims handling.
Severe losses in the third and fourth quarter reflected higher frequency and severity and exposure growth following the
low level of severe losses in the first half. Our full-year severe losses were somewhat in excess of our expectations, but
we accept a modest amount of volatility for the increased returns. We expect to continue to see a decline in the accident
year loss ratio as a result of our underwriting improvements.
Over the last three years, we've continued to manage down our gross exposure to catastrophes and refined our global
approach to reinsurance, which has led to consolidation of our reinsurance purchases and a reduction in the number of
counterparties and contracts. While we don't disclose all of our reinsurance programs, we'd like to provide a few
highlights that illustrate the role of reinsurance plays in our business strategy.
In our corporate cat program, which we renewed in the fourth quarter, the attachment point is $3 billion and provides
significant protection up to $5.5 billion for individual losses in the U.S. and Canada and up to $4 billion for
accumulation of losses worldwide.
In 2013 we also continued our strategy of accessing the capital markets. During the year, as part of our cat program, we
entered into two separate multiyear cat bond transactions, providing combined reinsurance protection of $525 million.
Our Consumer business, which is presented on slide 11, underwent a transition in 2013, as we increased rates in Japan
A&H and Personal Lines and engaged in further portfolio management in the United States. We continue selective
growth in key markets. We experienced a higher level of travel and accident losses in the quarter, which we don't
expect to be a sustained issue given the short-tail nature of this business.
Consumer remains on track for modest improvements in both growth and profitability in 2014. Additionally, the
investments we're making in Japan will help provide a more competitive operating platform and a lower cost structure
in the long term. Under Kevin Hogan's new leadership, we look forward to executing on our strategy of targeted growth
in markets where we can achieve meaningful scale and applying some of the principles that have worked well in
commercial. We look forward to discussing more details of our Consumer strategy over the coming months.
Two items of note in the quarter are the severance charge that was recorded in AIG's other operations and our reserve
actions. The expense savings associated with the $265 million severance charge largely pertain to Property Casualty
and will emerge beginning in 2014 and become more significant in 2015. However, for the full year 2014, investments
in the business will result in a relatively flat expense ratio compared to 2013.
We began the final phase of the Fuji integration work in the second half of 2013, which will continue into the second
half of 2015. The cost of this initiative, estimated to be approximately $250 million, when combined with our purchase
price, still represents a meaningful discount to the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities acquired. We
believe the full integration of our Japanese business, which currently has an 8% market share, will position us well in
the second largest non-life insurance market in the world.
Slide 13 presents prior-year development for the fourth quarter and full year. We continue to review our reserves
quarterly and take timely action to address changes in development trends. In the fourth quarter, we added $225 million
to our pre-2004 runoff environmental reserves based on our updated review. Our analysis of pollution products looked
into individual cases, which indicated large increases in the value of certain previously reported cases due to new
developments such as the discovery of additional contamination in certain sites, legislative changes, court rulings,
expansion of plaintiff damages, and increased costs of remediation technologies.
In addition, there was a one point adverse impact to our current accident year loss ratio related to the multiyear runoff
lines of business. In the fourth quarter, we obtained approval from our Pennsylvania regulator to better align payout
pattern and mortality assumptions for our excess worker's compensation reserves, using our own experience and to
utilize the more economic discount rate assumption for our primary worker's compensation reserves. These actions

reflect our work with regulators over the course of the year and the significant analysis we completed to better model
our runoff excess worker's compensation book.
For the quarter, the total net discount benefit was $325 million, which included a benefit of $647 million on excess
worker's compensation reserves and a charge of $322 million on primary worker's compensation reserves. We also
expect to record an additional worker's compensation loss reserve discount benefit of approximately $100 million in the
first quarter of 2014 associated with the merger of internal pooling arrangements effective January 1, 2014.
In the fourth quarter, we made $2.6 billion of cash dividend payments to the parent company and $4.1 billion for the
full year. During 2013, we worked with our regulators to simplify our legal entity structure. We consolidated our U.S.
and Bermuda insurance exposures into one U.S. pool to increase our diversification benefits. These restructuring
transactions resulted in $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of dividend payments of the parent company and $1.8 billion
for the full year.
Turning to slide 14, Mortgage Guaranty's operating performance continues to improve, with operating income for the
quarter of $48 million. Mortgage Guaranty continues to benefit from its proprietary risk selection model and an
improving housing market, with 59% of earned premiums generated by high-quality business written after 2008.
Mortgage Guaranty closed the year with a record level of domestic first lien new insurance written of $49.4 billion.
The delinquency ratio fell to 5.9% at the end of the quarter, representing the lowest level since the fourth quarter of
2007. UGC continues to be strongly capitalized and holds an investment portfolio that's highly liquid, with 81% of the
investments rated A or better. As the leading U.S. mortgage insurer, UGC currently insures 800,000 mortgages across
the United States.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to Jay to discuss Life and Retirement results.
Jay S. Wintrob
Thanks a lot, Peter, and good morning, everyone.
2013 was a record year for AIG Life and Retirement. And we had our best year in top line results, generating nearly
$29 billion in premiums and deposits and in delivering on the bottom line with $5.1 billion of pre-tax operating income.
Turning to slide 15, operating income in the fourth quarter was $1.4 billion, up 29% from a year ago, due primarily to
fee income growth, active spread management throughout the year, and higher net investment income. Returns on
alternative investments were approximately $200 million above expectations and 52% higher than the prior-year
period, driving much of the increase in our net investment income.
These results and our solid capital position enabled AIG Life and Retirement to distribute over $1.3 billion to the
holding company this quarter and deliver full-year dividends and loan repayments to AIG of more than $4.4 billion.
Giving effect to these dividends, we still grew shareholders' equity ex-AOCI by 11% to nearly $35 billion.
The success of our retail investment product strategy was a key driver of the significant increase in our sales volumes.
Our all-products, all-channels distribution platform continues to generate outstanding results. Retail premiums and
deposits grew 88% from the year-ago quarter, reflecting growth across all of our investment products.
Individual variable annuity sales were $2.3 billion for the quarter and $8.2 billion for the full year. We remain
comfortable with this run rate of sales, particularly given the actions we've taken over the years to derisk this product.
Fixed annuity sales increased over 90% in 2013, and sales in the fourth quarter were nearly four times what they were
in the year-ago period. Consumer demand for fixed annuities has improved from the year-ago quarter, though sales
have moderated somewhat from the third quarter due to interest rates declining from peak levels reached last quarter
and our related disciplined pricing actions. We also saw increased premiums and deposits in our institutional
businesses, with growth in both group retirement and institutional markets on a year-over-year basis.

As of yearend, our assets under management were $318 billion, up 10% from year-end 2012. Over the course of the
year, we saw improved net flows across all of our retail investment products, higher separate account balances, and an
increase in institutional assets under management. Net flows in 2013 were nearly $4.6 billion, driven by the substantial
sales improvement in our retail products that I just discussed.
We continue to grow our stable value wrap business in the quarter and saw a year-over-year increase of $14 billion in
stable value wrap assets under management. These sources of AUM growth more than offset the impact of rising rates
on our invested asset portfolio. And for the first time in four quarters, we experienced sequential growth in our general
account asset balance. So overall, we're pleased with the growth in assets under management we're seeing across our
portfolio of businesses.
Slide 16 highlights the strong operating income results of our businesses. Retail operating income increased 37%
versus the year-ago quarter as a result of enhanced spreads, growth in fee income on separate accounts, and higher net
investment income. Institutional operating income increased 19% versus the year-ago period and similarly benefited
from crediting rate actions, higher fee income on separate accounts, and higher net investment income.
The increases in net investment income were largely attributable to greater partnership returns and appreciation in
hybrid securities, non-agency RMBS, and other invested assets accounted for using the fair-value method. We also
experienced better than expected mortality in our life insurance business, which contributed to the favorable
year-over-year performance in the quarter.
Our Retirement Income Solutions business continued to grow profitably, with operating income up over 70% from the
year-ago quarter. We're seeing strong demand for our products, which we believe are differentiated in the market based
on the income options we offer and our award-winning customer service.
Over the past almost four years, we've redesigned our products to reduce risk to AIG, and I think the strategy is paying
off. In our Retirement Income Solutions business, of our $24 billion of variable annuities with guaranteed minimum
withdrawal benefits, 71% include benefits with strong derisking features such as the VIX indexing of our rider fees,
volatility controlled funds, and required minimum allocations to the fixed account. Given its relative size, we view our
variable annuity business as an opportunity to generate attractive returns, especially as competitors reduce their appetite
for additional exposure while consumer demand for income solutions remains robust.
Slide 17 shows our investment portfolio composition, returns, and yields. Net investment income benefited from the
strong alternative investment returns in the quarter, as I mentioned earlier. Overall, the total portfolio base yield
declined four basis points from the year-ago period, as we continued to invest premiums, deposits, and cash flow from
the portfolio at new money yields below the overall base portfolio yield.
Over the course of 2013, portfolio cash flow included proceeds from asset sales, which generated significant tax gains
in our fixed investment portfolio designed to utilize our capital loss carry-forwards. Since inception of our gains
realization program to utilize those capital loss carry-forwards in 2012, our overall portfolio base yield has been
negatively impacted by 13 basis points on an annualized basis as a result of the action. It's worth noting, however, that
our base yield increased three basis points sequentially, mainly attributable to increased income recorded on residential
mortgage-backed securities, related to appreciation in the home price index, as well as an increase in estimated future
cash flows when compared to the prior quarter.
Moving to slide 18, we continue to actively manage crediting rates, which is reflected in the declining cost of funds for
both our Fixed Annuities and Group Retirement businesses on both a year-over-year and sequential basis. Net spreads
expanded for both Fixed Annuities and Group Retirement from the year-ago period and the prior quarter. And at year
end, 73% of our fixed annuity and universal account values were at minimum guaranteed crediting rates.
So in closing, 2013 was a strong year for AIG Life and Retirement, with record sales and profits. This year, we remain
focused on executing against our strategic initiatives, which includes growing our distribution organization and
increasing the productivity of our wholesalers, affiliated agents, and financial advisors, leveraging our strong
relationship with distribution partners to increase penetration of our broad retail product portfolio within the firm,
maintaining a leadership position and offering competitive and profitable retirement income solutions, and continuing

to look for opportunities to grow our institutional businesses where we can achieve the most attractive risk-adjusted
returns.
And with that, I'll turn it back to Liz to open up the Q&A.
Elizabeth A. Werner
Thank you, Jay. And, operator, can we open up the lines for questions this morning?
Q&A
Operator
Yes. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Brian Meredith with UBS.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Good morning, everybody, a couple quick questions here first. Peter, I'm just curious. With
2.5% or 2.3% rate increases globally, do you think we can continue to see the magnitude of improvement in your
accident year loss ratios here going forward?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Yes, we have a fair degree of confidence that the three-year trend of accident year loss ratio
improvement will continue. And as you know, a lot of the improvement is baked into this year's renewal, so we have a
high degree of confidence on that.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: And is it coming from maybe just mix instead of absolute rate and that's why you're still
getting the big improvement?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: It's a combination of all the initiatives we've made to make sure that we have re-underwritten
the books that were causing problems. So the U.S. Casualty book has been substantially re-underwritten, getting rate
where we needed rate, investment in much, much tighter claims to reduce claims leakage. So it's a whole combination
of factors which have been underway for two years and that are now starting to come through as we actually start to
believe in the trends that have been established.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Great.
<A - John Q. Doyle>: Brian, it's John Doyle.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Yes.
<A - John Q. Doyle>: We expect to see continued good growth in our commercial business in Latin America, in Asia
ex-Japan, as well as the Middle East and Africa. That business continues to perform quite well from a loss ratio point of
view. We also rolled out some new products around the world. That will continue to contribute to an improved mix of
business. So we're expecting underwriting results on a normalized basis to continue to improve next year.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Great, thanks. And then just quickly on capital management for David, as I look at your
common equity this year, it was up a little over $2.5 billion. And then if you ex-out the OCI, it was up close to $8
billion. So I'm just curious. Why aren't we seeing more capital management, more share buyback, or is that something
we may be able to expect on the horizon and at a faster pace that we've seen?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Yes, sure. Thanks, Brian. As we said before, listen, we've remained and do remain committed
to the $25 billion to $30 billion of overall capital management. To date we've done about $20 billion. I don't know, $16
billion or so of that's in common equity buybacks. We've done some debt. We're increasing the dividend.
I think the overall approach is to be prudent, to be deliberate and orderly about the pace at which we go. We want to in
the long-term scheme of things do this in an orderly way. And so we're balancing the perspectives of many different
stakeholders at the table. So the fact that we're increasing our dividend, increasing or getting an additional share

repurchase authorization, I think you should take as a sign of our confidence, our board's confidence in the underlying
financial underpinnings of the company. And as I said, we remain committed to the $25 billion to $30 billion of capital
management between 2011 and 2015. So we're going at a pace we think is appropriate. Bob, if you want to add any
commentary to that, I'd welcome that at this time.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: No, I think you said it exactly right. Keep in mind that considering where we've been
and we have a clear direction, we want to make sure we do this in a very thoughtful but keen and prudent way.
<Q - Brian R. Meredith>: Great, thanks for the answers.
Operator
Thank you. We'll go next to Mark Finkelstein with Evercore.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Good morning. Peter, can you elaborate on the A&H losses and Private Client Group
losses in Consumer, please?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: I think I'll ask Kevin Hogan to handle that one. So, Kevin, why don't you just take that?
<A - Kevin Hogan>: Yes, sure. Mark, these are primarily related to some wholesale travel business in the fourth
quarter. We had some severe losses, some travel delays. And then in the Private Client Group also, there were a handful
of losses associated with the severe weather. We've taken appropriate underwriting actions across the portfolio in the
U.S. throughout 2013, and we anticipate this to be a short-term impact on the results.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Okay, perfect. And then I guess also staying there, just thinking about the expense
ratio, you've had the severance charges. But the outlook for the expense ratio in 2014 is relatively flat, I think, if I heard
those comments correctly. And I know in the past you've talked about expense ratios staying high through 2014 and
into 2015. What is the current thinking on when we'll start to see some of the infrastructure and the IT spend moderate
and start to see the actual expense ratio coming down?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: The big expenditure in 2014 relates to Japan. As I mentioned, we're spending about $250
million in fully integrating the Fuji acquisition into our AIU operation. And that's a spend that really started in July of
last year and will last through July 2015, but really peaks this year as we make some very major investments in
infrastructure and branch rationalization in Japan. So that's the big item.
And then offsetting that is a continuation of the process we started in 2011 of integrating the Property Casualty
business into one seamless AIG as opposed to a number of separate profit centers with duplicative infrastructure. And
so this year, we will be really streamlining. We're removing excess layers of management in areas where they're
duplicative so that we can be as responsive to customers and grow and redeploy people and capital where the
opportunities are greatest.
I think the expense ratio has been affected by a combination of these investments as well as the reduced denominator of
the shrinkage in U.S. Casualty business. So a bit of negative operating leverage occurring, which as I mentioned, has
really started getting top line growth again as we have re-underwritten the Casualty book. So I think we feel good about
the outlook on the expense front but I don't think there's going to be a dramatic change until 2015.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Okay, and then...
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Can I just add to that? I know we're all focused on the expense ratio, but we need to
focus on the accident year loss ratio and the growth [ph] rate which is another thing that (39:20) Peter has talked about
over the last year or two, is that we've invested heavily in the engineering center, which will improve our ability to
assess this, investing huge amounts of money and time so we have better data around our underwriting intuition and do
a better job there. That's in the expense ratio.

When you look at money we're spending to put in the fraud unit, subrogation units, and our claims area, all this is
added expense. And the beneficiary of that is an improved and reliable and consistent accident year loss ratio. So you
really have to think about the strategic work that Peter has talked about over the last two years and how we're seeing
that benefit across the entire combined ratio. And then also, it takes a while to earn into the benefits of what we're
talking. I just mentioned earlier today that we actually have to see the trends and it takes a long time for trends to
emerge. And I think you'll see this continuing to progress over the next several years.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Okay, all very fair points, just one very, very quick one if I may, which is the increase
in the statutory dividends that you're assuming for 2014 over 2013. Is that all from improvement in earnings, or are
there a more capital efficiency improvements at P&C or any other items that are helping to improve that number?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Mark, it's David. It's a combination of continued strength in earnings, so we're continuing to
generate deployable capital. But there is some amount – I haven't quantified it publicly, but there's some amount that is
– we're moving some higher than needed capital in some of the operating companies up to the holding company. So
we're continuing to evaluate the amount of capital that we're holding in the operating companies. We want to make sure
we've got plenty of capital for our ratings, we have plenty of capital to maintain our competitive positioning and to fund
our growth. But the businesses are continuing to generate very substantial capital, and we will migrate some of the
capital ratios down a bit over time, as we said we would do.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Okay, thank you.
<A - David L. Herzog>: You're welcome.
Operator
Thank you. We'll go next to Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Yes, thank you. Two questions, one is you mentioned the accident year loss ratio being
negatively impacted by some multiple-year contracts. I didn't quite get that. I think it was one point. And then secondly,
with your stock trading below book value, the capital that you'll generate from the ILFC sale, should we assume that
share repurchase will be a primary use of that capital?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: So, Jay, I'll start on the first point and I'll probably enlist James Bracken to help if I flub the
GAAP accounting treatment. But basically, these are contracts. These are policies written pre-2004. They were
multiyear in nature where because they're multiyear and we're receiving premiums still means that as claims get made,
they appear in the current accident year. But these in discontinued business from pre-2004 will appear in the current
accident year as they do normally.
<A - James Bracken>: Sorry, just one clarification. So they're being earned in, we've received all of the premium, and
think of them as multiyear claims made [ph] callable (43:05). So they run for a number of years. We still have a bit to
earn out, and you'll still see some revenue recorded in the NPE line of the other segment. And they attach – some loss
activity attaches to them, but it relates to runoff business.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: And was that one point?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Yes, it's one point for your entire...
<A - James Bracken>: One point for the total company in the quarter.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Yes, one point of accident year loss ratio for the entire company.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Great.
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: As far as capital management is concerned, what we've said all along is that our first
priority is our credit ratings because that speaks to our ability to live up to the promises we make, so we'll worry about
coverage ratio, debt management, and so on. We then said that we want to have some dividends to flow back to our

shareholders. But the primary goal after those two have been achieved is share buyback. And so when ILFC closes, we
will make a determination at that time, and we'll continue to evaluate our capital management program around our
stress testing of the company, which is right now. We'll do one starting in November and we'll do another one around
May. And then, we take a look at where the company is, where we think the issues are in the marketplace. And then we
present to the board what we think is appropriate capital actions based upon what we're seeing at that time.
So as we get to the point, as David pointed out, the $25 billion to $30 billion, you can see the dividends coming up to
the holding company. You can see the DTA beginning to get monetized. Our priority is to continue to maintain a strong
company while at the same time giving what makes sense to the shareholders as quickly as we can.
<Q - Jay A. Cohen>: Got it, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. We'll go next to Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill.
<Q - Paul Newsome>: I want to talk a little bit more about the expense in Property Casualty, but I think maybe I'd like
to ask it in a big picture perspective. If you go back to AIG before its problems, this was a company that had a
relatively low expense ratio and a pretty average loss ratio. And that was how they made their money, by having a
lower expense ratio than their peers. Today, we're looking at a loss ratio which is much improved and actually looks a
lot like the peers broadly speaking, but it's an expense ratio that's higher. Is the goal here to have a business that is
heavy on loss control and heavy on back expenses and a lower loss ratio over time, or ultimately are we talking about a
company that wants to make its competitive advantage once again in expenses?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: I think you should think of us having a very competitive combined ratio, both loss ratio
and expense ratio. I think that's what Peter is working towards. But you need to look at the loss ratio and look at it on
an accident year basis historically. If I go back to our releases, the information we provided you, I don't know that the
accident year loss ratio for those prior years looked at from this year would be what you saw. So I think there's a
difference and if you look back to then, which is what you need to do, prior-year development, and if you look at the
prior-year development over the last several years and look at what we've had to do, you can see that the accident years
were pretty high.
So what you're going to see is continued improvement in the loss ratio, continued improvement in underwriting and
systems around underwriting, continued investment in technology so we have a very strong, bulletproof processing
capability here at AIG that's state of the art, and then you'll see your expense ratios start to come down and still see
improvements in loss ratio. But we need to continue to invest in a lot of tools to make sure that that loss ratio five years
from now is what we said was in the loss schedule or slightly better. And so we're building this company not only for
2014 but for 2018 and 2020. We really have to have a strong foundation in the future, and that's what we're building
here.
<Q - Paul Newsome>: So to try and interpret your comments, it sounds me like your competitive advantage if you
achieve your goals will ultimately be a very competitive loss, a better loss ratio than most and an expense ratio that's
maybe in line with your peers. Is that the idea big picture, long term?
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: I don't view either of these ratios as a source of competitive advantage. They are outcomes
of what we do for our customers. So our competitive advantage comes by the expertise that we have in the risks that we
take ourselves or help our customers to manage if they choose to retain them. And so the investments that we're making
are to become true experts in the risks that we've chosen to specialize in around the world and to use the relationships
that we've developed over decades with customers large, medium, and small in the consumer and commercial space.
And so as a result of that, we are investing in what it takes to be expert, and that will lead to a higher expense ratio than
was the case historically. But those historical expense ratios were also somewhat flattered by reinsurance strategies
with large ceding commissions, which we don't do on the same scale anymore.

The other thing is, as Bob said, you've got to look at the restated accident year loss ratios, 1998 to 2003, which were
way above industry averages, and we never want to return to those sorts of underwriting standards. So we're really
sharpening up how we manage our risks so that we have a competitive combined ratio, as Bob says, and in a
sustainable way through the cycle.
And so the other thing we're really focused on is a better trade-off between profitability, growth and risk, so we don't
feel we're forced to grow top line in a soft market. So we want to get our fixed costs down. We're focused on the mix
between fixed costs and variable costs so that we have the ability to scale back volume in a soft market so we manage
the cycle better in the future.
<Q - Paul Newsome>: Perfect, thank you for the call and congratulations in the quarter.
Operator
Thank you. We'll go next to Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the call and congratulations on a lot of progress this
year. A question I think for Peter and John perhaps or one of the two. When I look at the commercial business and I do
some adjustments for severe losses and I think normalizing for the higher expenses in the quarter from incentives and
stuff, I get to something like an underlying accident year ex-cat combined and commercial maybe as low as a 92%,
which looks like a very nice improvement from last year and a lot of progress in total. And I'm curious, just where are
we going to get to on this number? When I look at peers you can sometimes see, you can often see, high 80% ex-cat
accident year combined ratio underlying numbers. And I think that's what you would need to get to your low 90%s
all-in calendar year target. Is that a realistic end goal for this story?
<A - John Q. Doyle>: Hi, Josh, it's John. We expect to continue to see in 2014 accident year loss ratio improvement,
again normalized. Peter talked a bit about the severe losses on the quarter. They were slightly elevated relative to our
expectations for the full year, a bit better than expected in the first half of the year and higher than expected. So that
contributed to a slightly higher 2013 accident year result than what we expect.
We've talked about expenses. We do expect to see an improvement in the expense ratio over time, as Peter pointed out.
We didn't mention shared service centers. We have some redundant work going on as we build out our shared service
capabilities in different parts of the world, in Europe and Asia, in Colombia as well. So yes, we do expect to continue to
see an improvement in the combined ratio results for Commercial.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: All right, great. If I can ask a different question for Kevin, welcome back to the company. I
think we're all happy to have you here. I want to talk about the Consumer business. So what were the – I know there are
a lot of things going on, we've talked about Japan. But in aggregate, results have been flat in the past couple of quarters
and on the loss ratio side I think have been a bit of a disappointment. I'm wondering if you can just – you referenced
some things you're doing more tactically, you're re-underwriting, some re-pricing. I'm wondering if you can give us
some color on some specifics and the magnitude of actions you're taking to drive margins over the next year or two.
Thank you.
<A - Kevin Hogan>: Okay, thanks. Thanks, Josh. The reality is that AIG has done a terrific job in the commercial
underwriting area in the last couple of years and are a little bit ahead of some of the disciplines that we're adopting in
the consumer area, and the focus is on the large portfolio. So in Japan, we have reviewed and taken rate on some of the
large auto portfolios as well as the core A&H businesses. And in the United States as well, we're taking a hard look at
the Private Client Group business state by state and have filed a number of rate adjustments in both the homeowners
and the automobile businesses there.
We are also in the process of introducing similar tools to what's been used in commercial in terms of its global raters
and focusing on rate adequacy in the various portfolios, including those which are the strategic business expansion
areas where we're introducing the appropriate technical skills from the get-go in our greenfield operations. So growth is
an important aspect of the Consumer business as we try to generate a customer insight driven business, but we are

doing it with the appropriate underwriting disciplines, and that is a very important part of our unit focus.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: That's great. Thanks, Kevin. If I could just sneak one quick one in, a couple of times now,
we've heard from management suggesting the actuaries are lagging in recognizing the underwriting results
improvement from underwriting and claims. I'm wondering, Charlie, if you can give us some color on how you're doing
the analysis and are you using the faster report methods or are you looking at lagging methods like the Bornhuetter
Ferguson and expected loss ratio? And how much more would you characterize of margin improvement has yet to
actually work through the income statement? Thanks.
<A - Charles S. Shamiah>: Josh, I think Peter's comments earlier really relate to a lot of the investments, especially in
the claims area and we've talked about in workers compensation. And so one of the key difficulties the actuaries have is
that settlements patterns are changing, [ph] paids and codes (54:30) are changing, and we're getting much better case
reserve information. And what Peter is talking about is it's very difficult sometimes to distinguish between that case
reserve strengthening and what's really going on in the business. But we're certainly using a whole wide range of
techniques that look forward and try to give appropriate credit for all the investments that the claims team is making in
those initiatives. And so I think with more track record on the paids and incurreds, the confidence in that increases, and
really that's what Peter is talking about. The statistical credibility that you give to the one or two years of emergence
would be better.
The only other statistic I'd give you is that we've reached today an inflection point where the last two years, if you
consider the re-underwriting of the casualty book, we now have – just over 50% of our reserves are coming from the
better underwriting that Peter and John talked about earlier. And so as that increases, I think you will also see an actual
improvement in future periods as the quality of the underwriting comes through and becomes a higher percentage of
overall reserves.
<Q - Josh C. Stirling>: Great. Thanks, guys. Keep up the good work.
Operator
Thank you. We'll go next to Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar>: Hi, good morning; first, a question for David. Maybe, if you could, just talk about where you
are on your interest coverage ratio now and what your aspiration is. And then second for Peter, on the loss ratio,
accident year loss ratio, maybe, if you could, discuss the reasons for the deterioration of the loss ratio this quarter. You
mentioned the one point because of the 2004 and pre-2004 business. But even with that, it would have been worse than
previously.
And then I'm not sure if you quantified the benefit of the cost savings plan and the severance plan that you just
announced. But maybe, if you could, just talk about how much you expect to save on that once it starts to fully reflect
in your results this year or next year.
<A - David L. Herzog>: Okay, Jimmy, thanks and I appreciate the question. I think there are three things I'd want to
leave you with, with respect to our debt capital management as it ties into our focus on coverage ratios. One is we did
achieve the goals we had set out for 2013 vis-à-vis the coverage ratio and interest expense run rate savings. So again,
we did it opportunistically and again, struck a balance of being able to allocate capital to share buyback, dividends, as
well as share repurchase. So again, point one, 2013 goals met.
Secondly, with respect to the direct investment book and the liability management that Brian Schreiber and the team
are overseeing, we funded that with cash that was allocated in the DIB very specifically for that purpose. So those
proceeds or the funds we used for that had no effect essentially on cash or capital we have available for share buyback
or other forms of equity capital management. And again, we'll continue to look to optimize the value of the direct
investment book over time. And as I said, 80% of it's gone at the end of 2018. If we can accelerate that without
sacrificing value, we certainly will.

And thirdly then, the point being we've continued to generate deployable capital, again, $5 billion to $6 billion plus the
tax-sharing payments. I would look for us to continue to very opportunistically focus on debt capital management as it
presents itself. I think I would expect we would continue to make progress on our coverage ratio primarily through
earnings improvements. But also from time to time, we will look at capital management, debt buybacks, et cetera, as
they present themselves. So really, as Bob said, we're focused on our ratings, and we'll strike an appropriate balance.
We haven't set any specific targets for 2014. I think, again, we're in a pretty solid place based on what we did in 2013.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar>: But it doesn't seem like you're done buying, reducing your debt maybe not as much as
before. But do you still expect to reduce that a little bit?
<A - David L. Herzog>: I think yes, we'll continue to be opportunistic in how we think about it. So I wouldn't give you
any specific targets of what we will do or won't do. But again, we'll be opportunistic. We want to focus on continued
improvement in the coverage ratio again. And I think we can do that primarily through earnings, but we'll look at other
ways to approach that.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar>: Okay.
<A - David L. Herzog>: I'll kick it over to Peter.
<A - Peter D. Hancock>: Jimmy, thanks for the question. I think that I will just give you a quick answer on the timing
of expense saves that are related to the severance, which is that we really have not disclosed the precise savings that we
expect in calendar year 2014 because we want to be extremely thoughtful about the way we execute what is effectively
around an organizational streamlining to better serve our customers, where we're not approaching this with a finite set
of deadlines during the course of the year. We want to make absolutely sure that we execute this in a way that makes us
better serve our customers. And so we'll be quite thoughtful about the execution. So we have a broad range of ideas,
and I think it's sufficient to say that we think we will maintain an expense ratio that's fairly stable this year. But they're
not necessarily going to be precise numbers nor a quarterly schedule of savings.
On answering your loss ratio, as Bob says, this is a business with zigs and zags. And to understand which of those zigs
and zags are noise and which ones the signal, you need to dig a little bit under the surface to normalize severe storms
and so on quarter to quarter, and I think that's probably best done offline in a follow-up discussion with James.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar>: Sure, and maybe if I can just ask one more quick question. On the AerCap stock, obviously
it's gone up a lot in value. Have you thought about hedging your position, and are there any limitations on you doing
that if you wanted to?
<A - Robert H. Benmosche>: Jimmy, we're not going to talk about ILFC. Once it closes, we'll be glad to talk about
what the options are. But let's get to closing and then we'll know what we can talk about.
<Q - Jimmy S. Bhullar>: Okay, thank you.
<A - Elizabeth A. Werner>: Operator, I think we can take just one more question and then we'll have to call it a day.

Okay. Our last question today will come from Tom Gallagher with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Tom G. Gallagher>: Good morning, just a quick one for David. The $5 billion to $6 billion of annual dividends
that you're expecting out of the insurance companies now I guess the run rate had been $4 billion to $5 billion. So we
should expect that for the next two years from a visibility standpoint, is that the goal that you would add on, the DTA
utilization on top of that? And so if those numbers are correct, the high end to that would be $8 billion by 2015. Is that
the right math?
<A - David L. Herzog>: I think I'll limit my remarks to 2014, so that's the commentary that I want to share with you
and the investment community because that's the line of sight that we want to provide. As I've said before, again, as we

continue to generate deployable capital, we want to maintain, I think first and foremost, strong capital positions in our
operating companies. And as they continue to generate capital, we'll give you as much insight to that as possible.
Again, I think the DTA payments, as I've said, is roughly $1 billion in 2014 and $2 billion in 2015 and it will go from
there. And so there will be very substantial cash flow for the holding company.
So again, the $4 billion to $5 billion is what we've said back in 2011 when we reintroduced the company, and that's a
very sound foundation. But again, we see opportunities to redeploy some capital above and beyond the levels we need
to hold at those operating companies. And again, that's what we want to do is get it up to the holding company so that
it's most fungible at that level.
<Q - Tom G. Gallagher>: Got it. And then I was just a little confused about the $4 billion or so of dividends that were
taken up in 4Q from the insurance companies. Can you just reconcile where the $4 billion went because if I look at
HoldCo cash and investments, they were up by a small fraction of that?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Yes.
<Q - Tom G. Gallagher>: So where did the full $4 billion go?
<A - David L. Herzog>: Yes, sure, very fair questions. So one of the things we did was we improved the
diversification of the capital in a couple of our operating companies through some internal restructuring we did with the
life settlement portfolio. So we took, we accelerated some cash out of the OpCos. We used that cash to improve the
diversification of some of the capital. The punch line is it had no effect on the level of capital or cash we had available
at the holding company for capital management or other general corporate purposes. So that's really where it went. So
almost $2 billion of it went through that. So it was some internal improvements we made.
<Q - Tom G. Gallagher>: Okay, thanks, and then one last one for me for Kevin. Just on the comments on increasing
rates in Japan, A&H, and auto, can you just comment on what's happening there because I just want to know. Is this to
keep pace with loss cost trends because you've obviously had some elevation of – you had cited travel and accident. I
don't know if that's specifically related to it, or should we expect the rate you're getting to actually improve margin?
<A - Kevin Hogan>: Thanks, Tom. The actions that we're taking in Japan are really related to an overall portfolio
review. Fuji Fire and Marine, a relatively recent acquisition, we've taken an extensive review, and this is really the
primary area where we have improved our selection parameters and rates, and we have seen improvements in the
overall profile of the results as a result.
In terms of the A&H business, it's more a reflection of responding to some changing trends in the underlying results in
the marketplace. And I believe that what we will see is an improved underwriting result going forward.
<Q - Tom G. Gallagher>: Okay, thanks.
