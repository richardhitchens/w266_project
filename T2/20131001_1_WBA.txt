Gregory D. Wasson
Thank you, Rick. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call. Today, I'll begin with highlights
of our fourth quarter and fiscal year. Next, I'll discuss the substantial progress we made in advancing our three key
strategic growth drivers. And finally, I'll take a look ahead to fiscal 2014. Then I'll turn the call over to Wade for a
more detailed financial review of the quarter, our full-year performance and the coming year.
We are pleased with our solid performance as we posted record adjusted earnings per share for the quarter of $0.73,
generated $1.1 billion in operating cash flow and a record $785 million in free cash flow.
We paid off $1.3 billion of senior notes upon maturity, consistent with our debt reduction plan. In addition, to our
strong financial performance, we also made significant strategic gains in the quarter. We introduced Smart90
Walgreens, our 90-day prescription drug program with Express Scripts. The program gives customers the option to
receive their maintenance medications through Walgreens' retail pharmacy or Express Scripts home delivery. We also
announced our agreement to acquire certain assets of Kerr Drug in early September, including their 76 retail drugstores
and specialty pharmacy business. Kerr and its associates will be a great addition to our family of companies.
Also in September, we launched another innovation in pharmacy healthcare as we announced our long-term partnership
with Theranos to provide new less-invasive lab testing services to customers at Walgreens. The services currently
available at our Palo Alto, California store and we have plans to expand later this year. And finally, we've successfully
transitioned on September 1, the distribution of our branded pharmaceuticals to AmerisourceBergen, executing
seamlessly to begin our 10-year strategic relationship.
Fiscal 2013 was a year of major strategic progress as we advanced the transformation of our company for long-term
sustainable growth and value creation. As you know, we worked hard throughout the year to improve our performance
in our Daily Living business and we continue to see growth and strong results in Pharmacy and Health & Wellness.
That performance across our business resulted in record annual sales of $72.2 billion and record annual adjusted
earnings per share of $3.12.
We continue to make progress in our strategic partnership with Alliance Boots achieving $154 million in combined net
synergies, exceeding our previous estimate for the year of $125 million to $150 million.
We generated $4.3 billion in operating cash flow and a record $3.1 billion in free cash flow. We distributed more than
$1 billion in dividends this year to our shareholders, increasing the dividend for the 38th consecutive year. We filled a
record 821 million prescriptions for fiscal 2013, representing a retail prescription market share of 19.1% for the year. In
addition, we made substantial progress on a number of our key initiatives. We launched our Balance Rewards program
last September. The program has now become the fastest-growing loyalty program in the world with more than 85
million people enrolled to date.
Alliance Boots has nearly 20-years' experience running the leading UK loyalty program and our partnership with them
gives us the benefit of their experience, which we will leverage as we continue to enhance our program. And finally
with our strategic partnership with Alliance Boots and our long term relationship with AmerisourceBergen, our three
companies are best positioned to create a pharmaceutical supply chain unmatched in the world.
Now I'll take you through the high-level results for the quarter. As always we will be presenting numbers on both a
GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. As you saw in our release this morning, we reported fourth quarter sales of $17.9
billion, up 5.1% from $17.1 billion a year ago.
GAAP operating income for the quarter was $1 billion, up 75.3% from $586 million last year. Adjusted operating
income for the quarter was $1.1 billion, up 31.6% from $838 million in the fourth quarter of 2012.
GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.69 in the fourth quarter compared to $0.39 last year, up 75.9%. Fourth
quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share were $0.73, up 15.9% from $0.63 in the same quarter last year. GAAP and
adjusted earnings per diluted share both include a positive $0.03 per share net impact from certain litigation matters.

Turning to our performance for the fiscal year, sales were $72.2 billion compared to $71.6 billion last year, up 0.8%.
GAAP operating income was $3.9 billion, up 13.7% from $3.5 billion in fiscal 2012. Adjusted operating income for the
year was $4.7 billion compared to $4.1 billion in 2012, up 14.1%. Our full-year GAAP earnings per diluted share were
$2.56, up 5.7% from $2.42 last year. And on an adjusted basis, earnings per diluted share were $3.12, up 6.5%
compared to $2.93 last year.
Looking at our gross profit dollar growth and SG&A dollar growth on a GAAP basis, this quarter the spread was $319
million. On an adjusted basis, the spread was $156 million. Adjusted gross profit dollar growth increased in the quarter
by $216 million or 4.3%. We also continued our strong focus on cost control as adjusted SG&A dollar growth rose $60
million or 1.5% in the quarter, which included a 1.1 percentage point net benefit from certain litigation matters.
Our continued focus on our strategic growth drivers through the quarter and the fiscal year generated results across our
business. We continued to create a Well Experience introducing new products and formats and making other
investments in our Daily Living business. The ongoing innovation in Pharmacy and Health & Wellness continued to
change the relationship we have with customers, patients and payers and help lift our market share. And we
strengthened ties with our partners Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen bringing us closer to becoming the first
global pharmacy-led health and wellbeing enterprise.
As we create a Well Experience, we are transforming the customer experience across all of our touch points, channels
and formats. As we discussed with you at our Analyst Day, we continue to focus in four areas: improving customer
value, providing innovative products and services, developing a systematic localized offering and designing the most
relevant network and formats. Today, I'll discuss some of the progress we've made this year.
We finished the fiscal year with more than 500 Well Experience stores across the nation breaking out the traditional
drugstore format with cutting-edge design, new assortments and an integrated healthcare offering. We also now have
12 flagships, the ultimate Well Experience store. We opened six new flags in fiscal 2017 including in Washington,
D.C., Boston and San Francisco.
In Beauty, we launched the Boots No7 women's skincare line at the grand opening of our 8,000th store, our Los
Angeles flagship. No7 products and Boots Botanics skincare line are now available online and in select flagship
locations. In addition, we're rolling out both lines to the Phoenix market by the end of the year. We also introduced the
Boots No7 men's product line in stores across the country this summer as well as two other high profile UK beauty
lines, Indeed Laboratories skincare and Mark Hill hair care.
Our private brands are also giving customers a reason to come to Walgreens. We invested significantly this year in our
product lines like Well at Walgreens, Delish, Nice! and Well Beginnings, introducing 400 new items in the fourth
quarter and increasing our private brand penetration in our front-end sales by 90 basis points year-over-year to 22.3%
this quarter.
In addition to these strategic initiatives last quarter, we implemented a three-point plan to balance our investment in
sales and margins in our Daily Living business to drive profitable growth. First, we made adjustments to our
promotional investments with particular focus on our weekly ad. Second, we worked to maximize the value of our
Balance Rewards program, highlighting redemption rewards in dollar value of points earned in both our stores and our
circular. And third, we began enhancing our store segmentation to ensure we meet the local needs and preferences of
our communities.
The result of that plan was our front-end comp increased 1.6% in the fourth quarter compared to the same period last
year, showing growth in every month beginning in May. Traffic also improved through the past two quarters compared
to last year. And in addition while final numbers for the month are not available, we have seen further improvement in
our comp sales and traffic data in September. Final numbers for the month will be available on our normal monthly
sales release on Thursday.
Turning to our strategy to transform the role of community pharmacy. We're making good progress across our business
in Core Pharmacy, Enterprise Specialty Pharmacy and Health & Wellness. We are advancing our work across these
three businesses by providing even more comprehensive care to our customers and patients, developing a differentiated

experience that our competitors can't easily match and we're becoming a strategic partner of choice.
We've made significant progress in our Pharmacy and Health & Wellness businesses here and I'll take you through a
few of the highlights. With the win-back of Express Scripts patients beginning last September and the successful
extension of other major pharmacy relationships, we now have greater predictability on rates in our commercial book
of business meeting our principle for fair value for the services we provide.
Through our preferred relationship with top Medicare Part D plans, we improved our market share. With an important
customer segment, Older Americans, our Medicare Part D share grew by 120 basis points this fiscal year, outpacing the
industry. As a result, we've have also increased overall retail pharmacy market share to 19.1% for the year.
We rebranded our nearly 400 Take Care Clinics as Healthcare Clinics at Walgreens and expanded the services we
offer. We added chronic care assessment, treatment management to our preventative and acute offering. We also
continue to build on our successful immunization program, a foundation of our effort to transform community
pharmacy. We administered more than 8.5 million total vaccines in fiscal 2013 compared to 6.7 million in the prior
year. We remain the only chain pharmacy providing all 17 CDC recommended vaccines in every state where we can
provide them and the largest retail provider of flu vaccines in the country.
And to improve the experience we offer specialty customers, we launched an alliance this year with the Cystic Fibrosis
Foundation to offer industry-leading pharmacy services to patients through CF services especially pharmacy that
provides medication and treatment support to the cystic fibrosis community. We are also improving support to specialty
patients by providing more access to limited distribution drugs for cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and other conditions
treated by specialty drugs. The specialty pipeline is robust and this year we gained access to 21 new limited distribution
drugs. We're making them available across our unique collection of enterprise specialty assets, which includes central,
retail, health system and community pharmacies.
And finally, our Well Transition program, which provides medication therapy management support to patients in the
hospital and through their discharge was recently endorsed by the American Hospital Association for improving
medication adherence and reducing hospital readmissions.
Script count for pharmacy shows the momentum in our performance throughout the year. In the fourth quarter,
prescriptions filled in comparable stores grew by 7.1% over the same period last year. Looking at the results over two
years, which Wade will show you in his section, our script comp improved from the third to the fourth quarter.
We also saw solid process this year on our work to establish a global platform. With this growth driver we're focused
on designing a winning global organization, optimizing the global supply chain, expanding our own brand portfolio,
leveraging the best practices, capabilities and innovation and pursuing new market opportunities.
We launched our joint venture in Bern, Switzerland, this year and, thanks to the work of our joint teams, achieved $154
million in combined net synergies for the fiscal year. Our strategic relationship with AmerisourceBergen is also making
an impact. They began daily deliveries of our branded drugs to our stores chain-wide as of September 1. In addition, we
purchased $224 million of AmerisourceBergen stock as of August 31.
Finally, we announced that Alex Gourlay, the Chief Executive of the Health & Beauty Division for Alliance Boots, is
joining our company. He will serve as Executive Vice President and President of Customer Experience and Daily
Living beginning today. It's great to have Alex come to Walgreens. He brings tremendous depth and experience from
Boots in their Health & Beauty business and we are looking forward to his leadership of our Daily Living division.
Fiscal 2013 was a year of solid progress. Looking ahead to fiscal 2014, we have real momentum yet more work to do.
While we're still operating in a challenging environment, we will continue to focus on execution in our core Daily
Living and Pharmacy and Health & Wellness businesses.
We're comfortable with the adjustments we're making in our promotional investments in Daily Living driving both
sales and margin to advance profitable growth. With our momentum we're now turning our attention to flu season and
the holidays, our busiest season. In Pharmacy, Health & Wellness, we continue to be a preferred provider for Medicare
Part D and we are working closely with our key partners to ensure our customers can take advantage of lower co-pays

and more access to services this season.
With both our Smart90 Walgreens offering and our Theranos launch of lab testing, we have new products in the
marketplace that will help lower costs for our customers and improve their health outcomes supporting our purpose to
help people get, stay, and live well.
On our global platform, we expect to accelerate the contributions from our strategic partnerships with Alliance Boots
and AmerisourceBergen through fiscal 2014. Wade will update you on the financial contributions we expect from both
relationships.
In closing, we are confident we have the right strategic growth drivers in place to continue to transform today's
challenges into opportunities, to deliver exceptional value, and build toward our future as a global pharmacy-led health
and wellbeing enterprise. In addition to executing on our three key strategic growth drivers, we also remain steadfast in
managing ongoing reimbursement pressure and are constantly looking for ways to streamline our cost structure to
prepare our company for our global future. We are setting our priorities against our strategies to ensure we can continue
to grow in an increasingly competitive marketplace.
And finally, today I want to thank our 248,000 employees for their commitment and dedication. They are the driving
force behind so much of what we talk about on these calls, the experience we offer our customers and the services we
deliver. And they deserve much of the credit for our results.
Thank you. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Wade.
Wade D. Miquelon
Thank you, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call. This morning I will take you
through our quarterly results as well as update you on our investments and partnerships with Alliance Boots and
AmerisourceBergen.
As Greg noted earlier, for the quarter we reported a GAAP EPS of $0.69 per diluted share based on 957 million shares.
GAAP EPS translates to an adjusted EPS of $0.73 for the quarter as illustrated by this chart.
In most quarters, we add back the LIFO charge but in this quarter LIFO benefit of $0.01 per share is negative in the
GAAP adjusted walk, which I will explain shortly. Acquisition-related items were $0.10 per share consisting of $0.04
of acquisition-related amortization costs, $0.01 of acquisition-related costs, $0.04 from Alliance Boots-related tax and
$0.01 of Alliance Boots-related amortization. Finally, special items were a net reduction of $0.05 per share.
As noted there was a $0.01 per share in cost associated with the company's charge in prescription drug wholesalers
which was more than offset by the positive impact of the $0.06 related to warrants issued by AmerisourceBergen. In
the quarter, GAAP and adjusted EPS both included a positive $0.03 per share net impact from certain litigation matters.
Let me now provide more detail on our comparable store sales for the quarter.
Comp prescription sales increased 6.4%, comp front-end sales increased 1.6% and total comparable store sales
increased 4.6%. Comp prescriptions filled increased 7.1% versus script comp of a negative 8% in the year-ago period.
Recall the year-ago quarter was negatively impacted by our exit from the Express Scripts network.
In the fourth quarter, the front-end comp increased 1.6% and traffic decreased by 1.9% while the basket size increased
by 3.6%. As Greg discussed, our front-end has now turned positive on both the one and two-year stack basis primarily
due to the momentum of our strategies and our new promotional decisions designed to balance traffic, basket and
profitability.
Looking at comparable store script numbers, our retail scripts were up 7.1%. This continues to reflect the fundamentals
of our underlying business, the return of Express Scripts customers, our continued progress in winning new Medicare
Part D customers.

With respect to margin, our FIFO gross margin was 28.9% in the current quarter compared to 29.1% last year, a 20
basis point decline. Pharmacy margins increased as a result of the ongoing margin benefit from generics that was
partially offset by market reimbursement pressure and continued growth of our 90-Day at Retail program.
The front-end margin was negatively impacted by increased promotional investment, but we are pleased with the
results we are seeing in improved traffic in front-end comp in a challenging consumer environment.
Taking a look at our longer term FIFO gross margin trends, this quarter's 20 basis point decline was up against a 60
basis point increase a year ago. The pharmacy margin was positive in the quarter, but was more than offset by the
negative change in the front-end margin. Moving forward, front-end margin will continue to be impacted by our new
promotional adjustments until we cycle these changes in the latter half of fiscal 2014.
This next chart illustrates the impact that new generic drug introductions have on our monthly prescription sales comps.
You can see that the generic impact on comp prescription sales was greatest in the first quarter of the fiscal year
reaching a negative 9% versus the generic impact in the most recent quarter of approximately negative 2%. The
highlighted quarter show the number of new generic drug introductions have slowed versus a year ago.
In our experience, the margin change resulting from generics is inversely correlated and slightly lagged to the impact of
generic sales changes. That is the strongest positive effect on margin typically occurs shortly after generic impact on
prescription sales when it's most inflationary. And conversely, the weakest positive effect on margin typically occurs
shortly after the generic impact on prescription sales is the least deflationary.
Transitioning now to gross profit, this slide illustrates our quarterly gross profit dollars growth trends for the past eight
quarters on a GAAP basis. And next slide shows the trends on an adjusted basis. Adjusted gross profit dollar growth
slowed slightly from a positive 5.3% in third quarter of 2013 to a positive 4.3% in the fourth quarter. Likewise, on a
two-year stack basis, gross profit dollar growth stepped down sequentially, as we lap a 3.2% decrease from the
prior-year's fourth quarter when we were out of Express Scripts network.
Some of the slowing in the one and two-year gross profit dollar growth stack can also be attributed to the slowing
generic impact I just described as well as the continued strong adoption of our various 90-Day at Retail programs. As
Greg said, we made solid SG&A progress in the quarter. To get to adjusted SG&A dollar growth, you can see that our
GAAP SG&A dollar growth was 0.9%, which included 0.1% for Walgreens acquisition-related amortization and a 0.3
percentage point related to the company's change in prescription drug wholesalers, as well as a benefit of 1 percentage
point from lower SG&A expense for the acquisition-related costs.
Netting these items resulted in an adjusted SG&A dollar growth of 1.5% in the quarter. GAAP and adjusted SG&A
dollar growth both included a benefit of 1.1 percentage points from the net impact of certain litigation matters. Shown
here are the SG&A dollar growth trends for the past eight quarters on a GAAP basis and the follow-on slide shows a
similar trend on adjusted basis. As I mentioned earlier, the adjusted SG&A dollar growth for the quarter was 1.5%
year-over-year increase versus the 1% in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2012.
Looking at adjusted SG&A dollar growth on a two-year stack basis, as you can see, there was a 180 basis point
sequential step-down from the third quarter of 2013. We are very pleased with the SG&A dollar growth in the quarter
and we continue to be very focused on continuing to drive efficiencies across all aspects of our business. This chart
illustrates our two-year stacked SG&A dollar growth trends on a GAAP basis for the last nine quarters.
Now let's review the two-year stack trends on adjusted basis. Two-year stack adjusted SG&A trends improved versus a
year ago with 0.5% growth in the fourth quarter of 2013, down from 3.4% last year. During the quarter, the rate of
growth and adjusted FIFO gross profit dollars exceeded adjusted SG&A dollar growth by 280 basis points. As you can
see this is second consecutive quarter with a positive spread and we're very pleased this is moving in the right direction.
Excluding the impact of net litigations, our spread was 170 basis points, meaningfully above our ongoing fiscal year
objective of 100 basis points.
Turning to other aspects of our income statement, this quarter included a LIFO benefit of $8 million versus the
provision or charge of $132 million a year ago. The significant change in LIFO was primarily driven by unusually high

branded drug inflation in the year-ago quarter and lower-than-anticipated prescription branded drug level inventory as
we initiated our transition to AmerisourceBergen. Our LIFO rate for the year was 2.67%, down from 3.3% a year ago.
Net interest expense for the quarter was $55 million, up $18 million from a year ago. The increase in interest expense
was primarily attributable to the $4 billion note issuance associated with the Alliance Boots transaction and also
includes a $16 million negative impact from a non-cash fair market value adjustment to our interest rate swaps
associated with our $1.3 billion notes that were repaid in August.
Our effective tax rate was 35.4% versus 35.8% last year. Average diluted shares outstanding were 957 million shares
versus 895 million shares last year. And as a reminder, the change is primarily due to the rolling impact of the 83.4
million shares issued for the Alliance Boots investment and to a lesser extent, the impact of a higher stock price
in-the-money options, which are accounted in diluted shares.
In Q1 2014, you can expect a diluted share count of approximately 960 million shares subject to changes in the current
share price. You can also expect interest expense of approximately $35 million. On a go-forward basis, Walgreen's tax
rate is expected to be about 37.5%, excluding the various impacts associated with Alliance Boots partnership.
Cash and cash equivalents were $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter versus $1.3 billion a year ago. Accounts receivable
increased by 21.5%, primarily due to the return of Express Scripts prescriptions, while accounts payable increased
5.7%. LIFO inventories were down 2.6% and FIFO inventories were up 0.6% year-over-year versus the sales growth of
0.8%. Overall, net working capital decreased by 0.6% versus the year ago and we are pleased given our strong focus in
this area.
During the fourth quarter, we generated $1.1 billion in cash from operations versus $768 million a year ago and free
cash flow in the quarter was a record $785 million versus $320 million a year ago. As a company, we remain very
focused on cash flow.
Returning cash to shareholders remains a key initiative for Walgreens as evidenced by the 22.2% year-over-year
increase in dividends per share distributed to shareholders in fiscal year 2013. As previously announced, in fiscal 2014,
shareholders will receive a 14.5% increase in their dividends per share. And our goal remains a dividend payout ratio in
the range of 30% to 35%.
Our capital allocation policy has four primary components beginning with continued investment in our key strategies.
In addition to returning cash to shareholders via dividends, we are also focused on delivering our 2016 goals, which
includes a combined net debt level of $11 million grounded on the basis of very solid cash flow generation. During the
past year, Walgreens repaid $1.3 billion of debt while Alliance Boots reduced their net borrowings by $1.8 billion. We
also invested $224 million to purchase AmerisourceBergen stock in the quarter at an average cost of $56.55 per share.
As a reminder, we are not currently repurchasing Walgreen shares.
As we stated on previous occasions, we deal with a fair amount of quarterly variability in our business including
seasonality, reimbursement rate changes, generic wave trends, flu trends and changes in macroeconomic conditions
among others.
Looking forward, let me give you some general thoughts on fiscal 2014 by quarter. We expect Q1 2014 will face the
headwind of relatively slow-down in the introduction of new generic drugs but will be helped by an easier compared to
a year ago because Q1 2013 adjusted EPS was negatively impacted by the dilutive impact of issued shares and interest
associated with Alliance Boots transaction without any meaningful synergy or equity income benefit due to the
three-month reporting lag. Q2 2014 faces a challenging comparison as Q2 2013 benefited from one of the strongest flu
seasons in the last 12 years and also benefited from our peak in the pharmacy margins during the recent generic wave.
In addition, keep in mind that plan changes with rate adjustments typically occur in January and last year the high rate
of introduction of new generics moderated the impact of those adjustments. This year, however, we anticipate a very
low rate of introduction of new generics in the second quarter. Generic waves begin to help us in the latter half of fiscal
2014 and our synergies should ramp throughout the year. Lastly, our strategic relationship with AmerisourceBergen is
expected to be modestly accretive from a distribution perspective in fiscal 2014 as the full generic distribution cut of

our benefits are expected to be realized in a more meaningful way in fiscal year 2015.
Shifting to our quarterly Alliance Boots accretion walk, as shown, we realized $56 million before-tax in synergies
during the fourth quarter and $33 million after-tax. Amortization adjustments amounted to $8 million for deal
amortization and $11 million for brand amortization. After-tax Alliance Boots equity earnings were $90 million for the
fourth quarter on adjusted basis. And on adjusted basis the income from our Alliance Boots investment was $109
million and incremental after-tax interest expense to Walgreens was $14 million. After the impact of share dilution,
accretion equaled $0.08 in the fourth quarter.
Looking forward, we estimate the adjusted EPS accretion from Alliance Boots for the first quarter of the fiscal year of
2014 to be approximately $0.05. Based on our current estimates of the IFRS to GAAP conversions and foreign
exchange rates and moving forward we will provide our accretion estimates on the call for each quarter in advance. We
estimate the combined synergies for fiscal year 2014 to be in the $350 million to $400 million range. We are very
pleased with both the operational performance of Alliance Boots and combined synergies we are achieving and we feel
we are just scratching the surface of things that we can do together in the coming years.
I'd like to close now by reminding you of our fiscal 2016 goals: $130 billion of combined revenue; $8.5 billion to $9
billion of combined operating income; $9 billion to $9.5 billion of combined adjusted FIFO operating income; $8
billion of combined operating cash flow; total synergy goal of $1 billion; and as I mentioned earlier, $11 billion of
combined net debt, again by the end of fiscal 2016. Later this fiscal, we will review the components of the relevant
measures with respect to progress, risks and opportunities across each of these measures.
So now in closing, let me just share a few final thoughts. This quarter reflects progress against many of our key focus
metrics such as accelerated top-line growth, solid cost management and record free cash flow. We also had many other
meaningful proof points with respect to our long term strategies, such as strong Alliance Boots results and above-goal
synergy delivery, a successful start to our AmerisourceBergen partnership and the continued evolution of our
healthcare strategy, which at its core leverages our best-in-class nationwide retail footprint and more than 70,000
healthcare professionals.
I feel strongly that we are only at the very beginning of the next leg of our company's journey, a journey that started
over 110 years ago, a journey that can put us at the epicenter of delivering better healthcare outcomes in the U.S. and
abroad, make everyday living a little bit better and change the paradigm of how we work with large global suppliers in
an ever and increasingly changing world to create value for them, for Walgreens and, most importantly, for the
customers that we serve.
I'm sure there will always be challenges along the way and we're very appreciative of stakeholders who have taken a
long view. In that vein, I believe the megatrends we face lend themselves to our unique assets and capabilities, related
our strategies are differentiated and sound and executed well should create significant value for shareholders. In short,
it's ours to win.
Thank you again for your kind attention and support. And now, I'll turn the call back over to Rick.

<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Hi, Ed.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Could we start with the gross margin? I'm a little confused on the FIFO gross margin down 20
basis points, pharmacy up, front-end down slightly but I guess I don't really understand how the front-end margin
maybe is not down more or pharmacy not down given the total company down 20 basis points. So is front-end just not
– it's only 35% of sales or so, right, and it's only down slightly. And maybe you could help us reconcile exactly what's
going on there?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yeah. Ed, I'll start and maybe Rick or Wade can give some actual dollars. But as far as we
said directionally, pharmacy was up obviously with the help of the generics that we had for this past quarter offset
obviously by ongoing reimbursement pressure but also with our 90-day drive that we have. One of the focuses we have
is to continue to give customers what they're looking for and that's their chronic medications and 90-day quantities at
retail. So that's an impact that's working the other direction certainly in pharmacy but we think it's the right thing to do
long term. As far as the front-end, as we said we think we are making good, intelligent investments in price and
promotion. I feel like we are getting steady momentum back into the front-end of the business and we're continuing to
make sure that we do that going forward. But as we said, we always planned to make some investment in the front-end
and that's exactly what we're doing.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Are you happy with the comparable gross profit dollar growth in the front-end? How does
that look and how has that changed since you started investing into promotions?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yeah, I think we had solid gross profit dollar increase and then when you compare it to the
SG&A dollar growth and we've said all along that our goal is to have 100 basis point spread between the two over the
long haul. And I think with the performance that we've turned in this quarter, we're pleased with the way both of those
worked in unison.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yeah, Ed, [indiscernible] (37:25). I really think that we really look at it from a gross profit
dollar basis, as you know, and I think we're finding a good balance with – some good momentum we have in growth
right now with also managing the margin wisely so.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Okay. And, Wade, you gave some color on 2014, which is definitely helpful. I just had a
couple of follow-ups on that. Given the fact that you have some tougher comparisons next year with the flu early on,
less of a generic benefit, does gross profit dollar growth slow from here over the next few quarters?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Well, we don't give obviously specifics on that kind of detail. But I think that
fundamentally we feel very good about our business going forward. I think we just want to provide some color that
quarter-to-quarter there can be some lumps, some up and some down. But in aggregate we feel good about how we
drive gross profit dollars and to manage SG&A as well.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Okay. And on the SG&A side, you've done a lot of good stuff on the cost control perspective.
How much of that do you think you can carry forward into 2014? Is there still opportunity there?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: I think we can always be better every day forever. And that's one of the things we're
working hard at is to really put continuous improvement and continuous focus on driving efficiencies and effectiveness
in every aspect of our business. So I'd say yes.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Okay. And Alliance Boots equity income, first quarter you didn't have it. Seasonally, how
does that business look in the first quarter?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: The first quarter is by far their toughest quarter of the year seasonally. So once again, we
guided it to roughly $0.05 accretion for the first quarter. It's summer period, not holiday period. So both in the
wholesale and the retail business it's a low seasonal point.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Okay. And then just one last question for you all, sort of modeling little bit. There's been a lot
of talk sort of like I think amongst investors about what the real tax rate is that we should be using on the synergies.
Any color there?

<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: I guess what I'd say is we'll do some work to try to figure out how we can provide more
clarity and guidance as we go forward. I mean obviously the rate that I gave today looking forward was kind of the
Walgreen standalone rate. Alliance Boots has a different rate. So we have to use a blend for that and then of course the
work we're doing together in synergies and other things is a bit more complex. But we'll do some work to see how we
can provide better understanding as we move ahead.
<Q - Edward J. Kelly>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Thanks, Ed.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Meredith Adler of Barclays. You may begin.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Yeah. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering as long as we were talking a little bit
about the investments you're making in the front-end comp, are you making the investments that you expected to make
and are you getting response that you expected to get. And can you talk a little bit about how you think that plays out in
full year 2014? You only started this I think in May, this increased promotion. So do you think it last till May of 2014
or do you think that it's something you'll be doing for longer until the frequent shopper program really the huge
traction?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Meredith, I feel good about the investments that we have made and are making. And as I
said, that's a balance between the right amount of investment and to drive the right amount of performance. But I think
the team has done a very good job in being surgical, using the data that we're getting from our Balance Rewards
program to help us understand how to strengthen the Sunday Circular as well as begin to use individual programs,
Balance Rewards to drive traffic and basket. So I think I would say yes, that we are seeing the expectations that we had
with the investment we made.
Going forward, I think we will continue to try to drive the improved performance. And I think what we feel good about
that we're going to be able to have to be able to use will be the increasing information we get from Balance Rewards
and the data that we have from the program. Not only to make even better decisions on what we promote and at what
pricing but also more and more individual marketing programs through the Balance Rewards program itself.
As I said the other thing that's needed is with Alex here now working with our team, we'll be able to begin to bring
some of the best practices from their program into our Balance Rewards program. So I think it will be, I think it's going
to be as I've said before like a locomotive. This isn't a jet aircraft. We're going to continue to just gain steam and try to
continue to gain momentum and feel confident about it.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Okay. And then I have a much more technical question maybe for Wade. And maybe you've
answered this in the slides, although you went through the slides quickly. You have other income and is that the
warrants, with a fair market value of the warrants and there is a number in one of your schedules at the end of the press
release that has $62 million as opposed to whatever $43 million, $44 million for the other income, I don't understand
what the difference is?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: That is the fair market value of the warrant.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: And why is that a different number than what you had in that schedule?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yeah, that's an AB share as well, that's the difference. Recall the warrants are split. I mean
effectively we, Walgreens has 50% of those warrants and AB effectively has 50% of those warrants.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: And could you just explain how that shows up in the numbers here. Is that because it goes into
your share of AB?

<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yeah, we can work it offline, but that's effectively right. And so these have basically been
for purpose of adjusted earnings, they've been [indiscernible] (42:59).
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Okay. And then, I guess I just have one more question about the gross margin. [indiscernible]
(43:09) could you talk again, I know you, Greg you talked about, sort of the expectation for generics next year, but are
we saying that most of the benefit of generics for next year comes really towards the tail-end of fiscal 2014?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: That's right.
<A - Kermit R. Crawford>: Yeah, it is Meredith, I think, and in fact, if you think – if you, the graph that we showed,
it showed the volume certainly last year shows what we're up against. But then as far as first and second quarter, they're
like worsen in the second half, we'll see a lift again.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: But we're also against an easier compared to back half, but we're up against the tougher
compare to the first half.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Okay. And then I guess, one more question about SG&A. You have done a pretty good job of
managing expenses. Could you just talk about whether there is any one initiative or a group of initiatives that you'd
point to that have been helpful in slowing the growth of SG&A?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: I think our folks in the field, Mark Wagner and Kermit and team have done a tremendous
job in really making sure that they are ensuring that our SG&A and our labor in the stores, and our expense match the
volume as we bring it back. I think our store people have done a tremendous job of becoming more efficient. We'll
really focus Meredith, on trying to take more and more tasks out of the stores, so that we can free our folks that are in
the stores up more to spend time with customers. So I would give probably 80%, 90% of the credit to our folks in the
field. With that, for our folks in corporate, we have really this year, I think done a tremendous job in getting focus on
the key projects and initiatives that will move the needle for us going forward in a big way and stop doing a lot of
things that will not. And then combined those and I think we feel very good with the focus we have, any ongoing focus
we will keep.
<Q - Meredith Adler>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Thanks, Meredith.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. You may begin.
<Q - Robert P. Jones>: Thanks for the questions. I wanted to ask you about the ramp of synergies, I see you're calling
for $350 million to $400 million in fiscal 2014. On the generic procurement side specifically, I was wondering if you
guys could comment on whether or not the re-contracting with your generic manufacturers, kind of where you are in
that process, is that close to complete?
And then as it relates to that, how should we be thinking about the ramp on the generic procurement side specifically?
Is that something you expect within the overall bucket of synergies to come in a little bit faster or is that kind of pacing
along with the other synergy – areas of synergies?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yeah, couple of things there is one obviously, since we exceeded our goal this year and hit
$154 million and we effectively started at zero. That means by the end of the year you have to be close to $300 million.
And so, we continue to ramp that, that's why we get the objectives and the goals for next year that we have pretty good
visibility on.
With respect to generics, our team who's leading it, Jeff Berkowitz and John Donovan and [ph] Bryan (46:04) made a
tremendous amount of progress. I think we're not going to get too much detail on it, because I think it's work that's
obviously making this happening, as we speak. But I would say that I think they are working with the likely suspects to

find really win-win relationships where we can bring a lot more business [indiscernible] (46:37) players and help them
and they can help us. And so we are very confident that we are going to create lot of value there over time, but I'll just
leave it at that.
<Q - Robert P. Jones>: And then I guess just to clarify Wade, the $350 million to $400 million in synergies that does
not includes any additional generic procurement benefits from AmerisourceBergen's purchasing or does it?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: This is really primarily – this is just us and Alliance Boots. And again there is six work
streams of which generics we've always said it's the biggest one, but all the work streams are now creating value.
<Q - Robert P. Jones>: Any sense you can give us just as far as timing, I know it's still a little bit earlier on in the
process than where you are with AB. But any sense you can give us on when you might be in a position to share an
additional synergy number related to AmerisourceBergen?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Perhaps maybe in future calls I will talk a little bit more. Really right now that the core
focus of AmerisourceBergen, as Greg has said, we've now basically moved all the branded drugs into the
AmerisourceBergen distribution network and that's going fantastic. And now over the next nine to 12 months, we'll be
moving all of the generics and the view of that will come farther out, but perhaps we'll guide on that later.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Bob, I will say that I happen to be in Bern last week or two weeks ago with Stefano
Pessina and Steve Collis and the team, and I'd tell you there is a lot of confidence and a lot of energy with that team.
So, we feel good going forward with what that team is going to be able to deliver.
<Q - Robert P. Jones>: Got it. That's great. And if I could just sneak one more in on the front-end, obviously
promotional activity seem to be a big focus. Currently, I know you talked about the more targeted promotional
programs and it sounds like these obviously have had a negative impact in this quarter and you are expecting that to
continue in the front half of fiscal 2014 if I heard you correctly. I was just wondering if you could give us any order of
magnitude as we think about the cadence into 1Q and 2Q, is it more or less negative than what we saw on the gross
profit margin in this quarter. Anything directionally there will be really helpful? Thanks.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: I don't know if we give actual numbers Bob, but I will say, I think the investment the team
is making in over the past several months that's beginning to drive the momentum. I would say that, we're pretty much
right on as far as the order of magnitude that we need to continue to invest to drive that steady momentum. So, I
wouldn't see any probably more aggressive investment. I think we'll just continue to take it quarter-by-quarter and
make the right investments. But I feel good with the level of investment we are making on, I think that could continue
to drive the momentum we're looking forward in the front-end of the business.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: I also think that balancing the promotional strategy is just one small component of what
the teams are doing, driving the Well Experience, improving our own brand portfolio, more relevant localized tailored
format. There is a lot of great work going on that's very structural and long term in nature, our customer satisfaction
keeps growing. So I think this is the bigger story of why we feel confident as we move forward here.
<Q - Robert P. Jones>: Makes sense. Thanks so much.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Thanks, Bob.

<Q - Robert M. Willoughby>: Wade, what is the inventory run rate we could expect with ABC now controlling more

<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: With our inventory, I mean effectively we reduced substantial inventory, all of our
branded effectively in the cutover. But as part of the agreement we've also increased our days payable. So the working
capital balances out to a fair degree. It just ends up on different lines.
<Q - Robert M. Willoughby>: Okay. Net-net, kind of, continued current run rates then overall for working capital?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yeah, I would say that's a pretty good assumption.
<Q - Robert M. Willoughby>: And just another question, in terms of the real estate that you own for your stores, that
metric was always, kind of, 19%, 20%. Where does that stand now?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: It's still about that, historically that was both for how we want to balance our balance sheet
as well as there are just some areas where it's more advantageous to own than it is to do a structured lease agreement.
But I think we'll probably be about that zone moving forward.
<Q - Robert M. Willoughby>: That's great. Thank you.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. You may begin.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Yeah, hi. Good morning.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Good morning.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: You mentioned that you were at about $300 million of a run rate at the end of fiscal year
2013. So when you think about your synergy guidance for 2014, the $350 million to $400 million, what is the exit run
rate that you're expecting to achieve?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: The exit run rate? Is that?
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Yes, the exit run rate for 2014.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: I mean it would be obviously higher than the higher end of that limit but we haven't given
exact guidance because we kind of give rise to the following year so it will be higher than $400 million.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Right, but should we think about it as $500 million to $600 million range? I guess it all
depends on the magnitude of the ramp up?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yes, I mean there is moving parts right so if I gave you exact number it would probably be
plus or minus wrong, but I think we feel confident that year by year by year we can keep delivering incremental
synergies on these extremes and we are also increasingly finding new areas that we can focus on. Now we drive
product efficiencies but just take the capabilities and drive top-line benefit as well.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay. And can you share with us, when you think about Alliance Boots for fiscal year
2014, any color on what's the top line and EBIT growth that we should expect from AB? And understanding that there
is some seasonality as we've seen in fiscal year 2013 but just overall for the year.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: I guess we're not going to comment on their business any more than we feel that they are
obviously performing very strong in a challenging environment. I think you saw obviously the last year delivered
strong numbers I think that they feel, the wholesale business continued to do well in challenging environment as well as
the retail business and being able to drive profitable meaningful growth. So...

<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay. And then just a follow-up on the SG&A. I mean, obviously, I think, in response to an
earlier question, you said that you think that you can continue to improve SG&A spend going forward. But the growth
initiative on SG&A on an adjusted basis was about 2.6%. So really significantly below, kind of, your long term steady
state guidance of 3.5% to 4.5%. So as we think about our model for fiscal year 2014, should we stick with the 3.5% to
4.5% or are you now at a new baseline of growth?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: I guess it's right to say, I just kind – I'd revert you back to that objective we have there 100
basis point or more spread over time on SG&A to gross profit dollar growth. There are also in SG&A, there is lots of
lumps that happen quarter-to-quarter and even fiscal-to-fiscal, I guess the key takeaway is we are very focused, as Greg
said, on really prioritizing the organization around the things that really matter. We're really looking at everything to
see does it create value, things like indirect spend, things that we buy that we don't re-sell, do we need it, does it cost
optimizer, is it efficient. So again I think it's really more of that ratio that's important, because even that number that
you alluded to, the 2.6% also include things like USA drug. So it's not really even a true organic number, which has
been better than that and these things can change that metric over time as well.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay. So we should obviously include Kerr, as we think about your SG&A growth for next
year.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yes, right, for sure.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yeah.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Yeah, okay. And can you give us a ballpark of what that dollar number would be?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: In terms of year-on-year growth or...?
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Yeah.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Again, I guess I'd just say that that objective for us is to make that spread or beat it
consistently most of the time.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: And Kerr is 76 stores, so that alone isn't going really I guess change materially our base
SG&A.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay. And lastly on preferred party network, it contributed to your growth last year. Are
you looking to add new partnership, new network partnership on Part D this coming year?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Kermit, do you want to address that?
<A - Kermit R. Crawford>: Ricky in this year as we were last year January, we certainly have relationships that are
preferred with our Medicare Part D providers. We are excited about the opportunity as we saw our market share grow
in this, as Greg said, in this very valuable Older American. So next year you'll see us with the same partnerships that
we've looked at in the past.
It's a part of our – if you think about our overall strategy is being a better strategic partner. There is a number of
examples out there, where we're beginning to see this not only with the Medicare Part D plan, but also with our SmartD
90 plan with Express Scripts, where we see that customers will have a choice to get their 90 day at retail at a Walgreens
or through Express Scripts home delivery. So this strategic partnership is a part of our overall corporate initiative to
continue to work with partners.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Okay. And then, finally, on October 1, open enrollment is starting today. Can you just share
with us your thoughts of how you think ACA is going to impact your business over the next 12 months?
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Well, the enrollment period starts today we certainly have our pharmacists and all of our
people prepared to ask questions as members or those who are affected or impacted coming to our stores. From an
ACA perspective, we certainly know there is going to be an increase in a number of people that get insurance. We're

not speculating on what that number is but overall we would anticipate benefiting from that in a number of ways not
only from our script volume but when you think about healthcare clinics. We have over 300 healthcare clinics that will
provide not only preventative, but minor acute as well as chronic care. We've also been involved in partnerships around
ACOs, where people are looking to have managed the entire benefit and under this exchange benefit design, it's a
benefit design of both medical and drug. So we think we are going to play a key role in that as people take advantage of
the pharmacy benefit and drive their overall lower medical cost.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yeah, Ricky it's Greg. I would just say I think we're looking at it certainly for all those
reasons it is more of a long term benefit for us. For all the reasons have been expressed it's a tougher audience, diverse
audience to bring into the program and make aware of.
But so next year is going to be hard to tell but certainly from a long term we think it will be a benefit for us for all the
reasons Kermit explained.
<Q - Ricky Goldwasser>: Thanks very much.
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Thank you.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Thanks, Ricky.

Thank you. Our next question is from Steven Valiquette of UBS. You may begin.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Hi, thanks, good morning, Greg and Wade. So I guess, first is in relation to all that
discussion on the adjusted gross profit dollar growth. Is there any preliminary view on the change in LIFO provision
and what that might be for FY 2014?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: You mean in terms of the rate or...?
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Yes, just thinking about it, if you're going to have fewer generic launches and brand
inflation remaining strong, I would think you could have a fairly good-sized LIFO charge overall in FY 2014. So I just
want to make sure I'm sort of thinking about that the right way. And also does the ABC shifting change the way that
your LIFO inventory might flow?
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: The ABC thing absolutely does change obviously because it's a different arrangement now
and they are managing the bulk of the inventory. I would say I don't think we see the rate being materially different
than it has been over the past couple of years on average, but there are a lot of moving parts with that especially when
you move from such dollar branded to having generics and then as we transition generics over time that will change yet
again. So I think maybe as we go forward in the next quarter we can provide some clarity, but I don't think it's going to
be anything material versus history.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Okay. And then also we've been getting a lot of questions recently on what your tax rate
may go down to once you get into your FY 2016. You obviously have a lot of guidance for that year, but tax rate not
being one of them. But if we do assume that step two with Alliance Boots is completed, I guess the question is, could
there be a material step down in the tax rate on your income statement once we get into FY 2016 versus where that tax
rate is currently.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: I mean very simplistically the kind of blend our rates and their rates on the relative
businesses although there are things like sub Part S and other things which can move it off of that number depending
upon how is the structure, but I think that if we want to model it simply you could probably use the blended rates and
be close.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Okay. I think there's been some discussion that even some of your U.S. operations, if it
gets offshored in some way, that even your overall tax rate could go down even lower than what that blended rate

would be. So maybe we can just discuss that more offline, if you want, but that's been something that's been coming up
a lot recently, just FYI.
<A - Wade D. Miquelon>: Yeah, we have no plans for that. I mean really it's managing our businesses as effectively
as we can the way they are today with the changes...
<A - Gregory D. Wasson>: Yeah, Steve, none at all.
<Q - Steven J. Valiquette>: Okay. All right. Great. Thanks.
