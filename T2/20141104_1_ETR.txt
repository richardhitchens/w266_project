Leo P. Denault
Thank you, Paula, and good morning, everyone. As many of you know, the annual Edison Electric Institute Financial
Conference is just around the corner. So we'll try to keep our comments today relatively brief and save longer-term and
more strategic updates for our meetings in Dallas.
I'll start with the bottom line. Our plan and strategy remain sound, and our progress against that strategy is both
measurable and clear. As it often does, progress incurs a cost, and we saw a little of this in the third quarter. But in fact
overall performance for the company was squarely in line with expectations.
We're pleased to report that the utility posted its fifth straight quarter over quarter of industrial sales growth and the
second straight quarter over 5%, exceeding our expectations for the year. Our nuclear plants operated well. We had
fewer unplanned outage days, posting a 90% capacity factor at EWC. Vermont Yankee entered its final months of
operation, and as difficult as that decision was, we are more confident than ever that it was the right one. We also made
progress on our rate case in Mississippi, reaching a constructive settlement with the Mississippi public utility staff, one
which aligns customer, regulator, and state objectives with our own.
Let me elaborate a bit on all fronts. As I just mentioned, the utility posted quarter-over-quarter industrial sales growth
of more than 5%. As you've heard us say many times, this kind of growth isn't by happenstance. At Entergy, we're
doing everything we can to drive it. Doing so requires many things, but one is having strong working relationships with
the people who serve our utility states, certainly our regulators, but also state and local policymakers, economic
development officials, and our customers themselves. Together, we've been able to find solutions that work for
everyone.
For example, in Louisiana this past August, we completed cost recovery for damage caused by Hurricane Isaac. We
were pleased that the efficient structure by which we did so allowed us to share the savings with our customers. Cost
recovery of Ninemile 6 begins when a unit comes online, through a formula rate plan adjustment mechanism which
was part of the Entergy Louisiana rate case settlement approved last year. We're pleased that the plant, which will allow
us to better meet the state's growing demand, is scheduled to be completed early, before the end of the year, and under
budget. Partly as a result of actions like these, we're in a good position to make the kind of investment our states need
to support economic growth, even as we keep the cost of power low.
The Mississippi rate case is another great example. As I just mentioned, last month we reached a settlement. It's true
that this settlement requires us to forgo recovery of costs associated with the development of a new nuclear option at
Grand Gulf. It would also allow Entergy Mississippi to maintain a competitive ROE, better meet anticipated demand,
and continue to attract capital on reasonable terms. Perhaps most importantly, by developing the state's transmission
infrastructure, we believe it will help Mississippi attract industry and create new high-paying jobs. The MPSC hasn't
approved the settlement yet, and we don't want to get ahead of either ourselves or the commission, but we think it's
reasonable and balanced and hope our commissioners will agree. We expect a decision in December.
Driving growth in our service territory also requires operational and financial discipline. So in the third quarter, we saw
progress on another important front. In a move designed to attract industry and jobs to the state, Entergy Louisiana and
Entergy Gulf States Louisiana asked the Louisiana Public Service Commission for permission to become a single
utility. The initiatives are different, but as in Mississippi, combining the two companies will make it easier for us to
make needed investments in Louisiana power infrastructure and, via expanded rate options, sustain and propel the
state's industrial renaissance. It will, for example, allow us to streamline investment by creating a stronger balance
sheet. It will improve our ability to attract capital, and it will give us more flexibility.
By 2019, the two companies expect up to 1,600 megawatts in industrial load growth. Both are already making
substantial investments to meet demand and replace aging infrastructure, which together with other ongoing capital
needs will require more than $5 billion in capital investment in generation, transmission, and distribution by then. Our
business combination proposal to the LPSC reflects significant input from stakeholders across the state, in particular
our industrial customers, and we were pleased to see positive feedback from the market. As some of you may have
seen, on October 10, Moody's issued a report saying this business combination is credit positive, reinforcing our case.

Let me give you just a couple of other highlights from the quarter. Entergy Texas filed for nearly $7 million in revenue
requirements associated with incremental distribution investment under a rider, becoming the first Texas utility to do so
since legislation was passed in 2011. A decision is expected early next year.
Some of our biggest customers also made progress. Big River Steel in Arkansas completed financing and broke ground
in September. Cameron LNG in Louisiana also had its groundbreaking just last month. And last week, Sasol announced
their final investment decision on an $8 billion investment in the Lake Charles, Louisiana, area.
At Entergy Wholesale Commodities, operational performance was once again strong. As I noted earlier, our plants ran
well. For example, the extended outage at FitzPatrick came in below the shorter end of our expectations, and at VY our
employees have kept the plant running for nearly 600 consecutive days now. Remarkably, they are on their fourth
breaker-to-breaker run. But in fact all of our EWC plants play important roles in their respective regions and
communities. Pilgrim provides fuel diversity in a part of the country where infrastructure constraints are most severe.
Without the onsite fuel benefits it provides, New England would be even more vulnerable to price volatility. As I noted
a minute ago FitzPatrick completed its refueling and maintenance outage, a very complex undertaking, in just 44 days,
a great example of what happens when a solid plan comes together with our employees' tremendous dedication.
And with respect to Palisades, although it has a PPA through early 2022, its long-term post-PPA outlook is improving.
For example, the MISO region, where it is located, has recently seen 3 gigawatts of coal-fired generation retire, and
another 5 gigawatts is scheduled to retire in the next few years. So keeping highly reliable sources of baseload power
like Palisades online will become even more important.
Let me now turn to Vermont Yankee, since I know a lot of you will have questions about its closure. As you may
know, in September the plant began its coast down to permanent shutdown, which will occur at the end of the year.
Last month, as we said we would, Entergy delivered a first-of-its-kind site assessment study to the state of Vermont.
While decommissioning costs articulated in the study are higher than our earlier estimates, they are more precise,
allowing us to develop plans with much more certainty.
Under the terms of our agreement with the state of Vermont, we had said we would periodically evaluate the cost of
decommissioning, together with the trust, to determine when we would have the resources needed to begin major
activities. Using conservative estimates about the growth of the trust, we think it will have enough money to begin such
activities in the next 25 to 35 years. At this point, we don't expect to add funds into the trust to meet NRC financial
assurance requirements.
The decision to close the plant was tough. It came with certain risks and challenges, but we planned to meet and
manage these challenges thoughtfully, which I think we have. For example, we obtained an order from the Vermont
Public Service Board authorizing VY to operate through the end of the fourth quarter. We targeted elimination of
overhead associated with the plant, and we placed a majority of Vermont Yankee employees wanting to stay with the
company in new roles.
It's worth reiterating that this was the right decision. First, we now see an incremental benefit of shutdown versus
continued operation of an additional $50 million through 2017. And second, despite the upturn in forward power prices
in New England over the past year, the economics for VY would still not be sustainable in the long run. Forward
capacity market improvement through the newly defined constrained zone that spans southeastern Massachusetts and
Rhode Island is improving the revenue outlook at Pilgrim and RISEC. But VY would not have benefited from this new
capacity zone.
Indian Point also continues to operate safely and reliably. The plant's importance to the regional electric grid was
recently reaffirmed by the New York ISO, which confirmed that, and I quote, "significant violations of transmission
security and resource adequacy criteria would occur in 2016 if the Indian Point plant were to be retired as of that time."
As most of you know, the state of New York is currently scheduled to determine Indian Point's compliance with the
Coastal Zone Management Act, or CZMA, by year-end. To date, we have submitted thousands of pages of information
demonstrating that Indian Point operations are consistent with state coastal policies.

There is at least one more environmental impact study the NRC has said it would summit, likely late next year, and we
think that that study would be important to complete the record. We also have two other paths for resolution to
establish that the NRC does not need this consistency determination to issue a renewed license. As we have made clear,
we believe it does not. Regardless of the outcome, we expect appeals to be filed. It is also possible that we will take
other procedural steps to support our position. But, that said, we don't expect license renewal to be decided anytime
before 2018.
I think we can say with some assurance that while Entergy may differ with some on the future of Indian Point, we can
all agree that what it offers – reliable baseload power, high-paying jobs, and stable prices – that these are attributes that
benefit Westchester County, New York City, and the state of New York as a whole. And that's why we say that Indian
Point is and will remain a critical part of the generation mix of New York, and why we are committed to ensuring its
continued safe operation.
Finally, as we look to winter, infrastructure constraints in the Northeast are expected to continue to challenge the
region, at least for the foreseeable future. As we've said before, various changes in structure are required to ensure these
markets function properly, not only with respect to reliability but also economic and environmental sustainability.
Building new capacity is one option, but it can be expensive to build any kind of new energy infrastructure, whether
pipelines and wind farms, in the Northeast.
This past quarter, Massachusetts stakeholders withdrew support for a proposal to recover costs for new gas pipeline
capacity via a FERC-regulated electric transmission tariff. We believe that recovery for this type of investment is better
addressed through competitive markets and market-based signals and mechanisms, as opposed to being subsidized
through a transmission tariff. Although forward markets indicate these constraints will be partially addressed in the
coming years, it's unclear when or if projects will actually get built. In any case, it will take time. So we expect
Northeast markets to continue to be premium markets for the foreseeable future, especially during the winter.
Before I conclude, I'd like to note that next week America celebrates Veterans Day in honor of the generations of men
and women whose service and sacrifice embody the ideals upon which this country was founded nearly two and a half
centuries ago. We live in a world in need of heroes, but at Entergy we get to work with nearly 2,000 people who, when
their country called, they said, "Send me." They work at our nuclear plants and at utility operations. They are linemen,
engineers, and accountants. They sit across the hall or across the table, and we are fortunate to call them colleagues,
bosses, and mentors. Words may never be enough, but on behalf of this company, to those who served and those who
continue to serve and to their families, let me just say thank you.
So that concludes the overview of the third quarter. We'll be seeing many of you in a week or so, and I know Drew will
expand on this, so I'll just say that at EEI we plan to address what Entergy is doing to meet the needs of our
stakeholders, from adding new capacity at the utility to maximizing value at EWC. Some of you know that I've been in
this business for more than 30 years. It's never easy going, but for all of us here, there has never been a more exciting
time. And so today at Entergy we can say that our fundamentals are strong, the path forward is clear, and most
importantly our long-term value proposition remains intact.
Let me now turn the call over to Drew. Drew?
Andrew S. Marsh
Thank you, Leo, and good morning, everyone. Today I will review the financial results for the quarter, provide
highlights on how we see 2015 shaping up, and preview what we'll discuss at EEI.
Starting with slide 2, our third quarter results for the current and prior years are shown on an as-reported and an
operational basis. Operational earnings per share were $1.68 in the third quarter 2014, compared to $2.41 in 2013.
Operational results excluded special items from the decision to close Vermont Yankee, HCM implementation, and the
transmission spin-merge effort last year.

Turning to operational results by line of business on slide 3, Entergy's operational earnings decreased quarter over
quarter. One key driver was income tax expense, which affected each of the segments. The effective income tax rate
was approximately 40% in the third quarter of this year, compared to approximately 25% in the comparable period last
year. Details underlying the income tax expense variance are discussed in Appendix A of our earnings release.
Moving to the segments, at the utility, operational earnings per share were $1.72 in the current period, compared to
$2.04 in the prior period. Utility net revenue was higher than last year, led by weather-adjusted retail sales growth for
the quarter at 2%. Once again, the industrial customer class had the strongest gains at 5.3%. And as Leo noted, this is
the fifth quarter in a row for positive industrial growth, which was due largely to expansions in the chemicals refining
and primary metal segments, as well as growth from small industrial customers. Substantially all the growth occurred
in Louisiana and Texas.
The quarterly net revenue increase also reflected higher price resulting from rate actions, a portion of which was offset
by other line items. Sales growth was partially offset by a very mild summer, leading to negative $0.11 of weather.
Also, O&M was higher quarter over quarter. Benefits from our ongoing cost management efforts were offset by nuclear
spending to improve operations, as well as other items, some of which were offset elsewhere in the income statement.
As Leo noted, utility results were also affected by a charge related to proposed settlement of Entergy Mississippi's
general rate case. The charge reduced current-period earnings by $0.23 per share.
Moving on to EWC, where operational earnings were $0.23 per share and were lower than the $0.46 earned a year ago,
primarily driven by income tax benefits in the third quarter 2013, as well as the depreciation change we have discussed
in the past. EWC EBITDA for the quarter, summarized on slide 4, was $165 million, the same as last year. EWC's
O&M was lower compared to the same quarter last year and driven by our cost management efforts. While the overall
net revenue variance was not significant, there were a few important items within that line item.
Third quarter results reflected 37 refueling outage days for the FitzPatrick plant. You may recall that that outage was
originally planned for the fourth quarter. The net revenue effect of the refueling outage was partially offset by an
approximately 40% improvement in unplanned outage days quarter over quarter and a higher average realized price in
the nuclear fleet quarter over quarter.
Moving on to operating cash flow shown on slide 5, OCF was around $1.4 billion in the current quarter, up nearly $300
million from 2013. The primary driver was $310 million in securitization proceeds to reimburse Hurricane Isaac costs.
Before we move on, slide 6 highlights our credit metrics compared to a year ago. Let me just take a moment to note
that we've seen credit improvements across several metrics, which shows progress in the right direction.
I'll now turn to forward-looking information. Today we affirmed our 2014 operational earnings per share guidance of
$5.55 to $6.75. Recall that the midpoint was revised upward in April of this year by approximately 23% to $6.15 per
share from the original guidance midpoint. Current expectations continue to be on track for around the midpoint of our
range, but for the unplanned charge associated with the Mississippi settlement. Similarly, absent that charge,
expectations for the utility continue to be around the $5 midpoint we discussed in April.
Next week we'll see many of you at EEI's annual financial conference. In advance of the conference, we surveyed some
of you in the investment community to get opinions on where we can enhance our communications. One specific point
of feedback was on our practice of pre-releasing earnings. It was clear that most of you do not find this practice useful.
Therefore, going forward, we will discontinue it.
You also provided feedback on what you wanted to hear at EEI. At the conference and on slide 7, we'll be prepared to
talk about 2015. As you know, we will issue our official guidance with supporting details on our fourth quarter call.
The good news is that our current expectations and the Street consensus appear generally aligned based on commodity
prices as of September 30 and other factors, which I'll discuss now, with more details to follow next week.
For the utility, we expect weather-adjusted sales growth in the range of 3% to 3.5% to be a significant driver. Industrial
sales are expected to be the major component, increasing approximately 6%. We don't expect rate actions to have a
significant earnings impact. For EWC revenues, the capacity and generation table, Table 7 in our release, provides

details underlying our revenue assumptions. We also provide our current EBITDA estimates, assuming market prices
as of September 30 in the accompanying slides. Because New York's Lower Hudson Valley capacity market is illiquid,
the table once again utilizes point-of-view pricing for LHV. Next year, the assumed average price is approximately $6
per kW a month for LHV.
Staying with EWC, the closure of Vermont Yankee will affect year-on-year results. This year, VY is expected to
contribute approximately $55 million to EWC earnings and approximately $165 million to operational adjusted
EBITDA. Keep in mind the year-over-year impact of the VY closure goes beyond simply removing 2014 earnings. To
this end, EEI materials will include information on line-item drivers for VY.
Updates on other typical drivers will include interest expense at the utility and depreciation in both businesses resulting
from capital investments. Non-fuel O&M will also be a driver for 2015, and one component is pension expense. We
will not know the final pension assumptions, including the discount rate, until early next year. For now, we're assuming
a pension and OPEB expense increase of approximately $70 million, which includes updated actuarial and experience
studies, as well as a discount rate of 4.75%. We also expect our overall and utility effective income tax rates to be in the
range of 32% to 34%, compared to approximately 37% overall this year.
Beyond 2015, we will discuss the longer-term view, and we'll roll forward many of our Analyst Day financial outlooks
and aspirations by one year. Finally, for content, we'll cover the utilities growth story, which includes robust growth in
industrial demand, as well as the case for investment opportunities in generation, transmission, and potentially natural
gas reserves. For EWC, we'll focus on its long-term strategy, as well as our efforts to improve clarity for Indian Point.
We look forward to seeing you at EEI, where you know we'll have a lot to talk about.
And now the Entergy team is available for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Okay. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Good morning. How are you?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Paul.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Just to sort of follow up on the EEI preview with the Vermont Yankee decommissioning, how
should we think about the ongoing expense item associated with that? Can you give us a little bit more before EEI?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Yeah. For the next couple years, we expect it to be about a negative $0.20 to $0.25 (sic)
[$20 million to $25 million], and then after that it would trail off to about – or excuse me, millions, sorry. $20 million
to $25 million of net income impact, and that trails off to about $12 million.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: I'm sorry, and -
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: There's several ups and downs in there. We'll have the line item drivers for you on a slide at
EEI.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And then does the change in the Vermont Yankee decommissioning cost in total have
any impact on what you guys are thinking about with your other plants? And I recall you guys taking some significant
tax positions associated with that. Could those change as well as a result of your updated Vermont Yankee
decommissioning study?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: I'll answer the second question first. No, it doesn't affect our tax positions. And on the first
question, we did learn quite a bit because we did the detailed study at Vermont Yankee, but it doesn't change our
current expectations for funding or expense at any of our remaining nuclear facilities.

Operator
And we will take our next question from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Good morning.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Good morning.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Julien.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: So quick question here. As you're thinking about New England and all the latest
developments, what's your fundamental view of 2015 through 2017 on the forward curve? Do you think or is it your
expectation to continue to use options to leave some upside there?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Bill?
<A - Bill Mohl>: Yes, Julien. We can plan to continue to use the same hedging strategy we have in the past, keeping in
mind that there are certain limitations depending on what the market offers. But – so we continue to use a number of
structured products. Those structured products change; the number of counterparties change. But we're still working to
maintain that optionality in the book.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. And then looking at the capacity side of the equation there. Obviously, we've
seen a few new new-build or potential new-build announcements in the last few months. How has that, if at all,
changed your expectations for pricing in the subsequent auction? And then specifically, are you expecting the SEMA
region to break out separately, and do you have any price expectations therein?
<A - Bill Mohl>: Yeah. So we have seen a lot more activity in terms of proposed projects. Our expectations on pricing
associated with capacity really haven't changed. We think that for the Rest-of-Pool in New England that still is
somewhere around an $11 CONE. We do expect ISO New England to put in place the SEMA pricing zone that has –
will hopefully be resolved by the end of this year. As it relates to pricing in that specific zone, where [ph] Rise (28:16)
and Pilgrim reside, that will depend on the amount of capacity that's actually bid. I think you're familiar with the rules
up there in terms of limitations on capacity pricing for insufficient offers, that type of thing. But we are somewhat
bullish in that area, but it's going to – final pricing will depend on the amount of capacity actually bid in FCA 9.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. Just to make sure I heard you correctly, there's the potential for an insufficient
capacity in SEMA?
<A - Bill Mohl>: Yes. So, with Rest-of-Pool, there's a sloped demand curve. I don't believe that sloped demand curve
has been implemented in SEMA. So we would revert back to the insufficient competition, which would go back to net
CONE.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Great. Thank you.

<Q - Neel Mitra>: I had a question on the New England capacity market as well. Obviously, you have the Winter
Reliability Program, which is kind of a temporary fix. Do you see anything progressing going forward similar to what
PJM is doing with the capacity performance proposal to make sure that there's adequate fuel for the plants in that
region during the winter?
<A - Bill Mohl>: Well, Neel, I think we were hopeful to see that actually change for this winter. Frankly, we were
disappointed with the fact that they rolled the existing plan forward a year. But I believe FERC gave some pretty clear
guidance on – that that issue for the 2015-2016 winter timeframe needs to be addressed. So we are hopeful that we see
some progress there, that we move beyond something such as the oil backup reliability to a more market-based
approach, which properly values all resources that have adequate fuel supply.
<Q - Neel Mitra>: Okay, great. And then at your Analyst Day, you laid out kind of the lack of pipeline capacity going
into New England. Has your view changed with maybe some of the bigger projects that are being proposed out that
would come on late 2018, early 2019, or do you think that there's still a long shot for a lot of projects that would
actually bring gas into New England?
<A - Bill Mohl>: I don't think our overall point of view has changed. You've got the Spectra/Northeast Utilities JV,
you've got the Northeast Energy Direct. You have to keep in mind that those have not been subscribed. So we believe
that that could be a challenge just given overall economics. So we believe, at least in the foreseeable future, nothing's
going to change significantly. We'll continue to see a lot of volatility up in those markets. And at this point, those
projects that have been proposed are very questionable from our perspective.
<Q - Neel Mitra>: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Thank you.

And we will take our next question from Stephen Byrd with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: Good morning.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Stephen.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: I wanted to discuss transmission growth as you join MISO. I wonder if you could just talk at
a high level. I know this is an evolving situation, but are there certain signposts or upcoming things we should be
looking for to get a better sense of what's really going to be required to integrate your system into MISO?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Stephen, I'll start, and then I'll let Theo kind of jump in with the details. From a transmission
standpoint, we've – and obviously, we'll be giving updated investment opportunities and everything when we get out
next week. But we still see, based on our internal business, which is from all the reliability projects, projects associated
with the industrial growth, and demand that we see down here, projects that will be required when we build or acquire
new generating capacity and everything, obviously we've had a significant uptick over the last several years on our
transmission investment, and we would think that continues.
And that is before you get into the idea of what we've got now that we're in MISO. And there's really two broad areas
where – at least where we see things. We're already seeing some things that are there because now we've got a bigger
footprint and more generating capacity we have access to, that we can count on, given the way it's dispatched in MISO.
Plus then there'll be the Order 1000 issues and then even things that show up to integrate us with or MISO with the
region.
As far as – so we do see that there's some opportunities out there that we're already looking at, but more to come on that
front. Obviously, some of those are farther out in the picture than the near-term investments we have in our own
system, which are pretty substantial. Theo, I don't know if you want to add to that.

<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Well, I mean – yeah, I'll add a little bit to that, Leo. I mean, you made a comment in
terms of the path of our transmission spending. I mean, if you look back in 2010, we were probably spending
somewhere around $280 million or so on transmission. I think if you go forward, we're going to more than double that.
So, obviously, our level of transmission spending is increasing as it relates to MISO. MISO does have the study out
around their voltage and local reliability mitigation that could potentially drive transmission investment as well.
We've gone through the MTEP process for 2014. There were some projects that were identified within that process.
That process will also occur in 2015, and you could see some projects that were proposed in 2014 become part of the
2015 MTEP process as well. But I think one of the major drivers for us may not be so much MISO but, as Leo
mentioned, just the transmission associated with the economic development opportunities that we have. If you look at
our EGSL/ELL business combination filing, in some of the details in there, we talk about some of the opportunities that
might require transmission investment within the context of that. So, while there could be opportunities relative to
MISO, I think we see our transmission opportunity as somewhat broader than that.
<Q - Stephen C. Byrd>: That's very helpful. And I wanted to shift gears to Indian Point. Of late, has there been a
dialogue between Entergy and the state over approaches that can be taken, compromises et cetera, or is this playing out
primarily in the legal arena?
<A - Bill Mohl>: Stephen, we've had a number of discussions with various representatives of the state, but obviously
we continue to aggressively pursue our legal paths. But I think that's all I can say at this point in time.

And we will take our next question from Dan Eggers with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Hey, good morning, guys.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Dan.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Hey, just another really good quarter on the industrial demand side, even relative to probably
expectations this spring. How much of that is kind of maybe situational timing relative to what you would have
expected? And what point in time are you guys going to be in a spot to reconsider that underlying growth trend?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Theo.
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Dan, I'm not – this is Theo. I'm not sure I understood your question in terms of
situational. But I think when we look at where we are from an industrial growth perspective in the quarter, I think it's
coming from where we would somewhat expect it to. It's primarily coming from expansions in the kind of
petrochemical refinery area, and that's where we really expected to be at this point in time. If you look at one of the
slides – I'm not sure exactly which number it is – on the 1,700 megawatts we laid out at Analyst Day, I think in terms
of completed and signed projects we're at about 300 megawatts, and so we're really just getting started in that regard.
As it relates maybe to the second part of your question in terms of maybe changing expectations, I think we – right now
we still feel good about the 3.5% to 3.75% earnings growth through 2016. And while we continue to firm that up in
terms of what we see, as relates to the 1,700 megawatts, obviously we see movements in; we see movements out. We're
still comfortable with that. The question of multiplier effect, the issue of potential energy efficiency impacts on the
underlying intrinsic growth, we still think about. But with the puts and takes and ins and outs, I mean, I think from our
perspective, we're still comfortable with the 3.5% to 3.75% at this point in time.

<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Theo, I guess the corollary to that is the residential load hasn't been nearly as impactful, right?
And when do you guys see – or do you see the prospects for kind of the multiplier effect starting to show up in numbers
as these projects get done, and what should we be watching from the outside to see more uptake on that side?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: I don't think we're really seeing the impacts of the multiplier effect at this point. Again, I
mean, if you look at the slide, we've only got 300 or 1,700 megawatts that are signed and completed. I think if you look
at historically other areas, what they've experienced, I wouldn't say this type of industrial growth because I'm not sure
anybody's experienced it in recent history, but some type of industrial growth. Generally, the lag that you see in terms
of the multiplier effect happens maybe within a year or a couple years, year and a half after you really start to see the
impact of the industrial growth. So we're not quite there yet. And I think that's still to come. We'll see more signed and
completed projects as we move forward into 2015 and 2016. And so I think you will start to see the impacts of kind of
the trickle-down of multiplier affect more so 2015-2016 timeframe. But, again, we're also going to continue to see
impacts of our energy-efficiency programs as those are broadened within our service area.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. Thank you.

And we will take our next question from Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Yeah. Hi, good morning.
<A - Bill Mohl>: Good morning.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Question just on – in thinking about the huge industrial growth, when you're signing
contracts up with Cameron or Sasol or these different large customers, are you – is it mainly a demand-fixed payment
no matter how much the facility runs? Just thinking about – we don't know if one day these plants – if conditions could
change, they may not run as much, or less. Just how are you kind of locking in the risk of that?
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Theo?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: This is Theo. I mean, clearly there is a demand element to most of our larger industrial
contracts. And that's probably about as far as I'll go, as it relates to that. A lot of those contractual arrangements differ
from customer to customer. There are rate tariffs that are in effect for some of those service contracts. We also, in some
cases, we get facilities charges relative to the particular customer. But clearly there's more of a demand-based type
element to rate structures when you talk about those types of customers.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. As opposed to like a fixed payment?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Again, and some of it is just contractually specific to the customer.
<Q - Steven I. Fleishman>: Okay. Okay. And switching gears, and one thing we've started hearing from a couple
companies is some interest in looking at E&P reserves as something to put in rate base, and maybe as like a hedge for
customers relative to gas prices, as they're very low right now. Given that you guys have a pretty heavy gas fleet, is that
something you've considered and something that you might have interest in?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Yeah. This is Theo again, Dan (sic) [Steve]. It's something that our regulators have
historically looked at ways to hedge volatility of gas, I'm sorry – Dan, I meant Steve, I'm sorry. I still had Dan Eggers
on my mind for some reason. And as a matter of fact, the LPSC has an open docket right now to look at long-term gas
hedging opportunities. And one such opportunity might be to invest in gas in ground, and that could provide an
economic long-term physical hedge for our customers. So, yeah, it is something that historically we've had discussions
with regulators about and I think we'll continue to have discussions around.

And we will take our next question from Angie Storozynski with Macquarie.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Thank you. So I had a question about the growth in regulated earnings, and I understand
that you're going to be providing us updates during the EEI. But I was just wondering, this write-down of expenses
associated with the new nuclear plant, does it have any impact on the rate base, and should we have any worries that
your former or current growth trajectory for regulated earnings is going to be lowered?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: I guess, Angie, I'll answer the question in terms of impacts on rate base. The asset that
was written off was not in rate base in the Mississippi jurisdiction. So, no, it would not have any impact on our views of
rate base going forward. It really wasn't – I think you used the term "plant." I wouldn't describe it as a plant. I would
really describe it as more of some additional – some early stage cost associating with permitting and licensing
processes as we were looking at new nuclear opportunities in earlier years. So clearly not a plant that was in service per
se and not an element of rate base. So I would not expect it to have an impact on our views of our rate base growth.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Angie -
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: The reason I'm – yeah, I'm asking because we're missing the slide that you guys usually
have with the earnings growth for the regulated utilities.
<A - Bill Mohl>: I'm not sure which slide that is, Angie, but we'll certainly have that for you at EEI.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Okay. Okay. And then my other question is, so there's been clearly a movement – a
downward movement in forward power curves. Could you give us roughly a sense, if we were to mark to market the
EWC's earnings power, how much of a change would we see on these bars that you're showing for 2015 and 2016,
EBITDA for EWC?
<A - Bill Mohl>: Angie, I don't know if I can comment specifically on the dollar value. I think from our perspective
what we see is that for 2015, it's in line with our POV; 2016 may be slightly lower than our POV, and that widens as
you move further out in the curve. So essentially I don't think our point of view has changed much from what we
provided to you earlier in the year.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Leo P. Denault>: Thank you.

And we will take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Hey, guys, couple of questions. First of all, tax rate going forward, you talked about the
32% to 34% for 2015. Do you view that as a normal number, or do you see kind of taxes migrating back towards the
higher historical level over time?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: This is Drew. So we see it – as we've talked about in the past, we have a portfolio of
activities going on with the IRS and at the state levels, and it depends on the timing of audits and things like that. So
next year we see 32% to 34%. Beyond that, I think we are still talking about a statutory tax rate in our guidance and our
aspirations and outlooks and those types of things. So that's where we are for now.

<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. And on the regulated side, two questions. One, with Ninemile, how significant –
what's the best way to think about what that level of rate increase would be, and when is the earliest you could see that
actually go into effect?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Michael, this is Theo. Right off the top of my head, I don't have a specific number as it
relates to revenue requirements around Ninemile. Probably have to get that for you later, but clearly we would expect
that any rate change relative to that would go in effect at the time we see the plant coming online.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: And I'll just add that we've got a lot of AFUDC in earnings this year. And so you're not
going to see a big pickup next year when that plant comes online. It'll be maybe a nickel or so.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. And last question. Mississippi – as part of the rate deal and some of the other
negotiations with staff in the Public Service Commission, are you moving to more of a forward-looking formula rate
plan, kind of similar to what one of your large neighbors in the state has, or is that formula rate plan some kind of
hybrid or still historical looking?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: No, I think, again, Michael – this is Theo – what we have arrived at in agreement in the
stipulation is an FRP with what we call forward-looking features, which does allow us to look forward to some extent
to kind of calculate and set what we would view as revenue requirements associated with a period of time in the future.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: And then are there any restrictions on when you can next file to get an FRP-related revenue
increase?
<A - Theodore H. Bunting>: Not certain. I'll have to get back with you on that. I don't – obviously, we're going to
operate within the formula rate plan constructs that have been in place in Mississippi for years. I mean, that's what we
would expect. And my recollection is they don't necessarily have specificity as to whether you can get a rate increase,
by the same token, that formula rate plan has – obviously, it goes both ways. You could see rate decreases. So I'll have
to verify that. But just off the top of my head, I don't believe there's any specificity, any stipulation around not being
able to obtain a rate increase or on the contrary not necessarily experiencing a rate decrease.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. And my apologies, one last one. Cash levels at the end of the quarter were actually
pretty high. I mean, roughly $1 billion if you assume short-term investments as well. Is that just a timing issue in terms
of timeline of CapEx, or do you have a greater than expected cash balance that you can deploy to either the balance
sheet or investment opportunities?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: This is Drew. So it was a little bit elevated. We have a couple big tax payments coming up. I
think that's probably part of it.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. Okay. Thanks, guys. Much appreciated.

<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Just picking up on something you just said. Are you saying that, when you do your

that sort of going to be part of the 2015 number you guide to?

<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: No, what I was referring to was for 2015 when we provide that guidance on the fourth
quarter call, we would expect – at least as we look at it right now, we'd expect the effective tax rate reflected in that to
be in the 32% to 34%. As we talked about 2016 as an outlook, we've been talking – we've been using a normalized tax
rate for that timeframe.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay. So you're not changing your practice in terms of guidance on that front?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Correct.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay. And, secondly, you gave a number of $70 million on pension, and you mentioned
the updated actuarial, I guess mortality studies, and then the discount rate. How much of the $70 million, if you can
say, has do with the new actuarial study?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: It's probably – I can't remember the exact number, but it's around half, I think.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: I mean, roughly half. We usually give a rule of thumb around interest rates, and if you're
trying to get to that $70 million increase off of our expectations for pension expense this year, you're not going to make
it. And that's why we're talking about that piece.

Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Paul Fremont with Jefferies.
<Q - Paul B. Fremont>: Thanks. I'm looking, I guess, at your slide 24, which is the EWC EBITDA outlook, and it's
very close or right on top of the numbers I think that you provided on the second quarter conference call. But at the
time of your second quarter conference call, when you were talking about LHV capacity prices, you were sort of
showing a flattish outlook going into the fall. This time you're showing a fairly significant decrement. Is there
something to offset the decrement that we should be assuming that are keeping sort of these numbers equal to where
they were on the second quarter conference call? And if so, what would that offset be?
<A - Bill Mohl>: I think we'll have to get back to you. I don't have that – honestly, I don't have that in my head, Paul,
in terms of what that reconciliation would be. But we can follow up with you on that.

<Q - Andy S. Levi>: I'm all right. Just two clarifying questions. Just on Vermont Yankee on the $25 million. So that
we should consider operating earnings?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Yes. Yes. We're going to call that operational earnings next year. There will be some special
items associated with Vermont Yankee next year, and – that related to the decommissioning activities themselves, but
it'll be a small amount, and we'll highlight it. But on an ongoing basis, we will be living with the decommissioned
facility, and so we're going to switch that to operational.
<Q - Andy S. Levi>: Okay. And then also around Vermont Yankee, you mentioned I guess in prepared – I don't know
if it's prepared statements, but you said that at this point, I think, you didn't expect any escalation in prices, and I just
want to understand what that meant.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Escalation of contributions to the trust fund – is that what you're referring to? Or – ?
<Q - Andy S. Levi>: Exactly.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Okay. So -
<Q - Andy S. Levi>: And what's the definition of that, at this point? Meaning is that – at this point the next 10 years, or
at this point – ?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Well, as we look at where we sit with the trust and the expenses and our financing strategy
associated with all of that, we believe that we won't need to contribute anything to the trust. But that is – we have to
still submit here at the end of the year a post-shutdown decommissioning activities report to the NRC, and then they
have to sign off on it. So as we look at it today, we think that we're going to be just fine, but we still had to go through
that process.
<Q - Andy S. Levi>: Okay. And one last question just on the pensions, on the $70 million. And I would, I guess, put
the $25 million on Vermont Yankee in that, too. When you did your Analyst Day earlier in the year, were these
expenses contemplated when you kind of talked about your longer-term outlook?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: I think the Vermont Yankee mostly was, and some of the pension piece was, but interest
rates have fallen further since then. And so I think the pension expense is probably up a bit since then.
<Q - Andy S. Levi>: Great. Thank you very much. I'll see you for a beer down in Dallas.

And we will take our final question from Mr. Charles Fishman with Morning Star.
<Q - Charles J. Fishman>: Thank you. Just one question. Will the economic development pipeline slide that is
cumulative through 2016, will you roll that forward next year or next week?
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: You're talking about the 1,700 megawatts slide.
<Q - Charles J. Fishman>: Right, right.
<A - Andrew S. Marsh>: Yeah. So we've been looking at that particular slide, and we've gotten a lot of questions
about how to actually make that more useful. So we're rethinking it. We're not going to update it right now and roll it
forward another year, because we haven't completed – it's a 2013 to 2016 view. So we'd want to get through 2014
before we'd roll it forward, but we're still trying to figure out how we want to use that slide, if at all, or if in a different
format going forward.
<Q - Charles J. Fishman>: Well, it is an interesting slide. Okay. Thank you.
