MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the Caterpillar third quarter 2014 earnings results conference call.
At this time all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode and the floor will be open for your questions and
comments following the presentation.
Now I would like to turn the floor over to your host Mike DeWalt. Sir, the floor is yours.
Michael Lynn DeWalt
Hey, good morning everyone and we're very happy to have you with us this morning for our third quarter earnings call.
I'm Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar's Vice President of Strategic Services. And on the call the today I'm pleased to have our
Chairman and CEO, Doug Oberhelman and our Group President and CFO, Brad Halverson.
Remember this call is copyrighted by Caterpillar, Inc. and any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call
without the expressed written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript
we'll be posting it in the Investor section of our caterpillar.com website and it will be in the section labeled Results
Webcast.
Now this morning for sure we'll be discussing forward-looking information and that involves risks, uncertainties and
assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. A discussion
of some of the factors that either individually or in the aggregate we believe could make actual results differ from our
projections – that can be found in the Cautionary Statements under Item 1A Risk Factors of our Form 10-K filed with
the SEC in February of 2014 and our 10-Q filed with the SEC in August of 2014. And it's also in the forward-looking
statements language contained in this morning's financial release.

In addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures can be found in our financial release this morning. And again,
that's been posted on our website at caterpillar.com.
So let's get started. I'll be covering three things this morning: our third quarter results, the increase in our profit outlook
for 2014, and our preliminary outlook for 2015 sales and revenues. Now, before I get into the quarter though, I thought
it might be helpful to summarize just a couple of themes from this morning's financial release and the key points that
we were trying to get across.
And the first one is around stability and consistency. Last year at about this time, we provided our first view of 2014.
That was our preliminary outlook of sales and revenues for 2014 that we did with our third quarter release. Back then
we said it looked to us like 2014 would be a relatively flat year with 2013. That was the case then, that's about what's
happened through the first nine months of this year and that's still our full year view today. So, consistency.
The second point is around profit. While sales and revenues for the first nine months of both 2013 and 2014 have been
around $41 billion, profit per share is up year to date. And every quarter of this year it's been higher than the
corresponding quarter of 2013. Profit per share, so far through the first nine months of 2014, are $4.64 all-in and $5.03
excluding restructuring. And that's – both of those are up from the first nine months of last year which was $4.21. So,
while there are a number of puts and takes, the point is we've worked hard on operational execution and cost
management, and that's helped results.
Okay, with that let's turn to the third quarter. Sales and revenues were $13.5 billion and that was up about $100 million
from $13.4 billion in the third quarter of last year. While sales and revenues didn't change much, profit per share rose
from $1.45 last year to $1.63 this year, or $1.72 without restructuring costs. The increase in profit per share – in that
increase there were a number of puts and takes. On the positive side, prize realization was up. Currency impacts, both
in operating profit and below the line in other income and expense were positive. Our share count was lower, and that
was positive for profit per share as well.
On the other side, SG&A, R&D and manufacturing costs were a little higher. Positives included material costs which
were favorable but more than offset by higher employee incentive compensation, expense and a little higher warranty
costs. The incentive compensation increase is a result of 2014 performance being well ahead of the targets we set when
we started the year.
Now, results by segment. Energy and Transportation, sales were up $663 million, or about 13%. Their profit was up
$250 million or about 29%. Most of that sales increase was from improved volume. And in Energy and Transportation,
remember we have several different industries that we're serving: oil and gas, power gen, transportation – and that's rail
and marine, and industrial – and that's where we sell engines to other equipment manufacturers. Sales were up in all of
those industries. Oil and gas and industrial were up relatively in line with the segment average, transportation grew a
little faster than the segment average, and power gen a little less than the average. The profit increase for Energy and
Transportation in the quarter was largely a result of the higher sales.
Now for Construction Industries, sales were down $98 million but profit improved $194 million, or about 67%. Now
for sales, on the plus side, Construction had positive price realization. On the downside, volume was a little lower. And
most of that was from dealer inventory reductions as dealers lowered inventories a little more in the third quarter this
year than they did in the third quarter of 2013 for Construction. And user demand was also down slightly from the
absence of a large sale to the Brazilian Government that we had last year. And I mentioned that in our second quarter
financial release. We also had a little lower demand throughout most of Asia, including China, and weakness in the
Middle East and in the CIS. On the plus side, demand was up in North America and we had a small improvement in
Europe. The profit improvement was a result of the positive price realization, some of the currency impacts and
favorable manufacturing costs.
In Resource Industries, which is principally mining, sales were down $496 million, or about 19% from the third quarter
of last year. And profit was off $239 million or about 62%. The decline in sales was primarily lower volume. Price
realization wasn't significantly different one way or the other. The volume decline was largely a continuation of what
we've been seeing all year. While overall mine production has been good and many of the global mining companies are

improving their performance, their purchases of new equipment are at low levels. While sales this year are below last
year, the 2014 quarterly sales trend has been pretty stable with $2.1 billion in the first quarter, $2.2 billion in the second
quarter, and $2.2 billion in the third quarter; not a lot of change quarter to quarter as we progress through the year. The
decline in profit from the third quarter of last year was primarily the result of the lower sales. While profit in Resource
industries is down from a year ago, much like the sales, it's been in a fairly tight band throughout 2014. In the first
quarter profit was $149 million, second quarter was $133 million, and the third quarter was $147 million. Again,
similar to sales, it's been pretty stable but at a low level.
Our Financial Products segment revenues were up $44 million and operating profit was up $2 million, so not much
change from a year ago.
Now, before I move on to the outlook, I'd like to touch on the balance sheet and cash flow. We generated another $1.4
billion of Machinery and Energy and Transportation operating cash flow this quarter and are at $5.4 billion through the
first three quarters of 2014. Our balance sheet remains strong, with the Machinery, Energy and Transportation debt to
total capital ratio less than 35%, which is comfortably towards the low end of our desired range. Given the current
demand environment, we generally have the capacity we need and CapEx expectations this year are less than $2 billion.
Our strong cash flow has enabled us to repurchase $4.2 billion of stock so far this year. And we announced an increase
of 17% in the quarterly dividend last June. And we've maintained a healthy cash balance at about $6 billion with the
ability to invest.
With that, let's turn to the outlook. For 2014, we now expect sales and revenues to be about $55 billion, which was the
midpoint of our previous $54 billion to $56 billion outlook range. We have, however, increased our profit outlook for
the year. Previously at the $55 billion midpoint of our sales and revenues range, we expected profit of about $5.75 a
share, or $6.20 excluding the restructuring costs. We're pleased this morning to have announced that we've raised that
to $6.00 a share all-in and $6.50 excluding the restructuring costs.
Now, in addition to the outlook for 2014, as we typically do in our third quarter financial release, we've provided what
we call a preliminary outlook for next year's sales and revenues. As we look towards 2015, from an economic
perspective we think there's a reasonable likelihood that world economic growth could improve a bit in 2015. In the
developed countries, growth oriented monetary policies we think could support modest improvement. In developing
countries, several governments raised interest rates or constrained liquidity in 2013 to either control inflation or protect
exchange rates. And those measures slowed growth in 2014. More recently, interest rates in some of those countries
have stabilized and we've seen the first monetary policy easings in the third quarter of 2014.
In addition, we think there is some potential for increased investment in infrastructure, now particularly in countries
like United States if we could get a highway built, India and Turkey. Despite cautious optimism for improved global
economic growth, significant risks and uncertainties remain and that could temper growth in 2015. Political conflicts
and social unrest continue to disrupt economic activity in several regions; in particular in the CIS, Africa and the
Middle East. In addition, the Chinese Government's push for structural reform has slowed growth some, and the
ongoing uncertainty around the direction and timing of fiscal policy and monetary policy in the U.S. could temper
business confidence. As a result of all that, our preliminary outlook for 2015 sales and revenues is flat to slightly up.
Now one thing you won't find in this morning's release is a discussion about 2015 profit. That's typical for this time of
year. We start our planning process with sales. We provide a topline view of next year's sales with our third quarter
release. We complete our planning process in the fourth quarter and we'll provide a more complete view of 2015 in our
January release, along with our year-end 2014 results.
So in summary, profit per share was up in the third quarter. We had another good solid quarter of cash flow. Our sales
outlook for 2014 is similar to our previous outlook and we raised the profit outlook for 2014. Our preliminary outlook
for 2015 is flat to slightly up.
So with that, we're ready to take your questions.

Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you
very much. We'll take our first question from Ted Grace. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your question.
<Q - Ted Grace>: Hey, guys. Susquehanna. Congratulations on the quarter.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Thanks, Ted.
<Q - Ted Grace>: Mike, I know you said that you didn't want to give too much on, or really any guidance on
profitability, but could you speak to...
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: But you're going to ask anyway, right?
<Q - Ted Grace>: Well, no, what I was going to say is – as a starting point, could you frame out at least across the
three segments how you're thinking about each in the context of sales being flat to up slightly? Where would you have
the most optimism, the most caution, and maybe start there?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yes. I think in the scheme of things, our view around each of the segments is much like
the total. I don't think – we don't see big swings up or down, really, in any of the segments. It's always, as you know,
looking out that far, it's tough to always be exact. But – or ever be exact, I guess. But by and large we don't see a lot of
change going forward in any of the three segments.
<Q - Ted Grace>: Okay. And the second thing I was hoping to ask either you or Doug is one of the big initiatives
you've talked a lot about is making the company a lot more nimble and reactive to the demand environment that gets
served to the company, something that's outside your control. Can you just speak to the progress you've made in 2014
and how you think that sets you up for 2015? And to the degree you can talk about specific metrics, whether it's cycle
times or velocity, that would be great.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yes. That actually is, could be a quite long answer delving into operations. I think what
I'll do is kind of summarize it for you a little bit. We've – one of the key metrics that we have that kind of measures the
success or failure of that is the incremental operating profit pull through. We've had a target of around 25%, and we've
taken the actions needed to be flexible enough to achieve that. But embedded in that there, Lean helps if you improve
cycle times, that helps. We're down that path. But I think the ultimate measure of this is when either profit goes up or
goes down, do we have the flexibility to take costs out going down? And I think we've shown that we do.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: I'll just add to that, Mike – it's Doug here. And I agree with that completely. In terms
of really Lean manufacturing, Lean Six Sigma standard work, it's – I think we're still early in the process here. We've
probably got about a third of our sales, we're, manufacturing anyway, covered to some degree with where we want to
be in our first wave of Lean – really deep Lean manufacturing. In every one of those cases, whether it's a medium
wheel loader line in Aurora, Illinois, wheeled excavators in Grenoble, France – and I can go on – certainly Solar's a
good example of that, too. We've seen really tremendous improvements in quality, in throughput, in inventory, in
almost all metrics and we're encouraged. But there's a lot more work to do.
And as I've said to you all many times, we really expect to see the big chunks of this come in 2014 and 2015. I think we
saw some of that in some of the year-to-date numbers. We certainly have seen it in the quality of margins in the third
quarter. But in my mind, we've still got plenty of work to do on that. I also said earlier today that in a way, flat
production really gives us time. Flat production output gives us time to get to work on this. When things are booming,
it's hard to work on efficiency because we're trying to satisfy the market. In 2013 when the bottom fell out in Mining,
we're cutting costs at every moment and we really can't think about how we want to organize a manufacturing line.
Well, since mid-2012 or so, certainly into 2013 and now 2014 in Construction, and in Energy and Transportation, that
team has been doing that and it shows in the margins. Mining will be next. When Mining recovers, we'll really prove
what we can do with that because a lot of that work is being done now, too. So I think we've seen a down payment on it
but in my mind there's more to come.
<Q - Ted Grace>: Thanks, guys.

Thank you very much. We'll take our next question from Eli Lustgarten. Please announce your affiliation then pose
your question.
<Q - Eli S. Lustgarten>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Good morning.
<Q - Eli S. Lustgarten>: Can we first talk a little bit about the fourth quarter as we look out? I mean, you're giving us
guidance of about a little over $14 billion, and while I recognize there's about $0.15, $0.16 from lower taxes and
foreign currency in this quarter, your guidance, your midpoint of guidance, $1.47 or so for the numbers, can you give
me the bridge of why the fourth quarter will be – even with higher volume will be somewhat weaker profitability,
because you've been pretty stable in production, but pretty stable in profitability for the year.
Hello? Hello? [audio gap] (20:05-20:21)
Operator
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. Please remain on the line. We're going to get Mr. DeWalt reconnected.
One moment. [audio gap] (20:28-21:24 ) Okay, gentlemen. We are live.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Eli, could you ask it again? We got cut off. It was nothing personal.
<Q - Eli S. Lustgarten>: I was wondering whether I did something wrong or not.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Sorry.
<Q - Eli S. Lustgarten>: First question very quickly, on the fourth quarter you're guiding to a little bit over $14
billion. You've been very stable in production, very stable in profits almost for the year. Yet you're guiding us to lower
numbers in the fourth quarter on profitability. And I know there's $0.16 of lower taxes and benefits and some currency
in the quarter. Can you give us a bridge of what you're expecting in the fourth quarter that's different that drops the
profitability to under $1.50 from the $1.60 level that you've been doing?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yes. Yes, Eli, I will. You're right. With our fourth quarter outlook, or our full year
outlook, it's not too hard to turn that into a forecast for the quarter. And we do expect profit to be down a little bit in the
fourth quarter. A couple of the things that you mentioned, we had currency gains in the quarter and there are a lot of
things that we think we can do a decent job of forecasting and exchange rates is not one of them. So we don't – we're
not forecasting changes in exchange rates from here, so there's no continuation of the gains. We had a favorable tax
item in the quarter. That goes away as well. So those are two positives that were in the third quarter that won't be in the
fourth. We typically have seasonally higher costs in the fourth quarter. We're wrapping up the year and discretionary
spending tends to rise a bit. So that happens essentially about almost every year that I can remember since I have been
at the company. So we've got that worked in.
One other item probably of note is we expect a little bit of negative mix in the fourth quarter. We'll have a couple of
big, or a big electric power sale that we think will be completed in the fourth quarter at quite a bit lower margins than
the total. So I think I would say mix, seasonal costs and the absence of a couple of the favorable items from the third
quarter. That pretty much bridges it, I think.
<Q - Eli S. Lustgarten>: Okay. And can we talk a bit about the Construction Industries segment? You warned us in
the second quarter about lower emerging market business that's taking $1 billion out of production. But we're hearing
strong things, particularly in the U.S. in the quarter, we have emissions coming next year so that the dealers are saying
that they're having trouble even getting inventory out of Caterpillar for some of the demands that they would want. Can

you give us some insight of what you expect for the Construction Industries in the fourth quarter – particularly as you
go into next year because that should be one of the better segments, particularly in North America?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: I'll try and answer your question, but I'm going to try and answer another one that you
kind of touched on but didn't actually ask directly, and that's on inventories. Sometimes I think there's confusion around
dealer inventories. Since we sell through dealers, we frequently talk about changes in dealer inventory to kind of help
give a complete picture of what's going on. But just because inventories go up or down doesn't mean that they're, in and
of themselves that doesn't mean that it's well managed or poorly managed.
There are a lot of seasonal impacts that go on during the year. In Construction, for example, we had a sizable increase
in the first quarter in inventory. And that builds up for the spring and summer selling season and then it gets worked
down for the rest of the year. That happened in the third quarter of last year, that happened in the third quarter of this
year. Fourth quarter that usually tends to happen as well. Dealers tend to sell a little more than we ship them. So that
occurred in the third quarter. That will probably occur again next quarter.
In terms of Construction, it's a mixed bag around the world. We tend to – we live in the U.S. and we get influenced by
what we hear in the U.S. a lot. And that's been actually pretty positive – it's been quite a bright spot. Although I would
make the pitch that while it's better that doesn't mean it's great. We are I guess seven years, eight years now past where
the peak was, and that was 2006 and 2007. So we still have a ways to go to get to where we would think it's really
good. But it has been better.
In other parts of the world it's a little bit of a different story. And China's been weak. Our share there has been pretty
good and rising but that doesn't offset a weaker industry. Europe has been flat to slightly up for us, which I think is a
surprise to a lot of people. But again you have to think back to where it's come from and how low it got. My comment
about the U.S. not being back to peak goes even more so for Europe. There's a lot of room for Europe I think to
improve if they can ever get economic growth kicked back in there. So that's a little bit of a run down through the
world.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: Hi Eli, it's Doug here. I wanted to talk about the Tier 4 that you alluded to also. And
there's – we're in the throes of 2014/2015. By the end of 2015 virtually all construction equipment will have been – will
be Tier 4 Final compliant. And as we go through that, we're about halfway done, maybe a little bit more than that right
now in terms of individual models. That has, as we phase out of Tier 4 Interim and phase into Tier 4 Final, again it's
depending on horsepower, size or kilowatt class, that has doubled the degree of difficulty in some of those assembly
lines, certainly around implementation.
And we're seeing some of that availability go out, you mentioned you heard that from dealers, I do too. I would expect
that to continue for a little bit more but all of our product managers are all over it. And I suspect by the time we're done
with Tier 4 Final, the end of next year if not before, this will work its way through as well. We're really happy, by the
way, with the Tier 4 Final machines that are out there. A lot of them are running up a lot of hours and doing very, very
well in the marketplace. So as soon as we've worked through this bubble of the introductions, I think we'll like what
we'll see. But it is, it's a bit of a challenge right now. You are right.

<Q - Andrew M. Casey>: A couple of questions. First, on E&T margin performance, Q3 obviously very strong at
20.1%. You talked about volume helping the quarter and then a negative mix going forward into Q4 because of the
electric power contract. I'm just trying to understand whether – how to handicap the impact of presumably lower U.S.
locomotive sales in 2015 on mix. Was there positive mix in Q3 or was it all due to volume?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: No. Well there are several questions wrapped in there. If we take locomotives
specifically, no doubt next year is going to be lower. But that would, if you're just looking at locomotives that would
actually be a positive for mix. The margin of a locomotive would be not the same as the segment average. So, no, I
don't think that would have a – that would not have a negative mix impact next year. In fact, big sales of that in the
fourth quarter would likely have a – would be another reason that fourth quarter mix might be a little weaker.
I think it's probably a good time to take that whole rail sector and frame a bit how it could impact next year. Our view,
at least at this point, is that certainly locomotive sales will be down. But remember, our rail sector, or that industry, our
business there has more than just new locomotives. We have a very large service business and then we have a pretty
sizable parts business for locomotives. And we have a healthy international business that we expect to be up, actually,
next year. So overall our view is that rail will have a negative, but probably less than 2% impact on Energy and
Transportation next year. I hope that helps.
<Q - Andrew M. Casey>: It does, Mike. Thank you. And then if I could ask another question within E&T. There's
been a lot of concern about some recent changes in commodity prices as it relates to oil.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yes.
<Q - Andrew M. Casey>: Could you comment on maybe what percent of revenue is exposed to upstream production
for oil and nat gas? And then is there any point at which oil prices may start to impact demand? Thanks.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yes. That's a good question, Andy, and I know that that's certainly been on everyone's
mind with what's happened to oil prices over the last few weeks. And certainly lower oil prices aren't of particular help.
But they're about where they were right now a couple of years ago, and our business didn't fall apart two years ago in
oil and gas. So while it's not a big positive, we don't think it's going be a significant negative as well, at least not where
it's at now.
You asked a question about how low would oil prices have to go, and that's always kind of a sliding question. It would
depend a lot on where they were, how long they stayed – it's a very difficult question to answer. I can say that we're at
now kind of where we have been over the last – not last year, but a couple of years ago we were down at this level. And
again it wasn't all that negative. Remember the majority of our oil and gas business is gas compression and oil and gas
production and transmission. So production is a big driver in our business.
And also, particularly for our turbine business, it tends to be pretty long-term. The kind of projects that our customers
are doing are big; many of them multibillion dollar projects that go several years. And most of those big oil companies,
they understand that there are short term fluctuations in price. And on those big investment projects that they have in
flight, which would effectively be in our backlog at the moment, they generally don't change those based on short-term
fluctuations.
So all in all, I would say, we'd like to see a little higher oil price, but kind of where it's at now, we don't see it having a
big negative impact. One other just minor point, maybe around that, and that is the dividends that could play through
potentially in other parts of the business. When oil prices are down, there's usually a pretty direct consumer impact of
that; with people purchasing gasoline and the lower price of oil leads to a lower pump price, which puts a little more
money in everybody's pocket. So maybe that would be helpful for the economy overall.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: I just want to add here – it's Doug here again. And we're obviously watching oil and
gas prices very closely. We're talking to – trying to stay close to our customers on this and what they're saying, and I
think you're seeing their quarterly announcements come out. And generally, the impact – the feedback we've been
getting that say, mid-$80s – say $80 to $90, somewhere in there on a sustained basis, certainly will take the really
agitated top off of it. But there's still plenty of room for reinvestment. Like Mike said, it's still where it was a couple

years ago. I think if you'd see low $70s on a sustained basis there would be a chill across the market.
And I'd say gas coming down below $3, substantially on a sustained basis may do that as well. The other wild card here
that we're really anxious about and looking forward to is Mexico opening. And that – the oil and gas industry there is
about to go. We're confident it will. They've passed laws down there. They've made changes in the industry. That's
going to go at almost any oil or gas price. So there's so many moving parts on this all over the world that it's just hard to
predict. But basically, in the U.S., mid-$80s we think is on a sustainable level we can all live with.

Thank you very much. We'll take our next question from Ann Duignan. Please announce your affiliation then pose your
question.
<Q - Ann P. Duignan>: Yes. Good morning. JPMorgan.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Good morning, Ann.
<Q - Ann P. Duignan>: Morning. I think just following up on that theme. One of the things that Komatsu has said
recently, and not to quote a competitor, but I'd be interested in your comments on it, is that a lot of their construction
equipment is being supported by domestic oil and gas also. Can you talk about that a little bit, Doug, and then what
indirect impact might that have if oil prices were to fall to the low $70s?
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: Yes. Yes, sure, Ann. And I think that's right. We do see – we've seen everything from
pad preparation to road building around all the shale zones in the country. And that has impacted, to some degree, our
construction equipment. I don't think it's probably going to move the needle. I don't think it's material. But it would
certainly impact that a little bit in our case. Again, we get down to low $70s, a lot of bets are going to change on a lot of
things. And there's no doubt that would be impacted to some degree. I would agree with that.
<Q - Ann P. Duignan>: So in your view, Doug, most of the increase in construction equipment as you're seeing now
in dealers are pure resi and non-resi construction driven?
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: I'd say yes, it's across the table. I mean, across the board, yes. Yes.
<Q - Ann P. Duignan>: Okay.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: Certainly the fracking site preparation has been a help. But boy, we're seeing kind of
across the board steady growth. Lower than we'd like, but steady growth in the other businesses as well for construction
equipment.
<Q - Ann P. Duignan>: Okay. Thank you. And then just a clarification on your outlook for 2015. You said in the U.S.,
you are hopeful that we would get a highway build. Is that included in your outlook, or would that be upside to your
outlook?
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: I don't know if I said I was hopeful, but I said it could be upside. But there is a
possibility, and it depends on a lot of things in Congress. I think in terms of India, we're definitely going to see
infrastructure spending increase at a significant rate. We mentioned Turkey in the write up. I'm also optimistic in
Brazil, although there's an election there this weekend, but both candidates, both parties are talking about reflating the
economy. And Brazil has always used infrastructure as a way to do that. In our case, we could see some kind of either a
steady extension of what we're doing, or a bit up as Congress tries to stimulate the economy or do what they do. But I
wouldn't say I'm hopeful, but it could happen. I'd put it that way, Ann.

<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yes. Ann I made the comment a few minutes ago, and I think there have been a lot of
elections this year. I mean the one in the U.S. is coming up. So hopefully we'll have a window where the government
can work together to make some progress before the next election.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: Yes. Yes.
<Q - Ann P. Duignan>: In a lame duck session, indeed.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: No. I don't think would happen in a lame duck, although anything can happen. I
would say it's more going into a post-election in 2015 as maybe there's some consensus to try to get after job creation,
grow the economy faster. That could push on some element of tax reform a little bit and infrastructure. Those would be
the two things that have an outside chance of something happening. Bigger than right now, but I'm not going to call it.
It's going to happen.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Back to your original point, Ann. We're not counting on a big...

Operator
Thank you very much. We'll take our next question from Seth Weber. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your
question.
<Q - Seth R. Weber>: Good morning. It's RBC. Mike, on the – it sounds like you've bumped up your restructuring
costs expense a little bit this year to $450 million from $400 million. And it sounds like that's targeted at the Mining,
the Resource business. Can you give us any color on the incremental details or where you're stepping up the spending
there?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yes. Actually, I won't point to any one thing. We started the year by saying $400
million to 500 million. And some of the projects we understood very specifically. Some were being studied and that
was the reason we had a range. There were some that we might do, some that we might not do. Last quarter our
estimate was closer to $400 million. So we kind of revised it down a little bit. That estimate right now is closer to $450
million, so there are a couple more things that we're doing. None of them are material. None of them would we want to
call out separately. About the only thing we've talked about separately that individually is pretty material is the
European restructuring we did in Construction. So again, we started out the year saying $400 million to $500 million,
and I think we're going to basically come in there.
<A - Douglas R. Oberhelman>: But just to clarify, the vast majority of that is not Resource Industries or Mining. It's
in and around the Construction equipment business. In fact, Resource Industries' restructuring in 2014 of the $450
million, is one of the smaller pieces.
<Q - Seth R. Weber>: Okay. Thanks for that clarification. And then just on the performance of the business I think
you called out the Mining, the aftermarket parts sales were down. Can you talk about any color on the aftermarket order
activity in the Resource business?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: For us, sales and orders are pretty much the same thing. We turn around parts orders,
usually in about 24 hours so there's no significant backlog there. So one is about the same as the other. For the
company overall, parts sales were positive and I think seem to be starting to build some momentum. And that's a good
thing.

Thank you very much. We'll take our next question from Stephen Volkmann. Please announce your affiliation then
pose your question.
<Q - Stephen E. Volkmann>: All right. Excuse me. Good morning, guys. It's Jefferies. And I'd like to actually like to
go back. Doug, you were just talking about the restructuring that was mostly done in Construction. And I guess I was
under the impression certainly that the first half of 2014 Construction margins were probably over-earning a little bit.
You guys built a fair amount of inventory I think. And so I guess I had assumed that those numbers were not something
I should think about as we move forward, and yet there's a fair amount of restructuring going on here. I guess I'm just
having trouble trying to parse out how much of the restructuring has permanently improved those Construction margins
and how much you had temporary things going on in 2014.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yes. I'll answer that. This is Mike. So we're talking about Construction here.
<Q - Stephen E. Volkmann>: Yes.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: So in 2014, I think – this is maybe an odd way to say it, but I think Construction is a
little bit – this is probably not the right choice of words, but more back to normal. If you go back to starting in late 2012
and throughout much of 2013, in Construction, we were reducing inventory, both ours and dealers', and that had
negative impacts on production. It was – made price realization tougher. So I think 2013 was a very tough year for
Construction because of that. So – and I think this year, if you look at dealer inventory changes, I mean, there's been
changes by quarter, but by and large they're likely to end the year about where they started. Production levels are kind
of matching demand, in other words, and have been pretty stable. To the point that Doug made earlier, that's really
helped efficiency, and we don't have the downward changes, if you will. And in fact, you see part of that in their price
realization this quarter versus a year ago.
I think in terms of the restructuring charges, there's a little bit of benefit in this year. But again, much of it is around
restructuring our Belgium facility, and some of the benefits are in this year and more will be added in next year a bit
and then after. So I think there's more to come in terms of restructuring benefits for Construction.
<Q - Stephen E. Volkmann>: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then can you just update us, Mike? I thought I
remembered you were going to try to reduce inventories in Construction. Maybe it was more broad than that, but
something like $800 million this quarter and in Q4, and it looked like maybe you didn't quite get there. Can you just
talk about how you feel about all that?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yes. Yes, again, this goes back – what we're talking about here is dealer inventory. Last
quarter we said we thought that dealer inventory was going to come down somewhere around $800 million. And this
quarter dealer inventory went down $600 million. Now I would call that, given your ability to forecast of that all the
moving parts of that side actually pretty good. I think it's directionally what we thought it was going to be, and I think
the fourth quarter is probably going to be directionally what we thought it would be. And it's a couple of things. Part of
it's seasonality, Construction adds to inventory.
There's not a – if you think about the Northern Hemisphere where you're in winter, there's not a lot of activity going on
then. And so we tend to produce more and dealers tend to stock up. You can kind of smooth load things a little bit

better. And then it gets sold throughout the rest of the year. That's pretty common. That's happened. That's happened
this year. We've had absolute reductions that I wouldn't call seasonal in Mining and that has continued. Although the
reductions are a little bit maybe less than they were a year ago, that dealer inventory is coming down. And it's at a
pretty low level right now. If I look at dealer inventory overall, I would say it's in pretty – barring the seasonal changes
that occur – I would say it's in pretty good shape. We do not have a dealer inventory problem per se.
<Q - Stephen E. Volkmann>: Okay. I appreciate it.
Operator
Thank you very much. We'll take our next question from David Raso. Please announce your affiliation, then pose your
question.
<Q - David M. Raso>: ISI Group. Good morning. The questions on oil and gas, the order book – can you give us some
feel for where the order book is year-over-year and how far does it extend into 2015? And also how you're
extrapolating that order book when you lay out your 2015 sales guidance?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yes. Okay, David. So I would say overall – and this is one of the industries where we
actually do have a little bit better visibility than, say, Construction, where relative to sales, the order book is usually a
little less. It turns over quicker. I'd say it's pretty healthy. In fact, if you look at Solar, it's not – it's actually roughly
where it was a year ago. It's not changed much during the year. If you look at the rest of Energy and Transportation in
the reciprocating engine piece of it, it's up. We had a nice increase in the third quarter and I'd say it's at pretty healthy
levels.
When we forecast next year, we don't just look at the backlog and forecast forward. It's more like we're out there trying
to figure out what we think will actually happen in terms of sales. And then we use the backlog as maybe a reality
check to see if that makes sense. So I would say for Energy and Transportation, we still have a pretty good backlog.
<Q - David M. Raso>: And to be clear though, oil and gas within E&T was my question. So can I take the
reciprocating comment as similar to what you have in oil and gas, up on recip and flat on Solar?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Well, yes. So what I would – I gave you Solar, because that's mostly Oil and Gas. The
recip – or remember, think factories. We build engines, they get sold into different applications. So the data that I see
around backlog is around product, not end market necessarily. So, but I would tell you I think anecdotally, a lot of the
strength has actually been oil and gas.
<Q - David M. Raso>: Okay. And then lastly on the puts and takes for 2015, I know we're not giving an earnings
guidance, but just trying to think of the moving parts, things we've said in the past. Do they still stand for restructuring
savings for next year? Any carryover or incremental benefits from repo? The short-term incentive comp, I know you
bumped it up to $1.3 billion today for this year. Just trying to think about those puts and takes, maybe even a comment
on pension. Just something to frame the puts and takes for the 2015 earnings model.
<A - Bradley M. Halverson>: Yeah, David, this is Brad Halverson. I'll take a shot at this without giving you guidance
for 2015, but try to tell you how we think about it internally. We remain very committed to our pull-through targets and
operating profit of 25% on the way up and 25% or 30% on the way down. We've demonstrated that, demonstrated as
well this year with our profit being up year-to-date, with sales being down. And that's driving focus across all the units
in terms of restructuring, Lean. I'd say also [audio gap] (50:48 – 51:00).
Operator
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, and please remain on the line. We're going check the line once again so
please remain on the line. Thank you very much [audio gap] (51:04-51:53).

<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: David, we lost the line again. We're not sure why. I'm not sure how far we got before
we lost you.
<Q - David M. Raso>: Brad, if you can hear me, I basically – you, talk about a little bit beyond the comment of
incrementals, 25% on the way up, 25% to 30% on the way down, and just how the segment's...
<A - Bradley M. Halverson>: Yeah, yeah, I was just trying to give you – yeah, a flavor of how we're looking at it
without giving guidance. And if I repeat something, we'll just do that since we're starting over here.
But, yeah, we talked a little bit about being nimble earlier. Somebody made the comment. We feel that internally, and
we think it's driving our flexible cost structure. It's driving our delivery around incrementals and decrementals. Again,
we're happy that profit is up with sales actually being down on a year-to-date basis. And so it's driving the Lean
initiative, it's driving the restructuring efforts division by division, and it's driving I would say a pretty strong supplier
collaboration as we look to improve our margins. And so if we look out to next year, we have targets across each of our
segments for incremental and decremental margins. If we were to get some sales growth next year, as we said, sales
could be flat to up slightly, assuming we get some sales growth we remain committed to that 25% incremental
pull-through.
I think the other question, you had commented about pension, and we wouldn't see much of a change in pension
year-over-year in terms of our pension costs.
<Q - David M. Raso>: Obviously flat sales or sales don't move up or down much. Incrementals are a little less telling,
right? It's a...
<A - Bradley M. Halverson>: Right.
<Q - David M. Raso>: It's off a small number. I think what we're just trying to figure out, we used to speak of
restructuring savings over time being $400 million to $500 million with a lot of, I mean a lot of the savings after 2015
would be significant. But even 2014 I think we used to speak of maybe a couple hundred million dollars of savings.
Trying to think what that number could be in savings for next year. Again trying to think through the repo. We can all
make our own projections around sales, but we're just trying to think of non-volume sensitive items.
<A - Bradley M. Halverson>: Yes. I think in terms of kind of giving more guidance again, if you look at this year, and
you look at our original outlook; again we've been pleasantly surprised with some operational items. Particularly on our
margins. And we've also been helped in the last quarter by currency. But I think clearly on an operational basis, we're
really happy with where our margins are relative to flat sales, and we see them moving forward, we see to be absolutely
committed to the 25% pull through. Which we think is a pretty good number.
<Q - David M. Raso>: All right. I appreciate the...
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: David, we're not trying to be tricky on profit. We just didn't make a profit outlook. And
we're trying really hard not to give all the pieces that make a profit outlook for next year. That doesn't mean that it's
terrible. That doesn't mean that it's great. It just means that we didn't give an outlook.
<Q - David M. Raso>: Can you at least, the one thing though, there were restructuring savings that we used to speak to
$400 million or 500 million by exiting 2015, how much of those savings do you think you'll have captured in 2014?
And at least some concept of 2015? Just on that one item?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yes. I think, I suspect we'll talk more about that in January. We have savings in 2014.
And we'll certainly have more in 2015.
<Q - David M. Raso>: Okay. I appreciate it. All right. Thank you.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Okay.

Thank you very much. We'll take our next question from Steven Fisher. Please announce your affiliation, then pose
your question.
<Q - Steven M. Fisher>: Great. Thanks. It's UBS. Can you guys talk about how the rental channel is influencing your
Construction sales in 2014? And how do you see that in 2015? And then I guess, how is demand in Construction
outside the rental channel?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Wow. That's a good question. Actually rental has been affecting the business. I would
say increasingly for I don't know 10 years, 15 years. And particularly when times are more uncertain, customers have a
tendency to rent more. Remember, we tend to not sell through rental houses. We sell to CAT dealers who are in the
rental business. And we've had, particularly in the U.S., we've had positive sales through the rental channel, and
positive sales through the end user owner channel. I don't think there's anything out there that is driving a big structural
change that impacted 2014, or that will drive a big directional change in 2015. But I think it is true that as customers
get more and more focused on asset utilization, the rental channel can be more attractive. That's why we're big time in
the rental business. It's a key element of the Across the Table initiative. I mean, it's a definite part of the channel and
here to stay.
<Q - Steven M. Fisher>: Okay. So both channels it sounds like are up this year, is that right?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yeah. Well, for North America.
<Q - Steven M. Fisher>: Right. Sure.
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yeah.
<Q - Steven M. Fisher>: And then, Mike, you mentioned a lot of room for growth in European Construction. How do
you feel about the visibility of European Construction right now? Is there your base case for next year that that's maybe
flat?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yes. So when you look at Construction, and I kind of touched on this a little bit a bit
ago. You don't, there are two parts of the business. Parts for example, where we have little to no backlog, because we
get an order, we ship it. We get an order, we ship it. So it's not the kind of thing that lends to a lot of visibility based on
a backlog. And Construction is a little bit like that, too. Generally when a customer or when a dealer orders kind of on
average, they get it in a few months. So the backlog isn't quite like it would be for maybe a big turbine or a big mining
truck.
So again I would say in Construction, we forecast based on what we think is going to happen economically, where the
market is relative to replacements. We look at where dealer inventory – we take in a lot of factors. Backlog and short
term visibility don't play into Construction or parts sales at all as much as they do in some of the other parts of the
business. So I guess bottom line – that was a long winded answer to say within Construction, it's normal not to have a
lot of concrete visibility through a backlog.
<Q - Steven M. Fisher>: So the baseline probably would be about flat as your expectation for next year in Europe?
<A - Michael Lynn DeWalt>: Yes. I think that's the case for all of our – this is a worldwide comment. But for all of
our segments, we said flat to slightly up next year. We don't see either Energy and Transportation, Construction or
Resource Industries being kind of far from that. It looks pretty flat to up a little for much of the business.
<Q - Steven M. Fisher>: Terrific. Thank you very much.
Michael Lynn DeWalt
All right. We're at the top of the hour so we'll sign off. Thank you very much for joining us on the conference call
