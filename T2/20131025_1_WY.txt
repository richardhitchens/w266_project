third quarter earnings of $157 million or $0.27 per diluted share on net sales of $2.2 billion. This is a 34% increase in
earnings compared with third quarter 2012 and a 28% increase in adjusted EBITDA compared with year ago levels.
Let me now turn to our business segments, starting with Timberlands, charts 2 to 4. Timberlands contributed $118
million to earnings in the quarter, up $4 million from second quarter 2013 as the contribution from a partial quarter
from the Longview timberland acquisition mostly offset a smaller than expected seasonal decline in earnings in the
company's legacy Western operations. In addition, non-strategic Timberlands dispositions were up modestly in the
quarter. In the West, log sale realizations were down in both domestic and export markets. Fee harvest from legacy
Western lands was seasonally lower and as expected road and silviculture expenses increased in the quarter. In the
South, log sale realizations in the third quarter were flat compared to the second quarter, and fee harvest volumes were
up modestly.
We continue to be excited about our acquisition of the Longview timberland and are fully engaged in leveraging our
silviculture, logistics, and marketing expertise to realize the full potential of this outstanding asset. This transaction
closed on July 23 and contributed $16 million in earnings and $26 million in EBITDA in the quarter. Going forward,
we will be focused on maximizing the earnings and cash flow from all our timberlands.
Wood Products, charts 5 and 6. Wood Products contributed $79 million to earnings in the quarter, down from $136
million in the second quarter, but above the $59 million of earnings from third quarter 2012. Average sales realizations
for OSB declined 26% in third quarter 2013 compared with second quarter 2013, and realizations for lumber fell by
approximately 7%. The effect of these lower prices was somewhat offset by higher sales volumes across all product
lines and lower log cost in the West.
Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $110 million. In lumber EBITDA was down $26 million in the third quarter
compared with the second as lower prices were partially offset by higher volumes and lower log cost, especially in the
West.
In our lumber operations we're focused on continuing to drive down our cost structure and improve our margins. In
OSB, EBITDA was down by approximately $42 million in the quarter compared with the second quarter, and
significantly lower prices were partially offset by higher volumes and lower firewood cost. We continue to be focused
on lowering manufacturing cost and delivering high margin products to our growing customer base in this business.
Engineered Wood Products generated EBITDA of $16 million in the quarter compared with $7 million in the second
quarter of 2013. This improvement was due to higher prices and volumes and lower cost. We're committed to
continuing to improve the operating performance of this business.
The Distribution business remained challenged in the quarter as they worked through higher-price commodity
inventory. We expect improved results from this business in the fourth quarter due to our performance improvement
initiatives.
Cellulose Fibers, charts 7 and 8. Cellulose Fibers contributed $47 million in the quarter, down from second quarter
2013 as higher-than-anticipated costs associated with the scheduled shutdown of the liquid packaging board facility,
higher fiber cost associated with wet weather in the South, and higher chemical cost in the quarter more than offset
slightly higher pulp realizations due to mix.
We're focused on three priorities in this business. First, we will continue to drive down our cost through operational
excellence. Second, we will focus on developing new specialty products to improve our margins. And finally, we will
continue to support our growing global customer base. Our ramp up of our new modified fiber facility in Gdansk,
Poland is going well.
Real estate, charts 9 to 11. WRECO reported solid results as real estate contributed $33 million of earnings in the
quarter, more than double the contribution during the second quarter. Single-family closings increased seasonally by
nearly 21% over the second quarter and margins improved to 22.3% as margins increased due to previously
implemented price increases. As Patty will share with you in more detail in just a moment, we expect a very strong
fourth quarter in this business with closing volume increasing nearly 50% in the fourth quarter compared with the third

quarter.
In a moment I will come back with some general comments on markets, but let me now turn it over to Patty to
specifically address our fourth quarter outlook.
Patricia M. Bedient
Thanks, Doyle, and good morning, everybody. The outlook for our fourth quarter earnings is summarized on chart 13,
and I'll begin the outlook discussion with timberlands. In the West, export realizations are expected to be comparable to
the third quarter on higher sales volumes, primarily as a result of including a full quarter's operation of the Longview
acquisition.
Domestic realizations are expected to increase slightly. Lower sales volumes from our legacy Western ownership will
be offset by increases from the Longview acquisition. Fee harvest in the West is expected to increase by about 10%,
and Longview accounts for most of this increase. Costs are anticipated to be lower in the West due to decreased
silviculture spending.
In the South, realizations are expected to be slightly lower due to mix. Fee harvest is expected to increase on a seasonal
basis. Logging costs are anticipated to increase due to a slightly longer hauling distance this quarter.
Silviculture costs will also increase due to the timing of treatment. Sales of non-strategic timberlands are anticipated to
be modestly lower. Overall, earnings in the Timberland segment are expected to be comparable to the results in the
third quarter.
In Wood Products, the fourth quarter is traditionally one of the weakest earnings quarters of the year as we close out the
building season and mills prepare to perform minor maintenance and capital projects during the slower holiday season.
As a result, we expect to see lower sales volumes across most product lines and flat to potentially softening prices as
we progress through the quarter. We continue to focus on controlling inventories and matching supply with demand,
while driving further operational improvements.
We anticipate that log costs will increase in both lumber and oriented strand boards. Earnings in the Wood Products
segment are expected to be lower in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, but still above the $38 million we
earned in the fourth quarter of last year.
In Cellulose Fibers pulp realizations are continuing to move up and shipment volumes are also expected to increase
modestly. Worldwide inventories of softwood pulp are well balanced and exchange rates are favorable. Maintenance
expense should be lower as we have fewer days planned for maintenance outages. We anticipate higher productivity
and decreased chemical costs during the quarter. We expect that earnings in the Cellulose Fibers segment will increase
significantly during the fourth quarter compared to the third.
In Real Estate, we opened eight new communities in the third quarter and we expect to end the year with the
community count in the mid-80s, which compares to 62 communities at the end of last year. At the end of the third
quarter of this year, our backlog of homes sold but not closed was 1,435, an increase of 36% compared to a year ago.
Although we have seen some weakness in consumer confidence driven by the current uncertainty of governmental
actions, we continue to believe that we will see improved results as housing recovers.
During the fourth quarter, we expect to close over 1,100 homes or approximately 35% higher than the fourth quarter a
year ago. The average price per closing is projected to be higher than the third quarter with gross margins between 21%
to 22%. Selling costs will increase as a result of the additional closings. We also expect earnings from land and lot sales
to be comparable to the third quarter. Overall, fourth quarter earnings in our Real Estate segment is expected to
increase significantly compared to the third quarter.
I'd like to touch on unallocated items and unallocated items are shown on chart 12. During the third quarter, we had a
very large positive adjustment for the elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO. This is the result of
reductions in inventory primarily in Wood Products. We do not expect the fourth quarter adjustment to be of the same

magnitude.
Now, I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments. I'll be referencing numbers on chart 14 for these comments.
We ended the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $900 million comparable to the second quarter, excluding
cash associated with the financing of the Longview timberland acquisition. In July, we purchased the equity of
Longview Timber for $1.58 billion in cash and assumed debt of approximately $1.1 billion.
During September, we issued $500 million of new debt, and earlier this month we borrowed an additional $550 million
under a term loan, which together with cash on hand were used to repay the debt assumed in the acquisition. As a result
of the early repayment of the assumed debt, we will have a charge for early extinguishment of approximately $24
million in the fourth quarter. Debt repayments for the third quarter, exclusive of the acquisition, totaled $163 million.
Fourth quarter maturities are approximately $69 million. After the fourth quarter, we have minimal maturities until
2017.
In addition, during the third quarter, we replaced our existing revolving credit agreement with a new $1 billion
agreement that does not expire until 2018. There are no borrowings outstanding under this agreement. Capital
expenditures including reforestation for the third quarter was $76 million, bringing our year-to-date expenditures to a
$179 million. We still anticipate spending for the full year to approximate $300 million.
Now I'll turn the call back to Doyle and I look forward to your questions.
Doyle R. Simons
Thank you, Patty. In terms of markets, and specifically housing markets, we continue to be encouraged as long-term
favorable housing fundamentals remain in place. With that said, the housing recovery appears to have taken a slight
pause due to higher home prices, higher interest rates, although still very low by historical standards, slowing job
growth and the antics of our government. However, we continue to believe we're in the early stages of a longer-term
return to trend levels of housing starts.
Forecasters now [indiscernible] (14:02) there will be approximately 950,000 U.S. housing starts in 2013 and
somewhere between 1.1 million and 1.2 million starts in 2014. The housing starts long-term average is north of 1.5
million units, so there's still a lot of runway in front of us. We're focused on driving ROI and cash flow to capitalize on
the upturn as well as appropriately positioning ourselves for the future.
On that note, we will host an investor meeting in New York on December 17. In that meeting, we will address where
Weyerhaeuser is today, where we're going, and what we're doing to make this a truly great company for our
shareholders. We look forward to sharing our thoughts and plans with you at that time. Later this morning, we will put
out a notice containing the details of the meeting.
Finally, regarding our previously announced process to explore a range of strategic alternatives for WRECO, we are
fully engaged in the process, continue to be encouraged by the interest in this business, and we'll be back to you when
the process is completed. Until then, as I'm sure you'll understand and appreciate, we will not have any further
comment on the strategic review.
With that, we will now open it up for questions. Operator?

be the primary metrics that you focus your team on or are there any other metrics that we should be aware that you can
discuss at this juncture that you will be using to gauge the progress of the company?
And then you mentioned a couple times, certainly within Wood Products and I think also within Cell Fibers that you
are focused on lowering manufacturing cost, to paraphrase, at this juncture – to the point, to the extent that you can
comment where you see the opportunities to do that?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Well, good morning, George, and thanks for the question. I would say in terms of your first
question, clearly ROI and cash flow will be key metrics for our company going forward. But I wouldn't say they'll be
the sole metric, but clearly those will be key metrics for our company going forward. We look forward to our
conversation on December 17 at which time we will provide hopefully a lot more clarity on, again, where we are,
where we're going, how we're going to get there, and how we'll measure our progress along the way.
In terms of Wood Products, one of the things we are focused on throughout the company will be to continue to drive
down our cost, and specifically our manufacturing cost. What we're looking forward to doing is delivering high-quality
products to our customers, products that our customers want and are willing to pay for, and doing that at the lowest
possible cost. So that will clearly continue to be a focus for Weyerhaeuser going forward.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Doyle, maybe the follow-on, and I'll turn it over, do you see the opportunity more driven by
process or by needing to maybe put in more investment or some other factors as well? And then just quickly and I'll
turnover, should we expect that your overall operating profit in WRECO in 4Q is up versus last year's level? Thank
you.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yes, I'll address the first question and then I'll ask Patty to address your second question,
George. But in terms of opportunity, I think it's all of those things you listed. I mean, it will be process, it will be – we'll
look at opportunities to drive down costs across the board. Again, what we're focused on is producing high-quality new
products for our customers and doing that at the lowest possible cost. So we'll be looking for opportunities to do that.
Some of those opportunities will require some capital, some of those will not. With that, let me ask Patty to address
your second question.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: So, George, your second question I think was profit in WRECO this quarter compared to a
year ago, fourth quarter compared to a year ago?
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Right.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Yes, I think that the thing that swings from quarter-to-quarter is that – and I don't
remember fourth quarter a year ago how much we had in terms of land sales and lot sales in the fourth quarter. Our
single-family home building business will be very strong in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to 2012.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Okay.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: And I think as I mentioned in the comments that at this point we would expect a
comparable amount of land and lot sales, although as you know they're quite lumpy, but comparable to the third
quarter, which I think was about $9 million.
<Q - George L. Staphos>: Okay. Thank you very much.

<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: I guess just starting on the near-term outlook for housing. When you talk about consensus
numbers of 1.1 million to 1.2 million next year and kind of what you're seeing from the market and hearing from your
customers, how much confidence do you have that consensus has it right?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah, and as you know, predicting housing numbers is always a little difficult, Gail. I would
tell you that when you step back and look at the long-term fundamentals, we continue to be very bullish on housing. As
I mentioned, there has been a slight pause here due to a lot of factors, but clearly in my mind we'll continue to have an
upward trend in housing as we start to approach the 1.5 million to 1.6 million average over the next few years. And I
don't know exactly what the slope of that line is going to be. I think it has flattened a little bit just because of the issues
that I raised. But we'll see how it plays out, but I think in my opinion the 1.1 million to 1.2 million is a pretty good
guess at this point in time.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. And I mean the pause that you're seeing, I mean how significant was it? I mean it
looks like WRECO buyer traffic was down pretty significantly. Was that a seasonal or was that reflective of the
uncertainty that we saw rise with interest rates coming up in DC?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: I think it was a combination of both, Gail. I think clearly, again, as we had the shutdown from
the government, as we had the prices go up in houses and some other factors, we saw a pause, but again I think pause is
the right term. I don't want to overstate the pause. And again, if you look at the underlying fundamentals, they continue
to be strong and in place and I think will drive housing going forward.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. And just a quick question on engineered wood, given what's been going on in terms
of the input costs, do you see the recovery as sustainable or at some point would you expect to see some price pressure
emerge as customers kind of start pressuring you given some of the costs at least for lumber and OSB pricing?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: I think in that business, as we mentioned, we saw a nice improvement in the quarter, Gail.
Now, there will still be seasonal factors that will have an impact. And as Patty outlined, fourth quarter is a slow
seasonal quarter. But longer-term, that's a business that we're encouraged by what we've seen on the pricing front.
Probably need additional pricing going forward, but more importantly we're focused on our operations and making sure
that we provide on a cost-effective basis the products that our customers need.
<Q - Gail S. Glazerman>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citibank.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Good morning.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning, Anthony.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: In Wood Products you talked about your expectation for improved distribution performance
in 4Q. And I was wondering if you could give us any color on the performance improvement initiatives that are driving
that improvement. And then maybe what is the magnitude of earnings improvement you're expecting versus the loss
this quarter? And how much of that is really driven by the performance initiatives versus just sort of working through
inventory?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yes, good question, Anthony. And the improvement that we anticipate in the fourth quarter,
as you just highlighted, will be driven primarily by two factors. One is the fact that we will have worked through most
of the high-priced inventory in the fourth quarter. And then secondly, as I mentioned, we have some very specific
property improvement initiatives, including real focus on operational excellence and again making sure we have the
right cost structure in that business that we also have a very focused effort regarding growing specific product lines that
we need to continue to grow in that business to make it a profitable business going forward. So, back to your original

question, two key drivers for the fourth quarter. One, we will have worked through the high-price product and secondly
we have a very focused profit improvement effort in place in that business, and I think we will see the impact from both
of those in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Okay. But is it safe to say that maybe more of the benefit of the performance improvement
initiatives will be seen in 2014 or just in terms of the timeframe of completing some of those initiatives?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Sure, Anthony. Yeah, we will see the initial – we've been working on it, but we will see, like I
said, some of them in the fourth quarter, but it's not just solely in the fourth quarter. We will continue to build those
into 2014 and beyond. So, these aren't one-time initiatives. There is an ongoing effort to improve the operations of our
distribution business.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Okay, that's helpful. And then just switching to Timberlands, do you think that this quarter's
EBITDA contribution from Longview, adjusting for the fact you only had two months, is representative of what the
business could do over the next few quarters and do you have any updated view on synergies or the timeframe to
realize those synergies?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Sure, in terms of Longview, like I said, we're excited about that acquisition and are pleased
with the results in the third quarter. To your specific question, I think the third quarter adjusted for the things you just
said is generally representative. The other thing I would say is as you know third quarter in the West tends to be
seasonally a weak quarter. So, you should factor that in as you think about this acquisition going forward as well. In
terms of synergies, as we've previously stated, we anticipate synergies – achieving synergy savings of approximately
$20 million. And I would tell you we're on track to achieve those synergies by the end of 2014 at a run rate.
<Q - Anthony Pettinari>: Okay, that's helpful. I'll turn it over.

Your next question is from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Mark W. Wilde>: I want to come back to the distribution again because you've now got another publicly traded
peer out there with the distribution business. They've made $21 million in the last two quarters. You guys have lost $27
million. I mean how much of this you think is maybe just a different treatment from an inventory standpoint and what
are the other issues here because it's a huge delta.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yeah, Mark, we understand the delta that is in place. I can tell you I think part of it does have
to do with -my guess is and it's only a guess because I don't know what our competitors do. But I think part of it may
have to do at least in the third quarter with the treatment of inventory. As I mentioned earlier though, we understand the
gap and the opportunities and challenges that we have in that business and we're focused on improving that business
every day.
<Q - Mark W. Wilde>: Okay. So do you regard that business as somehow kind of intertwined with your engineered
wood business, especially you have to be in distribution to be successful in engineered wood or not?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Mark, we look at each of our businesses individually and we expect each of our businesses to
achieve above cost of capital returns over a cycle.
<Q - Mark W. Wilde>: Okay. And just in Wood Products, you talked a lot about improving costs of things, are you
doing anything just to kind of rethink maybe how Weyerhaeuser has approached markets from the commercial side? In
other words, thinking about how you sell, how you go to market, whether you're really kind of getting the best dollar
you can for everything you produce?

<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Sure, Mark. As I mentioned in my initial comments on Wood Products, one of our key
focuses is delivering products that our customers want and are willing to pay for. And a big part of that is who our
customer base is, how we go to market. As you know, we produce very high-quality products here at Weyerhaeuser,
and I think our customers appreciate that. And we just need to make sure we have got the right customer base in place
and that we're delivering quality products that our customers want and are willing to pay for.
<Q - Mark W. Wilde>: All right. And the last question I had is just on the Timberland side. Your log prices were
down quite a bit quarter-to-quarter, but I notice that your export mix skewed to China. I know they typically buy
lower-priced logs. I wondered whether kind of a mix shift in where you were selling contributed to that $10 drop in
average log prices.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Well, as we talked about on the quarter outlook for the third quarter on our last call,
pricing was projected to be weaker in the third quarter because of the seasonality, and we did see that. And now we're
starting to see those prices move up again. In terms of the mix, we do have a higher percentage of the total mix going to
China. Part of that is because of the Longview acquisition of just exporting more into China overall. So, I think from a
mix perspective, China does impact that a little bit, but we did say that pricing would come down somewhat in the third
quarter, as it does on a seasonal basis.
<Q - Mark W. Wilde>: Great. Thanks, Patty. Good luck in the fourth quarter.

Your next question is from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Good morning.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning, Chip.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Hey, first question is as we look at your companies, last couple of years, capital spending has
been quite a bit below the depreciation, and that's understandable because of the purchase accounting and some of it is
at least in depletion. But I mean, Doyle, as you look at things, do you think something down in the sub-$250 million
range is something that's sustainable, or could there possibly be opportunities either in the Wood Products business or
maybe a requirement for boiler rebuild or something in the Cellulose business that we should keep an eye out? In other
words, should we see CapEx remain at about half of depreciation?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Chip, we're – as I mentioned earlier, we've been spending a lot of time with our senior
management team over the past few weeks, and we are right in the middle of that process regarding capital. That's
something that we will share with you at the December 17 meeting and probably even get more specific when we
release fourth quarter earnings. I can tell you generally, Chip, in terms of our financial priorities going forward, first
and foremost, is going to be to return cash to shareholders, primarily through a growing and sustainable dividend but
also, at appropriate time, share repurchase. Second will be to invest in our businesses through high-return projects and
look for opportunistic growth opportunities. And then finally, making sure we maintain the appropriate capital structure
for our shareholders going forward. So, that's generally how we think about it. But again, we'll be back to you with
much more detail in a couple of months.
<Q - Chip A. Dillon>: Okay. And just a quick follow-up. I know that in – a couple of years ago, the company changed
the way they did maintenance to the Cellulose business and found a way, I believe, to cut costs by shifting from annual
to, I guess, every 18 months. And I didn't know if that's something that you felt was good and likely to be sustained, or
if you think that there could be some tweaking to the way you look at the costs, especially for maintenance from the
Cellulose business.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: I think – Chip, thanks for the question. I think that is something that's good and will continue.
As you know, we are in the process of phasing that in, and I think we'll start to really see the benefits of that in 2014

and 2015. But I think that is the right approach. Ultimately, over time, we'll lower your maintenance expense and also a
key benefit of that, of course, is you improve your productivity because you're not going down as often in your mill
system.

Your next question is from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: Thank you. Good morning Doyle and Patty.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: First question is can you give us an update on the restart of the Alabama engineered wood
products facility? How much capital do you think you'll need to put in to get that up and going? And how do you see
the trajectory of the volumes out of that facility going into the market?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Sure, Alex, thanks. I think the important thing to keep in mind about our Evergreen mill in
Alabama is that we announced that we would be restarting it. But the actual restart is not projected to take place until
late spring of 2014, probably around in the May timeframe before we'll actually producing significant product at that
location. Anytime you're starting up a mill that's been down for more than a year, it certainly takes time to put a
workforce in place. And so we're very focused on doing that. From a capital perspective, we will need to put some
capital into that mill because it has been down for some period of time. But it's not a huge increment of capital. So, I
think that as the market continues to recover, especially for engineered wood, we're really looking forward to bringing
that capacity online at a time that the market will really need it.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: Got it. And then on lumber, as I look at your shipment numbers quarterly relative to what you
state is your capacity number for lumber in the 10-K, it seems like you're essentially running at capacity even though
housing is well below normal levels. As you think about the medium term, do you expect you will be able to grow your
lumber shipments with the market without having to put significant capital into your system? Or will you have to put a
significant capital to be able to do that, given you're essentially running at capacity based on the numbers that are
reported?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Alex, I would say we're running somewhere in the low- to mid-90%s in terms of operating
rates in our lumber operation. And what we're focused on every day is improving our reliability in our lumber
operations, and doing things to get additional production where it make sense to do that. So, that's the focus of our
lumber operation going forward.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: Thank you. There is only just one more question on pulp. Softwood inventories are in excellent
shape, prices are moving up, while on the other hand hardwood inventories are elevated and prices are moving lower.
There seems to be a significant amount of hardwood inventory that – hardwood capacity that will be coming online
over the next 12 months. As you talk to your customers, what kind of impact do you think all this new hardwood
capacity that's entering the market, what kind of impact do you think it may have on softwood pricing and your
softwood business?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Well, Alex, it's difficult to know exactly what the impact will be, but our products from a
fluff perspective are really focused more in the softwood grades. And in addition to fluff, we have a number of
specialty proprietary products in the fluff grade spectrum.

So our focus really is, as Doyle said, to continue to drive down costs, which is always a good thing. And then really in
our product mix, in addition to our products today, to developing new products in the priorities for the business that
Doyle spoke to in his comments. Number two priority was innovation around specialty products, things like the product
that we announced, which we call THRIVE, which is a cellulose-based product that has some promise for us going
forward in terms of the automotive industry and others. So, we're working on all fronts. But difficult to know exactly
what that hardwood capacity will be, but it doesn't substitute directly for fluff today.
<Q - Alex Ovshey>: That's helpful. Thanks Patty.

Your next question is from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Two questions. How much of the improvement in engineered wood was attributable to the
lower OSB prices? And second, you commented a little bit on the increased sales from Longview to China. China for
you has been relatively low margin. Is there an opportunity to move some of that Longview capacity into
higher-margin markets, or is this just going to be a shift a little bit down in the overall mix?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Mark, I'll try to address your first question, and then I'll ask Patty to address your second
question. In terms of the improvement in EOP in the quarter, I don't know exactly how much of that was attributable to
the lower OSB cost. But as I mentioned, the improvement was a combination of lower cost and improved revenues in
that business.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: So, Mark, as you think about the Longview acquisition, one of the things that you are not
seeing as much of an impact in terms of the overall revenue, and that chart is a revenue chart that's in the web slides, is
that we actually did purchase through third-party purchases from Longview some logs to go to Japan to round out our
inventory needs for Japan, as we do on the marketplace. So that's why you don't see the significant change there. It's not
that Longview logs are not going to Japan. They're now going as Weyerhaeuser logs.
The other thing that I would say is, as the whitewood market becomes stronger, we will take advantage of shipping
whitewood off, to the extent that we have if off the coastal lands of Longview, to take advantage of both the China
market as well as the Korea market. So the mix will move around, but we will ship the appropriate log to the
appropriate market to get the best margin out of that.
One of the opportunities for us in terms of driving synergies from that acquisition is that even though we were
purchasing logs from Longview, we now have the tree and we have the opportunity to merchandise the cutting of the
tree into logs to pull the highest grade to the highest market for that. So we, as Doyle said, really are very pleased with
what we've seen so far.
<Q - Mark W. Connelly>: Terrific. Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Paul C. Quinn>: Hi, thanks very much, good morning.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning.
<Q - Paul C. Quinn>: A quick question on the Japan. How should we look at the effect of the consumption tax
increase next April? And how do you expect that to flow through in terms of timing on export log sales to that country
and the magnitude of the drop off once that tax is in?

<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Sure, Paul. Difficult to know because the consumption tax is just one of the factors that
affect the demand. Right now, we're seeing very strong demand. There is projected to be a small move up in the
consumption tax, but the Japanese government has also – proving to be very accommodative to housing financing. So I
think if that consumption tax does go up as it is projected, then we'll also likely see some potential benefit to the overall
housing economy in Japan. So, difficult to know, but our own view at this point would be that demand will continue to
be strong in 2014, may have some slight impact from the consumption tax, but it is something that we're monitoring
pretty closely.
<Q - Paul C. Quinn>: And then, I just had a follow-up question for Doyle. You've been there almost three months
now. What's most impressive at Weyerhaeuser and where do you see your biggest challenge?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Thank you for the question, and I would tell you when I showed up at Weyerhaeuser, I've
spent the first few weeks going around to our facilities, meeting our people, and really learning and listening a lot. Over
the past few weeks, I think I mentioned earlier, I've been spending a lot of time with our senior management team, kind
of distilling everything that I've learned when I was out visiting our facility, kind of figuring out where we are, where
we need to go, and how we're going to get there, and that will be the focus of our Investor Meeting on December 17,
and at that point in time, we'll spend a lot of time highlighting, like I said, where we are and what our biggest strengths
are and what our biggest opportunities are as we move this company going forward. So we look forward to sharing
those thoughts with you on December 17.
<Q - Paul C. Quinn>: Okay, fair enough. Best of luck.

Your next question is from the line of Evan Wingren with D.A. Davidson.
<Q - Evan Wingren>: Yes, thank you. Good morning. Given that a lot of your competitors have seen sort of log prices
in the South up a little bit this quarter, I noticed that yours were flat. Was that surprising to you kind of given what
we've heard about the wet weather in the South as well?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Our log prices in the South, as you mentioned, we did not see much of a movement. There
were in various regions impacts because of the significant wet weather. I think that's a portion of what you've seen in
some of the competitors. Also, there may be different inventory situations for various competitors as well.
What I am encouraged about is I think when you step back and look at it overall, I believe our pine sawtimber prices
this year will be up probably 4% to 5% versus last year. When all is said and done and probably more encouragingly as
we continue to see housing rebound, demand continues to grow, we see the impacts of the Canadian situation, I'm
convinced that we will see pine sawtimber prices in the South continue to increase maybe even more rapidly as we
move into 2014 and beyond.
<Q - Evan Wingren>: Great, thank you. And kind of moving to Cellulose, the additional six days of maintenance you
took, could you maybe just give a little more color on that and maybe how much did that cost you in the quarter, if you
could provide that as well?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Part of the impact in the quarter was due to the additional downtime that we took, and above
and beyond the downtime that was scheduled, we had a couple of additional downtimes at our liquid packaging
operation that were a result of not coming up quite as well as we had planned in that operation. So that had a impact on
the third quarter versus the second quarter as well. Now the good news is the liquid packaging operation is back up and
running and running well and there will be no impact from that shutdown in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Evan Wingren>: All right. Fair enough. And then on EWP again, do you have a range that you can provide
maybe of what you think your utilization rate was in that business during the quarter?

<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yes, overall, there's a lot of different products, as you know, in that business, but overall the
operating rates were in the mid-60%s for ELP in the quarter.
<Q - Evan Wingren>: And on the pricing side of that, are you seeing momentum sort of heading into the back half of
the year or maybe just sort of what are the trends you're seeing there on pricing moving forward?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Yes, as we indicated prices were up in the third quarter versus the second quarter in ELP and I
think clearly the trend is for favorable pricing going forward. Now, we've got to factor in the seasonality and as Patty
properly highlighted and as you very well know, the fourth quarter tends to be a slower seasonal period for Wood
Products, including ELP, but I think we will see favorable trends in pricing in ELP going forward.
<Q - Evan Wingren>: All right. Thanks a lot. And just one more kind of housekeeping. I sort of missed the
extinguishment of debt cost, $24 million. Could you just bring that back real quick?
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Sure. So when we acquired Longview timberland, that acquisition we assumed a debt in
that acquisition, and we repaid that debt early in October. And as a result of repaying it early, there were some
prepayment costs associated with that and we expect that there'll be about $24 million of loss from early
extinguishment of debt that will be in the fourth quarter numbers. And I just wanted to make sure that you all had that
number as you think about putting together your fourth quarter estimates.
<Q - Evan Wingren>: All right. Thanks both of you for taking my questions and good luck in the quarter.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Thank you.

Your next question is from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: Good morning.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Good morning, Mark.
<A - Patricia M. Bedient>: Good morning, Mark.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: In the past Weyerhaeuser has indicated their intent over the cycle to tap roughly 75% of
free cash flow in dividends. If, through actions that you take an increasing proportion of your cash generation in the
future is coming from the more stable timber business, does that lend an upward bias to that 75% number?
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Mark, as I mentioned earlier, in terms of our financial priorities, first and foremost is
returning cash to shareholders primarily through a growing and sustainable dividend. So, one of the things that we will
be continuing to monitor going forward is just exactly what the right payout ratio is in terms of our [indiscernible]
(47:37) contribution. So, that's something we'll be looking at, but we understand the importance of and are committed
to a growing and sustainable dividend going forward.
<Q - Mark A. Weintraub>: Thank you.
<A - Doyle R. Simons>: Thank you.
Doyle R. Simons
Okay, so I understand it that there are no additional questions. So, let me just close with a couple of comments. Let me
start by thanking everybody for joining us this morning and for your continued interest in our company, and also I just
want to say, I look forward to seeing everybody on December 17 at the meeting that we will be hosting in New York,
and as I mentioned earlier, we will be sending out details for that meeting later today. Thank you very much.
