MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Second Quarter Fixed Income Conference Call. My name is
Shiquana and I will be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only-mode. We will
facilitate a question-and-answer session towards end of this conference. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn the presentation over to your host for today's call, Ms. Molly Tripp, Manager of Fixed Income
Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma'am.
Molly Tripp
Thank you, Shiquana, and good morning. Welcome to all of you who are joining us either by phone or webcast. On
behalf of the entire Ford management team, I'd like to thank you for spending time with us this morning. With me
today are Michael Seneski, Ford Credit Chief Financial Officer; Neil Schloss, Ford Corporate Treasurer; and Stuart
Rowley, Ford Corporate Controller. We also have some other members of management who are joining us for the call
today including Marion Harris, Assistant Treasurer; Paul Andonian, Director of Global Accounting; and George Sharp,
Executive Director, Investor Relations.
Before we begin, I'd like to review a few items. A copy of this morning's earnings release and the slides we'll be using
today have been posted on Ford Motor Company's investor and media websites for your reference. The financial results
discussed herein are presented on a preliminary basis. Final data will be included in our Form 10-Q. Additionally, the
financial results presented here are on a GAAP basis and in some cases on a non-GAAP basis. Any non-GAAP
financial measures discussed on this call are reconciled to the U.S. GAAP equivalent as part of the appendix to the slide
deck.
Finally, today's presentation includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for Ford's future
performance, but actual results could differ. The most significant factors that could affect future results are summarized
at the end of this presentation. These risk factors and other key information are detailed in our SEC filings.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Ford Credit CFO, Michael Seneski.

Thanks Molly. Consistent with prior quarters, today's presentation will cover Ford Credit's profit and credit loss
performance, Ford Credit funding and liquidity highlights, automotive cash, debt and liquidity, an update on our
pension, and then will wrap things up with a summary of the quarter.
Let's turn to Ford Credit's operating highlights on slide 1. Ford Credit remains key to our global growth strategy,
providing world-class dealer and customer financial services, maintaining a strong balance sheet, and producing solid
profits and distributions. Ford Credit had another strong quarter with pre-tax profit of $454 million and net income of
$275 million. Managed receivables were $95 billion at the end of the second quarter, up $4 billion from year end 2012
and up $1 billion from the first quarter.
The growth from year-end 2012 was driven primarily by increases in net investment and operating leases and
wholesale receivables. Growth from the first quarter was driven primarily by increases in net investment and operating
leases. Second quarter charge-offs were $32 million, up $15 million from the prior year. The second quarter
loss-to-receivables ratio was 14 basis points, up 6 basis points from the record low of a year ago and well below our
10-year average of 67 basis points.
At June 30, the allowance for credit losses or reserve was $376 million or 39 basis points of receivable. Managed
leverage was 8.3 to 1 at June 30, 2013, unchanged from December 31, 2012. And at the end of the second quarter, our
equity was $10 billion.
Slide 2 shows the $16 million increase in second quarter pre-tax results compared with a year ago by causal factor. The
results are more than explained by higher receivables and financing margin, offset partially by lower credit loss reserve
reduction. The higher volume is explained by higher receivables in our North America segment which were driven
primarily by an increase in net investment in operating leases and non-consumer dealer finance receivables. Higher
financing margin is primarily explained by lower borrowing costs in our international segment. The lower credit loss
reserve reductions are primarily related to the consumer finance receivable portfolio in our North America segment.
And as shown in the memo, Ford Credit's pre-tax results decreased by $53 million, compared with the first quarter
2013, due to unfavorable mark-to-market on the derivative portfolio and seasonal insurance loses. For the full year,
Ford Credit continues to expect pre-tax profits to be about equal to 2012 and distributions to our parent of about $200
million. Ford Credit now expects year-end managed receivables of $97 billion to $102 billion, which is within our prior
range of $95 billion to $105 billion.
Slide 3 shows our quarterly trends of charge-offs, loss-to-receivable receivables ratio and credit loss reserve. Our
second quarter credit losses continued to be at year-end historic lows. Year-over-year charge-offs were up $15 million,
primarily reflecting a wholesale charge-off in Europe and higher severity and lower recoveries in the United States.
Quarter-over-quarter charge-offs were down $13 million, reflecting lower default volume in the United States.
The loss-to-receivables ratio was up 6 basis points, compared with the prior year. And the credit loss reserve was $376
million, down $30 million from a year ago and down $13 million from the first quarter, reflecting the continuation of
the historically low losses.
Slide 4 shows the primary drivers of credit losses in the U.S. retail and lease business, which comprises approximately
75% of our worldwide consumer portfolio. Over 60-day delinquencies were flat from the same period a year ago and
down 4 basis points from the prior quarter. Repossessions in the second quarter were 6,000 units or 1.06% of average
accounts outstanding, down 13 basis points from the same period a year ago. This is our lowest repossession ratio on
record.
Severity was $7,600 in the second quarter, up $900 from the same period a year ago and up $400 from the first quarter,
reflecting lower auction value values. Year-over-year increases in charge-offs and LTR in the lower right hand box
primarily reflect higher severity, while quarter-over-quarter decreases primarily reflect lower repossession volume.

Slide 5 shows the U.S. Ford and Lincoln lease residual performance. Lease return volumes in the second quarter were
12,000 units higher than the same period last year, primarily reflecting higher lease placements in 2011 relative to prior
years. The second quarter lease return rate was 68%, up 9 percentage points compared with the same period last year,
reflecting lower auction values.
In the second quarter, our 24-month and 36-month average auction values declined about $400 and $1,000 respectively
when compared to a year ago. And both the 24-month and 36-month auction values declined about $500 from the first
quarter. Our worldwide net investment in operating leases was $17.6 billion at the end of the second quarter, up $2.9
billion from year end 2012.
With that, I'll turn it over to Neil.
Neil M. Schloss
Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Turning to slide 6, we are on track to achieve our 2013 funding plan. In
the second quarter, we completed $5 billion of funding in the public term markets. We have completed about $13
billion of public funding year-to-date. Our second quarter public term issuance included over $2 billion of unsecured
debt in the U.S. and Europe and about $3 billion of public asset back in the U.S. and Canada. We ended the quarter
with $32 billion of committed capacity, up about $1 billion when compared to first quarter 2013.
Year-to-date, we have renewed about 60% of our committed capacity that is scheduled to renew this year. Our funding
strategy remains focused on diversification and we plan to continue accessing a variety of markets, channels and
investors. We remain focused on maintaining a strong investment grade balance sheet.
Slide 7 shows the trends in funding of our managed receivables. At the end of the second quarter, managed receivables
were $95 billion. We ended the quarter with about $10 billion in cash and securitized funding was 45% of managed
receivables. We project year-end managed receivables at $97 billion to $102 billion and securitized funding as a
percent of managed receivables at 44% to 47%, both within prior guidance. We expect this percentage to continue to
decline over time.
Slide 8 shows our 2013 global public term funding plan for Ford Credit excluding our short-term funding programs. As
I mentioned earlier, we have completed $13 billion of public term funding in the U.S., Canada and Europe. In addition,
this week we priced a U.S. retail ABS transaction, increasing the year-to-date total to about $14 billion. We project
full-year global public term funding in the range of $19 billion to $24 billion consisting of $7 billion to $10 billion of
unsecured debt and $12 billion to $14 billion of public securitizations.
Turning to slide 9, our liquidity remains strong at $22.9 billion, up $2.7 billion from the prior quarter, primarily
reflecting committed capacity – higher committed capacity and lower utilization. Ford Credit's source of liquidity
includes cash, unsecured credit facilities, FCAR asset-backed commercial paper lines and other asset-backed bank
capacity.
As of June 30, we had $42.3 billion of cash and committed liquidity sources, up $1.5 billion from prior quarter.
Utilization of our liquidity totaled $18.2 billion and we ended the quarter with gross liquidity of $24.1 billion. Capacity
in excess of eligible receivables was $1.2 billion. We remain focused on maintaining liquidity levels to meet our
business and funding requirements through economic cycles.
Now we'll summarize our automotive sector cash and debt position at the end of the second quarter, which is captured
on slide 10. Automotive debt at the end of the quarter was $15.8 billion, $200 million lower than the first quarter. In
April, we took advantage of favorable market conditions by increasing our revolving credit facility from $9.3 billion to
$10.7 billion and extended its maturity from November of 2015 to November 2017. As a result, we ended the quarter
with net cash of $9.9 billion and automotive liquidity of $37.1 billion.
Next, on slide 11, we would like to provide an update on our pension de-risking strategy. In the first half, we
contributed $2.8 billion to our global funded pension plans including $2 billion in discretionary contributions to our

U.S. plans. For the full year, we continue to expect contributions of $5 billion to our global funded plans including
about $3.4 billion in discretionary contributions.
In the second quarter, we settled about $1.5 billion of obligations related to the U.S. salaried retiree voluntary
lump-sum program, with $2.7 billion settled since the inception of the program last year. As a result of the second
quarter settlement, we recognized a special item charge of $294 million, reflecting the acceleration of unrecognized
losses in the plan. The lump-sum program is about 60% complete and concludes by year-end. Also, we have continued
to progressively improve our mix of fixed income assets in our plans with the objective of reducing funded status
volatility.
As a result of the strategic actions we have been taking along with the recent increase in discount rates, the funded
status of our global funded pension plan significantly improved as of June 30 compared with the end of last year. And
as usual, we will provide a full-year update at the end of this year.
Now let's close with a summary of the second quarter. The company earned a pre-tax operating profit of $2.6 billion
and net income of $1.2 billion. Automotive operating related cash flow and quarter end liquidity were both very strong.
Among our business units, North America and Asia-Pacific/Africa had record results. We returned to profitability in
South America and Europe incurred a loss, but it was improved compared to both a year ago and first quarter as we
continue to execute our transformation plan leading to profitability by mid-decade. We ended the quarter with
automotive net cash of about $10 billion and liquidity of about $37 billion.
Ford Credit had another strong quarter with a pre-tax profit of $454 million, net income of $275 million. Managed
receivables were $95 billion at the end of the second quarter, up $4 billion from year-end 2012 and up about $1 billion
from the first quarter. The second quarter loss-to-receivable ratio was 14 basis points, up 6 basis points from the record
low of the prior year. Year-to-date, Ford Credit has completed $13 billion in public term funding and we are well on
track to complete our full-year funding plan. Ford Credit's liquidity was about $23 billion for the quarter, which is in
addition to Ford's automotive liquidity of $37 billion.
And with that, I'll turn it to Molly to begin the Q&A session.
Molly Tripp
Thanks Neil. With that, we'll start the Q&A session. Shiquana, can we please have the first question?

Operator
Yes ma'am. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Doug Karson, representing Bank of
America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Great, guys. Thank you.
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Good morning.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Good quarter. Good morning. I had a couple of questions on Ford Co. and then one or so on
Ford Credit. On Ford Co. on slide 26, one of the planning assumptions and key metrics and it may have been discussed
on the call and I missed it, but there's a quality metric that was supposed to improve; looks like it kind of got
downgraded to mixed. I just wanted to understand what was behind the quality metric?
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Yes. This is Stuart here, Bill (sic) [Doug] (14:16). And Bob – I'm sorry, Alan covered that
in his comments on the call. So our initial guidance was to improve; in each of the four regions we've adjusted that
guidance to mixed and that's because we now believe that our quality in South America, Asia-Pacific and North
America will be about the same as 2012 as opposed to improved, and Europe will improve. So that's the change we

made to our guidance.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Okay. Great. That's helpful. On the appendix 9 of 12, it talked about automotive debt and
there was a memo of debt payable within the year was 1.2 and I see Ford Credit has an October $3 billion maturity
coming due this year. Is the sense that you'll refinance that in capital markets or would you use cash on the balance
sheet? Have you thought about how to refinance some of that debt at this point?
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: I think you've got – you're comparing debt of Automotive with debt of Ford Credit. The
footnote on the – in the appendix reflects the Automotive debt that matures in the next year. Ford Credit would have...
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Right.
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: ...its own separate balance sheet that would have – it's in the neighborhood of $5 billion to
$6 billion of debt that's currently payable within a year and so the maturity that you mentioned would be included in
that.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess on the timing of cash flows, I'm sorry if I missed this
on the major call, but the $3.3 billion was a much higher number than I had expected and there's a timing difference of
$1.2 billion located in the kind of the middle of the cash flow walk. Was there any color on what that $1.2 billion was?
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Yes. Bill (sic) [Doug] (16:12), this is Stuart. There're a number of things going there,
things like marketing and warranty accruals as well as the difference between cash payments and expense accruals on
pensions and a number of other items like cash taxes; the biggest pieces being warranty and marketing. I'd point you to
the fact also that if you look at the first half that was 400, so we had 0.8 negative in quarter one, 1.2 positive in quarter
two as the timing of those expenses and cash flows move around.
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: And importantly, it's 0.4 year-to-date, so from the standpoint we'll get quarter-to-quarter
movements in these balances as a result.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Right. I know a lot of discussion was in Europe, it's the last question I have, and I don't have
this many for Ford Credit because it seems a very solid quarter. In Europe, we're looking at a little bit of improvement
here; I think the number outperformed a lot of people's expectations. And we look at the plan like the volume outlook
actually is a little bit down on the high end for 2013. I notice some share moving around but is the improvement that's
expected in Europe is some of it cost driven? Maybe just highlight that a little bit and that's it for me.
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Well, we've improved our guidance from a loss of about $2 billion to a loss of about $1.8
billion. There's, as we've pointed out, three elements to our plan: product, brand and cost. And we're really making
good progress across all three of those elements. And new products are being well received; they're supporting the
improvement in retail share that we're seeing in the market. Quality is also improving and we're seeing that in the – that
assists our brand. And then on the cost side, we're making good progress and we will close the two facilities in the UK
this week and we've reached agreement with our unions to proceed to close the facility in Genk, Belgium at the end of
next year. So we're driving all elements of the plan, we're very pleased with the progress on all of the elements in that
they can – they're all contributing towards our improved outlook.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: That's great. I guess just one final one. Have you guys had more updated discussions with
S&P because your outlook is positive and it's been there since, I think, last summer so it's been about a year. I wonder
if you had any kind of follow-up discussions with them?
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Nothing out of the normal. We tend to have conversations throughout the year and meeting
throughout the year, but nothing off schedule.
<Q - Douglas Karson>: Okay. Well, thanks a lot guys. Good quarter.
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Thanks a lot, Doug.

Your next question comes from the line of Joe Spak representing RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed.
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Good morning, Joe.
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: He might be on mute.
<Q - Joseph R. Spak>: Hi. Sorry about that. Good morning and thanks for taking the call. Just on Ford Motor, clearly
some good progress in Europe, but it seems like at least on a year-over-year basis, a large part of the improvement was
the non-repeat of the de-stocking that occurred last year. Could you just remind us is that – I think that occurred all
throughout the back half of 2012, maybe it became a little bit more normalized in the fourth quarter. But is that still
expected to be a year-over-year benefit?
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: You're right that that was a contributor to our volume of mix as well as our improved
market share and lower industries were a partial offset. Our stock reductions this year – this is a change on the change
and our stock reductions this year were less than they were in the second quarter of last year. We progressively reduced
our stocks through the year in 2012. We're at about our planned level now. We're at levels that are below any historic
level we've had both in terms of the absolute number of units and days supply. So for the full year, the stock
comparator will be favorable, but as also will be – will the market share contributions.
<Q - Joseph R. Spak>: Right. Right. Okay. That's helpful. And then, just in North America, realize you're reinvesting
here and also clearly trying to expand some of the capacity on some of the key products that have been constrained;
that, obviously, has been weighing on results. I mean is it able to quantify how much of that investment for expanded
capacity is above and beyond sort of normal reinvestment in the business? And are we through to the worst of it,
because the volume should start coming on, I guess, in the back half and maybe start absorbing some of that cost?
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Well, I think you need to think of it – we are benefiting in the first half of this year from
the capacity that we've put in place. And last year, we added capacity to number of our facilities, incremental shifts.
<Q - Joseph R. Spak>: Okay.
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: However in 2013, we will continue to add capacity to support both the higher industry that
we're seeing this year and we expect going forward, as well as our improved market share. We'll be adding shifts at our
Flat Rock assembly plant, a shift in the second half of the year for the Fusion; and we have also announced that we're
adding a shift to the Kansas City assembly plant, for the F Series. So those are costs that we'll add to support
incremental volume in the second half of this year.
We are also continuing to invest very strongly in our product, in our engineering, for future growth as we move
forward. And we believe we're seeing the benefit of that, those investments that we've made last year and will continue
to make, in our bottom line results for North America.
<Q - Joseph R. Spak>: Okay. Thanks a lot, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Selle, representing JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: Hey, I guess the elephant in the room is treasuries have soaring here in the fixed income; we've
obviously been volatile couple of months and we haven't seen it hit volumes yet but could you speak generally on how
rates would impact your balance sheet and profitability?
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Let me start on the automotive side and then I'll have sort of Mike jump in and talk about the
credit company, because it does have different impact depending on what areas of the business.

On the automotive side, I think first and foremost, it's what's the impact on the overall economy. If rates are going up,
that obviously signals a stronger – presumably a stronger economy which should help industry growth as long as – I
guess, as long as it doesn't shoot up from a standpoint of sort of the shock effect. So as long as it's a nice steady growth,
Eric, it probably has a positive impact on GDP, which then has a positive impact on industry sales.
I think the other two pieces on the automotive balance sheet, the biggest one being the benefit that that would have on
the liability side of the pension plan on the present valuing of the liability; obviously there's a partial offset to that for
the amount of assets we have invested, which would obviously go down in value as a result of interest rates. But
net-net, and we've actually provided sensitivities in previous presentations of somewhere between $2 billion and $2.5
billion for a 100 point basis point change in rates to overall U.S. funded status. So we've given those sensitivities.
And lastly, and you saw it a little bit in this quarter's earnings, in net interest, obviously even though we run a very
short duration cash portfolio, rising rates do have an impact on the market value of that cash portfolio. But net-net, as
long as it's not a shock, positive industry and good news to the pension funded status would be a plus for the
automotive side.
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Okay. And then on the credit side, the impact on the present portfolio is going to be pretty
limited because, as you know, we have a term matched philosophy on our debt. Obviously, you're going to get noise in
the value of your derivatives and repricing timing. But for the most part, the impact on the present portfolio is pretty
muted, again in a consistent move upward as opposed to huge spikes.
As it relates to future placement though on the impact, it really depends on the competitive environment. Obviously, if
rates are rising and that's passed on to consumers, it will mean higher costs to buy a car. If not, and they're not passed
on, then that could be a bit of a margin squeeze and we'll have to stay tuned to watch that. I will say thus far, there has
been limited pass through of pricing in the market.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: That is great color. I thought it was 1 basis point for $5 billion; I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding. I
was off the last call, sorry, sorry. Hey, and you guys gave us 60 basis points lost to AR ratio in the last 10 years; did
that include Triad or no? You guys sold [indiscernible] (26:29), I think...
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: We have...
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: Backed that out.
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: I believe we did as a discontinued op. So, yes, 67 basis points is our 10-year average.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: And then I know you probably can't do this on the fly, but maybe later on today, I'd love to get it
ex the 2008, 2009 if possible, just to kind of get like a normalized number. I mean I've got in my model, but I just want
to double check.
Moving on to Europe, you guys said that there's going to be restructuring charges of $1.2 billion. Have you guys
disclosed what portion of that is cash and then kind of how the cash is going to ferret out? I think you have it 8 – you
know, 8 and then 400 charge cadence; I was just wondering how much is cash and then when is that cash going to hit?
And I'd imagine that when Genk's closed late next year, that's the majority of the cash but I may have that wrong.
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Yeah. We haven't disclosed – I mean the majority of it will be cash over time. We haven't
disclosed the timing of the cash payments and they differ by the type of employee and the nature of the separation
agreements.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: And is there anything generally you guys can speak on – I know in the U.S., it was basically a
one-year payback on the buyouts. Is there a general rule of thumb to apply to Europe? Is it two-year payback or is there
not really a good – it varies by plant?
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: Yeah. It varies by plants and by the type of the employee. We haven't provided any
guidance although I think we do have out some numbers of the – the numbers of separations and the total cost. But I
would say around two is probably not a bad estimate.

<Q - Eric J. Selle>: Okay.
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Remember, in addition to the savings that we have – that we'll get from closing the facilities,
there will be a reinvestment cost on the transition from the standpoint of moving the products from Genk to Valencia
and Saarlouis.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: So you get capacity utilization bump, and then don't you get a $0.5 billion depreciation benefit as
well?
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: We've...
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: I thought we talked about that on the last call.
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: We've – I mean there's about a $0.5 billion effect this year as we accelerate the
depreciation of our existing facilities. But going forward, we expect to see a number of benefits. Obviously, the people
are no longer in the business, but they're very importantly around the overall utilization of our European manufacturing
network as we consolidate into Valencia in the case of these products.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: Okay, thank you. And then just one final question, looking at slide 8, the third column, kind of
your forecast of funding; now that's 2013. Could you see that flip-flopping, going two-thirds unsecured to one-third
securitization in 2014? Is there – I mean could it flip that fast or is it going to be kind of a slow moderation that we've
seen over the last couple of years?
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: I think, Eric, and I'll actually have you flip back to slide seven, because I think you can see
the percentage of secure-type funding as a percent of managed receivables has really been walking from 55% in 2011,
to 48%, we're at 45% at the end of the second quarter. We're projecting to be between 44% and 47% at the end of the
year. I think you can continue to see that migrate down more toward our target levels over time. And so – and I think
the mix that you've got here from a standpoint of unsecured and secured, given the maturity profiles of differences
within each of those shouldn't be too far off as you go into the – into 2014.
<Q - Eric J. Selle>: That is great color. Hey guys, thanks a lot for your time and I hate to be cheesy, but it was a very
solid quarter. Great work.
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Thanks, Eric.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Brian Jacoby representing Goldman Sachs.
Please proceed.
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: Hi, guys, good numbers today. Just had a couple of quick ones, most of it was covered, but in
the past you gave some data on FICO scores and so forth and a lot of us get questions from investors just around how
much of the business being originated on the loan side at Ford Motor Credit is non-prime or whatever you want to call
it below a certain FICO score. Can you give us a sense in the first half of the year what perhaps maybe some of the
lower quality or, I don't know, lower level FICO score business that you did at Ford Motor Credit?
<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Sure, Brian. It's Mike. As you've seen through other agencies releasing data, the industry
has seen a gradual increase in subprime loans so far this year. Our data shows it up slightly year-over-year. Although I
know you guys get used to me saying this, Ford Credit has been very consistent in what we're originating. We continue
to be about 5% to 6% of our originations are higher risk. Obviously that's a combination of FICO and deal
characteristics, but we've been pretty stable in that 5% to 6% range.
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: Great, great. So, no changes there and presumably as the economic cycle evolves, I mean is it
something that – if the business looks attractive, could you take that percentage up or is it more so that you want to
keep it within that range?

<A - Michael L. Seneski>: Truthfully, our goal is to be pretty stable, that way our dealers really understand what it is
we're going to buy. I think the other measure that we use to make sure that we're really providing that value for our
Ford dealers and customers is the amount of subprime Ford customers that we actually do buy. And the other metric
that I usually share is that three out of every four Ford customers who buy – three out of every four subprime customers
who buy a Ford vehicle are generally financed by Ford Credit. And again, that's pretty stable through time and we hope
to keep that level right around there.
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: Okay. Great. And then I had one last one, it's just around – I think Doug touched on it earlier,
but it's around the cadence of cash flow. For the second half, I mean generally your operating cash flow tends to be
better, but you have higher CapEx and I think you still have, what, another $1.4 billion of discretionary pension
contributions plan for the back half.
So can you kind of give us a sense like the cadence still looks like second half should be pretty good; I mean is it kind
of a similar type of cadence of what we saw last year because obviously, you revised up your cash flow guidance and it
pretty much looks like – I mean it's going to be a slam-dunk easy to do a lot better than last year. But I mean the
magnitude of how much better seems to be pretty dramatic, but unless I'm missing something in terms of the – is there
anything else maybe on the cash use side in the back half, whether be taxes or something that I'm missing; that would
be helpful.
<A - Stuart John Rowley>: I think you've touched on the major pieces. Clearly, we've upgraded our guidance to
substantially better and as you've noted, the first half is better than our full year last year. We haven't provided anything
– we're not quantifying that any further but the items you've touched on, the CapEx, we've guided to about $7 billion;
that would infer higher second half CapEx and as you've just pointed out, the pension contributions also in the second
half.
<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: Okay, great. Well, again, good numbers. That's it from me.
<A - Neil M. Schloss>: Thanks, Brian.
