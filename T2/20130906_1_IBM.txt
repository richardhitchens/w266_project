Thank you for joining us today. In the fourth quarter, we improved our year-to-year revenue growth rate, primarily in
higher-margin areas, driving significant margin expansion and profit growth. We delivered operating earnings per share
of $5.39, which is up 14% year-to-year and generated $9.5 billion of free cash flow. For the full year, we delivered
revenue of $104.5 billion and expanded gross pre-tax and net margins. Our operating EPS for the year was up 13% to

$15.25 and we generated $18.2 billion of free cash flow. That's up over $1.5 billion year-to-year.
Now let me put this full year EPS and cash flow performance in perspective. This is the 10th consecutive year of
double-digit EPS growth, so a decade at a double-digit pace, and $18.2 billion of free cash flow is $12 billion higher
than a decade ago. That's an increase in the cash flow we generate in a year, not accumulative increase.
Looking at our fourth quarter by segment, our performance was led by continued momentum in our growth initiatives
and successful product launches in our high-end systems, both of which drive a more profitable mix. We had another
good quarter in Software. The performance was broad-based driven by Business Analytics, Smarter Commerce and
cloud with strength in several of the emerging areas where we've been targeting our investments like social business,
mobile and security.
Our new hardware product introductions really performed in the quarter. We had excellent acceptance of our new
mainframe and our System z revenue was up 56% year-to-year. So it's been a very successful launch, not only in major
markets but in growth markets where we were up 65% and we had significant growth in our mainframe specialty
engines led by Linux. This is a good indicator not only of new workloads moving on to the platform, but also the value
of a vertically integrated system. The year-to-year revenue performance in our total services business was fairly
consistent with last quarter. Once again we had strength in all of our growth initiatives which are becoming a larger
part of the business.
While IBM's revenue was down 1% at actual rates, it was up 1% at constant currency adjusting for the divestiture of
our Retail Store Solutions business. That's a 2-point improvement from last quarter's constant currency growth rate.
Consistent with our business model to move to higher value areas, we had revenue growth in our higher margin
businesses. The improving business mix and our productivity initiatives drove 10% growth in operating pre-tax and net
income.
Now looking at the margin dynamics, we expanded operating gross margins by over 2 points with improvement across
our major segments and a continued mix to software. With our ongoing focus on expense productivity, we improved
operating PTI margin by 2.6 points. This quarter our operating tax rate was flat year-to-year and we continue to expect
an operating effective tax rate in the range of 25% for 2013.
Our net income margin was up almost 2 points. And with $12 billion in gross share repurchase over the last 12 months,
we reduced our share count by 4%. When you pull this all together, we delivered operating EPS of $5.39, which is up
14%. For the year, operating EPS is up 13% to $15.25. Our strong earnings performance drove 9.5 billion of free cash
flow, terrific performance for the quarter, and for the year, over 18 billion of free cash flow, a record for IBM.
Looking forward, we are confident in our ability to continue to leverage our business model to expand our margins,
grow profit, generate cash and deliver shareholder value. In 2013, we expect to deliver at least $16.70 of operating
earnings per share for the year, keeping us on track to our objective of at least $20 in 2015.
Looking at the geographies on a constant currency basis, Americas revenue was up 1%, led by terrific growth in Latin
America. The U.S. revenue was down 1%, a 3 point improvement in the year-to-year growth rate compared to third
quarter. Canada was down 9% off of last year's very strong growth of 13%. EMEA's revenue decline of 3% reflects the
macroeconomic climate in the region. It was more challenging this quarter in the UK and Germany, but we did see an
improvement in Italy. Asia-Pacific growth improved to 5% led by Japan. Early in 2012, we said that we expected our
performance in Japan to stabilize in the second half of the year, and in fact, we returned to growth this quarter. So we
had great performance from the team in Japan.
Across all of the geographies, our growth markets delivered 7 points of growth, outpacing major markets by 9 points.
The BRIC countries delivered 14% growth, the strongest quarter of the year. Brazil contributed to almost 20% growth
in Latin America. We also had good performance in Africa, led by South Africa and the Middle East. In fact, across all
of our growth markets, we had double-digit growth in over 30 growth market countries, reflecting ongoing broad-based
strength.

Turning to revenue and gross margin by segment, year-to-year revenue performance in our combined services
businesses was fairly consistent with the third quarter. At constant currency, Global Business Services year-to-year
performance improved modestly, while Global Technology Services revenue growth slowed a bit. We had good results
across our Software business with growth in all of the key brands, and particular strength and share gains in
WebSphere, Lotus and Rational. In Systems Technology, we returned to growth adjusting for the divested RSS
business. This was driven by powerful performance in System z.
Turning to gross profit, our operating gross margin improved 2.1 points to 52.3%, driven by a combination of the
strong mainframe growth, good margin expansion in both services segments and improving segment mix due to the
relative strength of Software. Finally, our Global Financing business delivered over 40% return on equity.
So now let's take a look at our expense profile. Our total operating expense and other income was down 2%.
Acquisitions over the last 12 months drove 2 points of expense growth. The year-to-year benefit from currency
translation and hedging moderated this quarter, contributing about a point of expense decline. Consequently, our base
expense excluding currency and acquisitions was better by 3 points.
Turning to the expense items that have more significant year-to-year profit impact, I'll comment on just one item. Our
accounts receivable provision was about $20 million in the quarter, an improvement of almost 70 million from last year
when we increased the provisions to reflect the European credit environment. Typically we talk about the impact of our
hedging programs as a driver of expense. However, this quarter there was effectively no period or year-to-year impact
on expense due to our hedging programs.
So now let me get into the segments. In the quarter, the two services segments delivered 15 billion in revenue, grew
pre-tax profit 4% and expanded pre-tax margin by a point. Total backlog was $140 billion, up $1 billion year-to-year at
constant currency, driven by growth in the transactional businesses. From a geographic perspective, the growth markets
backlog was up 15% at constant currency. For the year the combined services business grew profit 10% and expanded
margin by nearly 2 points excluding workforce rebalancing charges in the third quarter. Turning to the two segments, in
Global Technology Services revenue was $10.3 billion, down 2% as reported and flat at constant currency.
There were two major categories within the major markets that affected revenue growth. First, we did a tremendous
amount of work to address a number of low margin contracts to improve the profitability of the outsourcing portfolio.
We see the benefits of that work in our profit and our margin performance, though it does have some impact on
revenue. This quarter the impact was a point of revenue growth to GTS and the services in total.
Second, we saw a decline in revenue from sales and volumes into existing base accounts. This activity tends to be more
transactional in nature and economically sensitive. You can see the impact of these in our GTS outsourcing revenue
which was down 2% at constant currency.
In outsourcing, we continue to have strong performance in growth markets with revenue up 8% and backlog up 9%,
both at constant currency. This backlog growth reflects an ongoing trend as our clients are building out their
infrastructures and scaling to meet the growth objectives of their businesses.
In Integrated Technology Services, revenue was up 3% at constant currency with the growth markets up double digits
at constant currency. Global Technology Services delivered 5% pre-tax profit growth in the quarter and expanded
pre-tax margin by over a point. This quarter margin expansion resulted from increased efficiency and productivity from
our focus on automation processes, primarily through our enterprise productivity initiatives.
Turning to Global Business Services, revenue was $4.7 billion, which is down 3% as reported and down 2% at constant
currency. From a geographic perspective, the growth markets turned in solid performance and the recovery in Japan
continued as they grew for the second consecutive quarter.
Looking at the GBS businesses by offering, the growth initiatives continued to drive strong performance. We had solid
double-digit growth in Business Analytics, Smarter Planet and cloud. And for the year, these initiatives now represent
over a third of our total GBS revenue. So as we retooled the GBS business and mixed the higher value work, these
larger more complex engagements are having a positive effect on GBS backlog

In fact, GBS backlog has now grown for the fourth consecutive year at constant currency, though mixing to longer
duration engagements. And as I stated last quarter, we've been taking actions to address the more traditional package
application work. We've added partners to this base and have increased sales capability. We've targeted and closed
large transformation opportunities in the growth markets and we've already seen some success in building the backlog
in those areas this quarter. Turning to profit, GBS pre-tax income was flat year-to-year and pre-tax margin expanded
0.5 point. Improved utilization and service delivery helped to overcome the impact from revenue.
For total services, we are providing you with additional detail around the projected total services revenue run-out from
backlog in 2013. This includes the impact to revenue from the work we've done to restructure a number of lower
margin contracts in our outsourcing business, primarily in the U.S. Now, keep in mind, the revenue generated from
backlog is approximately 70% of total revenue in any year, with the remainder coming from transactional signings in
the year and sales and volumes in our existing client base.
In 2013, the projected revenue generated from backlog is up 1%. This includes 2% growth from the backlog and a 1%
hurt from those restructured contracts, but despite the impact to revenue growth, these restructured contracts have lifted
the profitability of the portfolio. They provide substantial year-to-year gross profit improvement in 2012 which carries
through to 2013 and will contribute modest profit growth in 2013 off this higher profit base.
So for total services, as we enter 2013, we will continue to drive our key plays and shift towards higher value content.
We'll continue to invest in the growth markets which now represent over 20% of total services revenue and is where we
see the most opportunity for growth. We will continue to be aggressive in transforming our portfolio to higher value
content and away from the more commoditizing labor-based content. Our profit and margin performance will continue
to benefit from the work we are doing with research and software to infuse more and more IP into our offerings. In
addition, services is the primary beneficiary of our focus on enterprise productivity.
Overall, we think we have a good set of opportunities to continue to drive profit growth and margin expansion in 2013.
Software revenue of $7.9 billion was up 3% or 4% at constant currency. Key branded middleware grew 6% at constant
currency and gained share as we continue to be the clear leader in the middleware market. We had continued
momentum in our growth initiatives with strong performance in Business Analytics, Smarter Commerce and cloud.
These initiatives cross all of our software brands.
Our results reflect the sustained investments in our strategic branded software. In addition to our organic investments,
acquisitions provide additional capabilities while leveraging the existing portfolio of offerings. For example, in the first
quarter of 2012 we acquired Worklight, a provider of mobile software which enables enterprises to manage and secure
mobile applications. Worklight is now an important addition to our mobile strategy and has accelerated from a
million-dollar a year business when it was acquired to generating tens of millions for the year. Worklight is just one
example of our ability to leverage and grow acquired businesses. Looking across our Software portfolio, we grew the
pre-IBM transactional revenue of our 2012 acquisitions by nearly five times.
Now, let me take you through the revenue drivers from a brand perspective. WebSphere grew 11% and continued to
gain share. We continue to expand our portfolio to capture the emerging opportunity around mobile computing and saw
a significant uplift in some of our core WebSphere offerings such as application servers and commerce. As a result, we
are well positioned to continue to help enterprises build, connect, run and manage their mobile applications.
Information Management was up 3% at constant currency and held share. We had strong performance in information
integration and predictive analytics, both driven by big data. Tivoli Software was up 5% at constant currency and held
share. Performance was led our storage and our security offerings. Revenue from our storage portfolio was up 13% at
constant currency, reflecting the value with storage software. Tivoli security was up 16% at constant currency, driven
by Q1 Labs which provides next generation security intelligence.
We continue to transform the Lotus portfolio to the faster growing social business offerings. And consequently, we had
9% growth in Lotus revenue, gained share and had a great quarter. This was driven by strong performance from our
existing social business offerings and the recent acquisition of Kenexa, which we closed in December. Kenexa, a
leading provider of recruiting and talent management solution, helps clients create a more efficient and effective

workforce and brings a unique combination of cloud-based technology and consulting services to an already extensive
portfolio of social business solutions.
Rational posted double-digit growth of 12% and gained share. Software had a solid quarter with revenue up 4% at
constant currency, pre-tax income up 8% and pre-tax margins of 2.4 points. The fourth quarter rounds out another good
year for our Software business.
Systems and Technology delivered revenue of $5.8 billion, up 4% adjusting for the divestiture of Retail Store
Solutions. This performance was driven by our new mainframe and momentum in PureSystems, our expert integrated
system. In fact, in its introductory year, we have already sold more than 2,300 PureSystems in more than 70 countries.
System z revenue grew 56%, driven by our first full quarter of our new mainframe. MIPS grew 66% year-to-year. This
is the largest quarter of MIPS shipments in history. About half of these MIPS were specialty engines which were up
80% year-to-year driven by Linux workloads, a good indicator of new workloads moving to the platform.
Growth in z was up 50% in the major markets and up over 65% in the growth markets. In the growth markets, we had
strong sales to our established as well as new mainframe customers. This performance reflects the technology
leadership and value of our vertically integrated stack that IBM's new flagship server is delivering to our customers. It
is simply the fastest and most capable enterprise system to-date.
Turning to Power, while revenue was down 19%, our new P7+ mid-range and high-end power servers performed well.
We will continue the refresh of the power portfolio in the first half of 2013. Our success in competitive take-outs
continued in the fourth quarter. We had over 350 competitive displacements, resulting in over $335 million of business,
about half of which came from Oracle Sun and half from HP.
For the year, we had nearly 1,200 competitive displacements, resulting in over $1 billion of business. Our storage
hardware revenue was down 5%, driven by tape. Disk was flat. Within disk, we announced the new high end DS8870
in October and it was sold out in the quarter. This will continue to ramp in the first quarter. Our Systems and
Technology pre-tax income was up 23% year-to-year driven by new product introductions in mainframe, power storage
and of course PureSystems.
Across all of our segments, we're continuing the strong performance in our key growth initiatives. These are not
standalone offerings, but integrated into our client offerings and included within our segment results. In the growth
markets, our revenue was up 7% at constant currency and these countries now represent 24% of IBM's geographic
revenue. That's up 8 points since 2006 when we introduced our 2010 roadmap. So we've been very successful in
capturing the opportunity in these faster growing markets. We're doing this by continuing to expand into new countries
and territories to build out IT infrastructures in support of economic growth and to take a leadership position in key
industries.
To drive market expansion in 2012, we accelerated our opening of new branch offices. This year we doubled the
number of face-to-face branches, bringing the total number of face-to-face and virtual branches in the growth markets
to almost 450. So this is tremendous growth.
Our Business Analytics initiative continues to expand, allowing clients to make informed decisions everywhere in their
organization to improve outcomes and to manage risk. We made significant strides that expanded our leadership
position in a number of strategic areas, including risk management, price and promotion optimization and sales
performance management, just to name a few. Our value proposition in Business Analytics uniquely leverages the
integration between our Software portfolio and GBS consulting expertise. This year, Business Analytics grew 13% led
by our GBS consulting practice.
Our SmartCloud portfolio addresses the full scope of enterprise client requirements. We've seen continued strong
demand for our foundational offerings in hardware and software that help companies build and run their private clouds
as well as for cloud-based solutions like our SaaS offerings. With strong global growth our cloud revenue for the year
was up 80%. In 2012, we launched our family of PureSystems expert integrated systems as well as our SmartCloud
Enterprise-Plus public and managed private cloud offerings for large enterprises. These offerings further extend our

cloud capabilities.
We saw tremendous expansion of our Smarter Planet growth initiative over the last 12 months, measured in terms of
offerings, markets, customers and revenue. Our clients are leveraging our growing capabilities in areas like Smarter
Commerce or acquisition such as Emptoris, DemandTec and Tealeaf helped fuel growth in new market segments.
Social business, where industry-leading social platform and Kenexa come together in a powerful combination to allow
our clients to engage a smarter, more effective workforce; Smarter Cities, which includes a portfolio of solutions
ranging from public safety to social services to intelligent water systems, and finally, our next-generation analytics
systems like Watson which are helping tackle some of the most complex challenges facing our customers. For the year,
our Smarter Planet solutions generated more than 25% revenue growth. When you look at our offerings in business
analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet, about half of our revenue is software. So as these offerings become larger parts of
the IBM business, they are driving a higher quality revenue stream, improving our mix and our margin.
Turning to cash flow, we generated $9.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, that's up almost 600 million
year-to-year. In line with past years, about half of our annual cash flow is generated in the fourth quarter. And on a
full-year basis, we generated $18.2 billion of free cash flow, which is up $1.6 billion over last year.
Within our strong free cash flow performance, our capital investments are up by almost $250 million. The year-to-year
improvement in free cash flow reflects our growth in net income, and as you'll recall, the fact that our 2011 cash flow
was impacted by income tax payments for audit settlement activity in the first quarter of last year.
When I look at the uses of cash for the year, we continued to return significant value to shareholders, including $3.8
billion in dividends, and we bought back 61 million shares for $12 billion. Net of the cash received from options and
employee stock-related transactions, our cash outflow for share repurchases was $10.5 billion. At the end of the year,
we had $8.7 billion remaining in our buyback authorization.
In addition, we spent $3.7 billion to acquire 11 companies. In the fourth quarter, we acquired Kenexa. Over the course
of the year, we acquired DemandTec, Emptoris, Platform Computing, Tealeaf and Texas Memory Systems, to name a
few, to add to our capabilities in analytics, cloud and Smarter Planet. We also acquired Vivisimo, which expands the
breadth of IBM's big data capabilities and creates the most complete end-to-end big data solution for our clients. Over
the last three years, we've spent $11.5 billion for acquisitions. To wrap up the cash dynamics for the year, we generated
$18.2 billion of free cash flow and spent $18 billion on acquisitions, net share repurchase and dividends.
Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with a cash balance of $11.1 billion. Total debt was $33.3 billion, of
which 24.5 billion was in support of our financing business, which is leveraged at 7 to 1. Our non-financing debt was
$8.8 billion, down $1.6 billion from the third quarter and up $800 million from a year ago.
Now let me spend a minute on our retirement-related plans and the impact to the balance sheet. Despite volatile market
conditions in 2012, we had good returns on global assets, exceeding our expected return on assets in the U.S. and on a
global basis. But the discount rate environment remained challenging, resulting in a $5 billion impact to equity at the
end of the year due to the pension liability remeasurement. As a result, our debt-to-cap ended the year at 36%, up 4
points year-to-year, including a 6 point impact from the pension remeasurement.
At the end of 2012, our defined benefit-qualified plans continued to be well funded and our cash requirements
remained stable. We have included supplemental charts to cover ongoing dynamics of our pension plans. Our balance
sheet remains strong and we continue to have a high degree of financial flexibility.
So now let me wrap up with the drivers of our operating earnings per share performance. Our total revenue
performance had little impact on our profit growth, but we did have good revenue growth in our higher margin areas
which significantly contributed to margin expansion and profit growth. You see this in our margin expansion which
was the largest contributor, driving $0.47 of EPS growth through a combination of gross margin improvements and
expense productivity. And a lower share count resulting from our ongoing share repurchase program contributed $0.24.
Bottom line, we delivered 14% EPS growth in the quarter and 13% for the year. As you can see, the profile for the full
year is very similar to the fourth quarter.

Our results demonstrate the strength and flexibility of IBM's business model, which is designed to deliver profit and
cash on a sustained basis. In 2012, we continued to deliver value to our clients and capitalize on key trends. We had
strong performance in analytics, and cloud and Smarter Planet, key initiatives that leverage our software portfolio and
contribute to our margin expansion. We continued to expand our capabilities and build out infrastructures in emerging
markets. This year our growth markets revenue outpaced major markets by 8 points.
We continued to invest for innovation. Our investments supported the introduction of our new System z mainframe, our
PureSystems offerings, and our new storage and Power7+ products. And we just were named number 1 in U.S. patents
for the twentieth consecutive year, with many of the patents issued this year in key areas like analytics and Big Data,
cyber security, cloud, mobile, social networking, and software-defined environments.
We invested almost $4 billion in 2012 to acquire 11 companies, adding significant capabilities to support our growth
initiatives. At the same time, we divested our Retail Store Solutions business, as we focused our Smarter Commerce
portfolio on the higher value, IP-based opportunities.
So as you can see, in 2012 we continued the transformation of the business, shifting to higher value areas and
improving our structure. This results in a higher quality revenue stream. So while our overall revenue performance was
modest, we had 8% growth in our operating net income and expanded net income margin by 1.6 points, well above our
model level. And we delivered operating EPS growth of 13%, for a decade of double-digit EPS growth, and over $18
billion of free cash flow, a record for IBM. This demonstrates the flexibility of the IBM business model.
In 2013, we'll continue this transformation. We'll acquire key capabilities, divest the businesses, rebalance our
workforce and invest in innovation. Bottom line, we're continuing to retool our skills and our offerings to shift to higher
value and meet our clients' needs. We've taken all of this into account in our view of 2013.
We expect to deliver operating EPS of at least $16.70 for the year with the first half growth rate slightly higher than the
second. And now, two years into our 2015 roadmap, we are well on track to our objective of at least $20 of operating
earnings per share.
Now Patricia and I will take your questions.

Thank you. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your
question.
Bill Shope, Analyst
Okay. Thank you. On your prior earnings call, you had mentioned that the month of September was more challenging
than the first two months of the third quarter. Can you talk about how the broader environment and your execution
evolved into the December quarter? And was there anything unusual this time around that you'd call out in terms of
linearity?

Good question, Bill. Really, if you look at the monthly performance across the quarter, it was really pretty constant. We
saw a good performance through the quarter. Obviously within that, we feel very, very good about the performance we
saw in our Software business with key branded middleware of 6%, breakout performance from our z series content,
revenue up 56%. Within that, the growth markets up, I think, a spectacular 65%, MIPS up 66%, the biggest MIPS
performance in the history of the IBM Corporation and it's ongoing contribution from our base businesses. And with all
that to generate half our free cash flow in the quarter and a total of $18.2 billion, the largest ever, up $1.6 billion
year-to-year, I think that was just a very, very strong quarter, but if you look across the months, it was fairly constantly
month-to-month.

Your next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask your question.
Toni Sacconaghi, Analyst
Yes, thank you. I was wondering if you could comment on your expectation for services revenue growth in 2013. The
reason that I ask is, I think on the fourth quarter call last year, you talked about getting about 3 points of revenue
growth from your backlog-driven businesses and you ended up with services at constant currency about flat this year,
suggesting that non-backlog revenue growth was down about 6% in the year. So if you're looking at backlog revenue
growth, the revenue from backlog only growing about 1% this year, and again, you struggled and had weak current
period revenue growth this year, why shouldn't we be thinking about revenue growth being down in 2013 in the
services business overall?
Mark Loughridge, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Finance
and Enterprise Transformation
Yes, sir. So a very good question. Let's start by looking at our GBS business. So the GBS business, if you look at the
backlog over the last four years, they have actually been growing that backlog each year as they move into 2013. Now
within that, as we explained in our third quarter call dynamics, you see a retooling, if you will, or a mix shift into these
higher value initiatives that are so important to the IBM Corporation because those growth initiatives drive about 50%
software in their mix and so they have a very high profit for the Corporation.
But if you look at that retooling from the GBS perspective, they tend to be longer duration. And so as we look at that
duration and four years of backlog growth, both transactional and in total for GBS, we feel that as we enter 2013, GBS
should once again return to revenue growth.

If you look at the point that you had made on backlog run-out, we included that very discrete chart for the following
reason. If you look at the backlog content, moving into the year, we were impacted to some degree by the contracts that
we restructured as we went through the end of 2011 to 2012 and that magnitude was about a point.
Now that's the point on revenue. How did that perform on a gross profit basis? The fact is, it was a substantial
improvement in our gross profit dollars. In 2012, we had a lot of growth in our GTS business driven by that, but that
improvement in gross profit dollars, in a sense, Toni, it raises the waterline and continues into 2013 and that's a very
big point. That improvement that we saw across those contracts, because we maintained about 80% of the revenue
within those contracts, generally drove a much higher level of gross profit dollars in the ongoing base that we'll enjoy
this year, and in fact, we'll see some modest improvement in the year-to-year gross profit dollars from those contracts
moving into next year.
So net-net, the gross profit dollars coming out of the backlog are much stronger because of that. So we expect the
overall performance of the gross profit dollars coming out of the backlog to be more typical or, say, a 2% backlog
growth, and this is fairly a 1%. At 2% very close to the dynamic we saw last year, and with that dynamic, the services
businesses did a good job of driving to the model.
And I think the last point that I would make in this rollout, we had about $3 billion worth of very strong contracts roll
out of the fourth quarter into the first quarter. We've already closed a billion of this. And if you look at the complexion
of those contracts, they come in the -- many of them in the growth markets where we're having real success on that
operation deliverables and the value-add that we are showing our customer base, you see it reflected really in the
backlog in our growth markets, which on a total services base, that backlog is up 15%, so really strong performance on
that basis.
You put all that together, we feel very confident as we go into 2013 that the profit generation from our services
business in total should meet our model expectations, and frankly, if you look at the first quarter of 2013, we think that
the services business ought to generate double-digit profit growth.

The next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays. You may ask your question.
Benjamin Reitzes, Analyst
Yeah. Hi, Mark, I wanted to talk a little bit more about your roadmap. Your tone sounds a lot better than three months
ago. You've grown EPS over the last three years in the mid-teens, maybe 14% average or so and 13.5% this year. And
in order to make the roadmap, all you have to do is grow 9.5% the next three years to get there. So that would be slower
than you've been doing. Can you talk about your confidence in overachievement, maybe preview some of the tone in
what you may say at your Analyst Day coming up soon?
Mark Loughridge, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Finance
and Enterprise Transformation
Sure. Well, I think when you look at that at least number for 2013 at $16.70, that -- I would have said it, Ben, that
rounds to $10, but at any rate at $16.70 that's the at least number for the beginning of year. And I think if you look at
that relative position, that's pretty consistent with what we've said the last couple of years. Additionally, I'd point out,

when you look at the generation of value from the Corporation, I think it's worth stepping back just recognizing that the
performance that we saw in 2012 was, in fact, the 10th year of double-digit EPS growth out of this place. That is a
pretty big number. So underneath it, to drive that, we've driven this business to big growth opportunities in the
high-value, higher-margin spaces.
Stepping back again, you think about since 2010 alone, we've invested $19 billion in R&D, $12 billion in 34
acquisitions. If you look at the enterprise productivity initiatives that we're driving for $8 billion over the roadmap,
fully about 60% of that is driven to reinvest in growth initiatives like GMU, Smarter Planet, cloud and business
analytics. So from my perspective to drive that level of performance, we're plowing investments hand over fist back
into the business.
Now, what are the results are we seeing this? Well, let's look at Software. Since 2000, Software has gone from $2.4
billion annually, 2012 we did $4 billion in the fourth quarter alone and $11 billion for the year. Free cash flow, that
$18.2 billion that we talked about, 2000, it was $6.7 million and in the fourth quarter of '12 we had the largest MIPS
shipment in the history of the Corporation with our GMU content going from 16% of our business mix to 24% since
the 2006 initiation of the business model.
So I think as we look forward, those growth initiatives, the effect that they're having, their ability to continue to move
that higher value content and continue that growth gives us a lot of confidence not only in what we'd see in 2013, but
our remaining roadmap to 2015.

Sorry. A question on the Power side. I guess the 90% decline, I was a little surprised that, particularly since you had
indicated you had a new high-end product. Is this the UNIX business finally kind of turning over like everybody else's?
And I was also curious how much of your PureSystems, what's sort of the hardware breakout there x86 versus Power?

Well, if you look at -- for your first question, Steve, one thing that we've recognized in the kind of rollout of the cycle
of product introduction, when we introduced the new z cycle product, it hits right with the announcement and you've
seen that in the performance that we've generated in this fourth quarter.
Frankly, in a Power Systems announcement, many of those volumes go to our customers in product test evaluation
before that customer goes to volume shipment. And so generally in a power announcement, volume shipment
especially for mid-range and high-end, which we had in our announcement, that will lag by a couple of quarters. So I
wouldn't really expect to see the volume shipment against those announcements till we get into the second quarter of
2013.
Now, with that, Power once again had a very strong competitive replacement; 330 customers, over 300 million, and if
you look at that mix, about half from HP and half from Oracle Sun, so -- but the effect of that overall volume shipment
really we'll see about the second quarter of 2013.

The next question comes from David Grossman with Stifel Nicolaus. You may ask your question.
David Grossman, Analyst
Thanks. Mark, can we just follow up a question that was asked earlier. Obviously, the focus on margin impacts revenue
growth, so how should we really think about this tradeoff as we go forward through the roadmap? As revenue growth
accelerates, should we prepare for margin expansion to moderate even though we are getting some benefit from mix?
Mark Loughridge, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Finance
and Enterprise Transformation
Well, I guess, I would look at it this way. First of all, let's look at the operational model-driven plays to drive margin,
and if you looked at our -- maybe one way to look at the -- let's look at the fourth quarter. So fourth quarter PTI margin
expanded by 2.1 points, so that's about $2 billion, and I would attribute about half of that to the ongoing effect of the
model-driven initiatives for margin, and those two model-driven initiatives are continuing to mix the higher margin
categories like the Software business. And then the second category would be all of the spend takeout that we see in
kind of the support structures around the business that we call the globally integrated enterprise.
Well, I don't think either of those impact your go-to-market pricing content that you see in your business. That
go-to-market pricing content is really going to be dependent on the competitiveness of your offerings at the client, not
the spend structure in your back-office enterprise, nor will that margin improvement impact revenue growth simply by
mixing into the higher margin spaces like Software.
And I think if you looked at that 2.1 points of margin growth in the fourth quarter, I would attribute about half of that to
those ongoing initiatives we have to drive performance in margin for the business units.

The other half were unique items that we drove during the year. So a good example of unique item that did drive real
profitability was the work we did on those contracts we did in services to restructure them with our customers. We've
maintained about 80% of the revenue, but the profit generation out of it was quite significant. And that play alone
produced about a third of that balance of 1 point of margin growth in the $1 billion. That generation is going to
continue into 2013 because once again I would describe that as if we've raised the water level on the ongoing contract
performance.

The next question comes from Rob Cihra with Evercore Partners. You may ask your question.
Rob Cihra, Analyst
Hi, thanks very much. I was wondering what -- the Software shortfall you had in Q3, a meaningful part of that at the
time you had attributed to growth markets, and it looks like obviously you closed that in Q4. I'm just wondering if that's
you feel a function of growth markets environment getting better, or were you simply able to close those and yet you're
still looking at growth markets that maybe the environment is still weak. So I'm just wondering how much of that is
sort of improvement in the environment or simply you're booking those and the environment is still soft? Thanks.
Mark Loughridge, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Finance
and Enterprise Transformation
I think we had performance in the fourth quarter from our Software business that was more consistent with the ongoing
performance we're looking for in their business model. So I think they did a pretty strong job here as they went through
the quarter.
Let's just go through some of the elements. Lotus, up 9%, gained share; IDC now ranks them number one in bringing
social software to the business environment. Tivoli grew 5% against strength in the overall storage offerings; Rational,
12%, gained share; WebSphere, 11%, gained share; Information Management, up 3%. So if you look across that base
of business, we had very strong performance across the board. I thought they did a very nice job in transitioning from
the third quarter. And as we looked at 2013, we think we ought to be looking at revenue growth in the mid-single digits
and very strong profit performance once again.

18 months. What do you see with POWER7+? Thanks.
Mark Loughridge, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Finance

Well, I think we'll get a pretty strong product cycle out of it. As I'd said earlier, the characteristic that I would focus on
here is the couple of quarters it takes to get the volumes shipped, but we think we should have a very strong set of
offerings with strength building as we go through the year. And as I said, in the marketplace, it's performing quite well
on a competitive basis.

The next question comes from Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.
Mark Moskowitz, Analyst
Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. Mark, I had a question. As we think about 2013, you've done a great job in terms of
optimizing the operating margin profile. How should we think about the various kind of rates of contribution for 2013
in terms of incremental contribution to margin in terms of, A, is it going to really from a mix driven up to Software or
B, is it going to be increasing level of optimization of Software and less labor in Services, or C, will it be more about
just OpEx reductions in general?
Mark Loughridge, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Finance
and Enterprise Transformation
If you look at the overall performance basis, it's really those two very strong plays that we're driving through the model,
both with good results in 2012 and we think we'll present good results in 2013 as well. The first of all being the
ongoing mix in the higher value, higher margin spaces. I mean, again, the best example of that would be the
tremendous progress, I think, we've made in our Software business. Again, I gave earlier this statistic, but I think it's
kind of remarkable that in 2000 we're doing $2.4 billion. Last year we did $11 billion. So that ongoing mix to Software,
we think, should continue.
And then supplementing that will be all the work that we have ongoing in that $8 billion of focused spend that we
talked about in our globally integrated enterprise initiatives. Now, one point I want to make clear in that $8 billion, we
do work to drive about 40% of that to the bottom line, but the other 60% is firmly dedicated to remixing our spend
profile and our resources to those higher growth, higher margin initiatives like Business Analytics, Smarter Planet,
cloud computing. And if you look at the business mix within those, about 50% of the revenue mix within those
initiatives is Software. So much higher Software mix that we see in the base business, that too should help propel our

mix in the higher merging content.

Thank you, Mark. Operator, can we please take the next question?
Operator
The next question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. You may ask your question.
Keith Bachman, Analyst
Hi, thank you, Mark. You previously spoke to your thought, excuse me, Software would have kind of mid-single digits
as you look at calendar year '13. I want to see if you could specifically address then the services and the systems part of
the business. I don't -- I think to Toni's question, you said you thought GBS would have positive revenue growth, but I
didn't hear a GTS number. So if you could speak to both the services element if you think in constant currency collars
whether that will have positive revenue growth in any metrics and then the same question for the hardware system side,
please?
Mark Loughridge, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Finance
and Enterprise Transformation
Okay. Let's -- I think the best framework I can give you on the services side, and I am not going to walk through each
of the elements, but on the services side, we built that view of backlog run-out in the presentation and that covers about
70% of the revenue that we realized in the year. So another way to look at that, we already have 70% of revenue as we
enter the year, but in that, the math would say, it's up 1%, but the point I was making as we are more explicit about the
dynamics is really from a profit standpoint, it should perform more like a business that has a backlog run-out of closer
to 2%.
Now, the dynamics underneath that, just given the backlog growth that we have in our GBS business, should move
GBS into positive revenue performance as we go through the year, but I think the more important aspect of that is that
revenue performance, that better mix of contract profile within the business, closing out on those $3 billion of deals that
rolled across the deadline, that should generate model level profit performance at our services business. And as I said
earlier, we would think it would drive kind of double-digit profit as we're going to its first quarter.
From a hardware standpoint, as we go into 2013, that first half is really going to be defined by the z series momentum
that we have going to and we would expect that that would help us drive double-digit profit in the first half as well.
And on the Software base of business, with key branded middleware at 6% in the fourth quarter, we'd expect as we had
said earlier, mid-single digit revenue performance and a very strong profit contribution as well. So all those things put
together, give us confidence in the at least $16.70 of earnings per share that we pointed out for the year.

Chris Whitmore, Analyst
Thanks very much. Just to follow up on Keith's question, I believe in earlier comments, you've indicated earnings will
be a little bit more front-half loaded than the second half loaded. Can you talk through the dynamics that would drive
that type of unusual seasonality in 2013? Thanks a lot.
Mark Loughridge, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Finance
and Enterprise Transformation
Yeah, absolutely. So when you look at the seasonality in the year, I'd make a couple of comments. First of all, the
year-to-year performance across the quarters is relatively similar, but will be more pronounced in the first half of the
year, and that's really driven by kind of the z series content and the z series dynamic. Remember, by the time we get to
fourth quarter of next year, we'll be facing the big announcement in the rearview mirror. So I do expect that the first
half of the year should be better growth than we see in the second half, but we still expect to have a good second half.
Now, within the first quarter, the additional comment I would make is really we'd kind of expect to see a little better
performance in the second quarter compared to the first quarter and that comes down to Easter. This year, Easter falls
in that last week of March, and we've seen that in especially in countries where Easter is a major holiday, that tends to
move that business because you just have more difficulty getting hold of your clients and your customer base at the end
of the quarter, and those contracts will generally roll through to April.
So once again, a little stronger performance in the first half than the second half, but a good second half of that. And
within the first half, a little more strength in the second quarter than we would see in the first quarter based on the
calendar date for Easter.
So with that, let me take the opportunity to wrap up the call. Our 2012 results demonstrate the flexibility of IBM's
business model. We had strong performance in our growth initiatives, especially in our higher value areas. We
expanded our margins and had excellent profit growth, which drove our 10th consecutive year of double-digit EPS
growth and we generated over $80 billion of free cash flow, which was up $1.6 billion year-to-year and a record for
IBM.
So in 2013, we will continue to move our business forward, shifting to higher value and improving efficiency. We're
going to buy businesses, we're going to sell businesses, we're going to rebalance our resources, align those to
opportunities and continue to invest in innovation. Now, all of this is captured in our view of 2013. We're confident in
our ability to deliver at least $16.70 for the year on our way to our objective of at least $20 in 2015.
So thank you again for joining us today. And now as always, it's back to work.
