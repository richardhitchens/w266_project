Good morning. This is Dane Holmes, Head of Investor Relations at Goldman Sachs. Welcome to our fourth quarter
earnings conference call.
Today's call may include forward-looking statements. These statements represent the firm's belief regarding future
events that by their nature are uncertain and outside of the firm's control. The firm's actual results and financial
condition may differ, possibly materially, from what is indicated in those forward-looking statements.
For discussion of some of the risks and factors that could affect the firm's future results, please see the description of
risk factors in our current annual report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December, 2012. I would also direct
you to read the forward-looking disclaimers in our quarterly earnings release, particularly as it relates to our investment

Harvey M. Schwartz
Thanks, Dane, and thanks to everyone for dialing in. I'll walk you through our full year and fourth quarter results, then
I'm obviously happy to answer any questions.
Let's start with the annual results. We had firm-wide net revenues of $34.2 billion, net earnings of $8 billion, earnings
per diluted share of $15.46 and a return on common equity of 11%. This is a solid result and a modest improvement
over last year's performance despite what at times was a difficult operating environment.
With regard to the fourth quarter, net revenues were $8.8 billion, net earnings were $2.3 billion, and earnings per
diluted share were $4.60.
In looking at the broader operating environment, many of the global themes that dominated 2012, for example,
improving economic data in the United States, central bank activity and political uncertainty, continued into 2013.
Starting with U.S. economic data, we saw a relatively consistent improvement over the course of the year, reported
GDP consensus estimates in each of the last two quarters, U.S. employment rate declined by over 100 basis points to
6.7%, its lowest level since October of 2008, and housing prices as reflected by the Case-Shiller Housing Price Index
increased by 14% through October. 2013 represented a slow, steady improvement in the U.S. economy, which at
roughly a quarter of global GDP, naturally served as a stabilizing and positive influence on global market sentiment.
2013 was also marked by significant central bank activity. In Japan, the central bank announced unprecedented
monetary stimulus to achieve stated inflation targets. Japanese credit spreads tightened and the yen weakened
throughout the year. In addition, the Nikkei enjoyed its largest annual gain since 1972. In the U.S., initial commentary
from the Federal Reserve about tapering its bond-buying program ultimately translated into a December announcement
of a $10 billion monthly reduction in the program leading the marketplace to contemplate a world without quantitative
easing.
Finally, political risk and uncertainty were constant during the year, starting with the Italian elections in the first
quarter, continued unrest in the Middle East and the 16-day U.S. government shutdown. This created an environment
that required clients to constantly reassess their outlook for the global economy. For example, what are the implications
of central bank activity on the global economy, individual regional economies, and specific industry sectors? What are
the pushes and pulls associated with monetary policy versus fiscal policy? Are rising rates and tapering a headwind for
the U.S. economic recovery, or a return to a more traditional supply and demand-driven economy? Not surprisingly,
our clients' activity fluctuated over the course of the year as they were constantly digesting new information.
When you boil it all down, the 2013 environment, it's just one where the world took two steps forward followed by one
step back, a dynamic that you could see reflected in both price movements in the markets and client activity. To sum it
up, while we wouldn't characterize the last two years as a normal cyclical environment given all of the items I
previously listed, it shouldn't be lost on us that the long-term trend is slowly and steadily improving.
Now I'll discuss each of our businesses. In Investment Banking, we produced fourth quarter net revenues of $1.7
billion, up 47% from the third quarter. Three factors drove the increase: a robust IPO calendar, higher completed M&A
volumes, and debt financing activity that remained strong. For the full year, Investment Banking net revenues were $6
billion, up 22% from 2012 on the back of solid underwriting activity.

Breaking down the components of Investment Banking, advisory revenues were $585 million in the fourth quarter. The
38% increase relative to the third quarter reflects the increase in industry-wide completed M&A. Goldman Sachs
continued to be ranked first in worldwide announced and completed M&A for 2013. We advised on a number of
significant transactions that closed during the fourth quarter, including Vivendi's $8.2 billion sale of its controlling
stake in Activision, Ingersoll Rand's $5.3 billion spin-off of Allegion, and the $2.9 billion sale of Saks to Hudson's Bay.
We also advised on a number of important transactions that were announced during the fourth quarter, including
Sysco's $8.2 billion acquisition of US Foods, ViroPharma's $4.2 billion sale to Shire, and Deutsche Telekom's €2
billion sale of Scout24 to Hellman & Friedman.
Moving to underwriting, net revenues were a record $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, up 52% sequentially as equity
issuance improved significantly. Equity underwriting revenues of $622 million were more than double our third quarter
results, largely due to an increase in IPOs and convertibles. Goldman Sachs continued to be ranked first in worldwide
equity, equity-related and common stock offerings for 2013. Debt underwriting revenues increased 9% to $511 million.
During the fourth quarter, we actively supported our clients' financing needs, participating in Darling International's
$2.7 billion debt and equity offering, Twitter's $2.1 billion IPO, and Moncler's $1.1 billion IPO. Our Investment
Banking backlog further improved from third quarter levels, which you will recall were already at our highest level in
five years.
Turning to Institutional Client Services, which comprises both our FICC and equity businesses, net revenues were $3.4
billion in the fourth quarter, up 19% compared to the more challenging environment in the third quarter. For the full
year, $15.7 billion of net revenues were down 13% relative to 2012.
FICC client execution net revenues were $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter, or $1.9 billion excluding DVA losses of
$163 million. Excluding DVA, revenues were up 46% sequentially. In particular, currency revenues increased
significantly compared to a challenging third quarter. Credit was up on stronger client activity that was supported by
tighter credit spreads and solid issuance trends. Commodities revenues were largely flat sequentially and remain
depressed by lower volatility and client activity levels. Rates and mortgages declined as client activity levels remain
low.
For the full year, FICC client execution net revenues were $8.7 billion, or $8.9 billion excluding $220 million in DVA
losses. Excluding DVA, revenues were down 14% relative to 2012 as macro uncertainty, particularly around central
bank policies, and lower volatility levels impacted client risk appetite and activity. The decline was more pronounced
for rates and mortgages.
In equities, which includes equities client execution, commissions and fees and security services, net revenues for the
fourth quarter were $1.7 billion, up 4% sequentially and included $43 million in DVA losses. Equities client execution
revenues increased 9% sequentially to $598 million. Commissions and fees were $747 million, up 3% relative to the
third quarter supported by rising equity markets and strong issuance trends. Securities services generated net revenues
of $337 million, largely consistent with the third quarter.
For the full year, equities produced net revenues of $7.1 billion, down 14% relative to 2012. This decline was due to
the sale of our Americas reinsurance business in 2013 and the sale of our hedge fund administration business in 2012.
In our equity business during 2013, stronger performance in cash products was offset by weaker derivative revenues.
Turning to risk, average daily VAR in the fourth quarter was $81 million, down from $84 million in the third quarter.
Moving on to our Investing & Lending activities, collectively, these businesses produced net revenues of $2.1 billion in
the fourth quarter. Equity securities generated net revenues of $1.4 billion, primarily reflecting company-specific
events including initial public offerings and gains in public equity investments. Net revenues from debt securities and
loans were $423 million and benefited from net gains and net interest income. Other revenues of $234 million include
the firm's consolidated investments.
For the full year, Investing & Lending generated net revenues of $7 billion driven by $3.9 billion in gains from equity
securities, $1.9 billion of net revenues from debt securities and loans, and $1.1 billion of other investments.

In Investment Management we reported fourth quarter net revenues of $1.6 billion, up 31% from the third quarter
primarily as a result of $333 million in incentive fees generated largely from the firm's alternative asset products.
Management and other fees were up 5% sequentially at $1.1 billion.
For the full year, Investment Management net revenues were $5.5 billion, up 5% from 2012 on stronger management
and other fees, which benefited from growth in assets under supervision. During the fourth quarter, assets under
supervision increased $51 billion to a record $1.04 trillion. This growth was driven by long-term net inflows of $13
billion, largely in fixed income assets. We also had market appreciation of $20 billion, largely in equity assets. On a
full-year basis, $41 billion of long-term net inflows and $40 billion in market appreciation drove these record levels of
assets under supervision.
When it comes to Investment Management, we all know that performance is critical. We are intensely focused on
delivering returns for our Investment Management clients and have seen improvement in our multi-year performance.
The $41 billion of long-term net inflows in 2013 were the highest annually since the onset of the crisis. We will
continue to focus on delivering performance for our clients and have confidence that the rest will follow in due course.
Now let me turn to expenses. Compensation and benefits expense, which includes salaries, bonuses, amortization of
prior year equity awards and other items, such as benefits, decreased 3% to $12.6 billion for 2013, and translated into a
compensation to net revenues ratio of 36.9%. Fourth quarter non-compensation expenses were $3 billion, 40% higher
than the third quarter and up slightly compared with the fourth quarter of 2012. Other expenses were significantly
higher, reflecting net provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings of $561 million, more than $400 million
higher than the third quarter. Depreciation and amortization included $196 million in impairment charges, primarily
related to consolidated investments.
Finally, the fourth quarter also included a $155 million donation to Goldman Sachs Gives, our donor advised charitable
fund. For the full year, non-compensation expenses were down 2%. Total staff at year-end was approximately 32,900,
up 2% from year-end 2012.
Our effective tax rate was 31.5% for 2013.
Before moving onto capital, it's worth taking a step back to review our improvement in operating efficiency over the
past few years. In the first half of 2011, we announced a comprehensive expense initiative. If you look at our cost
structure this year versus 2010, before we launched our expense initiative, total expenses are lower by $3.8 billion. As a
result, our pre-tax margin in 2013 increased 140 basis points to its highest level in the last four years, this despite
having $5 billion less in revenues.
Delivering more operating efficiency is never easy and requires a real focus on striking the right balance. By balance, I
mean making sure that our actions position us to deliver for all of our constituents: our clients, our regulators, our
employees, the broader financial system and, of course, for our shareholders. We believe this early and ongoing focus
on our expense structure has not only benefited recent performance but more importantly also serves as the basis for
better results in the future, particularly as the opportunity set expands.
Now regarding capital, we repurchased 8.5 million shares of common stock for a total cost of $1.4 billion during the
quarter. For the full year, we repurchased 39.3 million shares for a total cost of $6.2 billion.
With respect to our regulatory capital ratios our BASIL III Tier 1common ratio on a fully loaded basis was 9.8% using
the advanced approach. Under the standardized approach our ratio was 9.2%. Of course, it's important to note that our
transitional ratios are both more than 100 basis points higher.
Risk weighted assets under the advanced approach are approximately $595 billion, $350 billion in credit risk, $160
billion in market risk and about $85 billion in operational risk. Our estimate for the proposed supplementary leverage
ratio under U.S. rules remains approximately 5% for the firm and approximately 6% for the bank. These are our best
estimates, subject to change depending on regulatory clarifications.

Of course last month, we also gained regulatory clarity on the Volcker Rule. Most importantly, the final Volcker Rule
explicitly permitted market making, lending, and investing on balance sheets. Regulators permitted these activities
given the essential role that they play in supporting healthy capital markets and economic growth.
Although we only received the finalized Volcker Rule last month, we've obviously been preparing to comply with
certain portions of the rule for nearly three years. In 2010, we began closing down our proprietary trading operations,
specifically Goldman Sachs Principal Strategies and our global macro proprietary trading desk. In addition, we
announced in 2012 our intention to redeem certain hedge fund investments. Since 2012, we have redeemed
approximately $2.2 billion of hedge fund investments and we will continue to redeem our interest. Now that we have a
final rule, the first thing that we did was establish a Volcker implementation team comprised of senior leaders with
expertise across a wide variety of control and business functions. They are focused on making sure that with are in the
position to effectively and efficiently meet the numerous requirements outlined under this new and intense compliance
regime.
In summary, as I mentioned earlier, while we're still not in what I would described as a normalized cyclical
environment, the underlying macro trend has been improving. To maximize our opportunity set and drive shareholder
value we need to continue to focus first and foremost on our clients. Their activity and our connectivity to their needs is
our highest priority. We need to continue to recruit and retain a high caliber and dedicated global workforce. We need
to leverage our technology expertise to adapt to new regulations and evolving market structures. And we need to
remain focused on improving our efficiency, both from a cost and a capital perspective.
Our goal is not only to enhance returns in the current environment, but more importantly over the long-term to position
the firm for significant operating leverage as the opportunity set improves. We believe that we have the competitive
position, the diversity of businesses, the caliber of people, and the institutional will to capture and maximize these
opportunities as they present themselves for the benefit of you, our shareholders.
Thank you again for dialing in. And now, I'm happy to answer any questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI. Please, go ahead.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Thanks very much.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Good morning, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Good morning. Just a quick follow-up. I heard all of your comments on Volcker. Just making
sure the hedging component, you mentioned about market making, lending, investing, anything different on the
verbiage related to hedging your ability to just manage risk across the desk?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, we don't see anything in the rule that prevents us from continuing to hedge. I think
the early concerns before the final rule came out was this reference to portfolio hedging, but we hedge within the
businesses. There's no hedging at the firm wide level. Hedges are hedges.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Good, good, good. Also, the Fed recently just put out a quick white paper ahead of testimony
on commodities. I think a lot of that was expected, but I am curious to get your updated thoughts on plans for the
business, but there was a piece in there that threw me for a loop a little bit, on the merchant banking and I wasn't sure if
it relates to your entire merchant banking business or merchant banking in commodities businesses. So, if you could
give quick thoughts on that. I know it just came out. That would be helpful.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, it's fine. It's an important question. So, as you know, the commodity business has
been an important business for Goldman Sachs and quite important for our clients for an extended period of time. I
think to simplify it, I would breakdown the business really in two parts. There's our activity that relates to investing

activities, and then there's our franchise business where we're working with clients in our market making activities. And
in that function, we're essentially providing the same services as anyone would working with a Treasurer or CFO on
any risk that they would be hedging.
So, in terms of a Corporate Treasurer, if they need to manage their exposure to dollar yen, they'll work with us in our
currency business. And if they need to manage their exposure to a cost input in commodities, they'll work with us on
the same hedging profile. So, that's a high-level how the business breaks down. On the investing side, we've been an
important provider of capital and working with our clients through a capital-intensive industry.
I think, as it relates to the white paper, I think it's a good step. It's another step in the regulatory process where people
are reviewing the businesses. I think the questions make sense. These are things that we consider all the time in our
businesses, from the safety and soundness perspective, so I think it's a healthy exercise and we'll work with the
regulators, but certainly no change in strategy from Goldman Sachs as it relates to commodities. It's just too important a
business for our clients.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Appreciate that. The merchant banking component within that paper, it seems to be chucked
in at the end. Is that questioning whether we limit bank holding companies' ability to do merchant banking in totality or
within the commodity space?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Don't know. Don't have any special insight in terms of that, so we'll see as it moves
along. I don't want to minimize it but it's a question.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. Moving on. FEA-- You guys have been doing this for a while. Some banks are catching
up. I'm just curious on if more of the competition is accounting for their credit spreads in pricing, does that make the
business on more equal footing? Do you envision an impact on the actual pricing of the business and the competitive
landscape?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Obviously there's been a lot of attention to FEA over the last couple of days. Obviously,
you're aware of this, Glenn, but we incorporated FEA into our pricing methodologies back in 2010, and if you take a
step back for a second, and just from a general risk management perspective and the way we think about risk parameter
and inputs, if we identify a cost or a parameter we try to incorporate it as quickly as possible. And so, we adopted this
in 2010.
In terms of its implications, I think there are probably two. One is really more for you and folks on your side of the
table, which is, obviously, it has some degree of distorting effect when you look at things like revenue market share.
And it's one reason why we look at revenue market share but we don't emphasize it as much as you do, necessarily,
because these pricing inconsistencies they can lead to anomalies at certain points in time.
I think the more important issue, really, in terms of how we run the business is the one that you mentioned, which is,
regardless of what the particular asset class is, if one firm, let's say Goldman Sachs in this particular case, ends up
being the one firm that is actually pricing a parameter, and all of the other competitors aren't. It leads to challenging
conversations with the clients because you look like an outlier. And so, to get to the gut of your question, the extent to
which the playing field is level and everyone is pricing on the same terms and managing their risk the same way,
obviously, we prefer that. But in the end, we're always going to prioritize the risk management over things like market
share.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Pretty consistent. All right, thanks very much, appreciate it.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Glenn, thanks.

<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hey, Matt, how are you.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Good, thank you. The question I get asked most often when I talk to clients about you guys
is how you can improve the ROE over time. To be fair, the 11% for the year is above many peers, especially if you
adjust for the business mix. As we think about, obviously, revenue as a driver, but if revenue stays kind of in this type
of environment, what you can do to optimize the capital and there's still some expense opportunities even after all of
the progress you've made to date?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: If you go back again a couple of years ago, we really were focused on building operating
leverage into the enterprise. And I think, at the end of last year you saw that reflected in the response as sort of our
performance with a 10.7% ROE. And this year, you're seeing increasing operating leverage, but obviously it's
important to see the back-to-back consistency.
Now, we are always looking to be more efficient. We could certainly do things – we're far from perfect. We can
certainly do things in terms of capital efficiency and expenses and we're constantly looking at how to leverage
technology, particularly as we get more visibility into finalized rules so we can adapt. I would say my comments before
about finding balance, as we've been doing this, the most important thing is we want to make sure we're well positioned
for our clients when revenue opportunities do look better. And I think you see it kind of across the board in terms of
market share in investment banking, league table presence, growth in asset management. All across our businesses,
you're seeing that we are trying to find that balance. We don't always get these things right, but that's really what we're
trying to do.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: I guess as a follow up, this is just a general question for you and the industry. When people
look at the fixed income environment I think there's a lot of focus on all of the structural changes occurring and a
concern that there will be revenue pressures, but I also get the sense that there hasn't been maybe an entire adjustment
to that franchise or to the platform as people wait to see what all of the new rules are and kind of when the Fed's out of
buying bonds, what happens to that market. I am just wondering, is that an area where there might be some capacity
adjustments we could see for the industry as a whole?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So, it's a really good question. I'm going to break it down into two parts.
On the first part, in terms of the impact of regulation, I think it's early. We haven't even really seen the launch of things
like swap execution facilities. And, the real impact is ultimately in how market structures adjust. I do think, though, that
the big impact from a regulation perspective is the fact that the entire industry is carrying more capital. And I think
implicit in your question, but you should correct me if I'm not hearing it correctly, is it would appear that perhaps
there's excess capacity in the industry.
Now, we've been building a lot of operating leverage into our fixed income franchise over the last couple of years and
at the same time we feel very comfortable with our relative position in all of our businesses. And so to the extent at
which capacity comes out, we think we'll benefit from that in terms of our competitors exiting businesses, but we'll
have to see. We're just focused on doing what we can with our opportunity set.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay, that's helpful. Thank you very much.

reposition the business, I guess what inning do you feel you are in terms of repositioning?
And then at some point you sold some of the U.S. reinsurance business I think to Europeans there. At some point do
you need to be able to either redeploy more than your earnings in terms of capital, or are you seeing enough
opportunities globally as the economy and the macro environment improves that you can start reinvesting to generate
higher returns?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So, it's a great question. So obviously we've taken a number of steps over the past several
years in terms of selling businesses that because of rule changes were, quite frankly, just better held in other people's
hands that wouldn't provide the proper returns. And as I said, under the hood we've been building in as much operating
flexibility into, for example, our fixed income franchise as we can during this portion of the environment.
I would say with respect to capital, first and foremost we just want to make sure the firm is positioned safely and
defensively and at the same time we can be offensive when opportunities present themselves. But it's really going to be
determined by client activity, economic growth, confidence. That will be the opportunity set and we'll just adjust. It
will always be incremental. You'll see us make incremental steps. You've seen us move, selling things, but you'll see us
make incremental steps. But really now it's about that balance because we don't want to forego the upside.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay, that's helpful. And just on the banking side, you mentioned the pipeline remains
strong. It feels like we are coming off of a very strong 2013 just given particularly on the equity side and even on the
debt side. But when you look at the outlook, you look at the conversations, is it possible to have multiple years,
meaning 2014, 2015, with an improving economy where the Investment Banking revenues are continuing to grow off
this base? And maybe partially it's because we've had five years of pretty anemic activity in some areas. Just want you
to get your outlook because there's some view that 2013 was a great year in some spots and so the growth rate from
here might be tougher.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: It's a good question. So, if you sort of just think about our Investment Banking franchise
and you break it down between, let's just say, underwriting on one side and advisory services, the merger business, on
the other, the underwriting activities, clearly there's a market component to that in terms of timing credit spreads,
people looking to put capital to work. And then obviously you saw it in the fourth quarter, a big uptick in equity
underwriting. The market was there.
The advisory business – for a CEO making a decision around a merger, it's a career-defining decision. And against a
backdrop, again, go back and look at 2013, against a backdrop where in one quarter you're contemplating what does
tapering mean, and then two quarters later you're contemplating a government shutdown. That's a difficult backdrop to
make a career-defining decision. And so it's going to lag. You're going to see pick up in M&A activity in sectors where
you see global confidence. And so not surprising to us at all and we've been very protective of that franchise, obviously
a leading franchise.
Now, as it relates to some of the other markets, so for example take the debt market, one thing I've learned in the last
year because I think it was one of the most frequently asked questions I got at the end of last year, is what does the debt
underwriting look like in the environment in 2013? I couldn't have told you that there would be as much activity as
there was. We just respond to it and we look to deliver for our clients in it.
Now, you could paint a picture of a declining debt environment, but also you could see debt transactions of significance
linked to mergers. We've seen some of that. Europe recovery and a long-term shift to the capital markets, growth
markets shifting more towards capital markets – these are very long-term trends that are in place. But we'll see.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Okay. And then just last question on FICC. I guess given some of the near term trends that
we could see, just wanted to get an update on how you see some of this transition of the OTC market on to these swap
execution facility platforms. Maybe we'll get it mid-February. Who knows if we'll get a delay. But it seems like
clearing was fine last year. I just want to get your sense on talking to clients, talking to customers. Is it progressing so
we don't have many hitches, or is it a little bit more challenging?

<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Sure. I actually think the regulator's approach and all of the industry participants, clients,
exchanges and clearers, I thought that the process of clearing, I don't know you could give it higher marks. It was done
in stages. It was very orderly. I think the issue with swap execution facilities is obviously there's a big technology build
and a change in behavior across all of our clients.
And so the only thing I would say about it, and we'll have to see what happens in February, I think that measured
approach to clearing was quite thoughtful and I know there's lots of discussion about the approach. The burden's on all
of us to make sure that as an industry we adopt these protocols. A lot of burden obviously on swap execution facilities
because they're at the center of all of this connectivity. But clients need to be ready. It's hard for me to gauge their
preparedness. But I think if it was staged, and I don't mean extended, but I think if it was staged and it mirrored the
approach to clearing, I think at the margin, maybe it's just more prudent.
<Q - Michael R. Carrier>: Yep, that's helpful. All right, thanks, Harvey.

Your next question is from the line of Roger Freeman with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hey, Roger.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Hi, good morning. I guess on I&L can you just remind us what you think the,
obviously the market conditions dependent, but what the realization profile looks like in terms of the tail? I mean is this
kind of still a couple three years of mature investments that we'll see coming out?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So, obviously, and we talked about this during the course of the year, it's been an
environment that has been favorable for harvesting. So you're seeing that as we go through but we're also seeing
interesting opportunities around the globe for investing. But you're seeing the performance as it comes through.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay. How should we think about the comp ratio? There probably is not as explicit
there, but how do you think about compensation on those and how it is beneficial throughout the sort of managing
competition around the firm?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So, absolutely no change to how we're thinking about compensation. First, we manage
the compensation across the firm as a collection of businesses; pay is based on firm performance, then we go into the
divisions and obviously down to the individual. And so obviously as our largest expense, we spend significant time on
it. I think you're seeing the benefit of some of the tough cost cutting that we embedded into the business over the last
couple of years.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay. And I guess one more on I&L. With Volcker out of the way now, do you
think you've got enough clarity around all of the rules, the capital requirements, et cetera, to step up investing on
balance sheet again if the opportunity sets are there?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: The short answer is yes, but I would break down regulatory clarity from the opportunity
set. The opportunity set is going to be driven by what we see working with our clients and being very disciplined about
returns as we have in the past. In terms of the rule set; the rule set gives a road map for the various alternatives under
which you can undertake the activities. You can invest with your clients in 3% funds. You can work within other
Volcker compliant structures and obviously we can lend and we can invest off our balance sheet. That speaks to how.
The when and working with clients, that will be opportunity driven.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: Okay. And separately, you mentioned that you thought we're still not quite in a
normal cyclical cycle, so I guess how far off do you think we are – not time wise, but how much of an impact are these
other things having and at this point what would you say the top two or three sort of issues are that are keeping you
from saying this is within the bounds of the cyclical, cyclical norms.

<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: What I was really trying to underscore there are some of the things I mentioned earlier,
which is focusing on a shift from quantitative easing to tapering or the entire financial architecture adjusting to
multiyear processes and regulatory reform or a government shutdown. Again, these are not normal characteristics of a
cycle and so, I referenced it in the script as sort of supply and demand driven. Really, what are the fundamentals of the
economy, what are the fundamentals of performance of companies? And that's really what I was talking about. It's
maybe not the best word but it's more of a return to sort of the normal day-to-day challenges and as you've seen in the
past when there's economic growth and activity and a degree of certainty, our clients are willing to make significant
decisions, commit more capital, and we get to work with them and the activity levels pick up. The trend is slowly
improving steadily.
<Q - Roger Anthony Freeman>: We've only, obviously, just had a couple of weeks here to start the year but how
would you characterize client engagement so far?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Client engagement, we're very, very focused on our clients. In terms of the first couple of
weeks; way too early to extrapolate anything.

Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Morning, Guy.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Thank you, good morning Harvey. So on the I&L, you had significant gains, whether they
were to the extent that they were realized or not in a sense, that maybe it doesn't even matter because given the IPO
environment and the apparently very much improving M&A environment, a significant amount of this probably will be
over the course of the next year or so it seems to me and so then the question is what's your philosophy with respect to
capital return of discrete amounts like that and do you think it's possible to make a case to the Fed that for significant
freeing up of capital of this type, it's not necessarily the right approach to kind of compare it to earnings as a payout?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So it's a good question and I think at the core of your question what you're saying is
basically if risk is down. So the consumption of capital is lower and the demand for capital isn't there, the question is
can we return or not return it?
Now the way we would look at that question is first and foremost, running with periods of excess capital is not a
problem if we feel like we're going to be able to deploy that capital. We're never going to force that deployment. So
first and foremost it's going to be a risk judgment about how we utilize it. If we see opportunities where capital cannot
be deployed and I'll say for the long-term, for example in our insurance businesses where the rule set changes, then
we'll look to return it. And we'll work with the Fed over time in the construct to return that capital. I'm certainly not
speaking for the Fed here, but I don't think any industry benefits from holding excess capital in the system for an
extended period of time.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: That's fair. On Volcker you mentioned that you have a very high-level committee that's
looking at implementation and the things that you need to do in order to implement it fully. As analysts, should we be
focused more on potential revenue impacts of that implementation or the cost of that implementation?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I think clearly the cost structure issue is one you could focus on because, as I mentioned,
the compliance burden is pretty intense. I think the revenue again-- one of the things in the rule obviously and I forget
the exact language but it basically said that market making activity is effectively essential because it promotes healthy
capital markets and so I think that, the Volcker Rule has covered. We'll have to see ultimately in the implementation
what happens but at least in the intent of the final rule that seems clear they want to support capital market and so those

revenues are going to be predominantly driven by the opportunity set. That's how I think about it.
In terms of our implementation team, this is just kind of typical of how we approach it; just making sure that we've
identified the right people across the entire firm to make sure that we do it as efficiently as possible and it will be a
build but at this stage it's way too early to sort of quantify any ongoing cost structure for you.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. That's helpful though just to get the philosophy of how you're thinking about those
things. The comp to revenue ratio, as was mentioned earlier, did come in lower for the year and to the extent that there
was a significant revenue shift, certainly in the latter part of the year it seems to have been in favor of I&L. Is 37% sort
of a benchmark that we should be thinking about now for next year or if, for example, in 2014 revenue were similar but
the composition was more traditional markets and Investment Banking and less I&L, would we expect that comp ratio
to be higher?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So that's a great question. It's way too early to tell, obviously, in terms of how we'll think
about compensation in 2014. It will be driven, as I said before, by performance and the performance will be driven by
obviously the collection of businesses that we run. I think that the mix issue. I understand why you're asking the
question, but there's no single business or segment that drives compensation expense for Goldman Sachs and so, for
example, if you asked that question slightly differently and said listen let's say I&L, everything else being equal and
I&L was down, I would expect that means the performance of the firm is down. If the performance of the firm is down
it's possible that compensation expense would be down but at that point in time we would be incorporating all factors.
Competitive position, businesses we're building, because while it's pay for performance for the year, it's also investing
for the long-term.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. Just a couple of housekeeping questions. I don't know if you've talked about the
impact of the Rothesay sale on FICC revenues in the quarter. I didn't see it in the release. If you could help us with that,
that would be good.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah sure, no problem. On a DVA adjusted basis sequentially and obviously we had a
challenging third quarter in FICC and it got a lot of attention but sequentially DVA adjusted revenues were up 46%. If
you adjust for the sale of the European insurance business, it's more like 30%. It's roughly about $200 million.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. Okay. That's very helpful and final housekeeping-type of question. You talked about
the SLR being pretty much in compliance on an NPR basis. Have you had a chance yet to think about what the impact
would be of adoption of the final Basel add-ons?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, we haven't. We're still digesting the rule. As you would imagine under that paradigm,
just because of the nature of our business it impacts our ratio more as a result of things like netting and collateral but
we're still digging through the rule.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks very much for taking my questions.

<Q - Christian Bolu>: Good morning Harvey.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hey, Christian.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Thanks for taking my question. Just to follow up on leverage which was a question earlier on,
just in light of your relatively stronger position there, just given the lengthy timeline for implementation, as leverage
becomes the binding constraint for your competitors, I would be curious on your thoughts on Goldman's appetite to be
more aggressive or more aggressively compete for market share in client-centric but balance sheet-heavy businesses

like prime brokerage?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: An important question. If you just split it into two parts for a second. On the first part,
we're not going to change our approach to risk. By the way the FEA was a good example earlier. We're not going to
change our approach to risk management and how we deploy our resources to the extent to which our competitors
change their strategy.
The other half of the question though is I think what you're asking for example if whatever the constraint is; it doesn't
have to be leverage ratio, but if a firm is constrained, if our competitors are constrained in a particular business and we
have relative strength in that business, we would assume that we could be a more valuable provider to our clients on a
relative basis and that relative strength would just improve. I think that paradigm applies for everybody.
<Q - Christian Bolu>: Exactly what I was asking. Thank you. On the compensation policy, just given the importance
of lower earnings volatility to the regulators and investment community, I would be curious for updated thoughts on
how the firm's approach to managing the quarterly compensation accrual, do you anticipate quarterly comp accrual
would be more sensitive to revenue environment or should we expect the practice of 4Q true-up to continue? Thank
you.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So the practice of the 4Q true up is that, we said compensation we have full visibility into
the performance of the businesses. Again, no change in compensation philosophy. We actually think it's quite important
to maintain our philosophy around compensation and for all of our employees at Goldman Sachs to understand it,
understand their obligation to the firm in the context of the compensation philosophy. Ultimately, obviously, as the
largest element of our cost structure, we incorporate everything you would think we would put into that, including our
obligation to our shareholders.

Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hey, good morning, Harvey.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Good morning,
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Just wanted to follow up on the Volcker question. I know you've got a lot of that already this
call. In thinking about the I&L, I know you called out Volcker pertaining to PE and to the hedge fund investments
you've got. But, do I take that to mean that the other components of I&L you don't – you are not constrained by
Volcker, so the real estate piece, the credit piece, the loan funds?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: You're into pretty intricate territory and the rule is 900 pages.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Right.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: What I was basically saying is, I was breaking it down to saying listen there's going to be
3% funds and there's going to be other Volcker-approved structures. So, for example, historically the way people may
have defined CLOs, you may have included securities and depending on the very intricate definition of the rules, you
may not be able to include certain securities and so however the investing activity and working with our clients' needs
to be structured, we're going to comply.
I think that the Volcker Rule, what it does is it outlines a set of rules where market participants can do that. Again, 3%
funds, other covered structures and then, of course, you can invest and lend on balance sheet, which is a pretty
straightforward activity. That's really what I was trying to emphasize. You really have to go to the rule set to determine
whether you can do real estate in a particular way or not, and we'll comply.

<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Right, right. No, I get that. It's just that, as you know, and you give some good detail about
the balances in I&L and how they are broken down in a couple of different ways. So – and I think the Street is just
going to be looking at that to understand how the capital is getting freed up and then reinvested in that space, because,
clearly, if there's opportunities to reinvest that would be great, and if not, you want to see it bought back. So, I was just
wondering how you're thinking about disclosing the balances in I&L. I guess I'm just wondering to the degree you can
put it in a Volcker, non-Volcker kind of disclosure, that would be, I think, helpful for the Street.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So, I think we've been pretty good in terms of disclosure around, for example, what the
firm's investment in funds are, and there is roughly $15 billion at the end of the third quarter.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Right.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I think the investing process is going to be one, again, which is going to be driven by the
opportunity set and what our clients want us to do. And so, the decision of reinvest or return, we're going to continue to
make that decision the same way. If the opportunity set's not there, we're definitely not going to be a firm that's going to
force investing. We're just going to be disciplined, and if we don't think the opportunity set is there we're going to look
to return the capital. Now, you're certainly seeing the impact of those businesses in our capital ratios. We've talked
about things like the financial institution's production in the past. There's a lot of aspects to all the rules, not just
Volcker but I'm not actually 100% sure I understand your question. So, if we need to, we can connect with Dane
afterwards and we can go through it a bit more.

Your next question is from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please, go ahead.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Morning, Harvey.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hey, Brennan, how are you?
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. You guys' VAR ticked up here this quarter. It's actually kind of at a level we haven't
seen in quite some time. Can you walk through and help us understand what drove that?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Really all driven by, basically, an overall decline in market volatility and an increase a bit
in positional risk, but that really is virtually all concentrated in equities. As you would expect, very active equity
quarter. Lots of activity.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. Was there any kind of positional and tailwind for your equities business? Or should
we think about this as all sort of solid flow revenue?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: You should think of it as solid flow revenue. When you do block transactions, and it was
a particularly active block quarter, and I've got to give credit to our teams. I think they did a fantastic job in executing
blocks, because it was a competitive environment. Those block transactions can be large. So, they'll drive the VAR.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Got it. Okay, thanks. And on the equities business, this quarter certainly was a better quarter,
but when you look back at 2013 and you adjust for the sale of the insurance business, the revenues really are not all that
strong and they kind of stand out on the Street as rather weak. Are you thinking about – how are you thinking about
loss of share in the equities business and what you want to maybe do to try to counter that? Have you come up with
some strategies? What's your view there?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So, we're always focused on any area of the business that we can grow and deliver more
value to our clients. I would say given our starting position in terms of just our aggregate position in the marketplace in
terms of whether it's prime brokerage, underwriting, the derivative business, our cash business, we're in a pretty
significant position in terms of aggregate market share.

So, it kind of gets back to this earlier issue of all revenues aren't created equally. And so, I completely understand
you're focused on quarter-to-quarter changes in revenues. We're focused on delivering over the long-term. And it's not
that we don't look at it, but there's risk in these revenues. And so, you really have to look at the entire set of metrics and
how does our pre-tax margin look versus other people's and how are we driving ROE? But, we feel very good about
our franchise position.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Okay. Yeah, and that's fair. Look, we have only blunt tools and so we use the tools we've
got.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah. No, I know. I know.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: And last one for me, litigation expense. We saw a pretty big uptick. Certainly, when we
include many of the money center bank competitors, that's been a big theme the last few quarters. It definitely feels like
this is something we should probably count on in the near term. Do you guys feel as though you're part of that scrum?
And how do you feel about your reserve for litigation? Have you had a chance to build it up? Do you feel like you
might be a little bit behind the eight ball on that front? Should we count on some build here for the medium term here?
Can you give some color on that? I know it's a hard one.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: This is a very, very important question because all firms in this particular case are not
created equally. The way, I think, for us and for the entire marketplace, this is our best estimate. So every quarter –
really no different than mark-to-market accounting – every quarter we do our what is basically the best estimate in that
particular quarter, and we add to the reserves. Now, we also obviously disclose the reasonably possible loss, which you
saw most recently at the end of the third quarter, but this is a quarter-to-quarter activity. This is not a budgeted
forward-looking activity. We incorporate all of the information set that we have at this point in time.
<Q - Brennan Hawken>: Do you have a view on where your year-end potential loss is above reserve levels will shake
out or how that will change versus your last reported number, or is it too early to know on that?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, again, this is not budgeted. If I knew at the beginning of 2014 that my estimable and
probable number was $962 million – sorry, at the end of 2012, I would have taken $962 million in the first quarter. I'd
encourage you to go in the financial statements, if you look at our reasonable possible loss, that's a good disclosure
item, which was $4 billion at the end of the third quarter.

Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please, go ahead.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hey, Mike.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. I'm still not sure on the answer to the Volcker Rule, and I understand it's 900 pages and
there's a lot of work to be done, but one of your competitors said it should not have a material impact. We could all
come up with our own estimates of what the impact of Volcker might be on you guys, but could you just give us some
range, like it should impact our revenues from X to Y percent or expenses from Y to Z percent or size it to some
degree?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So, I thought I was clear. In terms of the revenues that at this stage it doesn't look like a
revenue-impacting item in terms of the final rule, but of course, we've already jettisoned other businesses early on in
the process and made changes. And so, I don't think the primary issue at this point in Volcker is about revenue impact,
although, we have to see how regulators ultimately digest all the data they're requesting, et cetera. And with respect to
the compliance costs that I mentioned, it's just too early to quantify, but there's a pretty extensive compliance regime.

<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. And as relates to VAR, to what degree are you deliberately taking more risk? I think your
predecessor used to say, "We want to live to fight another day," as far as risk off mentality. It seems like maybe you're
taking a little more risk in equities but not necessarily elsewhere. What's your risk stance?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So, I think my predecessor also would have said, "We will never deliberately take more
risk. It's just not the way we're going to run the enterprise." It's all activity-driven. That's why I emphasize the equity
number picking up during the fourth quarter.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. And for the year revenues were flat even with much higher stock markets, even with
gains in Investing & Lending. So when you look out looking for revenue growth, where do you think that can come
from?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I think the most important thing for us this year was how we found that balance in terms
of achieving the 11% ROE and at the same time continuing to drive operating leverage. We feel very good about our
franchise position in an absolute sense and a relative sense. So I'm certainly not predicting the future, but as economic
activity picks up, confidence picks up, capital markets around the world, particular regions, I think you could certainly
paint an optimistic picture. But, I want to be clear, I'm not doing that.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. And what is the ROE target for Goldman?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah, thanks for asking the question that way, Mike. I understand this is an important
issue for all of you, and we are getting increasing clarity around the rule sets, although, there's still a fair bit to go.
When we put out an ROE target, I think first and foremost we want it to be credible and we want it to be achievable.
And so, when you hear from us, that's what it will be. Now, between now and then, no one should get off this call
thinking that we're not exquisitely focused on how we're deploying our capital and how we're focused on returns and
how we're thinking about returns to our shareholders. And I don't have a target for you today, Mike.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: No, I understand, but when do you think you'll have a target? When do you think you'll have
enough clarity around the capital rules to highlight an ROE target?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I don't know. I can't predict the ultimate visibility into the rule set and what it means for
markets, but when we have it, we know it's important to you.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: All right. Thank you.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thanks, Mike.

Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please, go ahead.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Yeah, good morning.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hey, Jim.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Hey. First question on equity derivatives, you mentioned that it was significantly lower this
year versus last year. I get that volatility is down but the market environment was pretty constructive, and typically
lower volatility means a little more risk taking. So, was there anything unusual this year – or I should say last year in
terms of derivatives that was so much weaker than 2012? How should we think about that going forward?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, there was nothing in there. I think you're just seeing the natural to's and fro's of client
activity and markets, but there's no single item I would draw your attention to.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Okay. And then maybe on the capital side, you guys highlight about a 60 basis point difference
between the standardized and advanced approach. Do you envision that converging over the next few years, and what
would be the major drivers?

<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So, the standardized approach really incorporates factors that are not as risk-centric, and
so that's not something that we focused on as much. So, things like collapsing derivative notionals, which is a good
thing to do for managing operational risk. So, it's really something that we're starting to focus on now.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Because the Fed wants you to report the lower of the two, right?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah, well, both.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Right.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Now, of course, under the transitional rules, as I mentioned, we're north of 100 basis
points higher on those anyway, so we're giving you fully phased-in numbers, which we have a couple of years on. So
from your perspective, I wouldn't consider this a significant issue.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Okay, fair enough. And lastly, on compression trades, do you view that as a material benefit
for you guys going forward? Do you think it's early stages and still a lot of room there, or is it sort of more in the
margin?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: It's early, but certainly the rule set. That's an example of where a rule set comes out and a
rule set dictates behavior, and in this case you're starting to see the behavior. And I would think you would continue to
see it pick up momentum.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Okay. All right, great, thanks.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thanks.

Your next question's from the line of Fiona Swaffield from RBC. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hey, Fiona, good morning.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: Good morning. Hi. Just a clarification on the moving parts on the Basel III look through,
the 9.8, which seems pretty static. Could you talk us through? I think you've given the RWA number, but in the last
quarter the deductions moved quite significantly and I thought they might continue to do so. Doesn't look like much is
happening there. And also, is there some operational risk inflation? I think it's marginal, but I do remember a number
being a bit lower than that six months ago. Thank you.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Sorry, could you say the second half of the question, Fiona?
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: I think you said a number of operational risk weighted assets of $85 billion. I'm not sure I
caught it. I think that's slightly higher. I'm just trying to understand why the RWAs aren't going down a bit more with
the natural roll-off?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Oh, okay. With respect to the ratio, there's a lot of gives and gets under the hood and one
of the biggest drivers, as you know, since the final rule came out, has really been the financial institution's deduction,
both significant and non-significant. And so, that was really the most significant change in the final rule which drove it.
But, for example, we picked up a benefit on the sale of the European insurance business of 20 basis points but that was
then offset by other risk factors. There's a fair bit happening under the hood.
<Q - Fiona M. Swaffield>: And is it right that operational risk weighted assets, they are trending slightly up? Is that an
offset to the roll-off of credit risk?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah, no, that's correct. Slightly higher, and as you know, operational risk RWAs, they're
slow moving and they're sticky.

Your next question's from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please, go ahead.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Morning, Matt.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Good morning, Harvey. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of, I guess more
housekeeping related items given that we've gone through most of the important questions at this point. In terms of the
fixed income inflows that you highlighted in your prepared remarks, I guess I'm just curious if you can provide some
further color on why those inflows were so much bigger than some of the other areas, given most people's view that
rates are going to be going higher and that presumably that means investors will be thinking about moving money into
less rate sensitive areas?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah, I think it's a pretty straightforward answer. There's two parts. One is just about
differentiated performance in fixed income. And also, there are funds that we have that are unconstrained fixed income
products, which are – give investors the flexibility and give us a more dynamic ability to manage in the rate
environment. But, it really is performance driven.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. I guess, let me follow up on a prior question talking about your opportunities. How do
you think about the revenue opportunities over the next couple of years across your geographic regions, I guess,
broadly speaking U.S., Europe, and Asia? Is the greatest opportunity in the U.S. given some of the confidence we're
getting relative to the economy or some of the trends that you were talking about that we've been hearing about for a
long time in terms of fixed income issuance in Europe finally moving out of the banks and into the capital markets?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah, so, quite frankly, hard if not impossible to predict. But, with respect to our position
and our commitment, we feel quite good about how we've deployed the resources and how we've made adjustments to
the resources during this portion of the cycle. For example, we've maintained a very strong commitment to Japan.
While a certain number of competitors have decreased their emphasis on Japan, because, as I referenced in my
comments, the equity markets haven't been at these levels since 1972. And so, we feel well positioned to capture the
opportunity.
Now, importantly, it's not about any individual region, but it's the connectivity across our businesses, and an ability to
connect, for example, our Investment Banking clients with resources in institutional client services, our securities
division, where we can deliver solutions globally. In Asia, people are looking to raise capital and they want to go to
U.S. investors. That's really where you get the synergistic leverage across the enterprise.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: And I realize a question about the backlog is fraught with issues, but presumably, if you were
at a five year high in the backlog three months ago, it's grown a little bit since then as of year-end, you've seen very
strong improvement in IPOs. IPO issuance, M&A looks like it's – is the composition of the backlog now moving more
towards M&A and less from equities and fixed income?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, there's not a huge shift in terms of mix, although, there were some adjustments
certainly in the quarter. But, what you're really seeing is, and this might have been hard to predict at the end of the third
quarter, is replenishment, because it was a pretty active fourth quarter. And so, to the extent to which it's a leading
indicator it's obviously a positive one, and I do think it reflects, as I said earlier, sort of global sentiment, if you will,
and confidence in our corporate client base. But, that could change.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. Thanks for taking my question.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thanks.

Your next question's from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Hi. Good morning, Harvey.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Hey, Steven.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: So, I had a question regarding the investment considerations, particularly as it relates to
Volcker on fund-related investing versus direct balance sheet investing. So, fund-related investing, largely limited;
direct balance sheet investing appears to be permissible, but I didn't know if internally are the IRR or at least
investment considerations meaningfully different between the two?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No. So, IRR is IRR. We don't adjust for vehicle, if you will, in terms of how we deploy
that capital. So, we would never allow the return discipline to be corrupted by the particular vehicle of choice. I do
think that the capital treatment can vary, obviously, as we've talked about. The financial institutions deduction and the
money we have in funds, which obviously has to come out anyway, is quite significant, but the risk gets captured in any
number of metrics. It will be in the capital ratios. It's obviously stressed under CCAR. So it's not a vehicle choice.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay. Well, actually as a follow up to that. I didn't know if you could disclose the RWA's
attached to the other $45 billion or so of I&L investments that I suppose aren't that Volcker compliant?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: I don't have that number, but you're welcome to follow up with Dane after the call.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay. And do you happen to have the number for the financial institution deduction for – I
guess it was roughly $8 billion last quarter. I didn't know if it was roughly around that same level.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Yeah, it's up a bit since the third quarter.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay. And just last one for me on the leverage ratio. I didn't know if there's a specific target
that we should be contemplating longer term, so assuming that the 5% ratio or mandated buffer level is the binding
constraint. Is there some sort of buffer that we should be contemplating on a go-forward basis?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: We haven't. Given where we are in in terms of the proposed rules, obviously, and, as you
know, our philosophy on these things is, given the regulators will provide an adequate glide path, we'll wait to see the
final rule before we'll adjust any aspects our business. Ultimately, you'll see us run with a buffer, but we haven't
invested any energy in that yet.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay. That's it for me. Thank you for taking my questions.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thanks so much.

Your next question is from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Mediobanca. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher J. Wheeler>: Yes, thank you and good morning. A couple of questions. The first one is on
something that is sort of topical this morning in the FT after your former partner's testimony yesterday to the Treasury
Committee where he mentioned that the European bonus cap was something of – wasn't the most appropriate method
of managing bonuses. Can you talk a little bit about how you're dealing with that issue, because obviously the FT is
running with the view that New York is a much more attractive place for people to be, rather than perhaps Europe
given this bonus cap? I'm just wondering about what you think the impact might be in terms of increase in fixed
compensation. I know I think you said it's not too many people impacted, but have you had to make or will you have to
make too many changes in respect to this?

<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: So, look, it's small in the context of the firm. Obviously, Europe as a region is critically
important to us strategically, so we're very committed to our clients there and our people there. And so, we'll work with
the regulators and we'll comply accordingly.
<Q - Christopher J. Wheeler>: Okay. And the second question really is really a follow up on what I think Guy and
Betsy had been asking. I'm trying just to get really clear in my mind about the capital allocated to I&L and how you're
thinking about that from a planning perspective. It seems to me where this perhaps would be a couple of years ago; the
thought was that you were going to be reducing capital because obviously Volcker was going to force you out. It
sounds to me like you have no clear view at the moment on reducing capital in that business. It's merely the fact that
you will naturally spinoff some capital and you will leave it very much depending on the state of the market as to
whether you actually leave it in I&L or whether you actually move it elsewhere in the business where you can get
higher returns. Is that a fair way of describing things?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: With respect to capital coming out of the business, obviously, the Volcker Rule is very
definitive on what we need to achieve. So, we, early on, as soon as we identified that as a likely finalized rule item, we
announced the reduction in our hedge funds. In terms of some funds, some funds will just roll off depending on the
opportunity set, but obviously we're committed to complying with the rule. That's not optional.
<Q - Christopher J. Wheeler>: But what I'm asking is, it sounds like where capital is thrown off, you're perfectly
happy to perhaps leave it in I&L rather than deploy it elsewhere in the business if you see the opportunity. It's not just
sort of fixed in concrete that you really want to reduce the amount of capital in your principal business?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Oh, okay, I'm sorry. I understand the heart of your question now. We don't think about
capital allocation. In other words, we're going to deploy an explicit amount of capital to I&L because it's all return,
opportunity set, client driven. So we'd be happy to redeploy that capital if its best use was in another part of our
business, and if necessary we'll look to return the capital.
<Q - Christopher J. Wheeler>: Okay. Thanks so much. Thank you.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Thanks.

Your next question is from the line of Douglas Sipkin with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
<Q - Douglas Sipkin>: Yes, thank you. Good morning.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Good morning, Doug.
<Q - Douglas Sipkin>: Just two questions. One maybe just on the outlook for head count growth. I guess
year-over-year about a flattish year. I think net adds about 200. Any feel for if you guys are going to be looking to grow
that or keep it steady state right now based on the environment that you are seeing in front of you right now?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No plans for any significant changes. If you dig under the hood a little bit the headline
numbers sort of mask some of the efficiency we've built. Obviously, we've talked about that in terms of the build-out of
for example our Salt Lake City office, et cetera and how we're leveraging technology and people and what I'll call the
pyramid, if you will, around the organization, but there are no significant plans one way or another, but it will be
dynamic. If we see growth opportunities, then you should expect to see us add if we need to. And if the environment is
less favorable, we'll make other adjustments. But it will be dynamic.
<Q - Douglas Sipkin>: Gotcha and with respect to the asset management segment, obviously you guys have had some
positive progress there. I know you guys have done a couple of small sort of it feels like opportunistic acquisitions.
Given how the capital model of the firm is changing, would you guys consider doing something bigger in asset
management on the acquisitive side if it presented itself given sort of the favorable capital/returns that business
provides in the new world?

you're seeing is not the result of a quarter's performance. You're seeing a multi-year commitment to the business, which
is now starting to show some differentiated yield.
In terms of opportunity set, look, if there are opportunities that are accretive at Goldman Sachs, to our business and our
clients you should expect us to consider anything.

Your next question is from the line of Devin Ryan with JMP Securities. Please go ahead.
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: Good morning.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Good morning. So I just have a question on the FICC business. I asked a similar question last
quarter but we've now seen outflows out of bond mutual funds in 29 out of past 31 weeks. I know the number is pretty
small in the absolute, but just given that your FICC business is more institutional in nature, is that something that
maybe you're paying closer attention to now that the trend's picked up some more steam and are you actually seeing
any change in client behavior as a result of that?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No change in behavior that I've come in touch with. The behavioral changes have been
more a response to the news dynamic during the course of the year. The issues that I talked about. What does tapering
mean versus QE? What does a government shutdown mean? Those are the kind of things that were a little paralyzing at
times for our clients, I think, as they contemplated the implications. Obviously, over very long period of time, fund
flows have an impact potentially – in the short run they can when there are dramatic withdrawals, it doesn't matter
whether its bond flows or equity flows but I don't think yet we're seeing any major change in behavior.
<Q - Devin P. Ryan>: Okay, great, appreciate the color there and then just a question on comp. Can you give any color
on the mix of cash versus restricted shares and whether there was any meaningful change from last year in terms of
how you thought about that and then just more broadly what the competitive environment feels like today to recruit and
retain talent maybe relative to a year ago?
<A - Harvey M. Schwartz>: No, so we don't disclose details on the compensation mix but you should rest assured that
for everyone that is participating that is receiving equity that there are long-term restrictions on that and we believe that
just basically aligns the broad employee based interest with our shareholders and that's been historically the case and
how we've thought about it for a long time.
With respect to talent, we've seen some tailwinds in the ability – and this isn't recent but certainly over the last year and
a half, we've seen the ability to acquire talent when needed. And so now having said that, our people are highly pursued
also but that's not a new phenomenon.
<Q - Douglas Sipkin>: Great, thank you.
Operator
And this concludes the Q&A session. Please continue with any closing remarks.
Harvey M. Schwartz
So just want to thank everyone on behalf of the team here for dialing in. We look forward to seeing you during the
course of the year and if we don't see you in the next couple of weeks we'll certainly catch up with you on next quarter's
