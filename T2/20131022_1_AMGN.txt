My name is Marvin, and I will be your conference facilitator today for Amgen's third quarter 2013 financial results
conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. There will be a
question-and-answer session at the conclusion of the last speaker's prepared remarks. [Operator instructions]
I would now like to introduce Arvind Sood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Sood, you may now begin.
Arvind K. Sood
Thank you, Marvin. Good afternoon, everybody. I'd like to welcome you to our conference call to review our third
quarter financial results.
This sure has been a busy year. It has also been a great year so far, as we have made remarkable progress against our
strategic priorities. I'm joined today by our Chairman and CEO, Bob Bradway, who will provide a progress update on

our accomplishments. Following Bob, our CFO, Jon Peacock, will review our financial results for the third quarter and
provide an update on our guidance for the remainder of the year. Tony Hooper, our Head of Commercial Operations,
will then discuss our product performance during the quarter and trends that we see going forward. And finally, Sean
Harper, our Head of R&D, will provide a brief pipeline update. And after Sean's comments we should have ample time
for Q&A.
We will use slides for our presentation today. These slides have been posted on our website, and a link was sent to you
separately by email.
Our comments today will be governed by our Safe Harbor statement, which in summary says that through the course of
our presentation and discussion today, we may make certain forward-looking statements, and actual results may vary
materially.
So with that, I would like to turn the call over to Bob. Bob?
Robert A. Bradway
All right, thank you, Arvind.
We executed well through the third quarter, and you can see that both in our financial and our strategic results for the
quarter. Financially, sales were up 11% and earnings per share were up 16%. And off the back of this performance,
we're raising our guidance for revenues and adjusted earnings per share for the full year.
A number of important pieces came together for our strategy over the past few weeks, and I want to just quickly
summarize them for you. In Japan, our strategic alliance, which is known as the Amgen Astellas BioPharma KK, has
now begun operations. And we're developing five innovative molecules through the alliance, the first of which we
expect to launch in 2016. And then ultimately, of course, we expect to establish our own wholly-owned subsidiary in
Japan as early as 2020.
In China, our joint venture with Zhejiang Beta Pharma is now complete, and we hope to launch Vectibix there together
as early as 2015. We also announced our plans to build research and translational capabilities in China at Shanghai
Tech University, representing a step forward in our commitment to this market.
Consistent with our stated strategy of building a presence in some 75 countries, we have achieved that and more
following the repurchase of rights to Neulasta and NEUPOGEN from Roche in markets outside of the U.S. and EU.
These markets account for about $200 million in NEUPOGEN and Neulasta sales and will provide a platform for future
product launches.
And finally, of course, we completed the acquisition of Onyx at the beginning of the month. And though it's still early
days, the transition is progressing smoothly, and we're excited about the prospect of adding value and driving growth in
multiple myeloma with Kyprolis, which we think has significant opportunity in earlier lines of therapy and in markets
around the world as a best-in-class proteasome inhibitor. Oprozomib looks attractive as well as a potential oral
proteasome inhibitor for maintenance therapy in multiple myeloma. And of course, we expect Nexavar, Stivarga, and
palbociclib to contribute to growth also.
While we were busy laying the groundwork for long-term growth with our strategic moves during the quarter, our
internal efforts were also progressing well. In R&D, with the addition of Kyprolis and ivabradine, the innovative
medicine for heart failure we licensed from Servier in July, our pipeline now includes ten late-stage innovative
programs set to generate pivotal data over the next couple years. Separately, our portfolio of six biosimilars continues
to advance as well, and we now have a pivotal trial underway for our second of these molecules, this one a biosimilar to
Humira.
Some of you have asked about the status of the patent infringement lawsuit we filed in the U.S. versus Teva on their
long-acting lipegfilgrastim product candidate. Teva has advised us that they have withdrawn their BLA for the product,
and the FDA has confirmed this withdrawal, so we've agreed to dismiss our lawsuit on this product. Of course, if

circumstances change, we can refile the lawsuit.
Before turning to Jon, I want to thank my colleagues at Amgen and our new colleagues from Onyx for their efforts
during this past quarter. All of our focus on patients is evident in the strong operational and strategic results we
produced over the last three months.
Jon?
Jonathan M. Peacock
Thanks, Bob.
This has been a busy quarter for us. We have advanced several of our most important strategic priorities, as Bob has
outlined. But at the same time, we have remained focused on our business and delivered a strong operating
performance in the quarter.
Revenues advanced 10% compared to the third quarter of 2012, with product sales up 11%. This included a $155
million NEUPOGEN order from the U.S. government. It also reflected continued momentum with Prolia, with
XGEVA, Enbrel, and Neulasta, as well as important contributions from Sensispar, Nplate, and Vectibix.
Operating expenses were up 10% on the quarter overall. Over the course of the last 12 months, we've been enrolling
multiple clinical trials, which will enable a data-rich year in 2014 as several of these trials start to read out. At the end
of the quarter, we had approximately 45,000 patients enrolled in our late-stage programs compared to around 30,000
twelve months ago. That's an increase of 50%. Research and development costs in the quarter were also impacted by a
$50 million upfront payment to Servier for the U.S. rights to ivabradine.
SG&A costs included a 12% increase in Enbrel profit share payments, which amounted to $430 million. And as a
reminder, the Enbrel profit share expires at the end of this month and is replaced by a 12% royalty on sales, leading to
an anticipated net benefit of around $800 million in operating income in 2014 compared to 2013.
Net income increased by 13%. Our tax rate in the quarter was lower compared to 2012, benefiting from the federal
R&D credit and a change in the geographic mix of expenses and revenues. This was partially offset by higher other
income and expense. The third quarter charge for other income and expense is broadly representative of the charge that
you should expect to see in the fourth quarter and into 2014. Adjusted earnings per share growth of 16% also benefited
from a lower average share count.
Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet on page five, we generated $1.6 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and
paid a dividend totaling $400 million. Our total cash and investments of $26.5 billion at the end of the quarter included
a $3.1 billion bank loan to fund the Onyx acquisition, which was dispersed when the deal closed on October 1. The
funding for the acquisition was completed with a further $5 billion bank loan received and dispersed on October 1.
With this, total debt outstanding at the end of the fourth quarter is expected to be $32.2 billion. And as a reminder, the
$8.1 billion raised to fund the Onyx acquisition carries an interest rate linked to LIBOR. And at current rates, this
amounts to 1.3% pre-tax.
Share repurchases year to date amount to $800 million at an average price of $85. And following the Onyx acquisition,
we don't expect any significant share repurchase activity in 2014 and 2015.
Turning to page six, we're raising our guidance for the full year, and this includes the contribution of Onyx from
October 1. We now expect revenues to be in the range of $18.3 billion to $18.5 billion, and adjusted earnings per share
to be between $7.35 and $7.45. Our guidance on tax and capital expenditures remains unchanged.

Thanks, Jon. You will find the summary of our global sales performance for quarter three on slide number seven.
I'm pleased to report we had a strong quarter three, with product sales growing 11% year over year and 1% quarter over
quarter. We also saw strong top line contributions from all our geographic regions. Our U.S. business grew 12% year
over year, with wholesale inventory ending in the normal range. Outside the U.S., sales grew 7% year on year, or 9%
excluding foreign exchange.
I'd like to start the review of our portfolio beginning with Enbrel. Rheumatologists and dermatologists continue to
recognize Enbrel with its track record of efficacy, safety, and long-term experience. We are committed to investing in
Enbrel over the long term, given our prolonged exclusivity and the end of our profit share agreement with Pfizer at the
end of this month. Enbrel sales grew 7% year over year, primarily due to price.
We remain focused on demonstrating the value and benefits of Enbrel to physicians, payers, and most importantly
patients. Our direct-to-consumer advertising continues to emphasize the benefits of using Enbrel. Enbrel consistently
leads total brand awareness in the rheumatology segment, and physicians continue to honor over 90% of Enbrel patient
requests. We remain the value share leader in both the rheumatology and dermatology segments and are confident in
Enbrel's potential growth.
Moving now to Neulasta and NEUPOGEN, please remember that Neulasta represents about 80% of the combined sales
of these two products. We continue to emphasize the addition of filgrastim to the first in every cycle of chemotherapy
as the best way to reduce the risk of febrile neutropenia in appropriate patients. Year over year, global sales for
Neulasta increased by 9%. This was mainly driven by price and a slight increase in unit demand.
For NEUPOGEN, sales grew 50% year over year, including the $155 million order from the U.S. government.
EPOGEN sales were flat year cover year. Quarter-over-quarter sales declined slightly due to a favorable Medicaid
rebate adjustment recorded in quarter two. Unit demand in the quarter was stable.
Aranesp sales were down 10% year over year. Quarter-over-quarter sales were negatively impacted by changes in
estimates in both quarters, including the Medicaid rebate adjustment recorded in quarter two. We expect Aranesp sales
in both the U.S. and Europe to continue trending slightly downwards.
Sensipar sales increased 7% year over year due to increases in overall unit demand, driven by strong segment
penetration.
Nplate and Vectibix sales in aggregate were higher by 19% year over year due to increases in unit demand. In Europe,
we continue to pursue reimbursement with payers for the treatment of first and second-line metastatic colorectal cancer.
And our European label now includes the new NRAS data, which allows more targeted treatment of patients based on
their wild-type RAS status.
Turning now to the denosumab franchise, Prolia posted a 62% year-on-year growth. We did see, however, some
seasonal softness in the third quarter, something we've come to expect, but we continue to grow share in both the U.S.
and the rest of the world. We also continue to improve repeat injection rates in the U.S., and our latest data shows over
60% of patients returning for their second injection. Earlier this month we launched Prolia in France, which is the
largest PMO market in Europe.
XGEVA global sales grew 5% quarter over quarter. In the U.S., our value share grew by six percentage points in the
quarter. On a unit basis, our share grew by two percentage points while competing against numerous generic zoledronic
acid competitors. We now hold 42% unit share in this segment.
Outside the U.S., XGEVA grew 12% quarter over quarter, driven by share gains. Recent launches in Europe continue
their strong uptake. In France, we have already achieved 50% segment value share since launching in quarter one. Our
commercial focus remains in reminding physicians and patients of the superior clinical profile of XGEVA.
Other products, which is comprised of our sales from our Brazilian and Turkish businesses, declined 13% year on year.
This was primarily due to Turkey, since this business is driven in part by government tenders, where timing of awards
tends to fluctuate. We expect sales to significantly rebound in quarter four.

Let me now turn to our new and exciting business, Onyx Pharmaceuticals. I'd like to start by thanking the entire Onyx
team for their unwavering commitment during the acquisition period. They remained focused and grew their business
6% quarter over quarter. Importantly, I'd note that their U.S. execution drove a 10% increase in the number of Kyprolis
accounts during the quarter, as the depth of prescribing continued to grow. We are excited to continue building on this
important growth platform in multiple myeloma with potential expansion into earlier lines of therapy as well as
launching in countries outside the United States.
In summary, I am very pleased with the competitive strategies our team has developed and our execution against these
strategies. We remain focused on serving patients and bringing them vital medicines. Our underlying business
delivered another strong quarter, and I believe we are well positioned to meet our full-year revenue growth objectives.
Let me now pass you to Dr. Sean Harper.
Sean E. Harper
Thanks, Tony.
We continue to forge ahead on our existing pipeline efforts. And I'd like to take this opportunity to also welcome our
colleagues at Onyx. The team has done an outstanding job advancing innovative multiple myeloma therapies, and we're
very optimistic about the long-term potential of Kyprolis and oprozomib. We're looking forward to the new Kypolis
data next year, including the final analysis of the FOCUS study in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma. In addition,
the Independent Data Monitoring Committee will review an interim analysis of the ASPIRE study in relapsed disease
next year.
As many of you are aware, FOCUS is the registration-enabling study for refractory relapsed multiple myeloma
targeting the EU. And ASPIRE is the confirmatory study for full U.S. approval as well as the registration-enabling
study for relapsed patients in both the U.S. and the EU. We will also be presenting additional data on oprozomib, an
oral proteasome inhibitor, at this year's American Society of Hematology meeting. We are doing everything we can to
help maintain momentum on these programs and to bring to bear any resources we can to further enable their success.
The mission and cultures of the two companies seem remarkably well aligned, and I'm excited to have them on our
team.
The lipid lowering program intended to be the basis of registration for AMG 145, now called evolocumab, is
completely enrolled, and we eagerly await the results in 1Q 2014. We plan to speak more about this program along
with our other cardiovascular programs at an investor event at the American Heart Association meeting in November,
where we will be presenting one-year data from over 1,100 subjects in our Phase 2 open-label extension study.
For trebananib, we continue to estimate the final overall survival analysis from the ongoing pivotal study in recurrent
ovarian carcinoma to occur in the second half of 2014. We have decided to discontinue enrollment in our study of
trebananib in combination with DOXIL in the setting of recurrent ovarian carcinoma due to ongoing DOXIL supply
issues. We have also determined that a much smaller study than initially planned can be utilized to adequately assess
the effect of trebananib on progression-free survival in first-line ovarian cancer. In addition, the emerging therapeutic
landscape in non-small cell lung cancer limits the potential utility of trebananib in this study, so we're also
discontinuing enrollment in this Phase 2 study. There were no new safety findings related to these decisions.
Our psoriasis program for brodalumab consists of three Phase 3 studies, one placebo controlled and two head-to-head
against ustekinumab, or Stelara. I'm pleased to report all of these are now fully enrolled, and we expect to see the data
next year.
Velcalcetide, or AMG 416, is our novel IV calcimimetic being investigated for the treatment of secondary
hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease who are on hemodialysis. Phase 3 data are expected next
year, and we will be presenting Phase 2 data at the American Society of Nephrology meeting next month.

Just to close the loop with you on an outstanding XGEVA filing, after extensive discussions with EU regulators, we've
decided not to pursue further our request for a bone metastasis-free survival indication in castrate-resistant prostate
cancer in Europe.
Our biosimilars unit continues to make good progress. And as Bob mentioned, enrollment has commenced in our
biosimilar Humira pivotal study in psoriasis.
Finally, I'd just like to take a moment and acknowledge my colleagues in R&D who continue to innovate and execute at
a very high level. We've made great progress this year. And as you can see from my last slide, eight of our late-stage
programs will achieve significant milestones next year. We'll be very busy in 2014, but our organization is ready. And
we look forward to continuing our track record of delivering novel therapies for patients in need.
Bob?
Robert A. Bradway
Okay. Thanks, Sean. Marvin, we're ready for questions. If you'd remind our listeners of the procedures, we will open up
the line for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Robyn Karnauskas with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Thanks for taking my question. So I think big picture, it seems like your base business
continues to be more stable than I think a lot of people on the Street expected, and you're continuing to grow your
pipeline. You did a deal today going into emerging markets. I guess I'm struggling with understanding the impacts the
new businesses have on margins and what the real revenue opportunity is for global expansion. So I know you haven't
given guidance. But maybe in a general sense, can you help me think about when you think global expansion will
contribute meaningfully? And how do we think about maybe bookends for margin impacts? And then lastly, when do
you think it's appropriate to give guidance on these businesses, more detailed financial guidance?
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay, thanks, Robyn. There are a couple questions there. Why don't we try and answer
that in two parts. First, you're right. We've continued to make progress in laying the groundwork for our future growth.
We've felt for some time that an important ingredient for our long-term success was international expansion, and in
particular a clear path forward in Japan, China, and the other key emerging markets. And we've made tangible progress
as reflected in the items that we reviewed from this quarter. So we feel good about the presence that we've created and
the ability to leverage that presence for our innovative molecules when they're ready to be launched.
As regards your question about margins and returns, why don't I ask Tony to share his thoughts? We're obviously not
going to provide individual market guidance. And, Robyn, I think the next opportunity for us to talk more generally
about guidance will be in connection with our fourth quarter results, which is scheduled for January, of course, of next
year. Tony, do you want to offer any general thoughts to Robyn on how we're thinking about markets and the criteria
for profitability that we're holding the teams accountable to?
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: So as we think about the Amgen presence at the moment, we do have a fairly decent
presence already in the Middle East, North Africa, and Latin America. Our business in this part of the world is already
well in excess of $0.5 billion and growing rapidly, double digit. The products we have in the portfolio also are highly
sophisticated biotech type products. So pricing is pretty much in line with the type of product we bring to market. So
we're not competing in these markets in the mass part of the market, but clearly around high unmet medical need with
prices that will allow us margins that are fairly close to the type of business we run in Europe at the moment.

<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay, let's go to the next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Terence C. Flynn>: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. I was just wondering first if you can provide us on your
thoughts on the Kyprolis development program. Now that the deal is closed, particularly I would be curious in your
outlook for both FOCUS and ASPIRE. And then in the event that FOCUS does not have a positive readout, how
comfortable are you that ASPIRE will be enough to secure a label there?
And then the second question I had was just can you remind us of your strategy for your Humira biosimilar, if the trial
you're running is designed to support worldwide filings, including the U.S.? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay, Terence, you've got a couple questions there. Let's try to answer those. Sean, I
suppose you might want to just share with Terence our thoughts about the global development plan at Onyx.
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Yes, I think that the FOCUS and the ASPIRE trials will read out next year, FOCUS in its final
form, and ASPIRE will have an interim analysis reviewed by the Data Monitoring Committee. And if positive, we'll all
see it. Otherwise, we'll see the final analysis. I think that in the case that FOCUS is really focused on a third-plus-line
indication for Europe, and we feel that it's quite an independent thing from the goals of ASPIRE, which are to allow a
relapsed population or, if you will, second-line population to have a registration path in both the U.S. and the EU, and
we're pretty confident that assuming the results are what we're hoping for that that stands on its own from a regulatory
perspective.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: And, Tony, on Humira, do you want to answer Terence's question?
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Sure, our biosimilar strategy is clearly a global strategy. We're working closely with the
FDA to understand requirements. We understand what's required in Europe. And then we're working with other
countries outside those two regions to try and understand where the pathway is going forward. But we think globally on
a consistent basis, yes.
<A - Arvind K. Sood>: Okay, Marvin, let's take the next question. And maybe you can just remind the audience to
limit themselves to one question, please, so we can get through everybody.
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company.
<Q - Eric T. Schmidt>: Thanks, maybe just a quick one on Bob's comments around Teva and the IP dispute around
long-acting G-CSF. Can you remind us when your patent actually expires and whether Teva withdrew the BLA
because of the patent or for some other issue?
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Eric, our IP on pegylated filgrastim extends through the end of 2015. And as I said in my
remarks, we understand that they've withdrawn the product from the FDA – or withdrawn the file, rather, from the
FDA, and that's the reason why we dropped our lawsuit.
<Q - Eric T. Schmidt>: Do you know why, Bob?
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: You'd have to ask them that question.

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. I know that CMS has proposed cuts to
reimbursement rates to dialysis providers. I think this came up on the 2Q call and I think at the time we were in the
comment period. I was wondering if you could update us on what's going on there, and if you could help us all
understand that issue and what impact it could have to models. And then if you could just comment on the
NEUPOGEN government purchase, should we think of that as one-time? Thank you.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay, Tony?
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Let me talk about the bundle. The time for comment to CMS has now expired, and we had
assumed that the CMS would make some type of ruling early in November. We're not quite sure how the government
shutdown will impact that timing, but we are standing by to wait to hear what's going to happen. Now their decision
could be to implement immediately. It could be to implement over a period of time or to implement at a time in the
future. We don't know yet what the impact will be or how much the proposed reduction will in fact be, so we're just
waiting for that at the moment. On NEUPOGEN?
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Sure, on the government order, Mark, I think at this point we can't predict whether there
will be future orders from the government or not. I think we would notice it. We've got a track record, a strong track
record of being able to supply customers with safe, reliable quality NEUPOGEN/Neulasta product. And if the
government wants to order more, we're prepared to supply it. But at this point, I wouldn't want to speculate as to
whether there will be future orders.

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Yee with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Yes, hey. Just to confirm, one, the pegfilgrastim application was withdrawn, but are we still
expecting both a NEUPOGEN-like and a non-peg Neulasta-like product to come from Teva soon and both under
settlement? Maybe you could clarify if you expect both of those to come and how we should, as investors, be expecting
your franchise to look once those do arrive to market.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay, a couple things, Michael. Just to remind you, we expect that there will not be a
NEUPOGEN-like product on the market before mid-November. After that time, when our intellectual property expires
on NEUPOGEN, we would expect to see Teva launch a product, although I would note it won't be a biosimilar and it
won't be a product that has the same label as NEUPOGEN.
With respect to other long-acting products, again, so far as I'm aware, none are registered. And so rather than speculate
on what they might do, I think we'll wait and see what the regulatory reaction is to products that they have on file.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Okay.

Our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS.
<Q - Matthew Roden>: Great, thanks for taking my question as well. Sean, as you know, I've been interested in this
ovarian program with trebananib. And I just wanted to ask you about the DOXIL shortage, which necessitated the
closing of enrollment for TRINOVA-2. I'm just wondering if you can talk about whether or not that impacts your
statistical power to hit PFS and OS, whether or not the second study is required for approval on the indication, and

whether there are other implications that we should consider here. Thanks.
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Matt, I don't think – the DOXIL study was always a non-registration trial to just generate data
in the setting of a very commonly used agent in ovarian cancer, so there really are two problems. One is that it's not
really a very commonly used agent in ovarian cancer anymore because it's so unreliable in its supply, and we can't get
the drug. This is the second time we've had to do this. And it's just very disruptive to not have supply for patients in a
clinical trial setting. So that should have no bearing at all on our ability to register the product, to assess OS in the
existing independent study with the paclitaxel background that we're waiting for sometime next year, nor would it
affect an ability to assess PFS in the first-line study, which has always been the primary goal of the first-line study.

Our next question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham with JPMorgan.
<Q - Geoffrey C. Meacham>: Hi, guys, thanks for taking the question. So Sean highlighted on slide nine all the data
events for next year, but I wanted to ask Tony the commercial perspective on this. Is there an ROI that you're looking
for, for the various Phase 2 or Phase 3 assets that you have that are maturing? I guess said another way, just given your
top line, is there a threshold that these assets have to cross to really move the dial for you guys? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Geoff, it's Bob. Let me jump in there on the question that you directed at Tony. Our
intention is to advance molecules for which we think we can exceed the cost of our capital. So when we look at our late
and early-stage programs, we want to have a clear view to what it's going to take to beat our cost to capital. And we
think we're in good shape in that regard on the late-stage molecules, and we continue to watch that carefully on the
mid-stage and early-stage programs.

Our next question comes from the line of Ravi Mehrotra with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Ravi Mehrotra>: Hi, thanks for taking my question, another big picture question on your biosimilar effort. When
can we expect more news flow on the other five projects you previously identified? And given the changes in the
biosimilar competitive environment since your business review day, do you view this opportunity as bigger than you
guided to at that point? Thank you.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Ravi, why don't we answer this in two parts? With respect to communications, again, as
our biosimilar molecules enter pivotal trials, we'll plan to call them out on our quarterly calls, as we did today. So we've
done that for both of the molecules that are now in pivotal trials. And, Tony, if you want to talk more generally about
the quality of the opportunity here, jump in.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: So as we monitor the six assets we have identified, all of them continue to grow globally.
So the medium-term opportunity of playing with the market continues to be a lucrative market. We continue to believe
that our ability to bring to market a high-quality, reliable supply of product will be a unique benefit that Amgen has. So
we continue to see it as an opportunity, yes.

Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber with Citi.
<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: Thanks for taking my question. I just have also a little bit of a strategy question relating to
your cardiovascular franchise. And if you don't mind, just on AMG 145, just give us a little bit of an update where you
are on formulation. And are you guys thinking that the concentration will remain the same but the device is going to
change into an auto-injector? And then where does ivabradine – where does that fit in? Are you going to be looking for
a CAD and necrotic heart failure indication, or what's the strategy? It sounds like you're going to be using previous data
to file. Thank you.
<A - Sean E. Harper>: Okay, so regarding AMG 145, as I said many times before, this is a very competitive situation,
and we're not wanting to get into that level of specificity around how we're going to be presenting the agent. Suffice it
to say that we think we're going to have good ways of delivering to patients the every two week and every four week
presentations of the product.
Ivabradine is a really interesting molecule that is unique in its mechanism and has a really critical role in the
management of heart failure outside the United States. We have data sets which are very robust supporting chronic
heart failure where there's a large outcome study that was done not too long ago, put into the labels around the world.
European heart failure guidelines include the use of ivabradine in patients who can't be adequately heart rate controlled
with beta blockers. So our desire is to see the agent registered ultimately in both of these indications, in congestive
heart failure as well as in patients with coronary artery disease and stable angina. There is also a large outcomes trial in
patients with coronary artery disease, approximately 20,000 patients that's going to read out next year, which should be
potentially quite supportive to the use of the agent in the angina indication.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Tony, do you want to add some thoughts?
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: So as we think about Amgen launching AMG 145, which is one of our largest exciting
opportunities we have, that would have been the first time Amgen competes in the cardiovascular field. And therefore,
ivabradine, which is shown as being a unique opportunity, a unique mode of action in an area of high unmet medical
need, will allow us prior to the AMG 145 launch to build competencies, skills in our organization, build a relationship
with a cardiology group, make sure we understand the hospital interactions, the P&T committees, discharge protocols,
all of which will play in line with the launch of AMG 145; so really setting us up, getting us the experience, at the same
time driving a rather exceptional product in a large unmet medical need.

Our next question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn with BoA Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Rachel L. McMinn>: Question, I wanted to go back to Kyprolis. I was hoping, Sean, you might be a little bit
more granular on your development plans I guess on two fronts. One, with the head-to-head studies, it seems like for
ENDEAVOR and CLARION, they're going to be important for front-line approval, but also potentially for EU
reimbursement, given the cost concerns with Revlimid and Kyprolis. I guess my view is that these studies are fairly
risky. Do you plan to make any changes to the design of these studies or add additional supplemental studies?
And then just on the cardiac pulmonary safety profile, given the recent events with [ph] the area of viclusic (37:00), I'm
just wondering what your comfort level is on the safety profile. How confident are you based on the data that you have
today that there's not going to be a safety imbalance that stops either of those studies early? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Sean?
<A - Sean E. Harper>: First, I'd say that generally, as we looked at the Onyx opportunity, we were very impressed
with the development program, and I see the development program as being quite well thought out. Of course, we'll
work with our colleagues at Onyx and think about details of the way that statistical analysis plans are done and this sort
of thing at a technical level. For sure there will be a process of looking together at things.

But I think that generally speaking, we feel very good about the development program, which has been developed with
a lot of input from the experts in the field from around the world and regulatory authorities of course. It's always
possible that we would add studies. I wouldn't think that there's anything that glares out as a missing piece, but there are
lots of opportunities to do additional studies with these molecules, with both Kyprolis and oprozomib. And we'll just
have to think about that in a big picture perspective in terms of return on investment and overall portfolio management.
Safety, I can't give you any guarantees about safety. The data that we see to date with the agents is reassuring and
appears that the benefit that's being derived from the use of the product in this setting exceeds the safety concerns.
There are, of course, especially in oncology, safety issues with virtually every therapeutic agent. So I still see a very
strong benefit/risk profile here, and I think that the opportunity to let these studies play out and see what we learn from
them is in front of us.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Okay, let's go to the next question, Marvin.

The next comes from the line of Geoffrey Porges with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Geoffrey Craig Porges>: Thanks for taking the question. I just had a question about the Onyx acquisition. If we
look back at Onyx, they had about $200 million in operating expenses in Q2, and now you've had a chance to integrate
the two organizations. Could you give us a sense of what that operating expense might be looking like in Amgen's
hands, say a year from now once you've embedded everything in? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Sure, Geoff. I guess we're 21 days into this transition. What I'd observe is that, as I said
earlier, the transition is moving smoothly. There are clearly going to be some opportunities for us to think about
synergies. And as you would expect, we're down the road already in that regard with our colleagues at Onyx, but I'm
not going to provide guidance at this point. We'll have an opportunity to do that next year in January when we talk
about the fourth quarter in the way that we typically do. But again, I think the big picture, Geoff, is that we're three
weeks into this. We feel good about what we've seen. I think we feel good about the way in which we're working
together and comfortable about the opportunity to help drive growth here and create value, both from things that we can
do to grow the brand and grow access as well as things that we can do to provide cost synergies. Okay, let's go to the
next question.
Operator
Our next question come comes from the line of Chris Raymond with Robert Baird.
<Q - Christopher Raymond>: Another cardiovascular question for AMG 145. So we've picked up a lot more investor
interest recently on Merck's upcoming IMPROVE-IT trial. I know this is not your trial and not your product, but there's
I think a fairly decent chance that there's going to be a read-through, at least from an investor standpoint, if that trial
fails. And I know these mechanisms are very different, but can you maybe just give us a sense, how should we be
thinking about how the FDA might be thinking if indeed that trial doesn't show a long-term benefit and what the
implications are for what they might require for the entire PCSK9 class? Thanks.
<A - Robert A. Bradway>: Yes, I think it's obviously difficult to speak for the FDA in terms of how they might view
LDL as a surrogate endpoint based on the results from one of dozens and dozens of studies that have been done that
have shown that reducing LDL has had a salutary effect on cardiovascular outcomes. I think it's just going to depend
enormously on the actual interpretation, detailed scientific interpretation of studies like IMPROVE-IT. I think those
studies will be looked at carefully. Any studies that come out over the next few years will be looked at carefully by
regulators and the scientific community.
But it's really down to the detailed assessment as to whether the results actually call into question whether LDL is a
reasonable surrogate for cardiovascular outcomes while one waits for a cardiovascular outcomes result to come from a

trial which is well underway. And it's just tough to speculate on that at this stage, but I think that it's clear to me that
LDL is looked at differently than other lipid parameters by regulators with respect to being the most robust of those
cases.
<Q - Christopher Raymond>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.
<Q - C. Anthony Butler>: I have a question. Tony, you have commented about how well Enbrel has done, not only in
this quarter but in past quarters. Yet in the last quarter, you made a reference to some slowdown in the der
[dermatology] market. So I wondered if you could actually break apart how you're looking at the growth rates around
each indication for Enbrel, it would be very helpful.
And if I could sneak in a second really quickly, it's again around AMG 145. In your comments earlier around
ivabradine, you made some references to the cardiologist. And I wondered if, in fact, your assumption was that AMG
145 would not be used by the primary care physician, or did I simply misread that from your statements in chronic
heart failure? Thanks very much.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Okay, Tony, as regards Enbrel, about two-thirds of our business is in rheumatology and
about one-third in dermatology. Net-net we've seen both these markets just slow down a little bit in terms of growth.
They're still growing fairly healthily. In rheumatology, we clearly continue to hold market share. In dermatology, we've
seen a slight decline in market share over the last couple quarters or so. But we truly believe that the product profile,
both in rheumatology from an efficacy and a safety perspective as well as our profile in dermatology specifically
around safety will allow us to continue to maintain a fairly large market share as we go forward.
As it regards AMG 145, the assumption we're making is that the initial launch of 145 will be more specifically on
high-risk patients, which will be treated by cardiologists. As always, there will be a smattering of general practitioners
who do a fair amount of cardiovascular work. But we don't see us going in the early stages to a large GP market, no.
<Q - C. Anthony Butler>: Thanks very much.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Okay.

The next question comes from the line of Eun Yang with Jefferies.
<Q - Eun Yang, Ph.D.>: Thanks, a question on brodalumab. I'm assuming two Phase 3 trials are designed to show
superiority over Stelara in psoriasis. And the fact that it already showed superior efficacy over Enbrel with their IL-17
antibody, why did you use Stelara as a comparator versus Enbrel?
<A - Sean E. Harper>: I think the choice of ustekinumab as the comparator for brodalumab was really a matter of just
putting ourselves up against the molecule that we thought increasingly is becoming the agent of choice from an efficacy
perspective in the disease. We wanted to set as high a bar as we could really from a competition perspective. And so
that was in part why we made the choice. We could have chosen other comparators, but that was the choice that we
made.

Our next question comes from the line of Joel Sendek with Stifel.
<Q - Joel D. Sendek>: Thanks a lot. I had a question about Kyprolis sales. Obviously, you seem pretty happy about
this $55 million. It looks to me pretty flat over the last couple quarters. I'm wondering, now that the drug is in your
hands, whether we should expect or if there's any significant growth embedded in your guidance for the fourth quarter.
Or do we need to wait for the new studies to come out next year? Thanks.
<A - Anthony C. Hooper>: Joel, it's Tony, so, let me just say a couple of things. The first leak of a potential
acquisition started to come out in late June, so there was a fair amount of uncertainty amongst Onyx employees for a
period of time. And as I said in my remarks earlier, I'm pretty impressed that in spite of this terrible disruption that
happened in their lives, they maintained the business as well as they did, including the third quarter is normally a fairly
soft quarter, even for oncology.
Fourteen days after the close, we had in the hands of every single field-based employee a letter of employment
confirming employment. We've looked at this team. This team has obviously been put together with a clear knowledge
of where the multiple myeloma market is, where the treatment physicians are. And we have hired through the Onyx
team a top-class oncology sales organization and medical field organization. We are certainly hoping that with certainty
now reigning in their lives, their performance will improve over the fourth quarter. But clearly, as you look to the
medium to long term, the next major expansion of the Kyprolis label will come with both the FOCUS and the ASPIRE
data, yes.

Our next question comes from the line of Howard Liang with Leerink Swann.
<Q - Howard Liang>: Thanks very much. Regarding the changes in the trebananib program, can you comment on
whether they represented in any way a de-emphasis of this compound, specifically regarding the focus on front-line
study on PFS. Are you still pursuing a regulatory filing in the U.S. for front-line?
And then second, the TRINOVA-1 study, can you talk about your outlook for regulatory filing given the interim overall
trends they presented?
<A - Sean E. Harper>: No, I think we're still quite interested in trebananib's potential and see it as an agent which
could gain registration globally in both first-line and recurrent disease. So in the first-line, I think we've recognized that
it's extremely difficult, as I'm sure you know, to try and achieve an overall survival result in the first-line. And our
general thought is that if we can achieve an OS result in a significant line of therapy like in the recurrent study that
we're waiting for OS data now that that would be sufficient for the molecule to allow us to move forward with attempts
to register in first and second-line globally, so that's really the strategy. And the change in the size of the first-line study
doesn't diminish in any way our ability to assess progression-free survival there.
<A - Arvind K. Sood>: Hey, Marvin, I think we have exhausted a lot of topics here, so why don't we take one last
question?

<Q - Gene C. Mack>: Thank you so much for taking the question. Just on oprozomib and the strategy there, I'm
wondering if you guys can give us a sense of, just given how fast Millennium moved their oral compound MLN9708
into Phase 3 testing, I'm just wondering. How soon do you think you might be able to get into a pivotal program with
oprozomib? Is it just too early to tell at this point, or can you, like Millennium, go from Phase 1 to – really they went
from Phase 1 to Phase 3? Thanks.

<A - Sean E. Harper>: Yes, I think it's probably just too early in the process for me to speculate about that right now.
The agent is really at the threshold between Phase 1b and Phase 2 at the moment. And I'm sure there's an ability to be
aggressive with the development of the molecule, but we also want to do it right. And skipping phases of development
isn't always the best idea. So we'll have to noodle through that and decide how we're going to proceed.
