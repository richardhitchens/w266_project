Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to over to
Safra.
Safra Ada Catz
Thanks, Ken. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results for Q1. I'll then review guidance for Q2 and turn the call
over to Mark for his comments. Larry isn't with us today because he is at an important race for the America's Cup.
I want to start by letting you know that currency in Q1 gave us a 2% headwind for new software license and total
revenue which was more than my guidance last quarter. So, today my comments on the quarter will generally reflect
constant dollar growth rates.
Q1 for us was really solid overall and quite strong in the Americas. We're especially pleased with our software results
as total software revenues were $6.1 billion, up 8% from last year. Software updates and product support revenues were
more than half of the total company revenue at nearly $4.4 billion, up 8% from last year. Attach rates and renewal rates
remain at their usual high levels and software updates and product support continue to power earnings and cash flow.
New software license revenues were $1.7 billion, up 6% from last year. Looking at GAAP results by region we saw
excellent results in the Americas with growth of 15% that's growth upon a previous year, so that's really very strong.
Asia-Pac saw solid growth of 5% while EMEA declined 5%.
There were some interesting product details that I think bode well for the future. Exadata software was up over 15%,
GoldenGate and memory software was up 30%, BI Technology and Foundation Suite were up around 10%, also strong
was retailing, CRM sales, and applications in North America generally. The quarter wasn't dependent on any one large
deal, anything like that, it was just a very solid quarter.
Hardware systems product revenue was $669 million, as older products like the older M-series and Netra saw
significant declines. Storage was more a mix story with tape down a bit, SAN down significantly while
network-attached storage was up. The Engineered Systems customer base continues to expand nicely. Exadata
bookings look very good. Revenues from Exalytics, SuperCluster and the Oracle Database Appliance all grew over
100%.
For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $8.4 billion, up 4% from last year. Our non-GAAP operating
income was $3.7 billion which was 6% higher than last year and operating margin expanded to 45%. We still believe
there remains ample leverage in the business model.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 21.8%. EPS for the quarter grew 12% in U.S. dollars to $0.59 on a
non-GAAP basis. The GAAP tax rate was 17.7% which was lower than my guidance for last quarter due to some
one-time events and the mix of earnings. On a GAAP basis EPS for the quarter was $0.47 in U.S. dollars which was up
14%.
Free cash flow increased to a record $14.2 billion over the last four quarters and to an all-time high of $6.1 billion for
Q1, up 11% from last year. We're now on the cusp of generating more free cash flow that IBM. Just five years ago, we
generated roughly half the level of IBM's free cash flow over four quarters.
We now have over $39 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of debt, our cash position is $15 billion. As we've
said before, we are committed to returning the value to our shareholders through earnings growth, share repurchases
and a dividend. This quarter we repurchased 92.8 million shares for a total of $3 billion. Over the last 12 months we've
repurchased nearly 335 million shares for a total of $10.9 billion, paid out dividends of nearly $1.7 billion for a total
that is nearly 90% of our free cash flow. And the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share.
Now to the guidance, and I want to remind you that last Q2, new license and cloud revenue increased 18% in constant
currency, so this will be a very, very tough comparison. And though our pipelines and potential transactions for the
quarter look really very exciting, our sales leaders remain very careful about what they are forecasting to us.

So new software license and cloud subscription revenue growth is expected to range from negative 4% to positive 6%
in constant currency and negative 6% to positive 4% in reported dollars. Hardware product revenue is expected to
range from negative 9% to positive 1% in constant dollars and negative 11% to negative 1% in reported dollars. As a
result, total revenue growth on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 1% to 4% in constant
dollars and negative 1% to positive 2% in U.S. dollars.
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.65 and $0.70 in constant dollars, $0.64 to $0.69 in reported
dollars. GAAP EPS is expected to be $0.51 to $0.56 in constant dollars and $0.50 to $0.55 in reported dollars. I want to
remind you that last year we had the benefit of a $145 million acquisition-related benefit for the Pillar earn--out. So
excluding that benefit, GAAP EPS last year would have been $0.51. This guidance assumes a tax rate of 23.5% and a
non-GAAP tax rate of 24%. Of course, it may end up being very different.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments.
Mark V. Hurd
Yeah, thanks, Safra. Just a couple things to add. Our new license executed really as we expected. The Americas had a
solid quarter, as Safra mentioned; 15% growth with both the U.S. and Latin America growing double digits, and
Asia-Pac came back strong with growth of 5%.
Database continues to be very strong, double-digit growth again this quarter. Now while customer activity on 12c was
excellent, it really is the traditional products, Database Options, Enterprise Manager, that drove this double-digit
growth. And we've seen that trend in three of the last four quarters.
And Cloud right now had a strong quarter. It's really started to hit stride with great wins at ANA, LinkedIn, Sirius XM
Radio, TELUS, Barclays Bank. And we're also really excited about our Sales Automation release 7. Not only will the
entire Oracle sales force run on release 7, but we're very excited to bring this to market. In HCM our Taleo product had
a very strong quarter with key wins at Honeywell, Emerson, Humana, Xilinx and DIRECTV.
Now last quarter we teased you a little bit with announcements we'd make and then we made them in June. We
announced a deal with Microsoft enabling customers to run Java and the Oracle database on the Azure cloud and that
we'd also be partnering with NetSuite on HCM. And lastly, we announced a comprehensive partnership with Salesforce
where they've chosen to power their cloud using Oracle 12c database and Exadata, amongst other Oracle products. We
expect others to follow suit.
Moving to Engineered Systems, we had great wins at Eaton, Telecom Italia, China Mobile, SunGard, Ingersoll-Rand
and Hitachi. Now, in the last two quarters we've shipped almost 2,000 systems, and this quarter we saw great unit
growth north of 60% as we shipped nearly 800 systems. Nearly 40% of Exadata systems were sold to new customers,
and we expect to grow our business with these customers over time. We're gaining a material amount of unit market
share. Exalytics, SPARC SuperCluster, the Oracle Database Appliance, all had growth in excess of 100%.
Lastly, our sales org in terms of salespeople is up. We're making investments in productivity to make them sell more.
We're growing faster than our key competitors, and our attrition is down from historical levels and down significantly
from last year.
Now with that, I thought I'd make a couple comments about Oracle OpenWorld, which is next week. We plan to have
roughly 60,000 people at the event in San Francisco from 145 countries. We expect to have 2 million attendees online,
so this is going to be the biggest one yet. We've got a great lineup of speakers. We've got EMC, Dell, Michael will
actually be there. We've got Fujitsu, Deloitte, Intel there. We've got customers LinkedIn, AT&T, Facebook, Electronic
Arts, Thompson Reuters, New York Stock Exchange, Tesco, Deutsche Telekom. I could just go on.
It's going to be a great set of people from the industry as well as customers, a very large attendee base. And we will
make some significant product announcements at the event as well. We'll be introducing Oracle 12c in-memory
database. We'll be talking about it being able to deliver 100 X faster application performance using the new

architectural approach. We'll be talking about existing Oracle apps that can now run in the Oracle database
functionality without change when using this in-memory capability. We'll have some releases in Cloud we'll talk about.
We'll have some release in HCM and talent management. We'll talk about database as a service, Java as a service that'll
be available to our customers.
So there will be a whole slew of product announcements there that Larry will be talking about Sunday night and will
continue on through the week so we're excited about the upcoming activities at Oracle OpenWorld.
With that, I'll turn it back to Ken and we'll take whatever questions you've got.
Kenneth Bond
Brian, we'll go to the Q&A now, if you're ready?
Q&A
Operator
Yes. Thank you. And we'll now take our first question from John DiFucci with JPMorgan.
<Q - John S. DiFucci>: Hello. Thank you for taking my question. Mark, you mentioned the strength in database and
it's reflected in license but it's also I think reflected in margins this quarter. You mentioned, and I would think it's really
too early for 12c to be having much of an impact on the numbers anyway, you mentioned options, Enterprise Manager.
I guess the question is why the strength right now in database? And how does this business look as you look forward
the core database with options.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Yeah, the interesting thing, John, first is we not only had good growth in database but we also
had good growth in database in the U.S. So it was very strong. It's exactly what you described. First, it was broad-based
across the regions, even with the strong showing in the U.S., and it was really the options. And again, as you start
dealing with some of the issues you see in the market, take for example, something as simple as the data growth that
you all hear in the industry, 30%, 40% data growth that our customers talk about, the ability for us to compress that
data is a tremendous opportunity and it's an option that, you can get advanced compression, you can get it with Exadata
that dramatically changes our customers' total cost of ownership.
So we had good growth really across regions, particularly strong in the U.S., particularly strong options. GoldenGate
was very strong. We had good growth in RAC, Active Data, in-memory caching, security was – I mentioned this I
think last quarter too, we had very strong growth again in security, and these are turning to be material businesses,
John, and I think this is not really the beginning – I would not call any of this really any significant impact from 12c.
This is really just the core database and the options around the core database.
<Q - John S. DiFucci>: You mentioned Exadata, so it sounds like sort of that Exadata pulls long some of these options
too and that's having an effect here?
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: It's all part of one story, John, in the context of we've got so much database out there and the
issue to drive more performance, more security, drive more compression, you can get a lot of it with the database as a
product. You can get even more of it when you buy Exadata and so it's a strong value prop, John.
<Q - John S. DiFucci>: Thanks, Mark. And if I might, just one quick one for Safra. Safra, the guidance you gave is a
little bit below where the Street is right now. You mentioned, you talked about exciting pipelines I think the word is
that you used, but you also talked about manage – the salespeople or sales managers being, I don't know what word you
used, but it sounded like being prudent. I guess if you, in the past you sometimes gauged what that guidance is. Do you
think that, that is something – the guidance you've given is it similar to the conservatism that is prudent that you
normally give? Is a little bit more conservative or less? If you can comment on that?

<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Well, as I always say to you all, I read the same newspapers or read the websites that you all
do and there's a lot of news out there whether it's coming out from our own government or from Europe and that
influences what we put as a backdrop for our forecast, and today was a big news day in both directions, and so we're
just trying to – I think everybody's just trying to stay a little bit, to have a little bit of room, and we could do
significantly better. But we still, even though our pipelines are big, we still have to close all those deals, and I just can't
assume that we will. So I try to just be reasonable about it, conservative about it. But I just need to take into account a
lot of different inputs. And I think that's where the guidance range is.
<Q - John S. DiFucci>: Okay. Great, that's helpful. Thank you, both.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Sure. Next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll now take our next question from Raimo Lenschow.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Thanks for taking my question. I just had a very topical one, you guys had a conference call
with Salesforce a few weeks ago that focused on joining the different clouds. A few minutes ago we had a call from
two cloud vendors that want to work closer together going forward. Can you talk maybe a little bit about this new
environment of vendors having to pre-integrate their cloud products? And also maybe go on a little bit about Fusion.
And it's a more complete solution than what others have. How is that done and how does that fit into the new world
here? Thank you.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Hi, Raimo. So first of all, I think that what you're seeing is that in fact customers want systems
that are integrated, and that, I think, works to our advantage. And it's significantly easier, obviously, to have very
integrated and very seamless integration when you own all the products, as we do. For those customers that have mixed
environments, especially a large installed base of one of our competitors, the big benefit of course in working with us is
that it's all based on our technology. I think it gets significantly harder when you're talking about almost random
companies who are trying to make the experience seamless when their systems are so very, very different, the
definitions, the underlying platforms are very, very different.
For us, we view this as a huge benefit towards us, and we think it's actually powering the strength of Fusion and the
interest in Fusion because Fusion actually has a second piece to it, which is it integrates not only all of our applications
work together in Fusion, but they also work with all of your existing Oracle applications in a way that if – and Fusion
itself can be deployed some on-premise if you'd like and some in the cloud and back-and-forth, in fact. So what you're
seeing is customers wanting more choice, but better integration. And we're really the only ones who have all the
products and the depth and an ability to deliver it in the cloud, in the public cloud, in a private cloud behind their
firewall or on-premise, which is truly about customer choice.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Perfect. Thank you.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please.
Operator
We'll take the next question from Joel Fishbein.
<Q - Joel P. Fishbein>: Yes. Good afternoon. Mark, a quick question. As I was going through the numbers, it looked
like hardware support is up 5% against hardware that's down 13%. Can you give me some – or give us some more color
on what's going on there?
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Yeah, I mean, I think, Joel, I've talked about this in the past. I think that if you looked
historically when the hardware business was not part of Oracle, the attach of service to a unit, so you sell a unit and you
then sell service with it; historically, pre-Oracle, that was a very, very low number. And we've realigned our business

so that as we sort of shifted to these very high Oracle-content products, we now attach support all the time. And as a
result, the growth of support is not symmetrical with the product growth rate. And so what we do is having support now
growing materially faster as we catch up to what I would argue would be industry norms in terms of the way you attach
support to a product. And it's causing – I understand your point, it doesn't look right that hardware support is growing
now 5%.
I might add our margins have improved dramatically with the growth rate, but it is because that we now have high
Oracle-content products and we're attaching support to those products regularly when we sell them. And that is causing
our hardware support to grow in a way that doesn't align directly to the hardware price.
Now I can tell it to you in another way, Joel. Once we start growing the top line in hardware, that will even be a further
catalyst to hardware support and because much of that cost in hardware is support, it's sort of a baseline set of costs to
be in the business, things like parts depots and spare parts. You'll actually be in position where you can make even
more margin. So it's really, Joel, just us going back to the fundamentals of running a good hardware support business
and it starts with attaching the service and the support to the product when you sell it, which is what we've done.
<Q - Joel P. Fishbein>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Brent Thill.
<Q - Brent Thill>: Good afternoon. My question is on the general demand environment, and, Safra, I think you made a
comment that you believe you can do significantly better. Overall tech spending seems to be pretty positive, yet your
guidance – and we certainly respect the tough comp – is really for no license growth. So from your perspective, what
are the key enablers for you to get back to what I would assume you would perceive to be more healthy growth on the
license side? What key building blocks do you have to fill in from here?
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: It's just that – we just have to execute and we have to avoid any kind of economic deterioration
or things like that. Some of those things are out of our control. We just have to execute. We have to have another
quarter just like this one, just straight execution, just follow a straight line. I think we have an opportunity to do
significantly better, but we just want to move forward. It really, really does come down for this next quarter to being an
extremely difficult comp.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: I'd probably put a little different view on your comments. One, listen, to Safra's point, we read
all of our peer group's results and to be very blunt, they're not very good. So what, depending on who you're talking
about, most of their numbers are negative. So when you say there's a robust tech spending environment, I'm not sure
whose numbers you're reading. So that's sort of point one. When you look at scale technology companies, there's some
pretty significant headwinds out there when you certainly look in July through the June read outs.
So when you look at this quarter, I would argue we again gained a lot of share just based on the results we just gave
you. So I think what we're telling you out there is we see what's out there. We're trying to be prudent and thoughtful in
the guidance we give. I don't think it's as much about the tough comp. I mean tough comp is part of it. There's also a
couple points of currency that are involved in the number that got you to zero as well. So that would be my view of it.
<Q - Brent Thill>: Great. Thanks.

<Q - Jason A. Maynard>: Hey, guys. I want to talk a little bit more about the hardware business and, Mark, if you
could maybe give us a little bit of a drill down into what's going on with the M and the T and how you expect that to
play out, talk a little bit about what's going on with some of the legacy products. And the last question would be, are
you still comfortable with seeing some growth this year in the overall hardware business just on the product side?
Thank you.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Sure. Thanks. Jason, I think we'll have some growth in hardware this year. I would say your
question which was primarily about the SPARC line, T was okay in the quarter. M was not. So as you know, in sort of
Q4-ish timeframe, mid-Q4 we released a new set of M products. We're pretty excited about them. We've got a big
installed base that we can move. It takes time to get those products certified and tested in customers' environments but
that's what happened in the numbers. We had the strong Exadata unit growth that both Safra and I described. We had
very good results in several regions in our storage, if you will, our NAS storage business. Tape was unexciting, as it has
been for a period of time, and the real issue was, again, in the M part of the SPARC line. That's really the story on
hardware.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please.
Operator
And we'll take our next question from Heather Bellini.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Hi, great. I wanted to follow up, Mark, a little bit on the response you gave to Brent just
talking about the competitive environment. I was just wondering specifically if you could share with us kind of who
what companies in particular are you benchmarking yourself against? Who are you benchmarking yourself against?
And how do you keep score versus those guys, if you will?
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: That could take us a while. I think to start off with if you're looking at who our competitors are,
you know, Heather, we certainly compete in the infrastructure business with IBM. They would be a competitor. We
certainly would compete to a part of the infrastructure business with EMC, probably to a lesser degree. Not so much in
the head-on storage business but the fact that when we're dealing with data and management of data you can see
competition from that perspective.
In the applications business, clearly SAP on a global basis, they would be a competitor. And then in addition to that,
you have competitors, I'd say even like Salesforce and Workday now, albeit that they're mostly North American and
that they're mostly in one process, Workday in HR and Salesforce in sales automation. We still view them as
competitors.
Now I could go down a slew of others in various product groups but those would be the big ones that I would describe
to you, Heather.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please.

And we'll take our next question from Rick Sherlund.
<Q - Rick G. Sherlund>: Thanks. Mark, can you hear me okay?
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: I can hear you great, Rick.
<Q - Rick G. Sherlund>: Okay. Thanks. The head count, you're up about 9% in Americas year-over-year and you're
up about 3% in the rest of the world. You showed good license growth in the Americas. I'm curious what's behind the
head count growth in Americas versus the rest of the world. Are you ramping sales head count or what's happening

there?
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: It is nothing more than the run rate that comes. So imagine as we've talked over the several
quarters, there is not a big bump sequentially, per se, as it is just the run rate of the hiring. As I said before, we were
quicker to hire in Europe, which is what really has helped us in Europe. While Europe was not fantastic for us in Q1
over the past several quarters, they've gained a lot of share in Europe. And one of the reasons for that has been the fact
that they've simply been in more deals. They've been in front of more customers. We were slower to ramp in the U.S.,
although, to your point, with your numbers we have begun to, and that shows up in the run rate that turns into this
year-over-year comp rate. And it has shown up by the fact that, when you look at our U.S. numbers over the past
couple of quarters, we are beginning to see some of that same effect that we saw in Europe.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please.

And we'll take our next question from Walter Pritchard.
<Q - Walter H. Pritchard>: Great, thanks. Mark, I wondered if you could talk about you did have better performance
it seems like from a sales execution perspective in Q1, I'm wondering if you could talk about what changes you've
made within the sales organization with execution in fiscal 2014 here as we're in the early months of that. Thanks.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: We really made no changes in fiscal 2014. So as we've said, we made changes over a year ago,
and one of our objectives going into 2014 was to make a minimal amount of changes. Before we went into 2014 we
had all our territories deployed, our quotas deployed. We really look to change almost zero territories and keep the
territories the same as they were the year before. We kept our specialization the same as the year before.
So as a result, we wound up really ready to go in the very early part of the quarter. And I think we talked about this on
the last conference call. But it was a big thing for us to have our quotas deployed and our territories defined. Everybody
knew their boss very early in June, and you can see it had in the end some affect for us. So there really were not many
changes in the sales force. And it's also shown up in, frankly, our attrition is down, which is helpful as well because we
have performers. And when you have to have attrition, you have to change a territory when someone attrits. And the
fact that the attrition is down is helpful to us in that respect as well.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please.
Operator
We will now take our last question from Kash Rangan.
<Q - Kash Gopalan Rangan>: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Mark and Safra, could you talk about – it's been
couple of years since you finished up Taleo and RightNow and I wonder if you could give us your thoughts on how you
view the growth opportunities for these two products lines, albeit [indiscernible] (31:32) but they are still important, if
you could address that.
But also I think the one story that is not told is the vertical specific applications. There is a bit of a myopic focus on HR
and CRM, which I completely get, but you guys have been historically very strong in vertical applications. So I'm
curious to get your thoughts on how you see a growth opportunity in verticals and how are they doing in general?
Thank you.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: RightNow has done very well for us. When you look at the overall market position, to the
earlier question, today we're really number one in service automation. We haven't talked about Eloqua, but we're
number one in marketing automation. So when you look at what's gone on and if you look at the web commerce space,
our products like ATG Endeca, we're number one in commerce server and the overall customer experience space. And
when you line those up, we have a very powerful offering in that whole customer experience, broader customer

So RightNow was strong in the quarter. I would argue we grew in RightNow in the quarter against a very tough comp.
Our toughest comp in RightNow in the quarter was Q1, and we had growth in Q1 and we were very encouraged by
that, particularly, Kash, the growth globally. We've had good global traction with RightNow.
Taleo had a good quarter, very good growth in Taleo in the quarter. So we were excited about that as well. And they're
both market leaders, leading recruiting app and, again, leading service automation app.
Verticals, we told the story many times. We've had a tremendous run in retail. We've really, I hate to use the term rolled
up the retail industry, but we're in the process of really going retailer to retailer to retailer with merchandising,
planning, our point-of-sale capabilities, and being able to really be, we think, the leader in the retail applications
marketplace.
We made investments over the past couple of quarters in additional products in the communications industry with our
acquisitions of Tekelec and Acme Packet. And the collection now we have from our billing assets and those assets
make us a leader now in the communications industry as well. We're doing the same thing with utilities. We're doing
the same thing in banking, the same thing in healthcare, so it is a critical strategy for us and the great news is when we
win in these industries, all of Oracle wins. I mean we win at the database layer, we win at the middleware layer, we win
at the hardware layer. So it's a very key strategy for us and we've made investments in those areas, as I described, both
from an acquisition perspective and with more distribution as well.
