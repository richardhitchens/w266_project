MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, everyone, and welcome to this Exxon Mobil Corporation third quarter 2014 earnings conference call.
Today's call is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Vice President of Investor Relations and
Secretary, Mr. Jeff Woodbury. Please go ahead, sir.
Jeffrey J. Woodbury
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, good morning, and welcome to Exxon Mobil's Third Quarter Earnings Call. The
focus of this call is Exxon Mobil's financial and operating results for the quarter and I'll refer to the slides that are
available through the Investor section of our website.
Before we go further, I'd like to draw your attention to our cautionary statement shown on slide two.
Turning now to slide three, let me begin by summarizing the key headlines from our third quarter and year-to-date
performance. First, Exxon Mobil's financial results reflect the strength of the integrated business model, which creates
unique competitive advantages and allows us to generate long-term shareholder value regardless of market fluctuations
over the business cycle.

Second, year-to-date cash flow from operations and asset sales fully covered our net investments in the business and
robust shareholder distributions. And third, we continue to meet our operational and project development objectives.
Production – Upstream production volume for 2014 remain on track to average four million oil equivalent barrels per
day by year-end as the company delivers new production from project startups and work programs, all of which are
enhancing our financial performance.
Now moving to slide four, we provide an overview of some of the external factors impacting our results. Global
economy showed mixed results in the third quarter. In the U.S., the economy continued to expand at a moderate pace.
However, China's economic growth tapered slightly while the European economy showed further signs of weakness.
As you know, crude oil prices decreased sharply and Henry Hub gas prices also weakened. The WTI spread to Brent
narrowed whereas global industry refining margins were essentially flat as stronger European margins were offset by
weaker margins in the U.S. And finally, chemical commodity and specialty margins strengthened during the quarter.
Turning now to the financial results shown on slide five. Exxon Mobil's third quarter earnings were $8.1 billion or
$1.89 per share. The corporation distributed $5.9 billion to shareholders in the quarter through dividends and our share
repurchase program. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding were $3 billion.
CapEx was $9.8 billion in the quarter and just over $28 billion year-to-date down 14% when compared to the first nine
months of 2013. Cash flow from operations and asset sales were $12.5 billion and at the end of the quarter, cash totaled
$5 billion and debt was just shy of $22 billion.
The next slide provides additional detail on third quarter sources and uses of funds. Over the quarter, cash decreased by
$1.3 billion from $6.3 billion to $5 billion. Earnings, depreciation expense, changes in working capital and other items
and our ongoing asset management program yielded $12.5 billion of cash flow from operations and asset sales. Uses
included net investments in the business of $7.9 billion and our shareholder distributions of $5.9 billion. Share
purchases to reduce shares outstanding are expected to continue at $3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014.
Now moving to slide seven and a review of our segmented results. Exxon Mobil's third quarter earnings of $8.1 billion
increased by $200 million from the third quarter of 2013. As you can see, higher Downstream and Chemical margins
were partly offset by lower Upstream liquids realizations and higher corporate and financing expenses.
In the sequential quarter comparison shown on slide eight earnings decreased by $710 million. Lower gains on
Upstream asset sales were partially offset by higher Downstream and Chemical earnings. Our guidance for corporate
and financing expenses remains at $500 million to $700 million per quarter.
Turning now to the Upstream financial and operating results starting on slide nine. Upstream earnings in the third
quarter were $6.4 billion, a decrease of $297 million versus the third quarter of 2013. Realizations decreased earnings
by $670 million, driven by lower liquid prices, and in this regard, on a worldwide basis, crude oil realizations decreased
by $10.48 per barrel and worldwide natural gas realizations decreased by $0.42 per thousand cubic feet as lower
European realizations were partly offset by higher U.S. gas prices. Notably, favorable sales mix effects increased
earnings by $340 million. Higher margin production growth in Papua, New Guinea; Angola and North America as well
as a net overlift, were partly offset by higher planned maintenance activities, lower entitlements and field decline.
Moving to slide ten: excluding the impact of the Abu Dhabi onshore concession expiry, our oil equivalent production
decreased by 1% compared to the third quarter of last year. Importantly liquids production was up 14,000 barrels per
day. Increased production from onshore U.S. work programs, Canada and Angola were partly offset by divestment
impacts in Iraq and Canada as well as scheduled maintenance in the U.S., Nigeria and Russia. Natural gas production
was down 319 million cubic feet per day as expected field decline in the U.S. and unfavorable entitlement impacts from
pipeline gas in Qatar were partly offset by new high-margin production from Papua, New Guinea LNG.
In short our volume performance demonstrates the progress being made to high grade our portfolio mix with
higher-margin liquids and liquids linked gas production. As previously indicated we remain on track to produce 4
million oil equivalent barrels per day in 2014.

Turning now to the sequential comparison starting on slide 11, our Upstream earnings decreased $1.5 billion versus the
second quarter. Realizations reduced earnings by $850 million with worldwide crude realizations down $7.29 per barrel
and natural gas realizations down $0.56 per thousand cubic feet. Again, favorable sales mix effects increased earnings
by $460 million, reflecting profitable growth in Papua New Guinea, Angola and Canada and a net overlift, partly offset
by lower seasonal demand in Europe. All other items reduced earnings by $1.1 billion, primarily driven by the absence
of the prior quarter Hong Kong power divestment gain. Upstream after-tax earnings per barrel were $18.65, excluding
the impact of non-controlling interest volumes.
Moving on to slide 12, volumes were essentially flat versus the second quarter. However, liquids production was up
17,000 barrels per day due to growth in Angola and the U.S., partly offset by higher planned maintenance in the U.S.,
Nigeria and Russia. Natural gas volumes were down 155 million cubic feet per day, reflecting lower seasonal demand
in Europe, partly offset by a full quarter of Papua New Guinea LNG volumes.
Moving now to the Downstream financial and operating results starting on slide 13, Downstream earnings for the
quarter were $1 billion, up $432 million from the third quarter of 2013. Higher refining margins increased earnings by
$820 million whereas volume and mix effects added another $100 million. All other items decreased earnings by $490
million, which mainly was due to unfavorable foreign exchange impacts.
Turning to slide 14: sequentially, third quarter Downstream earnings increased by $313 million. Higher non-use
refining margins increased earnings by $310 million. Positive volume and mix effects due to lower maintenance were
offset by unfavorable foreign exchange and other effects.
Moving now to Chemical financial and operating results shown on slide 15, third quarter Chemical earnings were $1.2
billion, up $175 million versus the prior year quarter, mainly due to higher commodity product margins. Positive
volume and mix effects were more than offset by increased planned maintenance activities.
Moving to slide 16: sequentially, our Chemical earnings increased by $359 million due to higher commodity and
specialty product margins.
Moving now to an update on our year-to-date cash flow growth shown on slide 17. Strong year-to-date cash flow from
operations and asset sales of $41.5 billion more than covered a net $22 billion invested in the business and $17.6 billion
distributed to our shareholders. The remaining cash was used for other financing activities including debt reduction.
Overall, free cash flow of $19.4 billion represented an increase of $12 billion compared to the same period in 2013.
This year-to-date free cash flow growth reflects our strong operational performance, ongoing asset management
program and disciplined capital allocation.
Turning now to slide 18, I'd like to provide an update on project startups that will deliver profitable growth. We remain
on track for a record startup year and plan to add 300,000 net oil crude barrels per day of production capacity that is
indicative of the diversity of our resource base. We continue to demonstrate our world-class project execution
capabilities and have made significant progress during the year.
Through June, three major projects were started up. As you know, Papua New Guinea LNG came online a few months
ahead of schedule and reached full capacity in July. In Angola, CLOV reached full capacity in third quarter, just a few
months after first production, and in Malaysia, Damar started up in the first quarter.
Recently we achieved several additional project milestones. In Indonesia the second well pad at the Banyu Urip project
started up adding another 10,000 barrels per day of early production. Banyu Urip is now producing nearly 40,000
barrels per day. Construction of the central processing facilities, as shown in the picture, is near complete and the
floating offshore storage vessel was recently towed to its location for final hook up. The project will reach full field
capacity of 165,000 barrels per day in 2015.
In Malaysia the Tapis Enhanced Oil Recovery project, which is the first large-scale EOR project in the country, was
completed. The project is utilizing a water-alternating gas injection process to sweep remaining oil reserves to the
producing wells increasing overall recovery.

Also the Qatargas 1 Plateau Maintenance project was completed enabling the venture to maintain 10 million tons of
annual LNG production for years to come. The project added well capacity and new onshore facilities for sulfur
handling.
In the fourth quarter we also expect to start up several additional major projects closing out our 2014 plans. In our
offshore Sakhalin project in Russia, the first production well at Arkutun-Dagi is currently being built. Offshore facility
hookup and commissioning activities are nearing completion following the installation of the platform topsides this
summer. Startup is anticipated around year-end and the field is expected to add 90,000 barrels of oil per day at peak
production.
In the Gulf of Mexico hookup and commissioning activities for both the Hadrian South and Lucius developments are
underway. At Hadrian South we finished drilling the two subsea wells earlier this year and installation of the subsea
facilities for the tie back to the Lucius spar is now complete. Startup of both projects is expected before year-end.
In Canada the Cold Lake Nabiye project is moving into the final stages of completion. Hydro testing and
commissioning activities are occurring in support of plant startup and steam injection is expected around the end of the
year. This project will add another 40,000 barrels per day to Cold Lake production.
I would now like to turn to slide 19 for an update on our U.S. onshore liquids growth. We are generating significant
cash flow by growing high-margin liquids production in the U.S. primarily in unconventional plays. In the Bakken our
resource base is now approaching a billion oil equivalent barrels and gross operated production is up more than six-fold
since we first entered the play in 2008. The Bakken remains our most active unconventional play and is the liquids
growth engine in the U.S. Gross operated production has increased 38% year-on-year reflecting higher activity levels.
Currently running 13 rigs, up from ten in the third quarter of 2013 and have increased new wells brought online by 25%
year-on-year.
We continue to achieve strong results and increased efficiencies through our development drilling in the core areas,
optimizing completions and leveraging pad development. In this regard, drilling and completion costs have been
reduced by 25% since 2011. We also have successfully employed our proprietary XFrac technology to reduce costs by
eliminating the need for multiple plugs normally required for fracking.
In the Woodford shale we're running ten rigs, gross operated oil equivalent production in the liquids-rich Ardmore and
Marietta area has increased by 25% year-on-year driven by more completions, strong well performance, and the move
to pad development. Here too, well completion times have decreased significantly reducing costs and increasing the
number of wells drilled per rig year.
Although rig counts have remained basically flat, we have increased the number of new wells by 33% year-on-year. In
2014 we also increased drilling activity in the Marietta basin timed with the completion of infrastructure there. We are
encouraged by the initial delineation work in the Marietta, which has an even higher proportion of liquids then in the
Ardmore area.
And lastly in the Permian basin, we continue to develop both conventional and unconventional reservoirs across a
leading position of over 1.5 million net acres as shown on the map. Gross operated Permian production has increased
8% year-on-year on a large legacy production base reflecting increased drilling activity. Currently we have 16 rigs
drilling liquids rich opportunities almost tripling the number of rigs we had in the third quarter of 2013 along with
approximately 65 work-over rigs that are enhancing base conventional production.
We continuously look for opportunities to add attractive acreage through bolt-on acquisitions. In 2014 transactions with
Endeavor Energy Resources and LINN Energy added 64,000 net acres in the heart of the expanding Wolfcamp play as
shown on the map in blue, complementing the ramp-up of our horizontal drilling activities.
Turning now to slide 20 for an update on our exploration activities: in Romania, drilling activities at Domino II are
complete. The well was drilled to gather more information on the 2012 Domino discovery to assess the size of the
resource and its commerciality. Domino II is being followed by the Pelican South wildcat, which is currently being
drilled. Additional exploration targets are also planned.

In Tanzania Statoil and Exxon Mobil made a seventh discovery in block two. The Giligiliani-1 well discovered gas in
the western part of Block 2. The well confirmed an additional one trillion cubic feet of gas in place bringing the total
estimated resource in place up to 21 trillion cubic feet.
In Argentina, drilling and testing continue in the Vaca Muerta, where we have drilled and successfully tested two
Exxon Mobil-operated horizontal wells. The Bajo del Choique X-2 well flowed at an average initial rate of 770 barrels
of oil per day and is currently on a long-term test and I'll note that this is the highest unconventional oil production rate
test in Argentina. The La Invernada X-3 well began testing in September with encouraging initial results although still
cleaning up. Our active program continues with additional drilling and testing later this year and into 2015.
And finally, in Russia we successfully drilled the University-1 well in the Kara Sea. I can confirm that the well did
encounter hydrocarbons, however, the results are under evaluation and it would be premature to comment any further
this time. The well was safely plugged and abandoned and the rig has departed the location.
So in conclusion, today's presentation provides a summary of our year-to-date performance. Exxon Mobil's strong
financial operating results demonstrate the value of our integrated business model and unique competitive advantages.
Total earnings were $26 billion, reflecting solid operating performance across all of our businesses and our ongoing
asset management program.
In the Upstream, production of 3.9 million oil equivalent barrels per day remain in line with our plan as we add new
production from project startups and work programs. We continue to improve our production mix with unit profitability
increasing from $18 per barrel in 2013 to just over $21 per barrel year-to-date.
Our strong operating results, combined with our disciplined capital allocation approach generated a robust free cash
flow of $19.4 billion, an increase of $12 billion compared to the same period in 2013. This favorable performance
enabled us to maintain industry-leading shareholder distributions of $17.6 billion.
That concludes my prepared remarks, and now we'd be happy to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, Mr. Woodbury. [Operator Instructions] And we'll first go to Ed Westlake, Credit Suisse.
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: Yes, and may I say welcome on behalf of the sell side to the new role.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Thank you, Ed.
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: So obviously your net income margins probably surprised most people. They
seemed to go up as the oil price pulled back. You've got new projects, obviously, coming on-stream, and I can see that
your expiration expense was a little bit low, which is kind of non-cash. But can you give us some color as to why you
think net income per barrel went up in the U.S. and internationally? [ph] All surprised. (24:00)
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yes. I mean, let me broadly say, Ed, that it starts with the integrated business model.
You're all very aware that we've got a very cyclical nature of our business, and our business model is focused on
creating shareholder value by participating through that whole value chain, so it provides robust earnings performance
despite the cyclical nature. If you think about just the overall Upstream unit performance, as I said, we're up
year-to-date versus 2013 by about $3 per barrel. Half of that is asset management impacts, the other half are improved
profitability, primarily due to improved liquids mix as well as higher profitability around our gas projects – really good
progress by the organization in improving the higher-margin production, as I said in the presentation.
<Q - Edward George Westlake>: Okay. And then a second unrelated question, just around Kearl. Obviously that is a
big project, and there's the Kearl expansion and potential debottlenecking, so maybe just give us an update of the latest
status in a bit more detail there. Thank you.

<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Sure. Thanks for that, Ed. Kearl, as we've said many times, is a long-life asset. It's
advantaged. Obviously it's advantaged because of the proprietary technology that we've implemented where it forgoes
the need for an upgrader. Overall, I'd say that we're making progress quarter-on-quarter at Kearl. Currently we're
consistently producing over 100,000 barrels of oil per day. As we ramp up production there, we are clearly identifying
opportunities where we can further enhance the facility reliability. I will say that we did take a turnaround in September
for planned maintenance, and all of these learnings are being fully integrated into the expansion project.
As you know, we've talked about the importance of capturing the learnings from the initial development, and that was a
key element of our investment decision to progress right into the expansion. Likewise, as we get more and more
comfort with the operability of the initial development, those learnings are being integrated into the expansion project
as well.
So overall, really pleased with the asset. As I said, it's a long-life asset that's going to provide very stable productions,
and quite frankly, Ed, we're in our sweet spot right now. We have – this is what we do very, very well in terms of our
project execution and then optimizing our operations to make sure that we maximize the value from the resource.
Operator
Thank you. We'll now go to Phil Gresh, JPMorgan.
<Q - Phil M. Gresh>: Hey. Good morning.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Phil.
<Q - Phil M. Gresh>: Just kind of following up on the question about the margin lift in the quarter and the past couple
of quarters. Just kind of wondering how you would think about – how we should think about the next year or so and
what potential benefits you could see, in particular from cost levers. As we've seen the oil price come down, what
leverage do you think you can pull around cost and/or CapEx?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yes, Phil, that's a great question. Clearly the market is seeing some changes with prices. I
don't think any of us should be surprised, given the oversupply and continued economic weakness. I'll go right back,
Phil, to the value of our integrated business model, which really does position us well to capture shareholder value
through the cyclical nature of the business.
Quite frankly, the market controls the price, and what we need to focus on are the variables that we do control. And to
your question, those include things like effectively managing our development and operating costs, maximizing our
reliability and then optimizing the value of the molecules through the integrated business model. All along that has
been a fundamental mainstay of our corporation and then as a key element of how we manage that and it's always
around optimizing the cost structure within our assets so that we are maximizing the value from the resources.
<Q - Phil M. Gresh>: Just as a clarification, could you tell us how much of the 2015 CapEx is locked in at this point?
What kind of flexibility you have?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah, so just a little bit more about the CapEx, if I could step back a moment, as you all
know our CapEx has grown through the years and it peaked in 2013 at about $42.5 billion. That was largely driven by a
deliberate decision to progress several high-value Upstream research projects – Upstream resource projects that were
ready and mature to move forward and now we're trailing down to what I'd consider more of a normal spend pattern of
just shy of $37 billion.
Now the Upstream is dropping off a little bit more than that as the Downstream and Chemical are increasing their
spend pattern but you can appreciate a lot of these projects that are in current progress that CapEx profile will continue
into the future. Our guidance is no different, Phil in terms of just shy of $37 billion a year for the next couple, and we
continue to invest through the cyclical nature of our business.

<Q - Phil M. Gresh>: Okay. My second question would be, you obviously have a very strong balance sheet and strong
free cash flow generation arguably stronger than most of your peers, so you're in a pretty unique position to be
potentially more aggressive in this period of weaker oil prices so maybe you could comment about how you would
think about that bigger picture whether it's the buyback program or opportunities with the portfolio.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah, Phil. I would tell you, I think you assess it up pretty good. Clearly the financial
flexibility we have with our current debt levels and our AAA credit rating position us very well to respond to potential
investment opportunities whether they be additional resource developments, investment in our Downstream or
Chemical that provide us advantaged benefits to the industry. It really requires us though to maintain a very disciplined
approach to capital allocation through the business cycle, while at the same time providing industry-leading shareholder
distributions. So if you think about our capital allocation approach, it's first and foremost to invest in all of our
attractive business opportunities that are accretive to average unit profitability and returns.
Second is to continue to pay our reliable and growing dividends, and I'll remind everybody that our dividends have
grown about 10% a year over the last ten years. And then lastly is to return cash to our shareholders through our share
buyback program. As we've said in the past our operating cash flows remain the primary source of funding for both our
capital requirements and our shareholder distributions, but we'll access the financial markets when and if needed, to
meet commitments or capture opportunities.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Thanks, Phil.
Operator
Thank you. We'll now hear from Doug Terreson, ISI.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Good morning, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: My question is in regard to margin and profitability improvement as well, you covered the
mix effects on new projects and the removal of Abu Dhabi but you also mentioned asset management. So my question
is whether these benefits that you guys are getting from asset management are of the strategic or operational variety, so
just some clarification on what you meant by that?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: So as you know, asset management has been a core component of how we manage our
business. We're constantly looking across the portfolio to assess how we could maximize the value of our assets either
through development or finding alternative means to go ahead and monetize those assets. So as a result, as you know,
we had a very healthy program in terms of our divestment activities. In terms of our unit profitability, as I said,
year-on-year, 2014 to 2013, part of that increase in unit profitability was associated with our asset management efforts.
By way of example, Doug, let me just remind you, over the last ten years, for instance, in our Downstream, we have
reduced our refining capacity by more than a million barrels a day, associated with divestment of about 20-plus
refineries. We've divested over 200 fuel terminals, 38 blending plants and 6,000 miles of pipeline. So it's a very active
program to make sure that we're maximizing the value to the shareholder but also positioning us strategically to
continue to perform at an industry leading pace in the future.
<Q - Doug T. Terreson>: Let me ask you one other question about this. So the company's always done really well
optimizing costs, but has there been – and there's always been pressure on your cost for that reason, but – is there
maybe a step-up in the effort to deliver sustained cost improvements that also may be affecting the results over the last
few quarters?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: We always focus on cost management and our cost structure, Doug. I'd tell you that
regardless of where we are in the business cycle, that is a fundamental part of our DNA is how do we become even
more efficient than we've had historically? And that's not only through the highly qualified people we have working
here at Exxon Mobil, but also the application, the technologies that we have in order to position ourselves in a – even a

<Q - Evan Calio>: Hey. Good morning, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Evan.
<Q - Evan Calio>: So somewhat related to the cash flow question and discipline. What drives the 4Q buyback
guidance at $3 billion, given the sequential commodity price drop or seasonality in refining, and [indiscernible] (35:38)
cash in 3Q? Maybe in general, what commodity price do you need to slow the flywheel or buyback, or will the balance
sheet just kind of underwrite that through any potential downturn?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Evan, I would fall back on what I indicated previously on our capital allocation approach.
It's a decision that we manage internally around what are our cash requirements in order to invest in the opportunities
that we have in our portfolio? It's making sure that we continue to return cash to our shareholders through the dividend,
and then we make a unique decision internally around how much additional cash are we to go ahead and distribute to
our shareholders via our stock buyback program.
<Q - Evan Calio>: That's just more of a quarterly-by-quarterly assessment, because I know it's kind of up and down
over time. Is that how it's approached?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yes, Evan, I'd say it's probably much more continual than that, but generally speaking,
yes, there's a – if you will, a decisive point on each quarter to decide what we're going to do in the next – near future.

And moving on, we'll hear from Asit Sen, Cowen & Company.
<Q - Asit K. Sen>: Thanks, and good morning.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Asit.
<Q - Asit K. Sen>: So two unrelated questions. First, thanks for the color on U.S. onshore liquids. But I wonder if you
could quantify your production during the quarter, if you could, from U.S. unconventional?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yes. You bet, Asit. Let me just share with you – the largest part of our unconventional
U.S. liquids growth is in the Permian, Bakken and the Woodford, and in total, those are producing in excess of 210,000
barrels a day now. And as I said in my prepared comments, it has really been a significant progress over the last several
quarters. I'd give you a little bit more color to that by saying that about 40% of that is in the Bakken, 35% in the
Permian and the rest is in the Woodford. Great progress. Couldn't be more proud of the folks there at XTO and the
success they've had here in the recent past.
<Q - Asit K. Sen>: Thanks, very helpful. And the second, on LNG, could you comment on how global energy pricing
adjusts to lower oil prices? It appears there's a four to six month lag. I wonder if you could comment on that?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Broadly speaking, the specifics of our LNG commercial agreements are confidential, but
let me use Papua New Guinea as an example. A majority of the Papua New Guinea volumes are contracted, in excess
of 95%. They are linked to a crude price and as crude price varies, so does that LNG.

Thank you. We'll next hear from Blake Fernandez with Howard Weil.
<Q - Blake M. Fernandez>: Good morning, Jeff. Thanks for taking the question. Over the past six months or so
you've announced a couple of investments in the Downstream in Europe which seemed a little bit counter to what we've
seen from peers who are basically trying to reduce their capital employed in the area. I'm just curious if Exxon is
maybe taking a different view on the macro, longer-term or if it's a scenario where you feel you have superior assets
where over time maybe just capacity rationalization occurs and you're left standing with an attractive asset?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Blake, thanks for the question and the interest in that area. Clearly, we are stepping out
and distinguishing ourselves but let me step back just a little bit and talk about the European portfolio and then the
Downstream investments. Clearly Europe is disadvantaged by over capacity, some of which is driven by the lower cost
feedstock in the U.S. and the Middle East. The sector will continue to rationalize existing capacity. Exxon Mobil's
European assets though, are advantaged versus our peers due to the more efficient operations and the integration that
we have with our chemicals and lubricants manufacturing businesses.
So you'll see us continue to invest through the business cycle in order to enhance our advantaged position. Now,
specific to those investments, they're always focused around key areas like lowering our raw material costs, increasing
our higher value product yields, expanding logistics capability and flexibility, and then our mainstay of reducing the
operating cost structure, ultimately to high-grade the products to capture market demand.
So if I focus specifically by way of example in the investment in the Antwerp delayed coker, that's around investing in
conversion capacity to take lower yield products such as the fuel oil and convert it to distillate [ph] products (40:57)
where we have higher volume and more margins.
<Q - Blake M. Fernandez>: Thanks. I'll take one more if I could. You may not be able to answer this, but you
mentioned the discovery in the Kara Sea with University-1. If I'm not mistaken I've read some press articles suggesting
that Rosneft may decide to pursue additional drilling on their own due to the sanctions and whatnot. I'm just kind of
curious how that would unfold with regard to your relationship there and participating in future interests?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Right. Well, Blake, thanks for the interest. Clearly this is an important area for the
industry in total and we certainly appreciate the interest. Let me first start off by just recognizing the success of the
well. We are extremely proud of what the organization has achieved in an extraordinarily remote Arctic region, both
from a logistics and a drilling perspective. The team successfully completed the well with the utmost concern for safety
and the environment and it really does speak to the strength and capability of the organization.
As I said in my prepared comments, I can confirm that we encountered hydrocarbons, but this is a very large area. This
acreage is over 31 million acres. We've got one penetration in that, so it is premature to make any assessment or really
say any more at this point. We are currently evaluating the results to assess what plans we'll move forward on. I will
remind you that Exxon Mobil has a very long-standing and successful business in Russia built on an effective and
mutually beneficial relationship with our Russian partners.

Moving on will hear from Jason Gammel, Jefferies.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: Thanks very much. Two questions for me, Jeff. First, on the accelerated drilling onshore
North America. I know that Exxon is a company that will invest throughout the pricing cycle but, just wondering if the
number of rigs that are being employed in these plays is going to be affected by the change that we've seen in pricing
conditions just over the last several weeks, and essentially what level of onshore price would you need to see before
you would perhaps start laying down rigs?

And then the second question – one of your primary competitors just this week successfully IPOd an MLP with
pipeline assets, and there's evidently a pretty big value gap between what the stock market is willing to pay for those
assets through an MLP and an integrated oil stock. Have you considered any form of MLP-type of transaction with
your pipeline assets?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yes. Jason, thanks for those questions. Let me first start with the unconventionals. As I
said, really good progress, I gave you a lot of details about it. Very proud of what the XTO organization is achieving up
there. Let me say that these near-term price fluctuations are not going to have an impact of – on our operational
activities. We test all of our investments across a range of economic parameters, including price, and I'll just say at a
high level that our current drilling programs and inventory are fairly robust in this price environment, so we're very
confident with the drilling activity. As I indicated, we are picking up rigs so that we can continue to progress our
resource development activities and it is a very significant part of our growth opportunity and importantly, our
improvement in overall profitability.
More specifically, on the Master Limited Partnership question, I talked a little bit already about our asset management
program, that that is a fundamental aspect of how we do our business, and it's around making sure that we're making
the right choices that are going to maximize value for the shareholder. We have – through the course of that process,
we've really divested or monetized all of our non-strategic assets, so we've been doing a lot of what you're hearing
some folks do today. The remaining assets that we've got in place are very strategic to the integrated model that we
have between the Upstream, Downstream and our Chemical business.
The MLPs are generally used as a financing mechanism to raise cash and fund business growth. As you know, with our
financial flexibility, we have very low cost of capital. While I'll never say no, I will tell you that just the cost-benefit
trade-offs for MLPs are unattractive for us given our low cost of capital.
<Q - Jason D. Gammel>: Very helpful. Thanks, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Thank you, Jason.

Our next question comes from Roger Read, Wells Fargo.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Roger.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Just maybe to go along with that capital allocation and other questions that have come on here,
so CapEx plus or minus $37 billion – or maybe I should say minus $37 billion here going forward – you just made the
comment a lot of the non-strategic assets have been pared. If we do find ourselves in a, let's say, $80 to $85 oil
environment, between the share repurchase program at around $3 billion a quarter, the CapEx at $37 billion, and maybe
not as many assets left to sell, at least from a non-strategic or non-core standpoint, how do you balance all of that?
What gives? Is it CapEx that gets pulled back, is it the share repurchase, is it something else? I'm just sort of curious
there.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yes, Roger. Generally speaking, operating cash flows remain our primary source of
funding for both our capital requirements as well as our shareholder distributions. We will access the financial markets
when and if needed to fund other commitments, and I don't want you to walk away from this thinking that there won't
be any other divestment opportunities, because it is a continual process. Think of it as an ongoing upgrade of our
overall portfolio, whereby we continue organic exploration and identify higher-value assets. We continue to high grade
our Downstream and Chemical facilities. So it's an ongoing process that will likely continue to yield, periodically,
divestment opportunities.
<Q - Roger D. Read>: Okay. Thanks. And then taking another look at your Lower-48 unconventional opportunities
and ranking those in terms of returns or growth plus returns to some of your other opportunities, how do they scale up?

Or maybe if you just said what is your best return opportunity today and where do they fit in relative to that?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: I would tell you, Roger, that they all are very strong. There's a lot of variability even
within a given resource area depending on where you are in the trend and I would tell you that Exxon Mobil has prime
acreage in all three of the areas that I talked about as well as some others. So we are very well positioned and as you
saw with the Permian Basin, we continue to look for opportunities to high-grade the overall portfolio in those basins.
So, very strong inventory that we continue to high-grade and look for opportunities for progressing the investment
opportunities in each one of those fields. So we would not expect any change in our operational plans.
Thank you, Roger.
Operator
Thank you. Moving on will hear from Allen Good, Morningstar Investment Research.
<Q - Allen Good>: Good morning. Just another follow-up question on the Lower-48 unconventional. As you
mentioned, you've been pretty active in Permian acquisitions. Just wondering what's Exxon's thought as far as what's
the right-sized Permian position that you eventually want to get to get that to scale? And is there a preference for
Permian acquisitions relative to Woodford and Bakken or has it just been a case of value.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Allen, it's always a case of value for us. I wouldn't say that we are excluding any
opportunity in the U.S. or internationally. Now, we have found a number of opportunities to high- grade the portfolio in
the Permian recently but we continue to keep very well alert to other opportunities that may come up and maybe even
with the current decrease in prices, we may have additional opportunities that we'll find that are complementary to our
business and can increase our overall underlying value. And I would take that – I would extend that beyond the U.S. As
you know, we've leveraged expertise within the U.S. unconventionals to position ourselves strategically for other
unconventional opportunities globally.
<Q - Allen Good>: Great, thanks. And just one on the Downstream: Exxon obviously has a very large Downstream
global footprint. Can you give us any color on what you're seeing as far as the demand side given the slide we've seen
in oil prices? I know a lot of concern out there is understandably on the supply side but weak demand and I was just
wondering if you've seen any changes in the demand patterns of late given the lower prices?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah, well, as I said in the presentation, we did see some margin improvement, but
generally, demand has been fairly strong within the U.S., particularly in our Chemicals business but in Europe,
Asia-Pacific, demand has been down. That's really a function of building capacity faster than demand as well as
economic weakness but you've got to step back and from a chemicals perspective for instance, we're expecting demand
to grow at 1.5% above GDP, and we're a long-term business where we invest for the long-term and it's all fundamental
to our energy outlook and our demand projections.

to the Hong Kong Power and your expiration expense is lower so that may be adding another $100 million, $150
million in earnings, so that's about a $300 million to $400 million of other benefits. Can you help us in terms of what
that benefit may be, the nature?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah, so you're looking at Paul, the sequential earnings reconciliation?
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: That's correct.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: As I said in the presentation, that was down about $1.1 billion, and I would, at a high
level, say that it's – asset management is down about $1.3 million, it's the net effect of the absence of Hong Kong
Power as well as other acquisition activities that occur during that period as well as I think you appropriately pointed
out that other operational items were positive by about $160 million due to lower OpEx primarily in exploration as well
as some minor ForEx benefits.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: So you're saying that the asset sales swing is $1.3 billion, so that means that we have about
$300 million or so in asset sales gain in this quarter?

We'll now hear from Iain Reid, BMO.
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: Hi, Jeff.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Iain. How are you?
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: Yeah, very good. Can I ask a quick question about Papua New Guinea? Now you've got the first
part of the project, or at least phase one fully on stream. What is your thinking about adding the third train, utilizing the
additional gas that the joint venture has discovered in the region? And also potentially processing third-party gas or
building another train to process third-party gas. Could you just kind of outline Exxon's thinking about that?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Sure. Sure, Iain. Thanks for bringing up Papua New Guinea because it's another very
successful accomplishment for the organization. I would tell you that everything is on the table in terms of what we do
there.
Obviously, first and foremost is – in terms of our priorities is to make sure that we are very comfortable with the
operating structure. As I said, it started up early, we got up to peak production. It is operating very, very well. The
project team and operations organization has done a remarkable job there.
You're aware that there is some – we maintain an active exploration program in Papua New Guinea. We have picked up
some additional resource. There are some other exploration opportunities that we're considering, and I would tell you
that the next step would be to consider, and has been under review, the economic viability for incremental trains there
at the LNG plant. It was designed in order to easily tie in additional trains.
So we are very well positioned and as you can appreciate, the incremental cost to expand the PNG facility is going to
be much, much more competitive than another greenfield site. So in summary, I'd say that we're very pleased with the
resource, the overall potential and performance of Papua New Guinea. We've got some additional resource out there
with the successful P'nyang discovery, and we're looking for opportunities to add to it and that can come either through
additional resource development or, as you indicated, processing third-party gas.
<Q - Iain S. Reid>: Okay. Thanks. And one further thing, on the Russian sanctions, how is that affecting your Sakhalin
developments? And also the LNG project that which you're progressing with Rosneft?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Very good. I failed to mention that when we were talking about Russia earlier and just to
clarify for everyone, that the sanctions do not apply to Sakhalin-1, or our Far East LNG facility. And so the current

<Q - Jason Smith>: Hi, Jeff. It's actually Jason Smith on for Doug. How are you?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Good morning, Jason.
<Q - Jason Smith>: So most of my questions have been answered, I just had one quick one. To look at lower oil prices
from a different perspective, one of the key issues I think in your production trajectory last year has been the loss of
PSC volume as the result of rising oil prices. Can you provide some sensitivity or an update on how much production
you get back if oil stays around $85?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Well, Jason, I don't have the specific numbers at the price that you stated but I will tell
you that sequentially, in our sequential earnings that there were some positive effects associated with PSC volumes. It
was under 10,000 barrels a day second quarter to third quarter.
<Q - Jason Smith>: Got it. Okay. Thanks. That's all for me.
Operator
We'll now hear from Ryan Todd, Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: Great. Thanks. Good morning, gentlemen. I guess – a question, you've already touched on CapEx
and CapEx outlook a few times during the call, but if we take a step back and look – a number of your European peers
there's been kind of a clear trend, and maybe for a variety of reasons, a clear message and strong effort towards capital
constraint, deferral of certain projects and trying to kind of inflate free cash flow going forward from that point of view.
It's been a bit more muted here in the U.S. Can you think about maybe how if there's been a shift in your approach to
project economics and relative returns and profitability as you look at your go forward portfolio and the potential to
constrain more CapEx and whether lower oil prices impacts that whatsoever?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yes. We always are mindful of what's happening in the near future, but I keep on falling
back that we are a long-term investor. Our plans are set well in advance. As I said earlier, our investment portfolio is
tested across the full range of economic parameters, including price, so that we have the comfort that we are going to
end up generating a favorable return, regardless of the type of price fluctuations that we would test on. And so we
always do stress tests, we feel like the program is robust. That is one of the real strengths of Exxon Mobil with our
integrated business model is that we invest through these business cycles and we've got the financial flexibility in order
to fund those projects if we need some additional capital.
<Q - Ryan Todd>: Okay. Thanks. And maybe one more, specifically in Tanzania, you guys have discovered an awful
lot of gas to date. Can you give us any thoughts in terms of the timing, in terms of your expectations on go-forward
plans there?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yes. So on Tanzania, very good progress between Statoil and Exxon Mobil. As I said,
seven gas discoveries, now over 21 Tcf in place. There is a consortium that has come together that have evaluated
potential sites for a common onshore LNG facility, and we have made a recommendation to the government of
Tanzania regarding the planned site location. Studies are progressing to determine the optimal development plan for
Tanzania Block 2 resource as an LNG development. It really is at very early stages, and it's really too early to
determine a specific startup date or an overall design capacity or even the capital investment. But fundamental for us to
move forward is a competitive, predictable and durable fiscal environment to ensure that an investment of this scale
and complexity is going to generate an acceptable return for our shareholders.

And our next question will come from Paul Sankey, Wolfe Research.
<Q - Paul I. Sankey>: Hi. Good morning, Mr. Woodbury. Welcome from me, too. On this CapEx question that we
keep going back to, it's an interesting number that you gave us. You talked, again to be clear, about a peak of CapEx in
2013, and then you said next year around $37 billion, in line with this year. Could you talk a little bit about the
components of that? Because we have some interesting variation in your spending, for example, even in the latest
quarter where we're seeing lower Upstream spending, somewhat higher Downstream and Chemicals. And beyond that,
beyond the $37 billion next year, would we go down – would we potentially have even lower CapEx in the longer-term
future, given that you've highlighted the extent to which you reached a peak in 2013 as a function of recapitalizing the
Upstream?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Thanks, Paul. So as I said, we grew up to $42.5 billion in 2013, and again, I want to
make the point that that was a deliberate decision, given the resource opportunities that we had before us and the
maturity of those, and the confidence that we had that we would generate very favorable returns for our shareholders.
Likewise, it's a conscious decision to bring our Upstream spending down to a normal spend pattern, and as we
communicated early this year in our Analyst Meeting, we're projecting that to fall down to just south of $37 billion over
the 2015 to 2017 period. And yes, there is this larger increase in the Downstream and Chemical business, and that is
focused on, like I talked about Antwerp, focused on making strategic investments that are going to better advantage our
Downstream facilities relative to industry such as the North America ethane cracker at Baytown.
<Q - Paul I. Sankey>: I wanted to pick you up on the more normal, you describing it, level of CapEx? What you mean
by that? Had you define that normal level?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: If you look at the overall portfolio and the maturity of the resources going forward, Paul,
it's based on our judgment as to when those resources are going to be ready, whether they be the definition of the
resource, the definition of the development concept, the regulatory or fiscal regime. It's a matter of when we believe
they are ready to move forward and we have an optimal development plan in place. That's really what I mean by
normal. It's looking at our portfolio as opposed to several years back when we saw these really large projects that came
to fruition together that provided a huge opportunity for the corporation that we capitalized on.
<Q - Paul I. Sankey>: Yes, I'm with you. And just going back to the PSC question, obviously if prices were to stay
here you spoke about Q2 to Q3, obviously it was a relatively minor oil price shift, but at the moment you're guiding to
4.1 million barrels a day next year. I assume that you're continuing with the guidance laid out at the Analyst Meeting.
But the obvious expectation would be that that number would come in higher as a result of lower oil prices even though
I know there's a different whole other issue around economics, but broadly speaking that would be what we should
work towards, right?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: I think, Paul, I'd suggest that our guidance is no different from March, at the Analyst
Meeting. Again, we look at a range over a period of time. The market is going to drive what the prices do and we make
our best judgment as to where we're going to fit in that in order to give you that guidance. So if you think about what
we said back in the Analyst Meeting, we said that we would grow from about 4 million barrels a day up to about 4.3
million barrels a day – million oil equivalent barrels a day by 2017 and in doing so, we were adding about 1 million oil
equivalent barrels a day of capacity.
And I'll remind you that a large part of that, 95% plus of that, was liquids and liquids-linked gas production. So it will
change our production mix from about 64% liquids and liquids-linked today, to just south of 70% in 2017. So in
summary, I'd say our guidance on volumes is still consistent with what we shared with you in March.
Thank you, Paul.

way they moved year-on-year. I just wanted to get a wee bit of an explanation for why that was.

that area but we really don't break it down beyond the country itself. And you can see that in our financial and
operating, the additional data in the Investor Relations information.
With respect to Qatar, this is really associated with entitlement impacts associated with the Al Khaleej gas project.
<Q - Alastair R. Syme>: Is it going to ratchet down or is it temporal?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: No, it's associated with prices.
<Q - Alastair R. Syme>: Okay, great. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from John Herrlin, Societe Generale.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Thank you. Most everything's been asked, Jeff, but regarding the shale economic thresholds in
North America, with the Bakken it sounded like you have a different kind of completion. It's not plug and perf, it's
somewhat different. Can you elaborate a little bit more, and also with that completion, are you also doing a similar
thing in Argentina?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah, good question, John. I would tell you that, as I said in my comments, the XTO
expertise that we've built up in the unconventionals is being leveraged globally, and we are continuing to grow our
capability there. As I shared in my prepared comments, the improvements that we've seen, not only in reducing overall
costs but improving the productivity of, if you will, the manufacturing process of drilling these wells, but a key element
of that has been the application of technology.
And as I said in my prepared comments, one of the benefits that we've used in Bakken has been this completion
technology which is proprietary Exxon Mobil technology called XFrac and it allows us to avoid putting a whole bunch
of plugs in the well and makes it a much more efficient and safer operation for completion installation.
And to close out on your question about Argentina, I'd broaden it and say that all of these learnings in the
unconventional are being positioned to apply elsewhere within our portfolio. And once again, it's just another really
good example of our industry-leading performance and our capability, and that positions us very well to compete for
resources.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Thanks, John.

<Q - Guy A. Baber>: Thanks very much for squeezing me in here. Two quick ones for me; first on just a big-picture
question around exploration. Generally speaking can you just remind me what percentage of the total capital budget
this year is allocated to exploration appraisal activity? And then optimally, where would you like to see that percentage
longer-term just to sustain the long-term opportunity set, reserve maturation? But also how comfortable you may be in
flexing that down at any point in the cycle for a given year? So that's number one, just thoughts on the exploration
budget.
And then secondly, if you could quickly talk about the balance sheet. You mentioned you'd access financial markets if
need be and your net debt to total cap obviously low compared to most peers. But actually high relative to where it's
been at the last ten-year period. So could you just remind us of your target leverage ratio and framework also and just
where you're comfortable in taking the leverage?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yeah, Guy, let me first start with the second half of your first question about whether we
would flex down our exploration. I would tell you that we are opportunity driven. We've got tremendous opportunities
around the world, we've got very robust inventory. It's a – we're very well-positioned to compete. As I said earlier, it's
all around how do you go ahead and upgrade the value of the overall resource base. So from an exploration perspective,
given our financial flexibility, given the opportunities, we have really got to be focused on the horizon around
high-grading our portfolio and positioning ourselves strategically around the globe.
So specific to our budget, we don't break that type of information out in terms of the various components within the
exploration budget, but I'd like you think about our exploration activity as a means to further high-grade our overall
portfolio.
On the second point, on our leverage ratio, there is no target. We've been fairly consistent over the last couple of years.
We've maintained a AAA credit rating. I want you all to think about that our focus is around value. It's not always – or
not a focus around market share or volume, it's around value. How can we create greater value and we'll use that
balance sheet to achieve that objective when we think it's appropriate.
Operator
Our next question comes from Pavel Molchanov, Raymond James.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: Hey. Thanks very much. Just one more for me on Russia, if I may. You touched on the
policy sanctions-related uncertainty in relation to the Arctic. Are there any other operations within Russia that have had
to be postponed, deferred or reduced because of the sanctions rules?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Yes. So you may recall that we have a number of joint ventures throughout Russia. We
talked about the Kara Sea. We also have a venture in the Black Sea in West Siberia, and then lastly, a number of
ventures within the Russian Arctic Shelf. And if you think about the sanctions, they deal with specifically deepwater,
unconventional resources and Arctic activity. So yes, the joint ventures I just summarized for you are included within
the scope of the sanctions.
<Q - Pavel S. Molchanov>: So have all the activities in those JVs have been suspended as a result?
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Well, we have – we are fully complying with the sanctions and regulatory requirements.
Operator
And we do have one follow-up question from Paul Cheng, Barclays.
<Q - Paul Y. Cheng>: Hey, Jeff. Two quick ones. First on – related to your investment in Europe refining, do you
have any plan to do a similar investment in your U.S. refining system?

Second question, in the – I think in your comment you're saying that you have some overlift in the quarter. Can you
quantify how big is that or how much is the impact in the quarter? And also at the end of the third quarter, from the
inventory standpoint, are you guys neutral or underlift or overlift? Thank you.
<A - Jeffrey J. Woodbury>: Thank you, Paul. On your first question around additional investments, I would just say
broadly that we regularly evaluate our global portfolio where we have opportunities for investment, as I've already
discussed, with the areas targeting on things like expanding our feedstock flexibility or our logistics or reducing our
cost structure. We have a lot of conversion capacity in the U.S. already, but as a – generally speaking Paul, as a matter
of practice, we just don't want to comment or speculate on any particular opportunities or investments that we may or
may not be considering. When they're ready and we've made a decision, we'll go ahead and share that more broadly.
The second question was around overlift, and if I can, I'll refer back to our quarter-on-quarter Upstream earnings
reconciliation. And if you remember, there was a volume mix component about positive $340 million. And first and
foremost, there was a fairly sizable component associated with the project, high-margin project and program activity of
over $500 million, and as I said during my prepared comments, it really highlights the progress that we're making on
our unit profitability and the higher value volumes, not for the sake of growing volumes, but for the sake of capturing
value. There was an overlift component that was positive, and then there was an offsetting decrease in a number of
areas such as entitlements, decline, downtime and some asset management.
