William H. Swanson
Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Raytheon continued to perform well on the fourth quarter, as we did all
year. I'm particularly pleased with our performance, given we operated under a government shutdown in October,
sequestration and continuing resolutions at the start and end of the year.
In the quarter, we delivered strong margins, earnings and cash flow, driven by solid execution. Bookings were good in
the fourth quarter at $7.5 billion, which resulted in a book-to-bill of 1.28. For the year, our margins, EPS and cash flow
were all up, while sales were down slightly. Said another way, we had good performance in a challenging environment.
Looking-forward, we're expecting solid performance in 2014 and Dave will walk you through our guidance in a
moment.
As expected, our international business continues to be a significant driver of our results. In the quarter, international
sales were 29% of the total sales and 43% of total bookings. Notably, we booked several key international awards in
the quarter. A ground-based air defense system for Oman for $1.28 billion, $500 million for tactical radar systems for
international customers and $100 for international classified cyber.
For the full year, international sales represented 27% of total sales and grew by 3%. Our international bookings
increased by 10%, a result of our strategic focus on global markets. In November, I visited several of our customers in
the Mid East and we continue to make considerable progress in some of the larger opportunities in the region. For
example, Kuwait signed an LOA for Patriot in December, the U.S. Army now has it and we expect to have a completed
agreement by the end of February.
We also made significant progress on Qatar Patriot, which is the first step in a multi-year, multi-billion dollar
opportunity for the company. Qatar has the LOA and we're expecting their leadership to sign an agreement for Patriot
portion any day now. Then it will go to the Army for final approval and we expect an award exceeding $2 billion in the
first half of the year. We feel good about the bookings outlook in 2014 and expect total bookings of $23.5 billion, plus
or minus $500 million. International bookings are expected to be in the 35% to 49% of total bookings. We expect
international sales to be around 30% of total sales.
Domestically, we continued to see strong interest in our portfolio of advanced technologies and we received several
notable awards in the quarter, including TPY-2 radar 12 and two competitive wins, the Global ASNT Communication
system and the Air and Missile Defense Radar, or AMDR for short.
We weren't immune to the effects of the Budget Control Act in 2013, but the good news is that in December a budget
deal was reached, which provides a stable budget for two years, giving the DoD and industry some much needed
clarity. Hopefully, there'll be no more continuing resolutions and shutdowns.
After the close of the quarter, we received some more good news. Protests on two of our competitive wins, the Next
Generation Jammer and AMDR, were favorably resolved. And as I noted on previous calls, these are important
development programs that will provide long-term growth opportunities for the company and also reflect our strong
position in future markets, both domestically and internationally.
Looking back at 2013, I'm really proud of what the Raytheon team was able to accomplish. We continue to meet our
customers' needs in a challenging environment. We successfully consolidated Raytheon's businesses from six to four
and in record time and we continued to reduce our cost.
I'm also proud that Raytheon was the only A&D company recognized in The Civic 50 for the second consecutive year,
as one of America's most community-minded companies. The Civic 50 identifies and recognizes companies for their
commitment to improve the quality of life in the communities where they do business.

So in summary, as I look across the company, our performance continues to be solid, our strategy continues to create
value, our culture is stronger than ever and the company is well positioned and prepared for the future.
I also want to take the time to thank the Raytheon team for its focus and dedication throughout the year. I would also
like to thank our supply chain partners for their support. As you all know, I announced my intention to step down as
Raytheon's CEO and the board appointed Tom Kennedy to be CEO and Tom is on the call with us today. We started
the transition and we're both excited for the company's future.
Most of you know Tom and the excellent job he's done as COO, leading our business consolidation that enhances
productivity, agility and affordability. His experience as a proven leader with a broad understanding of key
technologies, a keen customer focus and a deep knowledge of our business, makes him the ideal CEO to take the
company forward. I look forward to continuing to serve as Chairman of the Board and working with Tom to ensure a
smooth transition.
With that, let me turn it over to Dave.
David C. Wajsgras
Okay. Thanks, Bill. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the fourth quarter and full year results, then I'll discuss
our outlook for 2014 and after that, we'll open up the call to questions.
During my remarks, I'll be referring to the Web slide that we issued earlier this morning, which are posted on our
website. If everyone could please move to Page 3. We delivered solid results in both the quarter and the full year.
Fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $1.58. For the full year, adjusted EPS of $6.38 was up 1.6%.
Our sales for the quarter were $5.9 billion and $23.7 billion for the year, consistent with the guidance range we
presented in October. We also generated strong operating cash flow of $1.1 billion for the quarter and $2.4 billion for
the year. Our focus on cash cycle productivity continues to drive results. I'd like to point out that we made a
discretionary contribution of $300 million in the fourth quarter of 2013. Even with this pension contribution, we still
achieved the high end of our prior cash flow guidance.
Additionally, during the quarter, the company repurchased 4.7 million shares of common stock for $400 million,
bringing the full year 2013 repurchases to 15.2 million shares for about $1.1 billion. The company ended the year with
a strong balance sheet and net debt of $437 million.
As we previously disclosed in the fourth quarter of 2013, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an
additional $2 billion of the company's outstanding common stock.
Turning now to Page 4, let me go through some of the details of our fourth quarter and full year results. We had solid
bookings of $7.5 billion in the quarter and $22.1 billion for the full year, resulting in a year-end backlog of $33.7
billion. Our book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.28 and the company ended 2013 with a funded backlog of about $23
billion.
For the quarter, international orders represented 43% of our total company bookings and for the full year was 30% of
total bookings. At the end of 2013, approximately 37% of our total backlog was international. In the fourth quarter,
significant international awards included $1.3 billion at IDS on a ground-based air defense system and $566 million at
SAS on tactical airborne system upgrades for international customers.
Other significant bookings included $393 million at IDS for AMDR; $173 million for a TPY-2 radar for the Missile
Defense Agency; and $585 million at IIS on a number of classified programs, including $100 million for international
cyber. Missile systems booked $189 million for the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile and $177 million for the Phalanx
Weapon Systems for the U.S. Navy and international customers. Missiles also booked $172 million for Paveway for the
U.S. Air Force and international customers.

Page 4 of 15
If you'd move to Page 5, we had fourth quarter sales of $5.9 billion, down 9%. As I mentioned earlier, sales were
consistent with our expectations. It's worth noting that fourth quarter sales reflect the impact from the timing of
international awards, some of which were received late in the quarter.
Looking at the businesses, net sales at IDS were $1.6 billion in the quarter. Compared to last year's fourth quarter, the
change was primarily due to an international Patriot program nearing completion and lower volume on a Tactical Radar
program.
IIS net sales of $1.5 billion in the quarter were down from the same period last year, primarily due to lower volume on
training and some of our classified programs. Missile systems had fourth quarter 2013 net sales of $1.6 billion, down
compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. The change was primarily due to lower sales on U.S. Army sensor programs.
And SAS had net sales of $1.6 billion in Q4, lower than the comparable period last year, primarily due to reduced
volume on some of our ISR and classified programs.
For the year, sales were $23.7 billion, down 2.9%. A decline in domestic sales was partially offset by a little more than
3% growth in our international sales.
Moving ahead to Page 6, we delivered solid operational performance in the quarter and for the full year. Looking at
business margins in the quarter, all were essentially in line, or better, than last year. And at IDS, IIS and SAS, margins
all exceeded the range that we had provided back in October.
Missile Systems' fourth quarter margin did come in below our expectations, driven by mix, a small loss on the disposal
of a non-core manufacturing facility, as well as an investment in the development of a new wafer-level packaging
technology. Overall, our adjusted margins were up 30 basis points in the quarter.
As I stand back and look at full year 2013, we again delivered strong margins. Our adjusted margin increased 10 basis
points, driven by solid execution, favorable mix and meaningful contribution from our ongoing productivity efforts,
including the business consolidation and the successful implementation of Global Business Services.
On Page 7, you'll see both the fourth quarter and full year adjusted EPS. In the fourth quarter 2013, our adjusted EPS
was $1.58 and for the full year was $6.38 compared with $6.28 in 2012, an increase of 1.6%. The increase for the full
year was driven by capital deployment actions, specifically share repurchases and by strong execution, partially offset
by lower volume. As I previously mentioned, the company generated strong operating cash flow of $2.4 billion in
2013.
So moving ahead to our 2014 guidance, which you'll find on Page 8. We see sales in the range of between $22.5 billion
and $23 billion, down 3% to 5% from 2013, driven by our domestic business, which is partially offset by the growth in
our international business.
As for pension, we see the FAS/CAS adjustment at a positive $346 million, which reflects our investment returns in
2013 of over 15% on our U.S. pension assets and the December 31 discount rate of 5.1%. We expect net interest
expense to be between $200 million and $210 million. We see our average diluted shares outstanding to be between
312 million and 314 million on a full year basis, a 3% year-over-year reduction at the midpoint of the range.
As for our effective tax rate, we expect it to be approximately 28.5%. Our 2014 effective tax rate guidance is lower
than 2013, due to an international cash management initiative which was executed in January, bringing cash back to the
United States. This action impacted the full year tax rate by just under 3 percentage points and is worth approximately
$0.26 per share.
I should also point out that we haven't included the possible extension of the R&D tax credit in 2014 guidance. If the
legislation passes, it would favorably impact the effective tax rate by about 100 basis points and our EPS by about
$0.10.
In 2014, we see our adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.76 to $5.91. In addition to the FAS/CAS adjustment, this also
excludes the $0.26 impact that I just mentioned. We see 2014 EPS to be in the range of $6.74 to $6.89. Our operating
cash flow guidance is between $2.3 billion and $2.5 billion.

Moving ahead to Page 9. Here, we've provided our initial 2014 guidance by business. We expect 2014 adjusted margins
to continue to be solid and in the 12.6% to 12.8% range. This includes 20 basis points of expected cost to support
productivity and efficiency initiatives, including real estate utilization improvements through facility consolidations, as
well as investments to support the continuing evolution of our advanced technologies to maintain our competitive edge,
which has been a focus area in the past and will continue to be so in the future.
Further, our margins for 2014 will be impacted by a change in program mix, both from an international and domestic
perspective. We're continuing to focus on reducing our cost structure. In 2013, we consolidated several facilities,
reducing our square footage by about 3% or approximately 1 million square feet. Looking forward, we're targeting a
square footage reduction of approximately 10% over the next three years to four years, which should yield considerable
efficiencies and further support our customers' affordability objectives.
If you'd now turn to Page 10. We've provided you with our 2014 outlook by quarter. You'll notice that sales ramp-up
throughout the year. In the first half of 2014, sales are expected to be down in the mid-to-high single-digits on a tough
comp. You may recall that in the first half of last year, we received some quick turn book-and-bill business. The back
half sales for 2014 are expected to be in line, to slightly up, when you're comparing to the same period in 2013. And if
you compare second half sales to first half sales, we expect to see mid single-digit growth. The improvement in the
back half is driven by the timing of international awards, which we received in late 2013 and expect in the first half of
2014. It's worth noting, that the sales cadence in 2014 is consistent with what the company saw in 2011 and 2012.
Finally on Page 11, as we've done in the past, we've provided a summary of the financial impact from pensions in 2013,
as well as the projected impact for 2014 through 2016, holding all assumptions constant.
Let me conclude by saying that in 2013, Raytheon delivered solid operating performance. By focusing on program
execution and structural cost improvements, our margins, earnings and operating cash flow were all ahead of
expectations. Our international business continues to grow. We have a strong balance sheet and net debt of less than
$450 million. This gives us real flexibility and options to continue to drive shareholder value. We continue to find new
ways to apply our world-class technologies to deliver meaningful and differentiated value to our customers, improve
efficiency and drive productivity.
Before concluding, I'd like to offer my personal thanks to Bill. Your leadership has transformed this company and you
are handing off a strong, well-managed organization. I know I speak for the rest of the employees by saying thank you
for your leadership, vision and all the contributions you've made over your 42 years of service, to help make this
company a success for our customers, our employees and our shareholders. I look forward to continuing to work with
you in your role as Chairman.
I would also like to personally congratulate Tom. I've had the pleasure of working closely with Tom over the past eight
years and especially since he became COO this past spring. With his 30 years of experience, Tom knows this company
from top to bottom and has demonstrated strong leadership throughout his career. So Tom, I and the rest of the team,
are looking forward to working with you and building on our strong foundation under your leadership.
So with that, we'll open the call up to questions.
Q&A

<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Bill, we're not going to ask about succession today.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Well, you can go ahead and ask.
<A - William H. Swanson>: I could probably give you a definitive answer now.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: I'm sure. Well, congratulations. Can I just ask a question? If I just take some of the numbers
you gave us for the domestic and international, it would seem to imply that domestic is probably down 8% this year and
international gets 6% growth. And given that first half, second half dynamic you just talked about, should that growth
continue into next year? Is the midpoint of this year where you feel like we start to hit bottom in a cycle?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: So Sam, why don't I start with that and maybe Bill or Tom want to add a little bit of color.
So we expect domestic, on a full year basis, to be down in the mid single-digit range and we see our international
business, again for the year, growing in the low-to-mid single-digit range. And to use the phrase that Bill had used in
the past, 2014 does look a lot like 2013 from a sales profile standpoint.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah. And I would add that, I think we've always said that we looked at 2014 and part of
2015 being a transition year. And if you look at 2016 and look at the numbers, it ticks up even under sequestration. So
for us, this feels like what we've been talking about. And the international awards that I highlighted and some of the
ones that were expecting to come in, really are a nice transition for us as we go through this change in budget, if that
helps.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Thanks. And Dave, if I can just follow-up, is there a cash effect from this tax benefit in the
first quarter? Because just looking at the quarterly run rate, it did look like it was heavy in the EPS, which I guess is the
tax benefit. But is there a cash effect as well?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yeah. There is. It's about $75 million or $80 million.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Thanks. Good morning. Bill, you've come a long way...
<A - William H. Swanson>: Morning.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Since the MCS problem programs, it's a much more pleasant call these days.
<A - William H. Swanson>: That was about 10 years ago and I remember it vividly.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Yeah. Me too.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yep. Yep.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Can you highlight how much of that second half growth is dependent on signing the
international contracts in this first half of the year? Obviously, they have a tendency of slipping a little bit, so I just
want to make sure we're not counting on too much?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yeah. So we feel confident in how we have guided for the year, both first half and the
second half. You'll recall that a number of these larger programs we started talking about mid last year, Bill just put a
lot of color around where the more significant ones stand. So from our perspective, I would say that it wouldn't be a
stretch to say that we're highly confident with our second half performance relative to what I just said in my formal
remarks.

<A - William H. Swanson>: And I would just add a little color. The Oman program is started from the point of having
a contract. Kuwait, I mentioned, everything's done in country. It's back on this side of the pond now for us to take care
of. And when you look at Qatar, clearly, that's been through all the processes and just waiting for the final signature
over there. So I think Dave said it well, we're confident of what the front-end looks like. And once a few more stages
are taking place, we might even spend some of our own money to get an early jump on this to make sure we get it
nailed correctly.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: You should also keep in mind that we factor these pretty heavily when we talk about the
bookings outlook for the year and that's certainly taken into account here. So if you look at what had actually taken
place in the fourth quarter, with a book-to-bill of just under 1.3, we also see strength in the first half of the year. I'll
repeat what I just said, on a full year basis, we have a lot of confidence in the guidance than certainly in the second
half.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Got it. Okay. And then, just one clean-up one was on SAS. Anything in particular, in terms
of timing in the quarter? And was it just a push out into 2014, in terms of the sales for the fourth quarter?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Okay. From a sales standpoint for SAS, we do see 2014 declining in the mid single-digits,
which is driven by lower funding levels on some of the various classified programs, as well as some of the airborne
radars and EW systems. You also know that and we've talked about this in the past, to a scheduled completion on some
of the international tactical airborne radars.
Now, with all of that said, we do see a ramp in the second half of SAS, similar to what I just said about the company as
a whole. We continue to have a lot of confidence in that business. It's probably worth mentioning as well, the margin
performance in Q4 for SAS was very strong. They were able to pull some productivity initiatives forward into the
fourth quarter that we had initially anticipated in the first half of 2014.
<A - William H. Swanson>: And I would add just a little bit, Dave, they can now start on Next Generation Jammer.
We were delayed for about six months there, because of the protests and RACR will be starting up, so that'll give them
a nice ramp-up here.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Okay. Thanks and good luck.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Okay.
Operator

<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Hello? Can you hear me?
<A - Todd Ernst>: Yeah.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Oh, great. Perfect. Yeah. Excellent. So congratulations, Bill and everybody.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Thank you.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: So at a high level, I guess there was a lot of concern with maybe some of the changing
political perceptions in the Middle East, that you guys in particular would see some pressure on international sales in
the region. So I guess my question is, if we back up, have you seen a changing dynamic in the competitive landscape in
international markets, maybe particularly in the Middle East, but just more broadly speaking, as everybody's been
trying to dive into international markets and it's been a focus for – your competitors are putting together international
units and that sort of thing, so...
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah. What I would do is remind everybody back to about eight years or nine years ago, I
guess we were talking about international. It's not something you can flip a switch and turn on the light and have it
instantaneously happen. So I appreciate people starting organizations and putting things in place, but it takes a while to
establish your credibility internationally and our customers really count on the fact that we've been in the Mid East 50
years, Japan 50 years, Taiwan 50 years, Korea. These are things we've done for a long time and your performance over
that period really helps you capture new business and to me, it's all about relationships and trust and that does not
happen overnight.
To your question in the Mid East, clearly, the region needs the kind of products and services that we as a company have
in our portfolio. And I was over there in December and Tom was over there just recently. I think both of us would say
the same thing, that there hasn't been any kind of turn down whatsoever in what we're doing in the region. In fact, we
find the opposite is true, that they're counting on us to do more to help them, as they worry about their own national
security. So I know what's written in the papers, but to me, firsthand knowledge is really important and it's why we go
over there to interface with people that we've been doing work with for a long, long time.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Right. That's good, that's good to know.
<A - William H. Swanson>: If that helps.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Yeah, for sure. And as just a follow-on, when we think about where maybe some of the next
emerging opportunities are for Raytheon internationally, where would that be?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Well, for us the Mid East is still strong. We have two new customers in Oman and Qatar
that haven't been in our portfolio before. Those programs took a few years to get over the goal line and we intend to do
more with them and we can offer more to help provide for the security of their countries. So the Mid East is strong.
Asia is still strong, whether it's South Korea, Taiwan, or Japan, or that part of the region. Clearly, Australia and Europe
in my opinion, not now, but in the future, two years, three years from now, Europe is going to have to upgrade what
they have. They haven't spent money, they've made things do. And in my opinion, they're going to have to upgrade
what they have and we'll see that as an opportunity, because we've been there for a number of years.
But as a company, we sell in 80 countries around the world. And one of the things I'm proud of when I travel and I
know Tom feels the same way, is that we never have to talk about our performance; it's a given. So we start really with
more of what capabilities can we help you with as we go in there.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Great. Thank you.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Okay.

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Morning.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Morning, Joe.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Bill, it's been wonderful working with you and wish you all the best.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Thank you, Joe.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: My key question here is, is Tom a Red Sox fan?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Well, I'll let him answer that. Tom?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Not only am I a Red Sox fan, but I'm also a very strong Patriots fan also.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Wonderful to hear. So we'll keep the tradition alive.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Oh, yeah. It's in one of the envelopes in the desk that he opens up of what to do on a call.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay. Well, onto the business. I thought I heard you guys imply earlier that you're looking at
2014 and 2015 both as transition years, or I interpreted that as down years for domestic, with then potentially growth
re-emerging in 2016? Is that a fair characterization of the way you're looking at this?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, Joe. I would say it is. When you look at the budget process, even with
sequestration and the Budget Control Act, 2016 was always the year that there was an uptick where it started to come
back again. And even when you look at it, 2017 and on, the budgets start to increase. The other thing is, that if the
economy gets going, that'll take part of the pressure off too, but we've always viewed that as the transition. You got it
right.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay. And then, just on the international front. I heard what you said so far and we can do the
math on the two deals that you're waiting for here near-term. But when you look at the $8.8 billion that you're
expecting this year in bookings, roughly internationally, what are the other key deals that we can hone in on as we look
in, particularly into the second half of the year?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah. We feel good about it with that. Let me turn it over to Tom. He just came back
from a trip, so he can add some color.
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: Yeah, I just back from the Middle East. I did have the opportunity to do the ceremony
signing for the Oman deal. And as Bill mentioned before, Oman is a new country for us and we see additional
opportunities in Oman over the next five years. Also, the big one Bill mentioned was Qatar, it turns out there will also
be a second award towards the end of the year from Qatar, this is for a air defense operating center.
We also, Bill did mention the Patriot Kuwait fire units, that is very close to being awarded by the U.S. Army. We're
expecting that toward the end of February, beginning of March. There's other Patriot activities between $1 billion to $2
billion coming up on more towards the backend of the year. We also have a big opportunity relative to TOW
international and this is for this year, it's about between $600 million and $700 million.
And overall, there's another overall missiles about $1.2 billion throughout the year and then, the other major activities
coming out of SAS. The tactical airborne radars and electronic warfare, approximately $600 million. And then, we
have, as you know, a significant training in O&M activities internationally and that's about $700 million. And then,
there's a miscellaneous of about another $1.5 billion and that's across our special mission aircraft, battlefield radars, air
traffic control, ground sensor systems and also airborne ISR and that kind of wraps it up.

<A - William H. Swanson>: Doug, are you there? On mute? Okay. We'll go to the next one, please?
Operator
It comes from the line of Robert Stallard of Royal.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Good morning. Can you hear me?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yep. We can hear you.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Someone's working right. Well, where should we start? Bill, maybe for the last time, I was
wondering if you can give us maybe your thoughts on maybe the general defense industry? Now that we have some
stability in the U.S. defense budget for the next couple of years, do you think we'll see some pickup in M&A? And
would you, Raytheon, be interested in getting involved?
<A - William H. Swanson>: I think, right now, the mid and lower tiers are facing some pressure. I think some
companies are having to decide what they're going to do, if they can continue on the path they're on, which if they
decide to do something different, will it involve M&A and I think some are going to have to do it. I think from our
standpoint, Dave said it best, we've got a balance sheet that's, I like to say, is pristine with a lot of fire power. So if
there's opportunities for us to add to our portfolio that make sense, not just to buy something for revenue sake, that
never works.
But where it fits in, especially in where we see future growth, then that would be the case. But I don't expect the
company to be doing anything totally different from what we've done in the past. One of the things we tried to be,
somebody mentioned, back to the 10 programs, 10 years or 11 years ago. We've tried to be transparent in what we do
and I don't expect that to change at all.
Since you asked me to reflect, one thing that I would say that I am concerned about as we go through this budget
process, we seem to be protecting personnel and readiness, which is okay. Those can be bought back very quickly. And
I'm going to be working hard to make sure that on the R&D side, that we don't take a lot of cuts in the budget there,
because being an engineer, I know how long it takes for R&D to come to fruition.
And we're always a country that has invested in our capability, in war fighting capability. I know Raytheon, even in the
tough times when we had $13 billion in debt, we still invested and that's paying off in some of our wins, as we look
today. And we'll continue to invest as a company, but I think as a nation as we look at our investments, we got to make
sure that R&D is not sacrificed, because you can't buy back that time that you lose.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Thanks, Bill. Maybe just a quick one for Dave, of course on pension and your [indiscernible]
(39:28).
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Of course, Rob. I was waiting. Yeah.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Maybe quite a simple question, but you show the gross funding requirements for the next three
years. Would it make more sense to use some of this cash on the balance sheet available today, to try and bring those
future contributions down?

<A - David C. Wajsgras>: I'm sorry, Rob. I couldn't – you were breaking up a little bit. Can you just repeat the
question?
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Yeah. Sorry. I asked if it would more financial sense to use some of the cash on the balance
sheet today, rather than these gross funding requirements in the future?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: To use some of the cash on the balance sheet today to fund? Yeah. Yeah. We made a small
discretionary contribution in the fourth quarter. There's a number of considerations with the cash that we currently have
on the balance sheet. And as we go forward in 2014, I've already suggested that we'll once again have a very strong
cash flow performance here of upwards of $2.5 billion. It's something we continue to consider.
Historically, the discretionary contributions have been very good investments for the company, at any way that you
would want to analyze those investments. So it's certainly something we'd look at going forward. I want to be clear,
none of that is contemplated as we sit here today, but if we do decide to go in that direction, we will certainly make that
public in advance of what we're going to execute.
There's in different areas that we're thinking about investing in, Bill suggested that we are going to continue to look
hard at M&A opportunities that are value-add to the company, both in the near and long term. We'll continue to look at
the dividend and we've said this publicly before, we believe that increasing the dividend over time is a very important
economic signal to the investors, relative to how we see our cash flow performance.
The repurchase plan. Back in the fourth quarter, our Board of Directors approved a $2 billion authorization, which is
not time sensitive. In other words, we can use that over any period of time we would like. And I just suggested that the
diluted share count for 2014 will be down about 3%. So we continue to see that as a value creation opportunity for
investors. So we're cognizant of our cash position. We feel good about the flexibility and we have a lot of confidence
that we'll be able to effectively drive value for our shareholders over time.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Thanks, Dave. And congratulations Bill and Tom.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Thank you.

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel of Jefferies. Please go ahead.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Oh my goodness. I don't know what to say, Bill, you know. I don't know if Tom has...
<A - William H. Swanson>: Careful Howard, careful.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: I was thinking since you're a short timer maybe all my questions should go to Tom and Dave
anyhow.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Take your best shot, Howard.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: There's no water in this one, Bill. First, something that goes back a little while and I think
you've talked about resolving it, was the British border authority. Where do you stand with that? And how close do you
think you are to getting what you need back?
<A - William H. Swanson>: On e-Borders, we expect a decision in the first half of 2014. All the hearings were
concluded late last year and that's about the best color I can give right now, Howard, because I don't know any more
than that.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: All right. That's fine. You spent a lot of time and effort on Patriot upgrades and some other
things you've been doing. Tom, maybe for a moment, you could talk a little bit more of how you've enhanced the
system? And what does that leave in terms of – at some point, it has to go back and help the Army in a meaningful

way, I would think?
<A - Thomas A. Kennedy>: So I think the big upgrade on Patriot came out of the UAE program and was about over
$400 million in non-recurring. And non-recurring is the dollars we use for development. Those changes are now in the
Patriot system. They've been through complete testing with the U.S. Army and so right now, on all our new offerings in
the Middle East, we are providing this upgraded Patriot system and it's gaining a lot of traction.
The other area here is, there's 12 nations that have Patriot today and so all those nations are now looking at upgrading
their systems with all the capabilities that were added via the UAE contract that we had.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: And then, last Dave, if I look at the math on the share repurchase, it appears as if you're
going to scale it back a little bit relative to last year. Is that a pretty fair assumption?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: That's a fair assumption, Howard and I believe, I mentioned that on either the second
quarter or third quarter call last year. So it is scaled back somewhat, but it's still an important part of the overall capital
deployment plan.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: So it does sort of indicate that you're looking at finding other ways to – or just more balance
I guess might be a way of thinking about it going forward for growth?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: That's a fair comment. We are balancing out the way we're looking at the various levers
from a capital deployment standpoint. And we still believe that roughly a 3% reduction will be viewed favorably. We
still see Raytheon as a good investment, or we wouldn't be repurchasing our shares. But again, there are a number of
different areas to consider as we go forward in 2014.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you, gentlemen.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Thanks, Howard.

Thank you. The next question comes from the line of George Shapiro of Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Hi. Good morning. Congratulations again, Bill, of a job well done over the years. It's
always been fun.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Thank you, George. I'd like to say I'm really going to miss this, but you know what I'm
going to do is, I'm going to be listening in on the call. So it probably will be a lot more fun.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. My question is that, Dave, given that you missed the book-to-bill for the year, it
came in at 0.93 versus the near or 1 you were expecting. Was that the reason why the sales guidance for this year is
down 3% to 5%, versus what you said on the third quarter call that it would be relatively similar?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Okay. So you are right. As bookings have moved to the right, that clearly impacts sales in
the near term. I want to repeat something that I said earlier. 2014 is very similar to the way 2013 looked from a sales
standpoint, both domestically and internationally. Now, we did have some larger programs move into the first half of
2014. We continue to see a very healthy book-to-bill, particularly in the first half of 2014. So if you take that three
quarter period, the fourth quarter of 2013 and the first half of 2014, that bodes very well for the sales outlook for the
back half of 2014. From an overall standpoint, it impacted the sales guidance somewhat, but it's not overly meaningful,
is the best way for me to say it.
<A - William H. Swanson>: And I think I should have mentioned, that when I gave the $23.5 billion, plus or minus
$500 million guidance on bookings, we expect a book-to-bill between 1.0 and 1.05. So we're expecting a strong year.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. But when you said similar sales in the third quarter comment, I was just trying to
figure out exactly how much the lower bookings might have impacted the sales guidance for this year. Was it 1%?

<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yeah. It's not a lot, George. I'm not going to get overly specific on the arithmetic, but I
would say the bookends of what we just went out with, it hasn't changed as a result of some of these orders moving to
the right. It's less than a 1% impact.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. And then, just one...
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: That's why we go out with a range, George. That's why we have a range.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. And then, just one quick one. You did well in the margins, but the Space area, you
particularly beat your guidance as set out in the third quarter. So was there something unique in this fourth quarter for
Space that you didn't anticipate? Or what caused you to beat it by that much?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yeah. No. That's...
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Just that's 30 basis points higher than what your highest guidance was at the third quarter.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yeah. So the SAS business did see strong fourth quarter margins and they were slightly
above the prior year's fourth quarter. It's primarily due to the productivity improvements in our airborne radar program
area. We had a couple of things going on and we were able to pull – and I mentioned this earlier, pull some
productivity actions that we had anticipated in the first half of 2014 into the fourth quarter.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. Very good. Congratulations again, Bill.

<Q>: Hello?
Operator
You're line's live.
<Q>: Hi. Sorry about that. It's [ph] John Reeve (50:17) on for Jason. Hope you guys are doing well today and
congratulations to Bill and Tom. Just curious what you're looking out for in the FY2015 budget process from a
domestic perspective and where you see risks and opportunities around hitting the top end or bottom end of your
guidance for this year.
<A - William H. Swanson>: DoD's going to submit the budget in the March timeframe. It'll be the first budget that's
submitted within the caps. So for us, it'll allow DoD to make the trade-offs that they see fit under the new budget
process. Beyond that, it's really hard to speculate what we think they may be doing in that regard. But clearly for us, the
areas that we're focused in, in missile defense and in cyber and so forth that fit with what we believe the priorities will
be in that case, as we go forward.
<Q>: Thanks. And then, just in terms of thinking about the high and low end of guidance for this year?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Yeah. So from a guidance standpoint, we range virtually all of our financial performance
measures. I think a good way to think about it would be starting at the midpoint. We have opportunities and we also
have some risks, but on balance, I would suggest the midpoint of the range is the way to start thinking about it.

Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes. Thanks so much. And Bill, again, congratulations on job extremely well done.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Thank you, Cai. Appreciate it.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: So well done that my only real question is one for Dave. So you laid this very attractive
profile through 2016 of CAS recovery and your contributions, at least the gross funding contributions and if you don't
make any discretionary contributions, it looks like every year you get another couple $100 million of cash flow benefit.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: That's right.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: As you look at that, what could make the CAS – how locked in is the CAS recovery? And I
assume the gross funding essentially – what could change the gross funding, other than your discretionary
contributions?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Well, there's a lot of variables involved in this from a discount rate standpoint, from an
asset return standpoint, from a demographic standpoint. All of these have various impacts on the accounting obviously,
on the recovery and on the contributions under the Pension Protection Act. With all of that said, I would look at what
we have in the Web slide deck with pretty high confidence. I don't see that changing dramatically going forward.
It holds all assumptions constant, relative to the discount rate and the asset returns at 8.75%. The demographics can
sometimes change these numbers somewhat, but not meaningfully. So I would look at those numbers from an investor
perspective and have a fair amount of confidence in what we put out there.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Thank you very much.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Okay. Sure.
