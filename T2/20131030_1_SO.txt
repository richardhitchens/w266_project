Thomas A. Fanning
Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. 2013 has been a very active year for Southern Company with major
progress on construction projects, a robust regulatory calendar and unexpected challenges in the form of consistently
unseasonable weather.
Let's begin on the regulatory front where we continue to see constructive processes and outcomes in all four states in
which we operate. An extensive review of Alabama Power's RSE rate mechanism was concluded in August. Following
three public hearings, the commission chose to change the way RSE is measured beginning in 2014 to a weighted cost
of equity range that appropriately takes into account Alabama Power's equity ratio. In so doing, they concluded that
Alabama Power's overall return on capital was fair and reasonable. The commission also approved two regulatory
orders that will enable Alabama Power to avoid any increases to RSE in 2014, thereby keeping rates stable for
customers.
Earlier this month, Georgia Power presented its proposed three-year rate plan to the Georgia Public Service
Commission. That proposal includes a one-time rate increase of $482 million that will become effective January 1,
2014. The PSC staff and other interveners have filed their testimony and the next round of hearings will be held next
week. Georgia Power will file its rebuttal testimony by November 15, with rebuttal hearings scheduled to begin
November 25. A final decision on the Georgia rate case is expected on December 17.
Recall that Georgia Power has operated under a series of three-year rate plans since 1995. These plans have all been the
result of negotiation and compromise between Georgia Power, the Commission Staff and other parties as approved by
the Commission and agreed to by the company. The Georgia Commission has a long history of constructive regulation
and we fully expect that the outcome of this case will reflect a continuation of that record.
In other Georgia regulatory news, the eighth Vogtle Construction Monitoring report was approved by the Georgia PSC
by a unanimous five-to-zero vote. This latest regulatory approval means that a total of $2.2 billion in construction costs
has now been verified and approved by the Commission. Meanwhile, testimony continues to be filed as part of the Gulf
Power rate case. As a reminder, Gulf's request for a $74 million base rate increase that would become effective in April
of 2014, as well as an additional $16 million that would become effective in July of 2015. We expect hearings to
conclude in December with a decision in the first quarter of 2014.
Finally, Mississippi Power expects to file an update to the seven-year rate plan to the Kemper County project later this
year, reflecting assumptions consistent with the fourth quarter 2014 in service days. We anticipate that the hearings on
the rate plan will now occur in the first quarter of 2014. The prudent review schedule for the Kemper Project has also
been updated. By mid-December, Mississippi Power will file information supporting the prudence of its procedures and
controls over the costs that are currently under review. Hearings on those costs are expected to begin in May. As a
reminder, this will be the first of two prudence processes. This initial process will address costs incurred through March
2013, while the second will address all subsequent costs through the completion of the project. We believe this
schedule will allow sufficient time for Mississippi's new Public Service Commissioner, Stephen Renfroe, to become
fully informed on the issues involved. As a reminder, Commissioner Renfroe was appointed by the Mississippi
Governor, Phil Bryant, to fulfill the remaining term of Leonard Bentz, who resigned from the Commission in August.

Finally, I would like to give you an update on our Vogtle and Kemper County projects. First, work continues to
progress well at Vogtle 3 and 4 as evidenced by dramatic changes across the entire construction site. The project
management team from Westinghouse, CB&I, and Southern Nuclear is aligned and working hard for the next major
milestone, which includes final assembly of the Unit 3 nuclear island Auxiliary Building, also known as CA-20, and
the pouring of the first nuclear concrete in the Unit 4 nuclear island. Assembly of the CA-20 module for Unit 3 nuclear
island is scheduled to be completed in December. Our contractors are diligently progressing through sub-module
inspections and remediation in order to meet this date. Meanwhile, the first nuclear concrete floor for Unit 4 is
scheduled for mid-November. Most of the rebar work is complete and the final inspections and prep work are now
taking place to the floor, which took 41 hours to complete at Unit 3.
In September, the conditional commitment for the Vogtle 3 and 4 DOE loan was extended to December 31. As of
today, we've settled on most major terms and conditions and final reviews are underway at the appropriate government
agencies. While there is no assurance of a definitive agreement, constructive dialogue with DOE leaves us very
optimistic about capturing the value of these loans for customers.
The past Friday we submitted our initial filing with the Internal Revenue Service to secure our allocation of nuclear
production tax credits for Vogtle Unit 3. These credits were authorized under the Energy Policy Act of 2005. We
expect to submit an application to secure the Unit 4 allocation of credit after the Unit 4 basemat concrete is poured. The
basemat is expected to be the final construction step necessary to lock in these important savings for Georgia Power
customers, which could total as much as $1 billion for both units over the first eight years of operation.
Now for an update on the Kemper County project, earlier this month, we announced that we did not expect to meet the
original May 2014 in-service date for the Kemper project, largely as a result of lower-than-expected production rates
and delays from wet weather. After recalibrating our assumptions on the rate of pipe installation, we have revised the
in-service date to the fourth quarter of 2014. In conjunction with the schedule change, we have recorded an additional
pre-tax estimated loss of $150 million. As a reminder, we estimated the incremental cost for a delay to be
approximately $15 million to $25 million per month. Our new estimate is consistent with that projection and also
retains a $100 million contingency.
Tremendous progress continues to be made at the site. We are now nearly halfway complete with pipe installation, have
fired both combustion turbines and have synced the entire two on one combined cycle to the grid. Our project teams at
both Kemper and Vogtle continue to work diligently to complete these state-of-the-art facilities, both of which will
deliver outstanding value to our customers for decades to come.
I'll now turn the call over to Art for a financial and economic overview.
Arthur P. Beattie
Thanks, Tom. For the third quarter of 2013, we earned $0.97 per share compared to $1.11 per share in the third quarter
of 2012, a decrease of $0.14 per share. For the nine months ended September 30, 2013, we earned $1.41 per share
compared to $2.26 per share for the same period in 2012, a decrease of $0.85 per share. Our results for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2013, include after-tax charges of $93 million or $0.11 per share, and $704 million
or $0.81 per share respectively, related to the increased cost estimates for construction of the Kemper project.
As previously communicated, Mississippi Power will not seek recovery of estimated cost to complete the facility above
the $2.88 billion cost cap net of DOE grants and exceptions to the cost cap. Year-to-date, 2013 results also include an
after-tax charge of $16 million or $0.02 per share for the restructuring of a leveraged lease investment recorded in the
first quarter of 2013. Earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 include $21 million or $0.02 per share of
insurance recovery related to the March 2009 litigation settlement agreement with MC Asset Recovery LLC.
Excluding these extraordinary items, earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 were $1.08 and
$2.24 per share respectively, compared with $1.11 and $2.24 per share respectively during 2012.

Excluding the effects of Kemper County, the primary driver for our third quarter results was milder-than-expected
weather resulting in a decrease of $0.07 per share on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Weather was actually $0.10 below
normal compared with $0.035 per share below normal for the same period a year ago.
In terms of cooling degree days, the third quarter of 2013 was one of the mildest in the past 20 years. For instance, in
metro Atlanta, where we would normally expect to see more than 100 hours of summer temperatures above 90 degrees,
we saw only one such hour. In August also in metro Atlanta, we experienced four straight days with average
temperatures of 67 degrees, but even that doesn't tell the whole story. Rainfall during the quarter across the entire
Southern Company territory was at its highest level since 1916.
The significance of this anomaly cannot be overstated. When rainfall is that heavy, the typical heat build-up fails to
occur. Without this build-up, the temperature momentum that usually results in sustained electric demand for cooling
never materializes. This factor greatly affects our earnings – greatly affected our earnings during the third quarter of
2013.
It's significant to note that weather affected not only our retail sales, but also energy sales to wholesale customers. We
were able to offset the total effect of weather somewhat by reducing non-fuel O&M spending compared to our plan. A
more detailed summary of our quarter-over-quarter drivers is included in the slide deck.
Turning now to a discussion of our retail sales and economic outlook for the remainder of the year. GDP growth in the
Southeast and the nation as a whole remained slower than expected, at 1.5% to 2% year-to-date growth. However, in
terms of jobs growth year-to-date, the region is just slightly ahead of the nation at about 1.7%.
Industrial sales growth during the third quarter of 2013 was relatively strong at 2.6%. We continued to see emerging
growth in housing-related sectors such as lumber up 9%, stone, clay and glass up 7% and textiles up 6%. We also saw
increased strength in paper up 11%, petroleum up 11% and primary metals up 8%.
Exports have begun expanding again after stalling in the first quarter. Weather normal residential sales were relatively
flat for the quarter, although customer growth is slightly ahead of the same period in 2012. As expected, residential
sales growth continues to lag behind our customer growth.
The commercial market continues to show signs of improvement as evidenced by a decline in office vacancy levels,
which have fallen nearly 10% from their peak. Elsewhere, our economic development pipeline remains active and
productive as the Southeast remains a great place to do business. Currently, our traditional operating companies are
supporting some 350 potential projects, representing more than 40,000 jobs and $15 billion in capital investments.
Meanwhile, recent announcements are adding nearly 7,600 new jobs in our territory. Included among these are Blue
Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia; carpet manufacturer, Shaw Industries; auto parts manufacturer, Hyundai Dymos;
vinyl tile manufacturer, Mannington Mills; wood pellet manufacture, Green Circle Bio Energy and medical software
developer, iSirona.
Now, at this point, I'd like to share our earnings estimate for the fourth quarter of 2013, which will be $0.44 per share.
This implies annual results at the bottom end of our guidance range.
I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks.
Thomas A. Fanning
Thanks, Art. There has been a lot of interest recently in the emergence of a changing trajectory in long-term earnings
per share growth for our industry. We've noted that many of you are writing about that now.
It has been our practice for the last decade or so, we will provide updated guidance range for 2014 and an updated
long-term growth rate during our fourth quarter earnings call in January. It's been an awfully busy year with a lot of
important regulatory outcomes either pending or complete in all of our jurisdictions. For example, we expect the
Georgia Power rate case to conclude in December. So there's still a lot of important information to be factored into our

long-term EPS growth. But still, it's an interesting question. What do we think will remain the same and what do we
think will change? While we don't yet have the specifics, we can talk directionally.
First, what do we expect to remain the same? Dividend policy. Based on what we see today, we believe our dividend
growth trajectory will remain consistent with the dividend increases of the past six years. Now, dividends are obviously
the purview of our board, but we are confident in our ability to continue to deliver those returns to our shareholders.
Second, what is likely to change? The shape of our EPS growth. Compared to the past 10 years, our EPS growth will
likely slow a bit during the middle of the current decade, but will likely increase again by the end of the decade. Why?
Well, as you know, Southern Company has been investing capital at a very healthy rate for many years now, supporting
major projects like our McDonough gas unit, Plant Vogtle, Kemper County, our environmental spend and growth at
Southern Power.
In fact, our CapEx as a percentage of our invested capital base has averaged about 8% over this timeframe. As we work
through our annual update to the financial plan, this percentage is projected to become smaller through the middle of
this decade. Associated with this reduced CapEx and growth of invested capital, is the fact that our cash flow metrics
are expected to improve dramatically. In fact, within the next three-year period our equity needs could be eliminated or
go negative in order to preserve our target equity ratio. And by the end of the decade, our growth in CapEx is expected
to resume with the advent of more environmental spending and the commencement of our next phase of generating
capacity for our traditional operating companies and Southern Power.
As always, our objective is to provide superior risk-adjusted returns to our investors by delivering on our commitment
to provide clean, safe, reliable and affordable electricity to our customers. Our regulatory jurisdictions continue to
prove constructive and we believe that Southeast is poised to lead the nation's emerging economic recovery and we are
prepared to support and take part in that resurgence.
We are now ready to take your questions. So, operator, we'll now take the first question.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.
Please proceed with your question.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Steven Fleishman>: Hey, Tom and Art. Just first, when you do get to kind of more specific guidance next year,
this [ph] $2.68 (22:01) that you're now guiding to this year, will you like normalize that for the weather as a base or is
that – assuming you get there, is that the kind of base we should think about?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, we always give weather normal projections.
<Q - Steven Fleishman>: Okay. Second question is on Vogtle, can you give us an update on the modules issued, Lake
Charles et cetera? Is that likely to stay on schedule to be resolved by the end of the year?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So the kind of primary focus is on the CA-20 that we referenced. I think the important
thing to note is that all of the material associated with CA-20 is currently onsite. Construction is progressing in an
acceptable manner. And like we said, we're projecting the assembly of CA-20 be done by year-end. That's kind of most
important. That actually forms a support mechanism for other modules, for example CA-01, that will occur later in
2014. Art, do you want to add?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: No.
<Q - Steven Fleishman>: To just clarify that then, does that then mean that the issue with the modules is essentially
resolved in terms of it being kind of a critical path issue in terms of current schedule for the project?

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So we – listen, I think we said this a lot in the past. There are always issues, right? And so
what we're always doing is working through the issues. So is it resolved? No. Do we have accessible workaround for
every issue that we see right now? Yes. When we talk about critical path, we fight among ourselves here about that
because there may be for the remaining integrated schedule, there may be something like 20 to 30 critical path items.
And if you are a week late on one it doesn't mean you're a week late on the end of the schedule. We believe that in our
evaluation of other critical path items we actually have improvements in the schedule. We believe right now the sum
total of critical path progress keeps us on schedule.
<Q - Steven Fleishman>: Okay. And then one other question just on Kemper? In the last two updates I think you've
given some – you've obviously had these write- offs but I think some of the higher costs you've been able to kind of
defer for recovery? Could you kind of highlight what that number is and why is that piece able to be deferred for
recovery versus the others have to be kind of counted in the cost cap?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes, Steve, if we look at the project cost that we expect recovery on, it would be the basic
$2.4 billion plant cost that we initially certified to, the cost of the mine, which is about $250 million, the cost of the
pipeline, which is roughly $115 million and then there are some other regulatory assets that were on Mississippi
Power's books that are scheduled to be recovered as well. That's about $190 million. And that's when we look at what
would be within Mississippi Power's earnings rate base, that's what we look at. The other pieces of it would be
AFUDC, which is roughly $425 million and then the difference between $2.4 billion and $2.88 billion cap will also
become part of the securitization package. That totals about $480 million. Those are the pieces that make up what we're
looking at, at this point, other than the write-off amounts.
<Q - Steven Fleishman>: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Julien. How are you doing?
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Not too bad. Thank you.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Good.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Excellent. So just turning to the CBI and I suppose the issue of CBI and litigation and
settlement, what have you. How do you see that progressing here? I mean, it seems like you've gotten some progress?
There are still some other issues out there? Ultimately, how do you feel about that getting resolved and what timeline?
And then, beyond that, given I suppose some slippage in settlement – some slippage in schedule of module 20 or what
have you, is there a potential to go back to CBI for more prospectively?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So let me give you kind of a broad comment. In the middle of negotiations or whatever
you never want to kind of give specific advice. Let me give you some very clear, though I think general guidance here.
As Chicago Bridge & Iron acquired Shaw, we had a change in leadership. Philip Asherman is the CEO of CB&I.
We have found the relationship between us and the consortium, particularly with CB&I and Philip Asherman to be
excellent. Danny Roderick now leads Westinghouse. Likewise, the relationship there is excellent. There are issues that
are within the purview of the consortium. How cost get shared among and between Toshiba Westinghouse and CB&I
that we're not party to that certainly do factor into the resolution of the commercial dispute.
But between the company and the consortium, I would argue the tone has turned a lot more positive and certainly I
think the progress of the litigation is acceptable. So while I can't offer you very much more specific than that, I would
say the general tenor should be positive. What else do you want to cover there?

Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Jonathan.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Good afternoon. Just to clarify, Tom, on these modules, last date – I think the last update
was some of them were still in Lake Charles. You're saying today they are all physically in Georgia at the site?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: CA-20 is all there.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay. But there are still some documentation and other issues you've got to tie up?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes. They call it remediation, but essentially whenever you find like a small defect or
whatever what you do is fix it on site. And we just felt it was a much more efficient time effective process to get them
on site, fix the documentation and get them ready to go.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Because I – my understanding was the NRC has to sort of sign off on them being moved
and that would be a sign that they were resolved at that?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's right.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, they've been moved to the site, but they haven't been accepted by us from a quality
perspective. Those elements that are still being remediated are still being remediated under CBI's oversight.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: So aside from the sort of logistical help I guess it'll be that they will be there sooner when
you do resolve those issues? The issues are basically still unresolved.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's right.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: We're actually going to be really bullish about that.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Sorry, Tom?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: I said we're feeling really bullish about [indiscernible] (29:56) CA-20.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Rather than having them resolving it down in the south and then you've got to get them up
there.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's right.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Later. Okay. And then on Kemper, can you just – I think when you originally announced
this earlier in the month you said that it was really weather and there were perhaps some other issues. But the way you
talked about it in the 8-K last night, it sounded like it might be more productivity and then the weather was a sub-factor.
Is that [indiscernible] (30:31)?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, let's kind of go through that a little bit. Early on when we talked about it, we did see
weather being kind of a major thing. And I remember right out of the gate we had some ambitious targets and right out

of the gate we hit our targets. And that's the tone you were getting from us. As we progressed on installing the pipe
particularly, it's almost hard to imagine unless you've been there. I know some of you have been to the site and you'll
know what I'm talking about. A, there's a lot of pipe. B, there are different kinds of pipe, wide bore pipe, there is small
bore pipe. Some of the pipe is outside the physical structure of the gas supplier island and the gas handling system.
Some of it is in constrained spaces inside the structure.
Obviously what we have found is production levels that we saw early were not able to be sustained because a lot of the
work ended up being detail work inside the structure. We just didn't maintain the kind of productivity that we wanted to
see.
Further, and we kind of alluded to this, we are now at over two shifts of 2,000 cramped people per day working on this
issue. And to some extent, there is a saturation at the site. In other words we don't think it's productive to add more
people and add more shifts and everything else. We are kind of where we want to be here. And part of changing the
schedule, I suppose if we could have done more and tried to keep May. But we felt that for the overall health of the
project it was important for us to take this new schedule, put people to work in a more efficient manner and get the
work done.
So it's kind of all that combination. And you know when we say weather and rainfall and all of that, I remember we
were down there one day – we go to visit the site a good bit as you can imagine. It's not just rainfall. Sometimes it's fog.
And in fact, you can imagine big cranes working and manipulating some of the material on the site. If you can't see the
top of the crane, you can't work. So fog ended up being an issue.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: That is helpful, Tom. Thank you. And then just on the growth topic, you talked about this
sort of mid-decade slow down shift to more of a cash generative mode. To Steve's question on weather and guidance,
what's your weather headwind year-to-date?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Year-to-date it is $0.14 against normal.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: So would you anticipate talking about growth off of a [ph] $2.68 (33:23) number plus that
$0.14 I mean to be more explicit?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: The thing you have to normalize as well is O&M. So it's not just a one-sided equation. So we
will decide where that ought to be and when we talk to you in January.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Look, do the dumb math a little bit real quick, Jonathan. I think this might be helpful. If
you add together less-than-expected sales and loss of sales due to weather, we're in the $480 million range for the year,
somewhere around there...
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Two years.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: For two years?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, yeah.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And O&M is down a similar number over something like two to three years. So we have
moved O&M and weather in concert to the extent we can. At some point, one of the issues that we face is, and Art,
thank you for reminding me of this, but something like of the past 25 months – we have had below-normal weather or
milder weather, 22 months of the last 25 months.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Right.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And therefore, I suppose we could just continue to take O&M out of the business and I
guess we could do that. However, that doesn't really serve our responsibility of clean, safe, reliable, affordable energy
to our customers, so we have to balance that whole equation. So look, we do, do weather normal projections, we will do
that. We need to restore some O&M to get back to...
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Right.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: ...other normal activities. Hey, let me just – I'm dying to do it, I always love to do this,
lagniappe in these calls. You all on the call are familiar with heating degree days and cooling degree days. You're not
going to believe the profile this year of Southern Company. If you look at the cooling degree days and heating degree
days for the months of January, February, March, June, July, August, they were all about the same number. It is
astounding the kind of year we've had.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: So, Tom, thanks for all that color and – maybe it's pinning you down too far, but on the
growth outlook, you obviously – you have this [ph] 4% to 6% (35:41) currently and [ph] 5% (35:42) is sort of the
midpoint. Do you still see [ph] 5% (35:44) as being part of the range as you...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, Jonathan.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Out of the decade?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, man, we'll update everybody. We'll update everybody in January. What we were
able to say here, because I know everybody is going to want to know the specifics, we're just not ready to do specifics.
We'll do that in January as we have for the past decade. But what we could say, in all the uncertainty is even now in our
financial projections, we do have what appears to be a dominant solution. The dominant solution basically says, so the
rate of growth dividend we think will be consistent with the past, putting in place all the caveats about purview of the
board and everything else.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Thanks. That's good. Thank you, Tom.

Our next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Citigroup. Please proceed with your question.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hello, Shar.
<Q - Shar Pourreza>: How are you guys?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Good.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Super.
<Q - Shar Pourreza>: Just a question on your cash flow profile. I think you kind of hinted that you should see a
potential improvement in that outlook over the near term. Could that potentially eliminate any equity needs in 2015 at
the earliest?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, I think when you look at our equity needs, we've outlined the need for equity a little
bit more this year, total of about $700 million for the year and $600 million next year. 2015 is still kind of a toss-up,
but as to whether or not we'll need any is a function of obviously tax policy, with bonus depreciation that we qualify for
all of that kind of stuff. But we may not need any equity, additional equity in 2015.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: And in fact, the net of 2015 and 2016 could be zero. If you sell some in 2015, you could
have a negative in 2016.
<Q - Shar Pourreza>: Okay. Perfect. And then just one real top-level question to the extent that you can answer it. I
think you mentioned maybe in the prepared remarks that some of the growth that you see could be back-end loaded,
when you typically issue your guidance CAGR, it's usually more of a long-term picture. Can you at least directionally
mention whether the growth in the outer years can offset a potential slowdown in the interim?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, the way you should think about that is that – what we've tried to say is, I'm going
back to John Childs, that old stuff, those of you that aren't old enough to know John Childs, you ought to read his book.
He's an old guy on Wall Street. But your earnings per share growth rate from net growth and dividends per share at or

above the rate of inflation, what we've been able to do with this tremendous growth period that we've had is increase
our dividend, I guess it's the past six years in a row at $0.07 a year. And what we're saying here is by almost any
measure we are looking at, we can maintain that kind of trajectory assuming that the board agrees and everything else.
But that's what we think. So, you should think about earnings per share growth and dividend per share growth together.
And by saying I think we can keep that $0.07 trajectory going, and I think it says that whatever happens in the

[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Eggers with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: Good afternoon, guys. Hey, just industrial kind of showed nice uptick in the quarter from what
we've been seeing of late. Can you just maybe give a little more color on not so much where the breakdown of
performance has been, but when you talk to all your customers what their expectations are in the year-end and for next
year from a planning perspective?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, again, it's going to vary depending on the industry you are talking about. I'd say auto
transportation is going to continue to expand. And I believe all of our manufacturers are operating two shifts, five days
a week, some more. We expect that certainly to continue. Primary metals has been kind of up and down depending on
what the metal is being produced for. Obviously automotive metal, the demand has been pretty high but construction
materials and other steel related products has been – that might be delayed towards the export market has been kind of
spotty as well.
Our chemical numbers year-over-year look down and that is because one of our bigger chemical companies closed one
of their processes here in Georgia. And so you'll – at the end of this year, that will be removed from the process. So you
should see a continuation of pretty strong growth – pretty strong performance in the chemical side. And again,
housing-related stuff is really off of a pretty low base. But we're pleased to see that they are improving. I think, Dan, it's
probably a mixed bag. And it's a little too soon for me to comment at this point. But we don't see a wholesale slowdown
in the industrial sector.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Let me give you just a little more lagniappe here. The residential and kind of housing
numbers are pretty interesting. We used to get about 70% of our sales from single-family homes. And with the
economic recovery from the pull-back in the housing bubble, now to the recovery, the number looks like 62% instead
of 70%. So we are seeing more people come in. One of the other questions that we've all had as an industry, I know
we've had a lot of fun talking about on this call, has been the whole kind of consumption pattern of residential
customers.
One of the other issues that we – when you peel the onion on the numbers, we've seen more customers come in, there
are houses with meters but nobody is living there. There are people now trying to sell them again where they didn't
before. So you've got to factor all that stuff into account. So, we actually think the trend here is positive. Let me give
you just a couple more things to keep your eye on. Domestic energy prices, particularly good old Southern Company
energy prices, remain awfully strong, relative to averages. And I think that gives us the basis to compete well and gives
us, I think, some good gunpowder, if you will, for companies that continue to locate in our area.
Another thing, export, significant part of our industrial production goes to the export markets as the worldwide markets
continue to improve, we'll do it. One more and then I'll turn it over. But pipeline is interesting. Pipeline shows up as an
industrial customer. Most times industrial customers are not sensitive to weather. In this case pipelines were sensitive
to weather and in fact I think it was our worst performing segment. But we think it was all weather related. So if you
get more normal weather, more normal throughput, better performance.

<Q - Daniel Eggers>: Got it. That was interesting on the house-flipping front. I guess switching gears on Kemper and
kind of these prudence reviews, can you share really what's going to be a conversation and how that's at play relative to
$2.8 billion cap you guys already agreed on?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, I'll give my shot at it. Art, give yours. Who knows, number one, we've got to have
the prudence review and we're giving them all the documentation and everything else. Certainly, we are disappointed
with the additional charges that we've recognized and what we believe will be a future loss. It would be amazing to me
for somebody to come up with an argument that for at least the first $2.88 billion that we were imprudent knowing that
we are writing off now on a pre-tax basis over $1 billion. I would find that a very tough argument to make.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: I think it's also important to note that under Mississippi law, as I understand it, that an
assumption of prudence has to be made and that there has to be proof of imprudence when you go through the whole
process. So it's something that's been clarified here as of late.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And I'll just tell you, I mean we believe the problem at Kemper was essentially at the time
that we made a fixed price commitment with 10% engineering done at 6.7% contingency. In other words, the problem
has been more and more a lack of engineering that was completed rather than construction. By all accounts the
construction of Kemper has gone very well.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: Got it. And I guess last one, Tom, and I know you guys are going to talk to this next quarter, but
when you think about the acceleration of growth, just kind of big bucket wise, is that going to be driven by
infrastructure replacement? Is that going to be driven by re-acceleration in power demand? What do you think of the
things on the horizon that's going to facilitate a higher rate of growth?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Sure. It's a higher rate of growth compared to the 2016 or 2017 timeframe. It's going to be
more like this I think. When you look at the integrated resource plans across the system, kind of the next timeframe of
new generation will be in the early 20s, so let's just say 2023. So getting ready for that, starting construction, all that
will be one. That's for our retail operating companies. Further, Southern Power. The Southern Power people work
really hard to produce results.
When I think about Southern Power this year, last year they made something like, I don't know, $175 million and we've
given them a stretched goal to improve that this year. We think they've lost pre-tax something like $40 million on
energy margins this year, just because the capacity factors that their equipment is lower, gas prices have gone up
something like 80% off their lows, coal prices have come down a bit, especially as we have shifted to western coal in
the aggregate.
So the other thing is we keep pushing Southern Power to go evaluate deals and go buy things that fit our business
model. I can tell you there is a lot out there for sale, but we are very disciplined and we have not pulled the trigger very
much, absent the solar deals we've announced, on striking new deals. So we want to clear that inventory out of the way
and accelerate Southern Power's own growth plan. We've also told you in prior calls that we're looking elsewhere. So
Texas, MISO, PJM West, a variety of other things where we might be able to find some more fertile ground.
That also is a function of our reserve margins in the Southeast. The other thing I would just mention is environmental
spend, particularly ash, water, what else is down the road. The new rules that we're looking at, particularly for ash and
water, are bigger in nominal dollars than our incremental MAT costs. So we think that as we find the firm dates in
which we have to comply, effluent standard 316 b, CCB, coal combustion byproducts et cetera, we think those numbers
will emerge at the kind of back end of the decade. So we'll be spending money there. Those are kind of the big buckets,
new generation, Southern Power, environmental spend.
<Q - Daniel Eggers>: Great. Thank you for that. I appreciate it.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: You bet.

Our next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group. Please proceed with your question.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hello, Greg? Greg?
Operator
Mr. Gordon, your line is open.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Sorry about that. Sorry I'm late. I just hopped off another call. Just a follow-up on that line of
conversation on the – I take it – you said earlier in the call that you would see sort of a dip in growth in sort of the
2016, 2017 timeframe and then accelerate back up in the back half of the decade. And I just heard the answer to the last
question, which put some more bones around that. If I look at slide 14 of your slide deck, it gives us the 2013, 2014,
2015 CapEx by segment. So is what you're telling us that your new generation and environmental compliance spending
will see a dip in 2016, 2017, and then re-accelerate later in the decade, but that T&D, maintenance, nuke fuel, general,
the other things are sort of steady as she goes? Is that the right way to think about it?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes. Yes. That's a good way to think about it.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: And at Southern Power you continue...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And at Southern Power, too.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Southern Power you think will also dip? Or you think you'll be able to find opportunities to
spend there?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: We hope we'll find opportunities. By definition we're a big EVA company, and if we can
find things that fit our business profile, we're not going to change long-term bilateral contracts, no fuel risk,
creditworthy counterparties. We're going to keep the course there.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Right.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: If we can find more deals, we'll do them. Gee whiz, we'll do them next year and the year
after. The thing is, like I said, there's a lot for sale, it's just kind of junk in my view. And the other thing is, we just don't
know how much more solar is out there, what our appetite is. You know we've said before, tax advantage investing to
us requires a risk premium.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Right. So – and that $2.4 billion over 2013, 2014, 2015 has always been to some degree a
placeholder for opportunities, right? So...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's exactly right.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Those numbers are even to some degree opportunistic.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: They are precisely opportunistic. You're exactly right.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay, Tom, thanks, that's very clear. Take care.

<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: How are you?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Super. Hope you're well.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: I am, thank you. Just the prudence review, is the $2.88 billion, is there any threat of that being
disallowed at all? Or is it just anything above that, that they're looking at?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, there is no – I mean, anything about $2.88 billion – wait a minute, let's be clear.
There's three big hunks of things, right? There's a mine, there's a pipe and there's a plant. And what I said before was,
we've already – not charging Mississippi customers above $2.88 billion. That's what gives rise to these expected
lawsuits that we've been booking. In terms of inside of $2.88 billion, that's subject to, kind of, the company and the
PSC to decide. Paul, my only point was, given the cost above $2.88 billion that we've taken for our own account, I
would find that to be a tough argument, but let the process go and we'll see.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: And then with this latest Kemper charge, how's that going to impact your equity needs into
2014 and 2015?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, Paul, we don't expect that they'll change from what we outlined on the last call. $700
million this year, $600 million next, and then 2015 will be dependent on other Southern Power projects or whatever.
But right now, we may not see any need in 2015 or 2016. But we're still maintaining a target 44% equity ratio.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Okay. And then it sounds like you – subject to the purview of the board, but you see $0.07
dividend hikes? Is that the way to look at it, or is there a percentage increase we should think about?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: What I am referring to is the $0.07 per share that we've been doing now for six years in a
row. And all I'm saying with that is, you've got to put all the right caveats there, right? I can't sit here and guarantee
everything for you, that is the subject – that is the purview of the board. But I can say that based on every projection
I've seen, we still need to work through all the details. We have a lot of regulatory uncertainty still with Georgia and
others. It looks like to me a dominant solution, I feel reasonably confident in saying that we can sustain that.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: But Tom, you sounded pretty optimistic about a Georgia settlement in your commentary. Did I
interpret that properly?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: We've been treated constructively in this three-year process since 1995. I know there's
been lots of questions before by people outside Georgia asking the Commission, how will they rule, et cetera, et cetera.
And I know that there's been a consistent theme of, why should I hurt this company. Georgia continues to provide some
of the best customer satisfaction. You know that's the middle – the center of our business model. We call it circle of
life, but it in fact works. If we deliver reliability, low prices, and the best customer service that translates into customer
value. Our core companies among the national companies we follow are the top four in terms of customer value in the
United States. So, we see all of the fundamentals in place to continue a constructive relationship with the commission.
Outside of that, I have no color on how that will go. I just think we'll be treated fairly as we have in the past.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Are you going to do your triennial Investor Day in 2014?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: We are still considering that. As of this point, we haven't made any commitments.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Just wanted to clarify one or two things. One is, to be clear, the fact that you will end at the lower end
of your guidance range for this year, are you attributing that all to weather? Or were there some other factors we should
be thinking about as well?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Vast majority of it is weather. If it was just economic growth, we could make that up
easily. It's mostly weather. We've never had a third quarter in our history, we think, that mattered $0.10 in weather.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. And then year-to-date weather normalized growth, load growth, has been pretty much flat or
0.1% down. Can you remind us normalized, what do you see normalized load growth 2014 and beyond? How should
we be thinking about that?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And Ali, don't think of it year-to-date flat, all that. Think of it as we suggested. The profile
of growth this year has been almost exactly what we thought it would be, except it has been a bit attenuated, right? So
the first six months we thought would be flat. Well in fact, it was flat, maybe slightly negative and you can fool around
the edges on that. The last three months has been a little positive plus 1%, weather normal. We hoped it was going to be
a little better than that, but that's because GDP is down. It's fascinating. We look at all sorts of things like all the
fundamentals that we give you guys every quarter on the bottoms-up evaluations of the economy.
The other thing that, like the Fed looks at too, is this uncertainty index. And the absolute level of this uncertainty index
is put out by some people coming out of University of Chicago, shows that the nominal level of uncertainty is just
about double what we've seen in history and importantly, the volatility of uncertainty is enormous compared to prior
history. And so what we see now is not only a challenged economy showing a recovery, although a bit feeble, we now
have introduced event risk. And when we see fiscal policy fail to resolve the issues of the day, we see all sorts of
effects in the economy as a result.
People not withholding spending actually saving more money, not all a bad thing. We're seeing companies hold back a
bit on capital expansion. We're seeing companies hold back a bit on employment. We've got to get out of this logjam in
Washington in order for the full potential of the economy to achieve its numbers. Down the road, we continue to see
recovery. We see all the data. I think the only one Art didn't mention is commercial recovery. We continue to see good,
what do you call them, green shoots or whatever there. You know and typically that's our lagging indicator.
<Q - Ali Agha>: And so, Tom, to be clear, I mean as you look forward remind us, I mean you see sort of normalized
growth what in the 1% to 2% range annually or...?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: 1.3%
<Q - Ali Agha>: 1.3%. Okay. And then Art, year-to-date can you remind us how much equity actually has been
issued?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Can you hold on a second. It's $500 million year-to-date. We need about $200 million more
to get to our target. I think there is an appendix slide on the website, Ali, that could give you that number as well.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Got it.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: One of things about weather normal, and I know I've always said this, is that it's more of an
art than a science. But, weather this year has been so abnormal that when we do, and I know our load forecast folks
shoot arrows at me when I say this, but when our models try to normalize it is using modeling from normal weather
years. So when you take an abnormally year like this and try to figure out the weather impact, we don't think we're
getting reliable numbers. So we think our growth could actually be a bit better than what we're reflecting.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, and let me give you – I couldn't agree more with, Art, here. Here's one more.
Normally when you think about weather adjustments, you go to temperature. It is clear that the rainfall has had a
significant wet blanket on economic activity. People are going out less, spending less. We've laughingly used in the
past the traffic over the Pensacola Beach Bridge and beer sales out of the Walmart, people just didn't spend as much

Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Michael.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Hey, Tom. Hey, Art. Just one or two questions on CapEx. I'm just looking at the slide in
the appendix from this quarter's slide deck and last quarter's slide deck. I want to make sure I understand what's
happening here. It looks like you moved CapEx up and into 2013 at Mississippi Power, but then you backed down the
back-end numbers there. And then at Alabama Power, it looked like you raised the back-end numbers but lowered
2013. Just want to make sure I understand the drivers there and then I want to follow up on Southern Power.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes, Michael I'm going to have to get back to you on that, I don't have that detail, but we
will be certainly glad to get you that information.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay. Also, Southern Power, you had earmarked about $900 million of CapEx for 2013.
We're basically at Halloween. I just didn't know where are you in that run rate? And is that a number that's likely to
come down and be a source of cash to the holding Company in the next – as you kind of have to fund the Kemper and
fund some of Vogtle?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, we are about half of that at this point, somewhere around the $450 million number is
my recollection anyway.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay. And there...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: We thought there would be more gas deals around, when we looked at another biomass
deal, we looked at other stuff and we just had them like what we are seeing.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Tom, you've made some comments about Kemper County and kind of the engineering
versus construction processes. Given the fact that it's an innovative technology, if you were sitting down a year or two,
three years from now with some of your peers and had to give them – give like a lessons learned, or if I had to do over,
what would I do differently type what else, are there other things you would have done significantly different? And I'm
really trying to think about this kind of longer term, next 5, 10, 20 years as other companies in the industry have to do
things that are technologically different than what they've traditionally done.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, let me give you a quick simple and that is, it would be do more front end
engineering.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Okay.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So that would be it, the other thing is we are seeing lots of potentials outside the United
States, and here let me give you kind of two factors. We continue to innovate around TRIG that's the brand name of our
technology and in fact there is this other technology we are working on, it's just a natural evolution at TRIG where we
might capture as much as 100% of the CO2. Now, we are far from being ready for prime time there, but the linkage of
CO2 not as a waste but as something of value particularly with enhanced oil recovery, they have some potential. And
so we are continuing to work on it. So look, we are very proud of TRIG, we made a mistake on the engineering. We
agreed to price cap without having done fully our homework on the deal and we're paying for it. But I think down the

road we'll find ways we think to keep the capital cost down and make the things economic.
The other thing people talk about all the time, well gee whiz, how can you do Vogtle? How you can Kemper with low
gas prices? Well, we have made probably the biggest shift in the industry from coal to gas. Southern Company is now
the third largest consumers of natural gas in United States. Everybody knows I'm bullish on natural gas, but we cannot
put all our eggs in that basket. We must find innovative solutions to go forward, okay.
The final point, we are now engaged in some discussions around the world, China, Pakistan, Indonesia, Australia,
Poland. I'll be in Washington on November 7, with Secretary Moniz and other energy secretaries from international
companies talking about the applicability of TRIG or any improvement to TRIG that we make down the road. And
think about it, why it would it might make sense there rather than hear? Well, because they may not have advantages of
natural gas industry that's been created through fracing and so if they don't, places like China, Indonesia, Australia,
Poland at all may have near-term uses for this kind of technology.
So look, I guess to summarize quickly, do more homework upfront, understand the risk of a price cap, it would be – we
are going to continue to innovate and we are very proud of this technology we think it's got great promise in the future,
we are continuing to work on it.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Dynamite, good to hear from you.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: You too. Just a couple of kind of incremental bits of information when – to go with that growth
rate in sales, what's your assumption about the kind of longer-term five, seven year growth rate in O&M as you go
forward?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, yeah, Kit, this is Art. You look at O&M, and we have a hard time defining normal in
O&M these days. As we look back in time and we just look at our operating company O&M levels over the last four
years, and if you normalize it for things like the Daniel lease at Mississippi, we've been relatively flat on non-fuel
O&M since 2010.

<Q - Kit Konolige>: And how many assets have your added?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: And we have added over $7 billion of plant and service during that time, including units here
in Georgia around the McDonough, 2,500 megawatts of natural gas units. We've added scrubbers and SCRs around the
system. All of these assets require O&M. So we've been able to absorb that around the weather and economic impacts
that we have suffered through for the last two years.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So let me just say it a different way. So assuming – accounting for increases in assets and
increasing the inflation, we've actually had declining real O&M level.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: That's correct.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Over four years.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Now you asked the question, well, what did we plan? How do we plan from there? I would
take, and this is kind of just a slingshot over the back here, but take a couple hundred million, maybe $250 million, and
add it to our current – maybe our current 12 month ended numbers and add 3.5% to it a year, and that would give you a
normal process or expectation around O&M.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: 3%?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's reasonable. Yeah.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: And then one other item related to the discussion of the future, and things you don't want to be
pinned down on, Tom. But obviously doing the arithmetic if your growth rate in EPS is likely to slow some, and yet
you keep up the rate of growth of the dividend and the payout ratio increases, what level of payout ratio are you
comfortable with?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, right. So that's the obvious math, right? And remember we said that EPS has a
shape now, so we have a trajectory, the trajectory could flatten a bit and then resume. So, remember where the payout
ratio would rise in the time of flattening, you're going to be much more cash flow positive. So from a credit metrics,
cash flow coverage or dividend or however you want to think about that, we can sustain a higher payout ratio. So we
wouldn't be afraid at all going above 75. I don't see any scenario right now credibly that would get us north of 80. but I
think we could be in the 75 and north range. But I think that would be fine for us because I think longer-term we'd work
it back down. It's more important for us to have regular, predictable, sustainable increases in the dividend policy. We
understand how important that is to investors and I feel confident that we're going to be able to sustain that, assuming
the board goes along with it.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Right.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Thank you.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Hey, Kit.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Yes, sir.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: This is Art. On that O&M comment, that may not be level across all our operating
companies. You may see companies increasing if their – for example Georgia Power putting the Vogtle 3 and 4 into
service. You are going to see some elevated levels of O&M around those assets.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And McDonough.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes. So those numbers may not work by an operating company standard.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Right. Fair enough. But if you bring them all up to consolidate them at the southern level, that
should be the sort of rough approximation?

Our next question comes from the line of Mark Barnett with Morningstar Research. Please proceed with your question.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Mark.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. It's been a long call, so I won't pepper you too much. I just have
a quick question on something that NRC staff released last week. They were talking about a greater coordination of
safety or severe accident management guidelines. Now, it might be a very small item, given the size of Southern, but
I'm just curious if you think that there's something in there that might meaningfully impact cash operating costs for
nuclear.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: No. We meet all the time on this stuff. You wouldn't believe – I guess between me and
Mark Crosswhite our COO board members we go to NSRB, Nuclear Safety Review Board where we go to each of our
plants and evaluate all the details, the operations to begin at. Our APCO CEO, McCrary and Paul Bowers at Georgia,
McCrary at Alabama go to these meetings. We have board meetings at Southern Nuclear, we meet all time on these
issues, as well at our management council meetings, we evaluate kind of budget to actual performance and projections
of all our business units including nuclear. While these are important issues that you are kind of highlighting here, we
don't think it's a significant budget issue and we'll be able to work through anything coming our way here. This is not
one of the issues that's going to be a driver to an investor's decision in a material way.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Okay. I think it seems that it's still something that's up in the air and there seems there might
even be some internal disagreement. But do you have any feel for what if any – whether it's a small item or not, what if
any real changes might be brought about by any such coordination of SAMG?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Mark you know what I'd rather do here, I would rather get you on a phone with some
of our nuclear guys and talk through that, because just talking about that in isolation really doesn't tell the whole story.
Remember we had the whole post-Fukushima things and we were going to do hydrogen venting and a whole lot of
other issues. I can just tell you looking at the budgets of our nuclear business, they do grow, but it's nothing that's going
to weigh down our ability to deliver financial results. If you want a lot of detail I can put you with the right people.

<Q - Mitchell Moss>: Okay. And then on the upcoming milestones, there was previously you had said that the steam
turbine synchronization was going to be at the end of October. So...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: We're synchronized.
<Q - Mitchell Moss>: You're synchronized?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yep.
<Q - Mitchell Moss>: Okay, so that's been completed. So, it looked like there weren't any other 90-day milestones
coming up, or at least listed. So are there – what should we be paying attention to, [indiscernible] (73:59) significant
bench marks?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: I think one thing we've mentioned in the past was with first gasifier heat up and that was
originally scheduled I think December, now it looks like mid to late second quarter.
<Q - Mitchell Moss>: Okay. So that's the next major milestone that we should be paying attention for?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: That's correct.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, finish the piping and get the heat up going so [indiscernible] (74:28) going so far, it's
been going very well. We're 60% through start up, something like that, 50%.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Right.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And it's gone well.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: We'll have some other milestones beyond that around reliable syngas out of each train, that's

<Q - Andrew S. Levi>: Okay. Just one thing I was confused about that came up earlier in the call. Maybe I just wasn't
aware of it. But just on Mississippi, on the $2.88 billion, did you say there was going to be a prudence review around
that? I thought that was kind of set in stone.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, no. There has always been a prudence review associated with the project. I guess as
we outlined in our opening remarks, there's going to be one kind of in the spring of 2014 that will cover, I think through
2013. And then we'll – through March of 2013. And then expenditures beyond March of 2013 to in-service we'll have
another prudence review on that. But that's always been the case.

guess I was wrong.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: I suspect that probably isn't true for anything in the utility industry.
<Q - Andrew S. Levi>: Fair enough. And then just a last question on Southern Power.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah.
<Q - Andrew S. Levi>: Anything that you end up doing, whether it's down in Texas or outside of your Southern
footprint would be contracted, right? We're not talking any type of merchant type...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah. I said that before, we don't believe in the merchant model, we think it doesn't serve
customer's interest in the long run and our business model, remember is long-term bilaterals, creditworthy
counterparties, no transmission or fuel risk, things like that. We're going to stay on that case. That's why we haven't
done a lot of deals. Like I said, there's lots of stuff for sale and we kick every tire we see, but we're very disciplined in
what we're doing. So the lack of spending and buying projects at Southern Power is not because they aren't out there;
it's because we don't like what we see.

Our next question comes from the line of Ashar Khan with Visium. Please proceed with your question.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Ashar.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: Hi, good afternoon, Tom. I had two questions. One is a factual question, going to page eight of the
earnings package. And this shows the financial overview of earnings as reported by each subsidiary for year-to-date as
well as quarter-to-date. And I'm focusing on Mississippi Power. Just wanted to make sure I'm doing my numbers
correctly. Year-to-date the net income is $115 million, and I add back nearly $48 million write-offs, it's $163 million, I
guess prior to the write-off for 2012 year-to-date. And then if I take the 2013 year-to-date I'm adding $704 million to
the negative $490 million, I get to $214 million. So am I correct, Mississippi Power, the earnings are up year-to-date
about $50 million versus I guess everyone else is flat or down? But am I correct in my interpretation that there's a $50
million improvement in Mississippi Power earnings year-to-date?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, I believe you are. It's mostly AFUDC, once you net out all the ex-items that you
mentioned.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: Okay, okay. And then Tom, I just wanted to get, as you have kind of mentioned strategically,
you're looking into the next decade in terms of growth and all that. One thing, when you were the CFO, in your CFO
role in the later half of the last decade, one thing which was very clear about Southern was – and you propagated and I
guess you guys still do, was risk-adjusted returns being very, very superior.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: What I'm trying to understand is that as you guys were kind of like planning for this decade,
where did the miss come that why did – I mean it seems like what's hurting is that you started two highly risky projects
at the same time. So I'm just trying to see what – did the management review that in terms of what you guys were in
taking on such two risky projects all at the same time as to why that didn't come into the mind? Because now we are

suffering from that risk adjusted. We've become a much more riskier company as the implementation is going through.
So I just wanted to understand, did those things come into mind? Or what drove the decisions to pursue two projects
simultaneously at the same time?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: There are days I ask myself that I suppose, gee-whiz, you have to put yourself in the
context of the time in which those decisions were made. I think management at that time felt that there was pretty
robust growth. A lot of the planning and all that occurred before the downturn in the economy and we were seeing
pretty robust growth and so we have always felt about the broad portfolio, we felt that the nuclear program, which is
actually going exceedingly well had the right supports in place to make it effective. And so my sense is around Vogtle
3 and 4, it's a terrific project, it's going along terrifically, we've had terrific support, support by the Governor, the PSC,
the Legislature, the General Assembly in Georgia, the Administration in Washington, Congress, Vogtle's going great.
The only kind of black cloud here is Kemper. And I have said many times that while we are very proud of the
technology that we developed along with our partner KBR, remember originally Kemper, that technology was going to
get built in Orlando, but it was going to get built without CCS, when we moved it to Mississippi we combined CCS
with enhanced oil recovery. And we made a strategic mistake back then; we committed to do the deal with a price cap
without enough engineering being done. That would be my sense of it.
Recall also the state of Mississippi within an interesting position to where failing to do Kemper County would have
subjected them about, I forgot what the number would be, 70% to 90% of gas for their electricity generation and from a
public policy standpoint, I think the regulators in Mississippi didn't want to have that much volatility of energy
production tied up in that fuel resource. There was a host of issues, but if you think going forward, how well Vogtle
was going, we definitely have taken our shots on Kemper. I think when you consider all of the efforts in Alabama, all
of the other efforts in Georgia outside of Vogtle, all of what's going on in Gulf and really the work in Mississippi
outside of Kemper.
Southern is that Southern was. We continue to deliver value to customers every day, price, reliability, customer service.
And I think if you want that underscored, it is the notion that our customer value numbers have been terrific for a long
time, we are the top four among the companies we survey. I don't think Southern – I think Southern is going to be fine
in the long run; it's just getting through Kemper is the issue.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes. You got it exactly right.
<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: And then on – I'm trying to understand on – for Mississippi Power, given the $1 billion plus
of write-offs, obviously that would have a big impact, I would imagine, on the equity and their capital structure. How
do you account for that in the rate-making process, given that your shareholders are taking the brunt of those
write-offs? Would you use like an imputed capital structure? For rate making purposes, how would your capital
structure, the equity in your capital structure be elevated?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: The equity is – the equity here has already taken place and we will replace the equity as
we finance the additional capital that we're investing in Kemper. So the additional $1.1 billion will be financed with a
portion of equity from Southern and it will help restore by the end of 2014 their equity ratio to about a 50% or so level.
<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: So you won't try to do an imputed capital structure. You'll just use whatever happens to be
even with that hit that was basically taken by the shareholders for coming up with the cost of capital for rate-making,
you're saying?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's correct.

you're going to have over and above maintenance CapEx and everything like that and that might be available? Because

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Dynamite. How are you?
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Managing. Just wanted to sort of follow up on Kemper. Just I know that there's always a
disclaimer and everything. But there was this discussion there about some uncertainty associated with what could
happen with future expenses, cost overruns, what have you. Can you give us sort of just any sort of flavor as to how
you feel about that now with the latest update that you've given us?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes, the numbers we've given you are based on everything, every piece of information
that we know right now. Essentially the information we've given you is consistent with the information that we've
suggested in the past, that any schedule change is worth about $15 million to $25 million, if you just want to do – I
always love kind of dumb math, simple math. $15 million to $20 million a month if you go six-month times $25
million to the $150 million and we've retained in light of that $100 million of contingencies. That's how you get to
where we are. Of the $150 million there's still $100 million of contingency in there.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. But I mean in terms of just qualitatively speaking, one would think as time goes on and
as you guys sort of reach certain milestones and what have you, that the uncertainty level would go down. Do you see
them sort of staying, I mean...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Sure.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: ...sometimes maybe not, maybe like you uncover something, you say, well actually it's not what
– that's what I'm trying to get feel for?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: I'm sorry, yes; I see what you are saying. Yes the risk should start converging. So clearly
now the risks are moving away from construction, because we're converging on the completion of construction and the
risks are shifting more to start-up risks. And as we have said on the prior calls, I know, several calls the big start-up risk
goes to I think the integration of the instrumentation and control environment at Kemper. Recall, we have an electricity
island, we had a gasification, we have a gas handling system. And so that's kind of what big risk I think in start-up will
involve. Now we're doing everything prudent in our power to anticipate that environment, we model; we already have
teams in teams in place to assess it. But that's probably is how the risk moves. So clearly construction risk is
converging maybe you got a start-up risk.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And then in terms of sales growth and EPS growth, and I know that you're not going to
give us really anything until January. If I understand you guys correctly, you're giving sort of this qualitatively how it
may flow through in the next couple of years just from a very general kind of concept, as opposed to specifics. I assume
that's correct. I mean there is no way – I'm not going to be able to get out of you sort of any relative numbers, is that
correct?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: That's correct.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay, just wanted to check. So is it potential that you might actually also reassess the long-term
sales growth at that point in time? Or is that sort of a separate issue? It's more of a CapEx issue that you guys are
looking at or in terms of O&M, things other than sales growth that will be making sort of the determination as to what
you guys will be providing us in January.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: We do the whole thing Paul, we start with the low forecast and then we put every piece
together after that. So it's an annual process as we go through.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: But it's all package, it's all together.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: So it's all that – so everything's really actually reviewed.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yes. Oh, sure. Oh, sure.

<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And so we'll see what happens. Okay. Thanks so much. All my other questions have
been asked.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Thank you.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Take care, guys.
Operator
At this time, there are no further questions. Sir, are there any closing remarks?
Thomas A. Fanning
Yes. I just want to say, thank you so much for your attendance on the call. We went over a lot of interesting territory.
It's a little unusual for us to talk about kind of longer term performance. But since it's been such an interesting topic that
many of you are writing about, we felt that it was a good things to kind of highlight. We continue to work hard and
making Kemper as successfully as it can be. We feel confident in our ability to execute there. Everything else at
Southern is going well. When you look at Alabama, Georgia, Gulf, the rest of the Mississippi when you look at our
fundamentals, Southern is performing as well as it ever had. We got to get Kemper build and operational and we'll be in
great shape. We thank you so much for your attendance this afternoon and look forward to talking with you soon in
Florida. Take care.
Operator
Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Southern Company third quarter 2013's earnings call.
