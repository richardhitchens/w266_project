Richard K. Davis
Thank you, Sean. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call. I'll begin our review of U.S. Bank's
results with a summary of the quarter's highlights on Page 3 of the presentation.
U.S. Bank reported net income of $1.4 billion for the first quarter of 2014 or $0.73 per diluted common share. Total
average loans grew year-over-year by 6% and as expected 1.3% or 5.2% annualized on a linked-quarter basis. We
experienced strong loan growth and strong growth in total average deposits of 5.1% over the prior year and 0.2% linked
quarter. Credit quality remained strong. Total net charge-offs decreased by 21.2% from the prior year and rose
modestly on a linked-quarter basis, as expected, due to the unusually high wholesale recoveries in the prior quarter.
Non-performing assets, excluding covered assets, declined linked-quarter by 1%.
We continue to generate significant capital this quarter. Our common equity tier 1 capital ratio estimated for the Basel
III fully-implemented standardized approach was 9% at March 31. We repurchased 12 million shares of common stock
during the first quarter, which along with our dividend resulted in a 67% return of earnings to our shareholders in the
first quarter. Slide 4 provides you with a five quarter history of our performance metrics, and they continue to be
among the best in the industry. Return on average assets in the first quarter was 1.56%. And return on average common
equity was 14.6%.
Moving over to the graph on the right. You can see that this quarter's net interest margin was 3.35%. Andy will discuss
the margin in more detail in just a few minutes. Our efficiency ratio for the first quarter was 52.9%. We continue to
manage our operating expenses effectively and in line with revenue trends. We expect that this ratio will remain in the
low 50s% going forward, and as we continue to manage expenses in relation to revenue trends while continuing to
invest in and grow our businesses.
Turning to Slide 5. The company reported total net revenue in the first quarter of $4.8 billion, a 1.2% decrease from the
prior year and a 1.5% decrease from the previous quarter. The decline in revenue year-over-year was largely driven by
lower mortgage banking revenue while the linked quarter variance reflected normal first-quarter seasonality within our
business lines. Average loan and deposit growth is summarized on Slide 6. Average total loans outstanding increased
by over $13 billion or 6% year-over-year and 1.3% linked quarter. Overall, excluding covered loans and run-off
portfolio, average total loans grew by 7.6% year-over-year and 1.7% linked quarter.
Once again, the increase in average loans outstanding was supported by strong growth in average total commercial
loans which grew by 8.5% year-over-year and 2.8% over the prior quarter. Total average commercial real estate also
increased over the prior quarters with average loans growing by 7.6% year-over-year and 1.9% linked quarter.
Residential real estate loans continued to show strong growth, 14.4% year-over-year and 1.7% over the prior quarter.
Within the retail loan category, average credit card loans and auto loans and leases were higher both year-over-year and
linked quarter. While average home equity lines and loans continued to decline. The rate of decline in this category,
however, has shown considerably – slowed considerably over the past few quarters.
We continue to originate and renewed new loans and lines for our customers. New originations excluding mortgage
production plus new and renewed commitments total approximately $35 billion in the first quarter. Total average
revolving commercial and commercial real estate commitments continue to grow at a faster pace than loans, increasing
year-over-year by 11.7% and 3.4% on a linked-quarter basis. Line utilization remains at low levels and was
approximately 23% in the first quarter. Total average deposits increased by over $12 billion or 5.1% over the same
quarter of last year. On a linked-quarter basis, average deposits increased by 0.2%, with growth in low-cost savings
deposits particularly strong on the linked-quarter basis.
Turning to Slide 7 and credit quality. Total net charge-offs declined 21.2% on a year-over-year basis and rose modestly
on a linked-quarter basis due to unusually high wholesale recoveries in the prior quarter. The ratio of net charge-offs to
average loans outstanding was 0.59% in the first quarter. Non-performing assets, excluding covered assets, decreased
by 1% on a linked quarter basis and 11.6% from the first quarter of 2013. During the first quarter, we released $35
million of reserves. Equal to the reserve release in the previous quarter and $5 million more than the first quarter of
2013. Given the mix and quality of our portfolio, we currently expect net charge-offs and total non-performing assets to

remain relatively stable in the second quarter of 2014.
Andy will now give you a few more details about our first quarter results.
Andrew J. Cecere
Thanks, Richard. Slide 8 gives you a view of our first quarter 2014 versus comparable time periods. Our diluted EPS of
$0.73 was equal to the first quarter of 2013 and $0.03 lower than the previous quarter. The key drivers of the
company's first quarter earnings are summarized on Slide 9. The $31 million or 2.2% decrease in net income
year-over-year was principally due to a decrease in mortgage banking revenue, partially offset by lower provision for
credit losses. Net interest income was essentially flat year-over-year as increases in average-earning assets was offset
by a decrease in net interest margin.
The $12.2 billion growth in average earning assets year-over-year included increases in average total loans as well as
planned increases in the securities portfolio. Offsetting a portion of the growth in these categories was a $6.1 billion
reduction in average loans held for sale, reflecting lower mortgage origination activity versus the same quarter of last
year, and a $3.8 billion reduction in average other earning assets, primarily due to the deconsolidation of a number of
community development entities in the second quarter of 2013. The net interest margin of 3.35% was 13 basis points
lower than the first quarter of 2013. Primarily due to growth in the investment portfolio and lower rates on loans,
partially offset by lower rates in deposits and short-term borrowings and a reduction of higher-cost, long-term debt.
Non-interest income declined by $57 million or 2.6% year-over-year primarily due to lower mortgage banking revenue
which reflected lower origination and sales revenue. Growth in several fee categories partially offset the decline in
mortgage banking revenue, including growth in retail payments, merchant processing, trust and investment
management fees, deposit service charges, commercial products revenue, investment product fees, and other income
which was driven by higher equity investment revenue.
Non-interest expense increased year-over-year by $74 million or 3%. The increase was primarily the result of higher
compensation expense and an increase in other expense which was driven by insurance related recoveries in the first
quarter of 2013, partially offset by lower tax-advantaged project costs and lower costs related to other real estate
owned. Net income was lower on a linked quarter basis by $59 million or 4.1%, mainly due to seasonally lower fee
revenue partially offset by lower non-interest expense.
On a linked quarter basis net interest income was lower due to the impact of two fewer days and seasonally lower loan
fees, partially offset by higher average earning assets. The net interest margin of 3.35% was 5 basis points lower than
the fourth quarter, principally due to growth in lower rate investment securities, loan mix and lower loan fees. On a
linked quarter basis, non-interest income was lower by $48 million or 2.2%. This unfavorable variance was primarily
due to seasonally lower retail payments and deposit service charges, as well as lower commercial products revenue.
Partially offsetting the decline in these revenue categories was an increase in corporate payments, trust and investment
management fees and other income which was driven by higher equity investment in retail leasing revenue. On a linked
quarter basis, non-interest expense declined by $138 million, or 5.1%, driven by lower professional services costs, costs
related to tax-advantaged products and marketing and business development costs.
Turning to Slide 10, our capital position is strong and continues to grow. Beginning January 1, 2014, the regulatory
capital requirements effective for the company follow Basel III subject to certain transition provisions from Basel I
over the next four years to fully implementation by January 1, 2018. Our common equity tier 1 capital ratio, estimated
using Basel III fully implemented standardized approach at March 31, was 9%, up from 8.8% at December 31. At 9%,
we are well above the 7% Basel III minimum requirement.
Our tangible book value per share rose to $14.99 at March 31, representing a 13% increase over the same quarter of last
year and a 4% increase over the prior quarter. In March, we received the results of our 2014 comprehensive capital
assessment and review, the CCAR, including the Federal Reserve's non-objection to our capital plan. Subsequently, we
announced our new one year buyback authorization totaling $2.3 billion effective April 1 and our intention to

recommend to our Board of Directors a 6.5% increase in our common stock dividend at our June board meeting.
Now, I'll turn the call back to Richard.
Richard K. Davis
Thanks, Andy. And to conclude our formal remarks, I turn your attention to Slide 12, Extending the Advantage, words
from the cover of our Annual Report that appropriately describe our strategy for 2014. In this slow growth economy,
our prudent risk management, efficient operating platform and industry leading profitability allow us to operate from a
position of strength. We will continue to manage, invest and innovate to further extend this advantage.
Yesterday I had the privilege of leading our annual shareholder meeting in Kansas City. In addition to conducting the
official business of the meeting, I told our shareholders how proud I am of what our 67,000 remarkable employees have
accomplished and how engaged they are in helping us to continue our success. We remain focused on always
producing consistent, predictable and repeatable results for the benefit of our customers, our employees, our
communities and our shareholders.
That concludes our formal remarks. Andy, Bill and I would now be happy to answer questions from the audience.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jon Arfstrom of RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hey, Jon.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hey, Jon.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: Richard, can you give us an update on some of your loan growth expectations and maybe
touch a little bit on if there's any changes in terms of what is driving some of the commercial growth?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: I'll be happy to. Thanks, Jon. First of all, as you see, our linked quarter was 1.3%, and we
have been saying we're in that range of 1% to 1.5%. Based on our ending period, not just our average and based on
what we're seeing, I'll expect that range to continue into quarter two at the high end. So we're actually seeing some
slight but continued improvement along the way. Now we're seeing it across the board. So wholesale, as you've seen in
the last many quarters, has been driving the majority of that and that continues. Leveraged lending and middle market
remain mostly active, as well as loan growth in the Western markets, particularly the Western United States for
wholesale, and then seasonal increases in food, ag and in the retail groups. So we're seeing seasonality and continued
market share growth, which is not going to be stunning. But at the high end of 1% to 1.5%, that continues to show a
nice trajectory and we think market share improvement.
Commercial real estate, Jon, strong on both coasts, as it has been in the past, both the East and the West as well as
Texas, particularly new construction and some investment decisions being made by some of our customers. The most
active cities are Seattle, San Francisco, L.A., and Orange County, so that stays pretty much West Coast focused.
This quarter, we had strong loan production in small businesses, up almost 30% over last year's first quarter. That's all
types of small business, particularly for those under $250,000, and SBA itself was up more than 50% over last year's
same quarter. So we're seeing small business and, I think, something slightly more than what you might expect to see in
seasonality.
Residential mortgages, we've said, is off from its record highs, but the portfolio continues to grow. Home equity, while
we see that continuing to be the softest spot as we are sliding to get enough acquisition to offset the runoff, we had a

very strong March, which takes me some good hope into the second quarter, particularly as we introduce some new
programs and some pricing in order to encourage that behavior in the spring.
And then lastly, auto loans and credit cards; they're both growing. As you know, we indicated a number of quarters ago
that we were going to double our auto loan production in the indirect auto loan and lease, and we're doing just that.
We're right on track. To give you an idea, our quarter one production for this last quarter was up 33% from the same
time last year, and we continue to see our rankings and market share starting to move, as we hoped they would. And
then credit cards, year-over-year also stronger, credit up 9%, debit up 6%, and prepaid up over 20%. So I would say it
continues to give me optimism that we can stay on the high end of that range and continue to see that getting stronger.
I know last quarter I said the second half would be stronger than the first half. We still believe that as well, and I'll
close with one of my reasons for that belief, is I think the Fed and their current messaging continues to allow people to
believe that we're getting closer and closer to the moment in time when rates will move up, and I think our customers
are starting to demonstrate behavior and getting really prepared for that moment and eventually they will use these
unused lines of credit, they'll use their deposits, and they'll start getting more lines and loans, to I think accommodate
that growth, which is probably a few years out, but may start at the last half of 2014. How's that for a brief answer to a
quick question?
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: That's wonderful. I don't want to hog the time on the call here, but just one more thing. And
maybe it is related, but in terms of the capital plan and the build on your capital ratios and the 60% to 80% range, what
is the plan for the capital that is not returned to shareholders? Do you want to continue to build capital on the balance
sheet? Is this, are you just signaling that maybe there is a little bit faster growth coming, there is more acquisitions
coming? Just help us understand whether or not you want capital to build or not and how you plan to utilize the excess.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hi, Jon. This is Andy. First, if you think about the fourth quarter to the first quarter, part of
the reason for, two reasons for the increase. Number one is our unrealized loss went to an unrealized gain position with
our securities portfolio because of lower rates, and that changed by about $300 million. The second thing is partly
offsetting our buybacks in the first quarter was an exceptionally high level of stock exercise, stock option exercises
from our employee base. I wouldn't expect it to continue at that level. So my expectation, Jon, is that this is sort of the
high point. Our normal earning-asset growth, loan growth that Richard spoke to, as well as our expected closure of the
RBS transaction, the branches will drive that down in quarters two and three, and big picture of what will accommodate
the reinvestment is our earning asset growth.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: And I'll just add, Jon, we don't like to have capital, so we're real careful about that as you
know. And in addition to what Andy said, we want to continue to have a little powder for acquisitions, you saw we did
a small deal with Ally Custodian Trust on Monday, and we'll continue to look for, particularly payment and trust
opportunities and we are still investing a lot. I mean, the one thing we're not doing, and it would be easy to do in times
when everything's not as sustainable, is stop the investment in things like R&D, and our payments business,
particularly mobile, we're spending a lot of time and energy and money making sure that we have the best ideas, the
next new emerging protocol for customers and we're not cutting back on those investments at this stage because we
think it's going to be important to stay true to that. So the retained earnings we'll use for ourselves as well as small
acquisitions.
<Q - Jon G. Arfstrom>: Okay. All right. That helps. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian of Bank of America.

Page 6 of 16
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: My first question, Andy, I was wondering if you could give us an update on where you
stand with regards to the LCR and how we should think about securities purchases from here and maybe help us
understand how earning asset growth is going to pace relative to the loan growth expectations that you laid out?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Right. So, Erika, as we talked about in the last call, we did increase our securities portfolio
from $80 billion to $85 billion in quarter one. My expectation is we will grow that to $90 billion in quarter two. So off
a similar amount, another $5 billion. We're getting very close in terms of our target here but we're – I'm not going to
give you a final number until we get the final rule because the final rule has some uncertainty, particularly as it relates
to the offset on municipal deposits. And that can throw our number one way or the other but we're getting very close
but I would expect another $5 billion in quarter two. As it relates to net interest margin, I would expect a decrease that
you saw this quarter similar in the second quarter for some of the same reasons.
So that $5 billion increase in securities portfolio will probably drive margin down 3 basis points to 4 basis points and a
combination of loan fees and mix will be another couple of basis points. So I would expect a similar decline in quarter
two. However, because we're growing earning assets, I would expect net interest income to grow in quarter two.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: And given sort of your comments, I know there is still a swing factor, is the liquidity built in
the second half potentially slower than the pace for the first half of the year?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Again, Erika, it'll depend on the final rule which we hope to get in the summer months, but I
wouldn't expect it to accelerate certainly and they'll be somewhere around the same level or down. The other thing I'd
remind you, and you know, one of the things we talked about also is that CAA or checking account advance product
will start to impact margins, because that fee goes to loan fees which is a component of margin. That will start to
diminish over the second quarter and then more materially in quarters three and four.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Got it. And my second question, Richard, if I could just ask another one on commercial real
estate in particular, we've had comments from large mega cap banks and large institutions during the quarter that
commercial real estate continues to be a potential bright spot and that the competition is less fervent here than it is for
C&I. On Monday, we heard from another regional bank essentially saying that they are starting to see frostiness in
commercial real estate. Perhaps give us a little bit of your view on this.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yes. Sure. I don't have anything remarkable to offer so I wouldn't necessarily align with
Monday's commentary. We've always been growing commercial real estate. I think you've noticed that. We've done in
a very prudent way. We were the ones I think alerting people eight quarters ago about certain markets that were getting
frothy as it related to multifamily and just start to intersect that with what would be foreclosed properties coming back
onto the markets. We've been very, very careful not to jump in the odd markets that when you predict where they'll be
once everything's built they'll be too overbuilt. So we've been careful there.
I wouldn't say it is any less competitive. I would say all of our wholesale businesses are competitive. We're certainly
seeing margin competition, and as I said every quarter, and I will continue to say because of our cost of funds
advantage and our ratings benefits will continue to compete on price, and we may be one of those culprits for why it's
more competitive on the margin, but we will not give it up. If it's a great customer, we will also not go for the customer
if there's a structural need to diminish what would be a quality underwriting, something like that. So I guess I would
say I don't see anything remarkable about CRE as it relates to other C&I business, Erika, but they're both competitive
and we're prepared to compete for them.
<Q - Erika P. Najarian>: Got it. And just a last question, and maybe this is for Andy, was there anything unusual to
call out on the mortgage banking line? There is a modest quarter-over-quarter increase and given typical seasonality, I
think the market would have expected that to be down sequentially. Was there anything to call out there?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Erika, no. We thought mortgage revenue was going to be relatively flat to the fourth quarter
and that's what it ended up being. We had a little bit of a benefit on the servicing rights effective valuation, but that has
to do with earnings credit rates and so forth. So I would say, no, nothing remarkable, and as I look into the second
quarter, I would expect a slight increase from mortgage revenue principally due to seasonality.

Your next question comes from the line of Jill Glaser of Credit Suisse.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hi, Jill.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Jill.
<Q - Jill E. Glaser>: Hi, good morning. So could you just provide some color in terms of what you are seeing in
securities reinvestment yields and loan yields and just your outlook in terms of the margin going forward? And then
just overall your ability to grow spread income going forward?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Right. So, Jill, the secure – we're going grow the securities portfolio I mentioned about $5
billion on a net basis in quarter two. The securities coming on are about 25 basis points to 30 basis points below those
that are coming off in the quarter, and then we have the $5 billion of growth. So that combination of growth and the
shift in the price or the rate cost us 3 basis points to 4 basis points, and that's the decline we'll see in the second quarter.
And then as I mentioned, the loan mix coupled with the loan fees, partly due to CAA, will be another couple of basis
points. So I would expect us to be down 5 basis points or 6 basis points in the second quarter. However, as I mentioned,
net interest income should grow because of earning asset growth.
<Q - Jill E. Glaser>: Okay. Great. Thanks.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: You bet.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Miller of FBR.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Yes. Thank you very much. You mentioned on the first question, a follow-up, the cities that are
the most – that are growing the most. I missed them all. You said them too fast. It was Seattle, Orange County --.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, I only say them once, Paul. [indiscernible] (24:15). No, I said Seattle, San Francisco,
Los Angeles, Orange County. So I went right down the Pacific coastline there.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And so can you add some color what you are seeing in Texas and in the Midwest?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, so Texas is also the other market that I mentioned. These are markets where you've
got just underlying growth of populations and consumerism. Right? So in Texas, you're going to find some of the
traditional markets building out where the communities are getting larger and the sprawl continues. And Texas has
been healthy, as you know, virtually through this whole period in time. The West Coast primarily provides for what
would be some of the transition to multifamily, where we feel that those are safe markets based on the competition of
dwellings, and also just the continued growth and migration in some of those growth markets, where we see the
personal and corporate needs for real estate continue to be pretty strong. We haven't spent a lot of time and energy

first quarter, but you continue to show good growth in there. Could you add color around that? Is that a big push for
you guys?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, it is. And it's a big part of our portfolio. It's like 7.5% which is one of the reasons why
our charge-offs will always settle at a number higher than most of our peers. I don't think anyone has a portfolio as
important as we do to our mix. And we like it, so we're going continue to grow it. I think you know that we have a
FlexPerks program which was a derivative of when we lost the Northwest Airlines program. And it's the most
remarkable thing I'll have ever been a part of in my career when I'm done here. It continues to provide all kinds of new
interest, and we continue to get awards for it. So it gets a lot of visibility without having to spend a lot of time on TV
commercials and direct branding.
That brings me to the branch originations. With 3,100 branches, we really had not turned up the opportunity for that to
be a significant source of really good high-quality new cards. But we've done that in the last six quarters, and that's
been a remarkable contributor to the kind of growth we've had. And then lastly, Paul, I'll just remind you even in our
FlexPerks, which I mentioned a moment ago, we've now introduced a corporate program, a FlexPerks rewards program
for corporate cards which continue now to gain a lot of favor as we realize that a lot of these corporate and small
business folks are interested in finding a way to retrieve some sort of benefit from using a card. And that's taken
amazing success in the early stages, so I think there's more where that came from as well.
But to say that we're spending time and energy on credit card is an understatement for me to go back and repeat that
part of our R&D costs have been protected under the area of cards not present, which would be mobile banking and
mobile payments. We're spending a lot of energy there, too. So I would expect us to exceed most of our peers going
forward in an area where we're spending a due amount of money to make sure that we stay ahead of the game.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And then one last on the auto side, that's an area that you've really done a nice job growing. How
is the competitive nature there? How are you – because everybody is focused on that, but I think you are doing the best
job out there of anybody.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thank you. The indirect auto business for us has always been, of course, capability. But as
you'll recall, when we announced our doubling impact over a couple years, we decided to move a little further down in
the FICO, so to the, we'll call it, the near prime. But we also realized that we weren't a big player in used autos. So I'll
just take you through an example. If you, Paul, are the F&I guy at the largest Chevy dealer in whatever city, you've
always known that we were one of the best paper to pick for auto loans or leases for new cars. And now that we've
introduced used cars, you feel better about introducing the U.S. Bank paper across all spectrums. And then, the bonus
round is you get more floor planning from that same institution, because you're now wholly committed to them in a
number of ways that perhaps you weren't before. So for us, it's kind of a two-fer or three-fer, but we're also getting a
high visibility of those dealers finding interest in taking the rest of our paper. So we already are taking an open door
and pushing it further open.
I will tell you that in the rankings we saw in fourth quarter, we've moved up 1.5% in share from eighth place to fifth
place among banks. And so, that does reflect that our early-stage efforts are starting to show up, and I would expect us
to stay in the top five, which was one of our stated goals, as we really double the value of this business. We're very
careful. I didn't say sub-prime. I mean, clearly, I just said something slightly below near prime, but we're going to get a
lot of that and used autos as well. So I think that's the reason you're seeing a full-on kind of a holistic success, and I
expect this to be one of our big replacement strategies for what will be a new normal for mortgage in the next couple of
years.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Hey. Thank you very much, guys.

Your next question comes from the line of Keith Murray of ISI.
<Q - Keith A. Murray>: Thank you.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Keith.
<Q - Keith A. Murray>: Good morning. Can you just touch on the expense outlook and – obviously near term, I'd be
interested in that, but longer term, when you think about the age of compliance that we are in and compliance costs
going up, over the long term, do you think the efficiency ratio – where does it bottom in the 50s% versus history?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yes. So first of all, Keith, I'm glad you asked the question. I probably would have found a
way to ask it myself, which I've been known to do. So, thank you. First of all, in the near-term, let's talk about – I'll
remind the audience how we manage the company. Every single 30 days, every of 68 lines of business sit with me and
Andy and we look at their current performance. We look at their near-term forecast, and we always look at the rest of
whatever year we're under. So we created a phrase around here called looking around corners. And we pride ourselves
on that. And as we look around the corner, we continue to measure and manage what starts out as a profit plan at the
beginning of the year, and we adjust it all through the year.
And so, as we see any stress on revenue, and it could be not so much on volume but it might be on margins and on total
income, then we're going to manage the same thing on expenses. So we manage expenses 30 days at a time. And we are
watching every nickel and dime, and it's not without surprise to you that we are very, very prudent right now. We're
watching all discretionary costs. We're measuring it very closely. We're watching all new hires and we're being
excessively prudent right now, because until I see a sustained and a very robust revenue future, we're going to be very
careful. And we're actually watching our expenses to a level below we thought they would be when we set the plan six
months ago. So, hopefully that gives you all confidence that we know how to watch that.
Secondly, the efficiency ratio is nothing more than a result of positive operating leverage; and we promised you
positive operating leverage this year, and we're going to deliver it. Not easy, but that's the whole part of watching the
expenses so that they stay below the revenue growth that we're both seeing and predicting. So you will find as long as
we keep to that mandate, then our efficiency ratio stays in the low 50s% because that's how the math works. We don't
have a goal for our efficiency ratio, but because our goal is positive operating leverage and we're sitting at low 50s%,
you can well bet that, not on a given quarter but over the course of the year, we're going to stay in that position as well.
You want to go longer-term? The Richard Davis view of things is as rates start to increase as the economy starts to pick
up we become essentially much more profitable and our expenses do not grow at the same speed as our revenue and
our efficiency ratio probably does fall. But it will only be [ph] result (31:54). There's no target. There's no goal. But I
think what you see now is probably one of our least attractive moments in time, and the cost of compliance has, for all
intents and purposes, been fully burdened and mostly what you see now as we continue to look into the future with a
new kind of normal for the cost of compliance and audit.
<Q - Keith A. Murray>: Thank you.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: I'm really excited. [indiscernible] (32:13)
<Q - Keith A. Murray>: And just going back to LCR for a second, does it at all change your view on commercial
deposits and how you view them going forward?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: No. It does impact how we think about different deposits in the company. And depending
upon the LCR runoff assumption, certain deposits are certainly more valuable. We try to reflect that in our pricing.
We've actually incorporated LCR into our FTP system, or Funds Transfer Pricing System. And different deposits have
different value, and that is a function of LCR and we're taking that into account.
<Q - Keith A. Murray>: And then, just last one. I know it is early stages, but any update on reworking the deposit
advance product and what are the steps that you'd have to go through on that?

<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yes, we're working on it. We're working particularly with our lead regulator, the OCC. But
we haven't got a solution yet, inasmuch as we're all trying to figure out what's the next best thing to try. If you follow
the real tight balance of the usury laws of some 30 some percent of total APR, no matter how you calculate it on any
given one day, you probably can't find a product out there that's going to meet the old fashioned test. So depending on
the willingness of the regulators to allow us to try different combinations of new products and new repayment
practices, I know they're working in good faith with a number of us to try to find that solution.
I've made it clear that U.S. Bank is happy to pilot and try certain variations on a program to see what kind of loan-loss
we would have, offset it against some of the benefits. I do think this industry needs a replacement for folks who have
some form of advanced need on financials before they get their pay, but we haven't struck gold on that one yet, and
with a number of us working with our regulators, I think it's in the offing but it won't be here as soon as our CAA
products starts to wind down. So we'll have a bit of a gap. And when it does come back it will be the same level of
profitability. It will be much more of a CRA kind of a program that will be intended to test and find ways to serve more
customers as its recovery starts to take effect.

Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies.
<Q - Bryan Batory>: Hi. Good morning, guys. This is Bryan Batory from Ken's team.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Bryan.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hi, Bryan.
<Q - Bryan Batory>: Hey. The tax rate was a little bit lower than the previous guide last quarter. Just wondering if
there was anything unusual that ran through the tax line this quarter, and where do you expect the tax rate to run going
forward from here?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: It was a little lower, Bryan, you're right and part of it is due to a small state settlement that
we had in the quarter. So the TEB effective rate was 28.1%. However, I don't expect a large variation for the rest of the
year and I would expect it to be somewhere around 28.5% to 28.7% for the full year. So right around this range a little
higher but not much.
<Q - Bryan Batory>: Okay, great. And then deposits are continuing to grow on a year-over-year basis, but the growth
was a little bit slower quarter-over-quarter looking at the averages and period-end balances, particularly for not
non-interest-bearing. Are we starting to see the very early signs here of customers drawing deposit funds to fund
working capital needs or CapEx or was there just a seasonality impact on deposits this quarter?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Bryan, it was more a seasonality impact. We typically have a lower first quarter, both
because of our corporate trust activities as well as wholesale activities in the first quarter, so I don't think it's yet to the
point that they're drawing down the deposits for investment. I think it's more seasonality and I would expect it to
increase in the second quarter.
<Q - Bryan Batory>: Okay. And one final question, the other fee income line was a little bit higher than trend. I know
you guys called out equity investment gains and some leasing items. Any sense for how big the magnitude of those
gains were?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: If there anything's greater than $20 million or $25 million, we usually call it out specifically.
So it's more a function of a number of smaller things and that can be lumpy in that category. While we're talking about
that category, let me bring up one item. You may have read on Monday that Nuveen was a part of the transaction with

TIAA-CREF. And we have an ownership interest in Nuveen. When it's all said and done, that will result in a positive in
the fourth quarter for us. As is typical in asset management transaction, there are components of revenue retention and
customer retention that will determine the final price. But as we sit today, I would expect that would create a gain of a
few cents in the fourth quarter.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: You'll recall we divested our First American Funds though two years ago.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: 2010.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah. And that went to Nuveen which gave us an equity position and now this transaction
will positively affect us late in the year.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scinicariello of UBS.
<Q - Stephen Scinicariello>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hi, Steve.
<Q - Stephen Scinicariello>: Just a couple quick questions on the fee income areas. Just want to follow up on the
commercial products revenue. I know you kind of mentioned you had some lower wholesale transaction activity. Just
kind of curious has that kind of since rebounded or what might the outlook be from here?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Right. Steve, so it's a function of a couple of things. One, standby letter of credit activity is
down and that has been trending down for the past few quarters. I would expect it to continue to be flat to down in the
second quarter. Second, there's some syndication revenue in that line that can be lumpy and the first quarter was
particularly down. That may come back a little bit in the second quarter. But generally speaking, the commercial
products revenue is a function of activity on the wholesale side. First quarter is typically low. It'll come back a bit in the
second quarter but I still think certain components like standbys and letter of credits are going to continue to trend
downward.
<Q - Stephen Scinicariello>: Got you. And then just I know there is seasonality in a lot of the card lines, the deposit
lines and some other areas. Any reason why those wouldn't bounce back as well or is it just purely seasonal, this
dipdown this quarter?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: So for sure the payments component is weakest in the first quarter across most of the
categories, and I would expect that to continue to balance in the second quarter. Deposit surcharge is also lower in the
first quarter but a lot of that is also driven by incidents and activity on the retail side. So all things being equal, we
would expect a bit of an increase in the second quarter but it will depend on customer and retail activity.
<Q - Stephen Scinicariello>: Perfect. Thank you so much.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Sure.

<Q - Brian D Foran>: Hi, good morning. Can you – I guess if you separate your footprint into the cold weather bit and
the warm weather bit, was the trajectory month-by-month noticeably different? And to the extent the cold weather part
of the footprint was weaker, by the end of March, was it kind of back to a normal level?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: We really didn't. It sounds so popular to say but we really didn't see much. I mean even the
Pacific Southwest where you have the more traditional winter and the lack of snow and things wasn't meaningfully
different than the Central and Midwest plains that we do banking in. So, while there was undoubtedly some
diminishment of consumer activity on those really bad snow events, but for a little of that, we're not counting on
weather to be much of a factor. And we certainly don't see a big pent-up, catch-up, kind of like the Cash for Clunkers,
we don't see that occurring here.
<Q - Brian D Foran>: And then on the payments business, you had a couple of comments that seems more positive.
We've been through a kind of transition period first with the regulatory changes, then with the Department of Defense. I
mean, are we at a point now where we hit that turning point and certainly the comps are easier, but the growth rate kind
of returns back to normal or there's still kind of identifiable headwinds that you see in the near term that would depress
results across those four line items?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Well, Brian, we are seeing the decrease in defense and government spending go down, so
while it was still down year-over-year, it was down a far lesser amount, it was down maybe 5% or 6%, and it was offset
by increased corporate activity, which actually resulted in corporate payment systems revenue being up on a
year-over-year basis, which is a positive sign. So I think we've seen the worst of it, and I think it will start to stabilize
and grow.
<Q - Brian D Foran>: If I could sneak in one last one on the dividend targets long term, you have always been very
consistent about this, but if you could just remind us both from your standpoint and a regulatory standpoint what would
have to happen for the environment to look like a 40% dividend payout instead of the 31%?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yes. This is Richard. We have always – God, we've said it since the mid-1990s, 30% to 40%
would be in dividends, and 30% to 40% in buyback, and we're relying more on the buyback at this stage. Two things,
Brian. One is with or without the Fed oversight, we're going be very prudent and careful to make sure that everything
we do is sustainable under any circumstance, stress test or not. And so the 30% on the low-end of that 30% to 40% per
dividend, and I believe in the next few years we will either get permission, real comfortable permission to do whatever
we want in that range, or we'll start seeing such a robustly strong 24-quarter or 24-month future that we'll move over
that number, because we'd like to be above 30%, but we wouldn't get above 40% so it's going to be that slow trip
somewhere in the middle.
Buybacks in the meantime are a very elegant solution to allow us to have that kind of permission to, as long as the price
is right and the financials are right to allow our shareholders to still get a good return, but giving us that ability to turn
on and off something given the uncertainty until we see things being more, I think, sustained. So we're not disappointed
where we are. All things told, we would get there in a nice slow methodical way anyway, and I think our expectations
would probably align pretty well with what the Fed will permit us to do as we continue to prove ourselves and prove
our stress test to be accurate, now with five years in a row. So we'll get there over time, but we're not feeling withheld
and we don't really want to send a signal that we're disappointed.

<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: How are you?
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: I'm doing well, thanks. Andy, I had a quick question back on the mortgage side of the
house. And I'm looking at page 40 and it kind of gives a nice breakdown between the origination, loan servicing and
some of the inputs on the servicing asset. The one item I was kind of looking at is the decay, the other changes in
mortgage servicing rights, fair value. That's been running plus or minus $100 million – excuse me – running at a
negative plus or minus $100 million for last several quarters and this quarter, it was down into the $80 million range.
I'm assuming that that decay is less than previous quarters because prepayment speeds have slowed. First of all, is that
correct?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yes. That's correct.
<Q - Chris M. Mutascio>: And then is that – I guess it is hard to predict clearly, but if the rates were to stay where
they are, and not even inch up on the long-term side, how would I look at the decay? Would it stabilize at a negative
$80 million or does it get lower from here?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: It all depends on rates, as you just mentioned, because of prepayments. But I would expect
to be stable to maybe up a little bit depending upon what rates do from this level.

Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom of SunTrust Robinson.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Eric.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hi, Eric.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Hi, good morning. Just to follow-up on a few different issues that have been raised on the
call already, the decline in the credit and debit card revenue that you showed sequentially is a bit more than what some
of your peers have demonstrated. And I would have guessed that weather effects might have been part of that, but it
seems like maybe weather wasn't such a driver. So I'm just curious about what, in your view, might have explained that
differential versus peers?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: I can't speak to the peers, but our number on a sequential basis is entirely seasonality if you
think about our credit card – retail credit card revenue. If you look at it year-over-year, we're up over 11%, principally
driven by increased activity and increased market share gains. So the linked quarter is all seasonality.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Got it. And then, just to go back to Keith's question on the payday advance for a moment, I
believe that you previously guided to a quarterly impact of around $50 million negative in NII. Is that the case and was
that evidenced in this period?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: We did have a decline across the – as expected, I would say. So across all of our fee
categories, I would say, yeah, it was as expected. So on the payday lending or on the CAA product, the full year
number is about $220 million. The first quarter was little impact. The second quarter is going to be down, call it, $15
million. Then it goes almost entirely away in quarters three and four.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Yeah, it goes bright-line at the end of May, so we just see a small, slow trip down to zero as
the year ages.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Got it. So – sorry, Andy, just because I was making quick notes there, that was very little
first quarter, $15 million second and then sort of phased out by third?

Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell of Wells Fargo.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Good morning, Matt.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hi, Matt.
<Q - Jason E. Harbes>: Hey, good morning, guys. It's actually Jason Harbes on Matt's team.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Hi, Jason.
<Q - Jason E. Harbes>: So it looks like you got a pretty nice boost from equity investments and retail leasing revenue
in the other fee income category this quarter. Just curious how sustainable do you view that and are you guys still
expecting overall fee income growth in 2014 in spite of the weaker contribution from mortgage?
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: So, Jason, a couple of things. In that other category, there are miscellaneous equity gains
that occur that can be lumpy quarter-to-quarter; so, sometimes up, sometimes down. This was a little bit of a positive
quarter as we benefited a little bit from those investments. We really don't know what the next quarters will be until we
get the results from the investments that we have, so it's hard to tell exactly. But I wouldn't expect material changes,
neither up nor down, other than the gain I talked about that we expect in the fourth quarter from the Nuveen
transaction. So that's number one.
Number two, in terms of overall fee revenue, we're going to continue to have the headwind on a year-over-year basis in
mortgage banking in quarter two because the decline in mortgage banking didn't really start last year until quarters
three and four. But I would expect fee growth in many of the other categories, and I would expect overall fee growth in
quarters three and four once we're past that mortgage headwind.
<Q - Jason E. Harbes>: Okay, thanks. And just, I guess my follow-up would be on the impact of the affordable
housing accounting rule change and specifically how we should be thinking about the noncontrolling interest line. It
looks like that's a little bit of a different number than we've seen historically.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Yes. And that was a function of the change we made in the fourth quarter. I would say the
first quarter is back to a normal level across all categories. And the first quarter impact versus the fourth quarter was
about $35 million lower non-interest expense and $35 million higher taxes. But that's now in the run rate. And what
you see the first quarter now reflects all the accounting changes and what you should expect to see in future quarters.
So the only change you'll see for us is really volume related, no more accounting.
<Q - Jason E. Harbes>: Okay. Thanks, guys.
<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Sure.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thanks, Jason.

<A - Andrew J. Cecere>: Hi, Dan.
<Q - Dan Werner>: Hi. If I had asked you guys a year and a half, two years ago what a normalized net charge-off
level was, you would've said around 1%, and clearly, since then, asset quality has improved and charge-off levels have
come down. If I asked you that question now, what would you consider normalized charge-off levels, both near term
and longer term, what kind of answer would I get?
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Long-term – I'm going to let Bill answer, but long-term is still 1%. On the mix of the
portfolio, it's hard to remember the old divisional days, right, because we're all extending credit at the right level and
we're taking the appropriate measured risk, especially with the credit card portfolio at the level ours is and the kind of
business that we will plan to conduct in the consumer areas. One percent would be over the long term. You're actually
never at 1%. You're passing through it one way or the other. Based on the math of credit measurements and credit
quality, it could take a number of years to get to the 1%. And so, we're not taking risk today to get there sooner than we
should, but we're also not trying to diminish what value we get from having a 59 basis point. But Bill is...
<A - P. W. Parker>: Yeah, so, Dan, we remeasure that every quarter, and – I mean, it's varied plus or minus a couple
of basis points of that 1%. So that just goes to the consistency of our outlook for the portfolio and how we underwrite.
And, as Richard said, the 1% is not a target, per se...
<Q - Dan Werner>: Right.
<A - P. W. Parker>: ...it is a through the cycle number. So in good times it's going be significantly less, and then in
bad times it's going to be higher.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: And you're not going to see it for a while. Even with our recovery and even it's taken out,
charge-offs are very, very moderate at this point and very flattish. So it is undoubtedly – we really kind of want all the
banks to start filling that movement northward as the credit quality becomes important, but so does the volume and the
more robust nature of people seeking credit, and in some cases not finding a way to pay it back. But I don't think it
[indiscernible] (50:02) for a while.
<Q - Dan Werner>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Richard K. Davis>: Thanks.
