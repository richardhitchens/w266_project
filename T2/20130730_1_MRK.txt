MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Andrea, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to
welcome everyone to the Merck second quarter 2013 earnings call. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Joe Romanelli. You may begin your conference.
Joe Romanelli
Thank you, Andrea, and good morning, everyone. We'd also like to say good afternoon and good evening to everyone
listening outside the United States. Welcome to Merck's second quarter 2013 conference call.
Before I turn the call over to Ken, I want to point out just a couple of items. First, there are a number of items in the
GAAP results such as acquisition-related charges, restructuring costs, and certain other items. You should note that
we've excluded those items in our non-GAAP reconciliation tables, and you can see this in our press release on Table 2.
This will give you a better sense of the underlying performance of the business.
There are three tables in the press release. The first table is the GAAP results. Table 2 reconciles our GAAP P&L to the
non-GAAP results for the second quarter, and Table 3 provides the sales performance for the company's business units
and our products both on a reported basis and excluding exchange. During the call, we will refer to Table 2 when we
discuss the P&L and Table 3 when we talk about revenue performance.

Finally, I would like to remind you that some of the statements we make during today's call may be considered
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are based upon Merck's current beliefs of management and are subject to
significant risks and uncertainties. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or uncertainties materialize, actual
results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
The company's SEC filings, including Item 1A in the 2012 10-K, identify certain risk factors and cautionary statements
that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking
statements made this morning. Merck undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements. Our
SEC filings can be found on the website at Merck.com. You can also find our earnings release and all the tables there
as well.
So with that, this morning I'm joined by Ken Frazier, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Adam Schechter, our
President of Global Human Health, will update you on our product and geographic performance; Peter Kellogg, our
Chief Financial Officer, who will review our P&L and provide an update on our outlook for 2013; and lastly, Roger
Perlmutter, our President of Merck Research Labs, will provide you with an update on some of our key programs.
With that, I'd like to introduce Ken Frazier. Ken?
Kenneth C. Frazier
Thank you, Joe.
Good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be here again today to provide an update on our performance and to
highlight some of the key events from the quarter.
We continue to focus on our core strategy. In so doing, we will build shareholder value by: prioritizing investments in
our best commercial growth opportunities with key in-line products and in innovative R&D; second, making
disciplined decisions regarding the allocation of resources; and managing our costs effectively. This approach is
especially critical in a period when we are navigating significant patent expirations and adapting to the global
healthcare environment.
This quarter, our business momentum accelerated while we continued to manage our costs. We believe these results
more accurately reflect the strength of our underlying portfolio when compared to the first quarter of this year. We're
still working hard to improve the competitive position and growth potential of key brands like JANUVIA, which will
allow us to drive our top line growth in the future. In addition, we continue to manage our expenses and are
maintaining our EPS guidance for the year. Peter Kellogg will provide more detail on our revenue and cost
assumptions.
For the quarter, we delivered an EPS of $0.84. This reflected underlying sales growth of 3% excluding the impact of
foreign exchange and patent expiries. The growth was driven primarily by our Global Human Health business,
including strong performance from our diabetes, immunology, and vaccines franchises. In total, seven of our top ten
products grew in the second quarter. As always, Adam will provide more detail on specific product performance.
The fundamentals of our complementary businesses, Animal Health and Consumer Care, remain strong. We continue
to view these businesses as important components of our diverse portfolio.
In terms of geographic performance, we grew 10% in emerging markets in the second quarter, excluding exchange.
In the past several months, I've had the opportunity to visit Brazil and Korea to see first-hand both the tremendous
potential of these markets and the extraordinary enthusiasm of the MSD colleagues there. In Korea, for example, our
diabetes and vaccine businesses are performing particularly well. The emerging markets now account for
approximately 22% of our pharmaceutical sales, with China continuing as a key growth driver.

Moving to the longer-term view, we remain committed to pursuing innovative science that translates into medically
important products. To sustain our ability to do so, however, we are mindful that we must continue to find ways to
improve our cash flow and build shareholder value over both the short and long term, a commitment we also take very
seriously.
One way we demonstrate our commitment to building value in the short term is by returning cash to shareholders. Year
to date, we've returned nearly $9 billion to shareholders through both our dividend and stock buyback. We've
repurchased over 120 million shares, including our accelerated share repurchase in May.
Longer-term shareholder value is, of course, driven by innovative R&D and improving the return on R&D investment.
Roger will share his views in a moment, but I'd like to comment on why we believe innovation is the path to
sustainable value and needs to remain the cornerstone of Merck's efforts, despite challenges like the recent suvorexant
and sugammadex delays.
There's an increasing need for innovative treatments that offer meaningful differentiation to patients and demonstrate
value to payers. This is true for chronic diseases like diabetes, but also in areas of tremendous scientific opportunity,
such as cancer immunotherapies and neuroscience. I'm excited about the programs like our anti-PD-1 for oncology and
our base inhibitor for Alzheimer's disease that have the potential to alter the course of medicine.
With the opportunities we see before us, I want to be clear that we intend to aggressively manage our costs in the short
term and our fundamental cost base over the long term. We need to do this in order to preserve our ability to invest in
our future and have the flexibility to respond to the opportunities and challenges presented by the global healthcare
environment.
In the second quarter, we continued to take out costs and prioritize our investments. We're doing this while supporting
future growth in core brands and in the pipeline. Let me share two examples, first with JANUVIA. We continue
making the necessary investments behind this franchise to ensure that we maintain our leadership position in the
increasingly competitive diabetes market and maximize opportunities for future growth. Second, with PD-1, we have
created a strong expert team with streamlined decision-making. We are committed to making critical investments to
ensure that we fully realize the potential of this important product and bring it to patients as quickly as possible.
In summary, we are committed to driving top-line performance with key growth products in key geographies,
advancing and augmenting our pipelines, and aggressively managing our cost base. By doing these things well, we will
preserve the ability to invest in our future, continue to generate strong cash flow, and drive shareholder value and return
over both the short and long term.
I'd like to now turn the call over to my colleague, Adam Schechter. Adam?
Adam H. Schechter
Thank you, Ken.
Good morning, everyone. This morning, I'll focus my remarks on the performance of our core products and our core
markets. Let me begin with our overall performance.
Human Health sales declined 12% in the second quarter. Our top-line results continued to reflect the loss of exclusivity
of SINGULAIR, PROPECIA, CLARINEX, and MAXALT, and weakness in the yen.
Excluding sales from these products, our underlying business grew 4% on a constant-currency basis. Key contributors
were JANUVIA and JANUMET, SIMPONI, and our vaccine business. Let me provide some more details.
I'll start with the JANUVIA and JANUMET franchise. The franchise had sales of $1.5 billion and 10% growth,
excluding exchange. The franchise grew 9% in the United States and 11% in international markets.

In the United States, demand, price, and inventory contributed to growth. With regard to demand, we were able to
maintain a 75% TRx share of the very competitive DPP-4 market. Volume grew slightly by about 1% this quarter.
Regarding price, we did see a benefit this quarter from price. We've increased price over the last year, but we've also
seen increased rebate and pricing pressures as competitors seek to improve their formulary positions by increasing
discounts.
Finally, on inventory, our customers increased their inventory levels by about $30 million in the second quarter. If we
excluded this inventory benefit, we believe our sales would have grown by about 5% in the United States, in line with
our expectations.
In international markets, JANUVIA and JANUMET had good volume growth in every region around the world and
maintained market leadership with a 70% global market share.
Now let me touch on our outlook for the rest of the year. We continue to expect mid-single-digit sales growth in the
United States, which excludes channel movements that are difficult to predict. We also continue to expect low
double-digit growth, excluding exchange, internationally.
In the United States, we continued to invest to change the current TRx trend. We have focused our resources on
JANUVIA to drive demand and to defend our strong leadership position in a highly competitive market. Globally, there
continues to be good growth opportunities in the diabetes market, and we are positioned well the market-leading DPP-4
inhibitor.
So moving now to ISENTRESS, ISENTRESS sales were $410 million, which represents about 5% growth. In the
United States, we're maintaining our patient share despite new competition. Outside of the U.S., ISENTRESS continues
to have good volume growth, offset partially by pricing pressure in Europe and timing of emerging market purchases
this quarter.
In our cholesterol franchise, ZETIA and VYTORIN global sales were up by about 1% over the prior year. ZETIA
growth was partially offset by a decline in VYTORIN sales. We are currently launching LIPTRUZET, a combination
of ZETIA and atorvastatin, in the U.S. This product reinforces the benefit that this family of product can provide to
many patients who continue to have high LDL cholesterol despite the wide use of statins.
Moving to immunology, the combined immunology business, consisting of REMICADE and SIMPONI, grew 11% in
the quarter excluding exchange. The growth was driven mostly by SIMPONI. Sales of SIMPONI grew 60% to $120
million this quarter. We're continuing to see a positive impact from the launch in France and the reintroduction of the
autoinjector in Germany. Last week we received a positive CHMP decision for an additional indication in ulcerative
colitis, and we look forward to potential approval later this year.
Moving to VICTRELIS, with global sales of $116 million this quarter, growth in emerging markets was offset by
continued contraction of the hepatitis C market in many countries, including the United States.
Lastly, moving to our vaccine business, which had another strong quarter, GARDASIL maintained its strong
performance with 20% growth year over year. Second quarter sales benefited from continued uptake of the male
indication in the United States and timing of government purchases in Latin America. Those were partially offset by
lower sales in Japan. In Japan, the government recently suspended the proactive recommendation of HPV vaccines. We
anticipate this decision will have a significant negative impact on the rest-of-year sales for GARDASIL in Japan. For
reference, sales of GARDASIL were $140 million in Japan last year. We are working with and we're providing
information to the government on the vast amount of safety and efficacy data available for GARDASIL. On the other
hand, we are pleased that the Minister of Health in Brazil recently announced a national immunization program with
GARDASIL to begin in 2014.
Moving on to ZOSTAVAX, ZOSTAVAX sales were $140 million this quarter. As we had expected, sales in the United
States declined sequentially due to seasonality. We expect the second half of the year to be stronger than the first half,
and the strongest quarter will likely depend on the start of the flu vaccination season. We continue to see ZOSTAVAX
as a key growth driver. In the United States, we estimate that a little over 20% of the population ages 60 and older have

received the vaccine to date, so there remains opportunity for growth. Internationally, we're just beginning launches in
a few Asian markets, including Korea. And we continue to anticipate our first European launch in the UK this fall, with
additional markets in 2014.
Now I'd like to touch on our performance on a regional level. In the United States, Europe and Canada, sales continued
to be affected by the loss of exclusivity of SINGULAIR, MAXALT, PROPECIA, and CLARINEX. Excluding these
products, U.S. sales increased by 7%, and sales in Europe and Canada were flat in the second quarter. Japan sales
declined 4% ex-exchange. That was due to an increase in the utilization of generic versus branded products and lower
sales of GARDASIL, which I mentioned earlier.
Emerging markets had another good quarter with 10% ex-exchange sales growth. That included 10% growth in China.
Growth in the emerging markets was broad based. It came from our base business, our new products, and our joint
ventures. In key emerging markets, our growth is at or outpacing the overall market, and we expect to continue to
deliver strong growth in 2013.
In closing, the Human Health business demonstrated growth of our underlying portfolio of key brands. In August, we
will annualize the SINGULAIR expiry in the United States, but we also anticipate generic entry in the United States for
TEMODAR. Despite the significant number of patent expiries we are facing this year, I am confident that we can drive
growth of our strong and our diverse portfolio.
Now I'd like to turn the call over to my colleague, Peter Kellogg.
Peter N. Kellogg
Thank you, Adam, and good morning.
As you heard from Ken and Adam, our core brands performed well this quarter. Furthermore, we continued to manage
costs effectively while investing for future growth. Additionally, we executed a significant capital initiative in the
quarter.
Our confidence in our future cash flows and the historically low cost of debt allowed us to return cash to shareholders
in the form of a $5 billion accelerated share repurchase. This accelerated repurchase is a key component of our goal to
buy back $7.5 billion of shares within the first 12 months of our $15 billion repurchase program announced in May.
These results and actions demonstrate that Merck is committed to improving our performance in the short term,
investing for the long term, and continuing to allocate capital in a shareholder-friendly manner.
This morning I will briefly talk about our performance in the second quarter, and I will discuss our outlook for the
remainder of 2013. My remarks will focus on our non-GAAP financials.
Starting on the bottom line, we earned $0.84 per share this quarter compared to $1.05 in the prior year. On the top line,
total company sales declined 8% in the second quarter excluding an unfavorable exchange impact of 3%. As Adam
said, sales increased 4% in our Pharmaceutical business if you exclude generic erosion and foreign exchange. Animal
Health sales increased 1% year over year excluding exchange, driven by companion animal and poultry businesses. In
Consumer Health, we had a one-time unfavorable adjustment to sales this quarter. Excluding this adjustment,
Consumer Health sales would have been up 4% on a constant currency basis.
Moving to other revenues, we saw an increase in supply sales to AstraZeneca in the second quarter. Despite this, we
continue to expect that supply sales will decrease as we approach the May 2014 U.S. patent expiration for NEXIUM.
At the PGM line, as previously discussed, generic erosion of high gross margin products also created a 2.5% headwind
on the gross margin this quarter. As a result, our non-GAAP gross margin declined on a year-over-year basis to 75.7%.
As we indicated previously, we expect the full-year gross margin ratio to be about 1% lower than 2012 due to this mix
shift in our sales.

Turning to marketing and administrative expenses, our second quarter SG&A expenses were about $60 million lower
year over year. Excluding foreign exchange benefits and some one-time corporate charges, we reduced our SG&A
spending by about $100 million this quarter. Similar to last quarter, we continued to proactively reduce spending. As a
result of our cost reductions, we continue to expect SG&A spending in 2013 will be lower than 2012.
Moving on to R&D, research and development expenses in the second quarter were $144 million lower than prior year.
However, recall that last year we had a significant upfront payment of $120 million for our agreement with Endocyte.
Excluding this, R&D expense would have been relatively flat.
Other income and expense was about $100 million higher year over year, primarily as a result of foreign exchange
losses and interest expense. In the month of May, we concluded a $6.5 billion debt offering at a blended average
interest rate of less than 2%. This debt offering funded our accelerated share repurchase, and we now have new interest
expense and lower shares outstanding.
Moving to tax, our non-GAAP tax rate was 21.9% in the second quarter. We are maintaining our estimated full-year tax
rate to be in the range of 22% to 23%. The tax rate for the second half of the year will be considerably higher compared
to the rate in the first two quarters.
Now turning to the 2013 outlook, on the bottom line we are reconfirming our 2013 non-GAAP EPS guidance range of
$3.45 to $3.55. On a GAAP basis, we expect to earn between $1.84 and $2.05.
Now for additional color on the outlook for the rest of the year, let's start with revenue. During the second quarter, the
U.S. dollar continued to strengthen against many global currencies. If today's foreign exchange rates persist, we would
expect full-year 2013 sales to be negatively affected by about three percentage points, which is greater than we had
previously anticipated.
Given our performance in the first half of 2013, the continued strength of the U.S. dollar, and select product trends, we
have adjusted our full-year revenue expectations. We now anticipate that total company revenue will be 5% to 6%
below 2012, including the negative impact of foreign exchange. While we have adjusted our sales guidance, we are
maintaining our EPS guidance through cost management and SG&A and R&D. Accordingly, we now expect R&D
expenses in 2013 to be lower than 2012.
Moving to the quarters, as we think about the back half of the year we see improvement in EPS performance compared
to the first half of the year. Additionally, we anticipate that the fourth quarter will be higher than the third quarter from
an EPS perspective.
So in conclusion, this was a solid quarter where we successfully executed a major capital initiative to return cash to
shareholders. We also drove growth in our key brands while managing costs, and we continued to step up our efforts on
our key R&D programs.
Thank you. Now I'll turn the call over to Roger, who will provide an update on MRL. Roger?
Roger M. Perlmutter
Thanks, Peter.
During the second quarter, we made steady progress in clarifying the registration process for Merck's next wave of
products and advanced our clinical trials in important areas. For suvorexant, our first-in-class orexin antagonist for the
treatment of insomnia, the FDA has provided a clear path to registration through their Complete Response Letter,
which we received at the end of the quarter. We're making good progress in preparing 10-milligram and 5-milligram
suvorexant dosage forms to enable initiation of therapy at lower starting doses, which was the principal change
requested in the FDA's review. We hope to be able to begin stability testing of these materials in the very near future,
with the goal of submitting definitive data in response to FDA's requests in the first half of 2014. As was demonstrated
at the FDA Advisory Committee review in May, suvorexant has distinctive therapeutic properties, which we believe
will enable it to become an important treatment for patients suffering from insomnia.

Turning to other regulatory actions, two weeks ago we announced that the FDA had postponed its Advisory Committee
review of sugammadex, our parenteral agent for the rapid reversal of certain types of neuromuscular blockade during
surgery. This delay will enable the FDA to complete audits of certain U.S. and European study sites that were involved
in generating data contained in our submission. We are working closely with the FDA to facilitate these audits, and
we'll have more to say about the registration timeline for sugammadex once the FDA has completed this review. As
you know, sugammadex is already registered in more than 40 markets around the world.
Also during the second quarter, we had the opportunity to present encouraging data on MK-3475, our monoclonal
antibody directed against PD-1 for the treatment of malignant melanoma, at the American Society for Clinical
Oncology [ASCO] meeting in Chicago. This immunomodulatory approach for the treatment of malignant disease is
also under study in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. We hope to present preliminary results observed in such
patients in October at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer [IASLC] meeting in Sydney. Our data
thus far have encouraged us to begin a Phase II/III study in non-small-cell lung cancer, for which enrollment is just
beginning. We're also continuing to study responses in patients with other malignancies, where we believe treatment
with MK-3475 may be beneficial by itself or in combination.
New studies have recently begun in patients with hormone receptor negative breast cancer, neuroepithelial tumors,
head and neck cancer, and in certain patients suffering from colorectal cancer. In the plenary presentations at the ASCO
meetings in Chicago, it was noted that immunomodulatory agents offered great promise for the treatment of desperately
ill patients suffering from malignant disease. Our portfolio includes not only MK-3475 but other immunomodulatory
agents which have emerged following the systematic evaluation of cell surface proteins involved in immune regulation.
With respect to MK-3475, you will recall that we have received Breakthrough designation from the FDA for this
therapy, and we are in very close communication with the agency regarding requirements for an evaluable data set and
the setting of advanced melanoma.
Meanwhile, our MK-8931 program, a small molecule inhibitor of beta secretase for the treatment of Alzheimer's
disease, continues to enroll patients in advance of a safety review, which we believe will complete at the very end of
this year. Satisfactory completion of this review will permit expansion of the study for formal efficacy testing. In this
pivotal study, patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease will be evaluated for the effect of MK-8931 on
cognitive performance and activities of daily living following 78 weeks of treatment as compared to placebo.
Finally, during my first three months in this role at Merck, I have found much to be proud of in terms of the quality of
our programs and our people. However, I see the clear need for changes that will strengthen the return on investment in
R&D. My review has focused on each critical area of performance: programs, processes, and people, and I have begun
to make adjustments along each dimension.
From the programmatic point of view, we are moving to narrow our focus to make certain that products with
unambiguous, clinically meaningful advantages receive our complete attention. With respect to process, the governance
structure has been flattened considerably, removing some layers of decision-making. Much has already been achieved
here, but more will be required to improve our efficiency in providing resources to leading projects.
Finally, with respect to people, we are moving quickly to build our leadership in R&D. I have specifically brought our
licensing business development function into my senior leadership area. As for all large biopharmaceutical companies,
licensing plays a key role in the development of breakthrough therapies. I expect Merck to participate fully in this area.
Additional details of our revised R&D strategy will be the subject of future reviews. I'm very much looking forward to
sharing this information with you.
Ken?

So before we move into Q&A, just to remind you that we're going to try to get through as many questions as possible,
if you could keep your questions to one or two; and if you have additional questions if you could rejoin the queue. This
way we can get through as many callers as possible.
So, Andrea, can you go ahead and open up the first line for questions?
Q&A
Operator
Yes, sir. Your first question comes from the line of Marc Goodman with UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Good morning, a couple things. First, can you comment a little more about Animal Health and
Consumer? Both areas seemed to be a little weak, even Consumer excluding that one-time change you made. You
talked about additional products for immunotherapy. Can you talk about how quickly you can get those into demand?
And then R&D, can you talk about some of the changes that allowed you to take spending down for the quarter?
Thanks – for the year I mean.
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: Thanks. Let me start the Animal Health and Consumer questions. So I would say that
overall reflecting on this quarter, it was an okay quarter for those businesses. But if you step back, you would see that
they grew low single digits. And as we look back beyond this quarter, we think both are performing well. So I would
not let one quarter be the answer for those two businesses. As I say, we continue to think of them as being
complementary businesses that will help us over the longer term contributing to our top and bottom line growth.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: Yes, thank you, Ken. I would add I think in the Animal Health business, they are in the
middle of rolling out the ACTIVYL product line, which we're very excited about, as well as ZUPREVO. And I think
I'd remind you that last year in the second quarter, we actually had very strong performance as we picked up some
business where they were out of stock at some of our competitors. So we probably are in Animal Health business
lapping a pretty strong prior year. For your other questions, maybe I'll pass it over to Roger.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: So, Marc, just a couple of things. With respect to the immunomodulatory agents, there's
a whole set of different cell-surface molecules that are involved as checkpoint regulators, if you will, that control the
response of T-lymphocytes to a stimulus. And we've had the opportunity to inventory these to develop antibodies
directed against a whole set of them and to look at them in preclinical studies. We hope to be advancing those into the
clinic relatively soon, and you'll see them come up on ClinicalTrials.gov, and I'll have more to say on them in
subsequent quarters.
With respect to expense, there's no single category of expense control that we can point to, but there are a whole variety
of things that I've been able to do in terms of reassigning resources; and in that process have pulled back on some of the
spending levers, which enabled us to reduce our expense now and will going forward as well.
<A - Joe Romanelli>: Okay, great, so next call.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott with JPMorgan.
<Q - Christopher T. Schott>: Thanks very much. I just had two questions. The first is on JANUVIA. We recently saw
a rebound in reported 2Q growth, but it looks like prescription volume growth, at least in the U.S., is still fairly low. I
guess my question is do you believe you're seeing a benefit from the additional resources you put in the franchise
earlier this year? And maybe more broadly, talk about the overall DPP-4 market at this point. I guess as you start to
annualize the TZD benefit, do you believe you can reaccelerate growth for this category?

My second question was just coming back to some of the comments that Roger had made about the licensing of assets.
I was just thinking inside a little bit more. Should we think of this as a greater focus on M&A for Merck than we've
seen in the past? And is that focused more on early-stage assets, or are they for those that have achieved proof of
concept? Thanks very much.
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: Okay, let me start with the second one first. I just would say, Chris, that for us when we
think about capital allocation strategy, one of the most important things, as Roger said, is to augment the pipeline, and
that means looking for the best technology that we can find, the best opportunities we can find that are value creating
opportunities, and that will remain a major priority. I know for us it's even a greater priority. So why don't I turn it over
to Roger?
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Chris, let me emphasize, as I think I did at the first quarter earnings call, that I'm really
interested and really focused on products. So it is to me less important that we consider what is the stage and more
important that we consider what is the potential value of this new therapeutic entry. Does it have unambiguous
meaningful clinical impact that can change the practice of medicine and bring important benefits to patients suffering
from grievous illness? That's the critical point, and I'm prepared to go after those wherever those exist. And I know Ken
and Adam and Peter are completely onboard with that.
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: With respect to the JANUVIA question, I'll turn it over to Adam. But again, we're pleased
that we saw the product perform better this quarter versus the first quarter. We think it's rebounding, and we're
continuing to provide tremendous support behind it. So with that, I'll turn it over to Adam.
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: Hi, Chris. Let me give you some additional context in the U.S. and also give you a little bit
more color outside the U.S. and how we're thinking outside the U.S. So as I discussed, in the U.S. we had 9% growth.
And I tried to give you some context on that by breaking it down, where we had 1% that was volume, 4% was
inventory, and the rest was price. The real key is changing the TRx trend, and that's what we're frankly focused on.
So the real issue, Chris, is that we have a 75% market share in the U.S. despite a very significant number of
competitors. So it's not about trying to gain more market share. It's really about getting sulfonylurea use over into
DPP-4s, of which we're the lion's share. Typically with multiple new entrants in a market, you see a lot of class growth.
We don't see a lot of class growth despite all the new competitors that have come into the marketplace. So a way for us
to change the trend is really to focus on the switch from sulfonylureas. And sulfonylureas still represent about 35% of
the patient days of therapy, so there's still a big opportunity there for us to go after.
So what we've done is increased our focus. We now have a dedicated sales force, and they're out there. They are
promoting; they are engaged. In addition to that, we have increased our promotion spending and our print
direct-to-consumer advertising. All of our focus now is on the sulfonylurea utilization. Up until the first quarter of this
year, most of our focus was on the TZD opportunity that's no longer there, so it really is about sulfonylureas. The good
news is that we've maintained our strong managed care access in the U.S., so we have access to our product. In over
80% of the patients, we have preferred access. And now it really is about executing on the sulphonylurea strategy in the
United States. Outside the United States, we still have a very significant opportunity, and every region outside the U.S.
had strong volume growth.
The one thing I think is important is that although we had 11% growth ex-FX, the big difference between ex-FX and
FX was the yen. We have a very significant amount of our sales in Japan for JANUVIA. In Japan you may recall the
DPP-4 class is the number one class of oral diabetics in Japan. It's ahead of metformin. It's ahead of sulfonylureas. And
we have by far the leading market share. At the same time, every other quarter we get supply sales from our
co-marketing partner, which happened this quarter. So when you look at our success in Japan plus the supply sales
coming in lumpy, you can see how the yen would have a very significant impact on our sales when you don't adjust for
exchange. That's the difference primarily for the underlying business performance being very strong of what you see,
including foreign exchange. Outside the U.S., we continue to anticipate low double-digit growth. And we see that we're
getting that in volume, and I think the opportunity remains very strong there for us.
<A - Joe Romanelli>: Okay, thanks, Chris. And, Andrea, can we have the next question?

The next question comes from Tim Anderson with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Tim Minton Anderson>: Two quick questions. On the new guidance changes, this is the second time this year
that you're changing guidance, albeit here you're not changing earnings guidance. And the revenue guidance that's
weaker is not just foreign exchange, which is something that's out of your control. Ken, when you first took over at
Merck, you withdrew long-term guidance that was standing at the time. So my question is at a higher level here, what's
happening within the company such that numbers are seeming to move around as much as they are?
And then going back to the outlook for mergers and acquisitions from here, historically Merck did not do big mergers
until it did Schering-Plough back in 2009. What's the outlook for M&A from here in terms of deal sizes? Are you going
to revert back to really only looking at bolt-ons? Are you considering midsize targets, as well? Or what exactly?
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: Okay, thanks for the question, Tim. And let me just start by saying we, of course,
maintained our EPS guidance, and so I want to make that very clear.
In terms of what's happening with the sales, you heard Adam talk about the foreign exchange. But there also have been,
during the course of this year, we took on, I think, at the beginning, some pretty ambitious revenue targets, given the
fact that we were facing major patent expiries. That's how we tried to deal with the situation last year. That was our
undertaking this year.
We have seen some things that have impacted product trends this year, including JANUVIA. We've seen the
warehousing in HCV, just to pick a couple of major growth drivers that we have seen an impact on this year.
So I want to just underscore that we take our guidance very seriously. During the course of the year, as you know, we
have seen a negative impact on full-year sales of about 3% for foreign exchange. But we've also seen some other
impacts that have hit us. Like this quarter, there was a one-time charge for MCC [Merck Consumer Care].
And I would also point out that if you look at our overall performance, you can see that we are managing costs, in order
for us to continue to deliver our bottom-line EPS guidance, which again, Tim, I take very seriously.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: On the M&A front? So, Tim, I guess you went through the chronology of – Merck for a long
time hadn't done any really big M&A deals, I guess, and then we did the Schering-Plough deal.
I think as we go forward, really in many ways, we're thinking a lot about the product portfolio and the business we
have. I'd reiterate a lot of what Roger commented on relative to making sure we have breakthrough products and really
exciting products. And if that ends up leading us to business-development deals or joint ventures or M&A, I think we're
comfortable with any of those.
I think as Ken commented earlier, we really do talk about our capital structure as having the number-one goal of
supporting the strategic needs of the business. And so we're certainly always maintaining a position to be able to do
that. That said, we also don't want to build up inefficient balances on the balance sheet, so that's why we have had a
more proactive capital-structure program recently. But in no way is that to say that we wouldn't be doing the right
things to build the pipeline. And we're always on the prowl looking for the right things, the great assets that are out
there.
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: Yes, I'll just underscore what Peter just said. I think from our standpoint, looking for M&A
deals that would be sensible, value-creating, bolt-on deals is something that we would be very interested in doing. But
we've tried to become and remain a very disciplined company when it comes to paying for assets so that we can
actually create shareholder value with them over the longer term.
So deals the number-one priority, if we can create value. We've enhanced our share repurchase. We obviously remain
committed to our dividend. But in the long term, it's products that drive this business, and that's why we're going to
continue to look for sensible opportunities to augment our pipeline, whether it's licensing or bolt-on M&A deals.

Your next question comes from the line of Jami Rubin with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Roger, a question for you. Merck issued a press release about a month ago providing an outline on
R&D restructuring, which involved removing layers of management. And today, you're talking about lowering R&D
spending for 2013 versus 2012, and narrowing your focus.
I'm just curious to know if you see this R&D restructuring process as more iterative in nature, or should we expect
more substantial change ahead, involving paring back on your specific therapeutic focuses, meaningful change in the
way you allocate capital and R&D? I'm just wondering if there's more big news to come with respect to what you're
doing to improve ROIC in R&D.
And then secondly, again on PD-1, I'm just wondering if you can update us on your views on combo studies, where you
are with that? If you are seeking to combine your drug with a CTLA-4? And when we can expect to see news on that
front? Thanks.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Thanks, Jami. So first of all, with respect to R&D structure and to lowering expense, as I
indicated, the goal is to focus our very substantial resources on the programs that matter the most, and give them our
complete attention.
There will be a series of changes that take place in order to improve the efficiency of the process. And as that goes
forward, of course, we'll communicate that to you. But our expectation is not that they're going to be big, enormous
changes that will be announced in the way that you described.
With regard to PD-1, we are interested, first of all, of course, in delivering on the monotherapy promise in melanoma
and in lung cancer. And as you know, and we presented these data at ASCO, there are very impressive response rates
that we've seen in patients with melanoma who have refractory disease who have failed all prior therapies. And
naturally we want to bring the benefits of that therapeutic intervention to those patients.
At the same time, we also recognize that there will be opportunities to combine immunoregulatory modulators, our
anti-PD-1 therapy, MK-3475, with other agents, both our own internally as well as others from other companies. It
won't surprise you to know that a lot of companies are interested in working with us on that. We've had discussions
with many of them, and we'll be talking about those combinations as we announce more results for the PD-1 program

Your next question comes from the line of Tony Butler from Barclays Capital.
<Q - C. Anthony Butler>: Thanks very much. Ken and Peter, while you have reiterated guidance for the full year, and
I may have missed this – what's the change from Q1 on the GAAP full-year guidance, which I think is down now about
$0.10?
And then, Roger, on MK-8931, the safety readout, will that be at a clinical meeting, CTAD [Clinical Trials for
Alzheimer's Disease] for example, in November? Or would you expect that at a press release? Will there be any data
coming out on the base inhibitor in the second half? Thanks very much.
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: I'll turn the first question over to Peter. But from an operating standpoint, we are
reiterating our EPS guidance.

<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: Yes, hi. So in the GAAP P&L, there are some items that we actually exclude from the
non-GAAP because they can be lumpy. And it goes back to, in many cases, the restructuring or the merger accounting.
Now in this case, we actually do have some adjustments to our R&D intangibles that we actually booked in the second
quarter. And that's simply looking at either products – as well as commercial intangibles, I should also highlight.
And so that's all part of the merger accounting. When you go through a major merger, you look at the balance sheet and
the items that are coming through, and you actually allocate value both to the pipeline in the form of in-process R&D
intangibles as well as the commercial products, which are intangible commercial assets. And then on a quarterly basis,
we work very closely in monitoring that very accurately, in terms of are the expectations of those products all
delivering exactly what we thought.
And from time to time, something happens in the pipeline, perhaps, and that causes us to write down an in-process
R&D intangible. Or conversely, perhaps the commercial trends aren't quite as robust as we had originally thought, and
so that would cause us to trigger a write-down or a reduction of the asset value in the intangible for a commercial asset.
So primarily when you look at the change in the EPS at the GAAP level, what you're seeing are some of those
evaluations that we go through on a quarterly basis, where we actually change the value of intangibles. And that's
primarily the difference that you see in the GAAP EPS that's incremental to what you see in the non-GAAP. And I
apologize for getting into that much accounting, but that's really what you're seeing.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: And, Tony, with respect to MK-8931, the structure of the program is that we have an
initial phase in which we enroll and analyze a set of patients over a three-month period, each patient exposed for three
months, in order to look at dose ranging and to look at safety and tolerability. And based on those results, we then
proceed into our large Phase III study.
We believe that we will complete that safety-run-in period, including the three-month drug exposure, by the end of this
year. Our hope and belief, of course, is that safety and tolerability will be expected and we'll move on into the large
efficacy portion of the trial. If there were any problem, of course, we'd let you know. And if we proceed into that, we'll
let you know about that as well.
And ultimately, those data will be presented in a scientific meeting. So you can expect to hear about it at the beginning
of 2014.

Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum with ISI Group.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Thanks a lot for taking the question. First of all, congratulations to Adam and his team
on the U.S. – especially on the U.S. JANUVIA numbers. You probably know there was a lot of consternation around
that number on the Street, and you guys delivered. So my questions are mainly around that.
So number one, you said that there was a $30 million inventory benefit in the quarter. Can you just remind us – I
believe there was a $70 million drawdown last quarter, so there has been a fair bit of movement here. Has that
stabilized? Should we expect further movements going forward, yes or no?
And then I heard a couple numbers thrown around. I got a little bit confused, so just a clarification. What exactly was
the price benefit in the U.S. year on year?
And then the ex-U.S., can you update us on what's going on with AMNOG and IQWiG in Germany? There has been
some, I know, movement over there. And I guess you guys came out a little bit ahead of your competitors. But could
you walk us through the potential scenarios there? I know no one knows what's going to happen, but what are some of
the potential outcomes? Thanks so much.

<A - Adam H. Schechter>: Absolutely, Mark. It's important that I try to give you as much specifics as we can because
it's such a big growth driver for us.
If you look at JANUVIA, what I said was that of the 9% U.S. growth, about 1% was from volume, 4% was from
inventory, the rest was from price, so that makes about 4% price.
You have to be careful extrapolating that over every quarter, because mix can have a significant impact on how much
price comes through at any point in time. Also, the timing of price increases makes it a little difficult for you to try to
predict and look for it to be the same, quarter over quarter.
With regard to the inventory, we did see about $30 million of inventory movement this month, which I mentioned. On
the base of business that we have, it's very, very small at $30 million. So it's very difficult to predict the channel
movements from one quarter to another. We're not seeing large channel movements in terms of how big the product is
in the United States – they're relatively small. But small channel movements can have $30 million to $50 million
impact.
So that's why for the guidance that I gave for the rest of the year, I said mid-single digits for the U.S., but I excluded the
movement of channel in there. Because you can't predict $30 million to $50 million of channel movement. It's within a
half-a-day sales or something like that. So that's how I think about the inventory moving forward.
With regard to IQWiG, so on July 1 they announced the outcome of their assessment of JANUVIA and some other
DPP-4s. We were pleased that they recommended that there's additional benefit for JANUVIA when added to
metformin. We were very pleased with that.
That's the beginning of the process. The next step is a decision on the added medical value by the GBA, and that's
expected in the fourth quarter of this year. Once that happens, you actually go into the reimbursement discussions.
So we're happy with where we are today. We're very pleased with the initial assessment. But there's still a lot more
work for us to do, and it will be another six months before we probably know the final outcome of that.
Just to put that in perspective for you, Mark, if you look at Germany, it represents less than 5% of our JANUVIA
family sales to just give you a sense of the magnitude of that. So we're excited with what has happened thus far, but
there's still a long way to go.
<A - Joe Romanelli>: Great, okay.

Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Yes, thanks so much. I have two questions, and they both relate to some crosscurrents. And
so, Ken, I'm hoping that you can clarify for me, and I guess for investors on the call.
With respect to the Animal and Consumer businesses, I think you described them as complementary today, but there
has been a lot of hoping and dreaming about Merck divesting these businesses or exiting these businesses on Wall
Street. So can you just set the stage right, in terms of how investors should think about them? As being core to Merck –
that you'll be building them? Or you'll consider exiting them?
And then second, with respect to R&D crosscurrents, I think, Ken, you described how important it was to invest in
R&D. But many on the Street have been hoping for significant R&D cuts. So if you could maybe settle that debate and
frame whether you expect R&D to remain flattish over time, or whether there are meaningful cuts ahead? Thank you.
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: Okay, so let me start with the Animal Health and Consumer conversation that we had
today.

So first of all, I've been saying for years that I think they're complementary to our business. But I also have been saying
that we periodically assess our overall business strategy based on fit and based on business opportunity. We believe
that business diversity can be complementary and can contribute to our top-line and bottom-line growth. But if we were
to view these assets as being more productive outside the company, we would consider other alternatives.
So I am saying that we constantly reassess and reevaluate our entire portfolio. That's an ongoing thing for us. When I
said that I consider them complementary – again, that's not a new comment. I've made that ever since I've been CEO.
But I'm also saying that we have to look at the overall performance of the portfolio and decide basically how we can
maximize long-term cash flow for shareholders.
With respect to R&D, the first point I would make is that we continue to think innovation is going to be the long-term
driver of the company's success. We're going to continue to invest in programs like PD-1 to ensure that we bring those
products to market as quickly as possible and reach their full potential.
We are always looking to improve productivity across the company. So I'll let Roger comment on what he sees going
forward, but I would say that in every aspect of our business, we are looking for an opportunity. As you heard Roger
say, he's evaluating programs, processes, and people. I think it's appropriate, though, to give him some time to assess
that entire equation and decide how he's going to drive better ROI going forward.
We also, by the way, did say that we are lowering our R&D guidance for 2013 versus 2012.
So all those things coming together I think directionally say something about R&D spending inside the company. But I
do again think Roger has the right and the opportunity to look at the overall picture and decide how he wants to
improve ROI going forward.
I'll just close by saying at the end of the day, all these companies at the end of the day have to innovate, and they have
to bring forward clinically meaningfully differentiated products the way that Roger has said. And that remains to me
the major focus of Merck and Merck's strategy.
<A - Joe Romanelli>: Great, okay. Thanks, David. Thanks for the questions. Andrea, next caller, please.
Operator
Yes, sir. Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Baum with Citi.
<Q - Andrew S. Baum>: Hey, good afternoon. A couple of questions.
First, on the DPP-4 class within Europe, the Transparency Commission in France just yesterday announced they're
going to be focusing on the class. IQWiG – while Merck may benefit from the ongoing discussions there, it's clear that
some of your competitors are going to have the pricing dragged down. The first outcomes trial failed to show any [ph]
DPP (54:30) benefits to much older drugs. And healthcare systems in my part of the world are still struggling, and
DPP-4s make a soft target, and obviously a reference to Japan. Am I being too negative here, when I think about the
pressures on the franchise outside the U.S.?
And then second question is for Roger. Perhaps you could outline what the split in current investment is between
research and development within Merck. And then following along from that, what scope do you see for downsizing
Merck's current research as opposed to development, the research infrastructure? Thank you.
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: So why don't I talk a little bit about the DPP-4 class? And I'll focus outside the U.S.
because that's where you focused, and I spoke a lot about the U.S. already. I just want to reiterate that we had good
volume growth in all regions and we had good growth. If you just looked at the five core European markets, we had
very strong growth, not only in volume but also in dollars. I believe the environment in Europe is tough and I think it
will continue to be tough. But I also believe that the value that physicians and patients see in a product like JANUVIA
is very strong. And also when you talk to the governments, I do believe that they see the value that a product like
JANUVIA can bring into the marketplace. And the marketplace tends to show you the value of the product based upon

the utilization. And when you look at the utilization of JANUVIA, I think it's because physicians see not only the great
efficacy that you can see on HVA1c, but they also feel comfortable with the safety profile that they've been accustomed
to.
And if you look at the cost of the implications of diabetes, they're very significant. In Europe, typically the DPP-4s are
utilized after metformin. So it's not threatening the largest generic in Europe; it's actually being utilized after the
generics are used in Europe. So I think that it shows that there is a way to try to use a low-cost metformin. But since
many patients can't get to goal on a low-cost metformin or if a sulphonylurea has safety or side effect issues that the
physicians are looking for a way to control diabetes such as with JANUVIA. And then the governments see the
implications of not treating diabetes in terms of the macrovascular disease, microvascular disease, in terms of hospital
admissions, and so forth. So I still think that there's a strong potential for JANUVIA in Europe. In addition to that, we
still have markets that we're waiting for reimbursement outside of Europe such as in China, where we think there are
also opportunities for the future.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Andrew, it's Roger. With respect to the split in current investment, we could spend quite
a long time talking about the way in which funds are allocated at Merck. But let me just point out that, as has been
described in detail by academic analyses of expenditures in pharmaceutical companies, investments in discovery
research as a total – as a fraction of the total investment in R&D have been declining monotonically since 1980. And
discovery research is actually a very small component of all large pharmaceutical companies. It represents simply the
fully allocated cost of the people doing the work, and the expense associated with clinical trials has been rising
progressively. Merck is no different from all other big companies. We spend far more on development than we do on
research. Having said that, you should keep in mind that there is a lot of stuff that is classified as research that really
relates to development. Questions are raised by regulatory agencies with respect to products that have long been on the
market that require preclinical studies. It's research effort, but it actually is contributing to the development role. So
there's a lot of complexity in there.
And with respect to opportunities that exist for reducing expenditure in research, I think the real question to be asked is
what you do to improve the productivity of the R&D organization to actually create breakthrough products that make a
real difference to patients? Ultimately, you innovate or you die, and that's what needs to be done. And you need to do it
as effectively, efficiently, and productively as possible, and that's what we intend to do.
<A - Joe Romanelli>: Great. Thank you, Andrew. Next question please.

Your next question comes from the line of Alex Arfaei with BMO Capital.
<Q - Alex Arfaei>: Thank you for taking the questions, a couple for Roger if I may. Are you doing any co-formulation
work to combine the SGLT2 you got from Pfizer with JANUVIA as a fixed-dose combination, similar to what your
competitors are doing? And also, could you please provide us an update on your once-weekly DDP-4, and is there any
possibility for a co-formulation there? Thank you.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Alex, thanks for the questions. With respect to the SGLT2 program, of course we're just
moving forward with that program. We expect to advance that program into Phase III this year. But we also are
interested, as I said last quarter, that one of the things that's extremely attractive about this program is it's very well
behaved pharmaceutically, and hence we expect it to play nicely with others. We've always had an interest in the idea
that this could be used in combination with our existing programs, and so we're looking at those things very closely.
That would be something, of course, that we would include in our registration programs. And we are making – we
continue to make progress on our once-weekly program. Our Phase III program is ongoing and we're enthusiastic about
it, and we think it's a very, very good opportunity.
<A - Joe Romanelli>: Okay. Thank you, Alex. Next question, please.

Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Holford with Jefferies.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I've just got two for you. On a margin basis, where do
think the greatest scope for cost-saving going forward in the company over a two, three year view would be? Would it
be in COGS, SG&A, and R&D? Maybe you could rank those for us.
And then just secondly, coming back to I think Consumer Health specifically, probably under 4% of group EBITDA in
terms of what it actually produces. How do you think of that really as being an asset to give diversification to the
company with such a small contribution? How would you assess the margins of that company versus some of its peers
of a larger scale? Thank you.
<A - Kenneth C. Frazier>: Okay, let me take the Consumer question. We've looked at the profitability of our
Consumer business, and we believe it stacks up well against its competitors. I agree that the asset is smaller compared
to our Pharmaceutical business. I've said before that it's not global scale, but it's a very good business. It produces really
strong cash flow. And we also continue to see that the OTC opportunities, of which OXYTROL is the most recent
example for us, do give us a complementary tie to our Pharmaceutical business.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: So, Jeff, this is Peter Kellogg. Let me answer your first question regarding margins and
opportunities in our P&L. So we're a large, complicated business, so I can appreciate it's hard to sort through. Let me
go back to a couple pieces. First of all, when we announced the merger almost four years ago, we did highlight that we
had a fairly extensive manufacturing network because, quite frankly, we combined three companies: Merck,
Schering-Plough and Organon, and really having an extensive manufacturing network of over 90 plants. I think you'll
recall that's what we highlighted on day one was that that required rationalization over time. We've made great progress
on that. At this point, the number of plants we have in the network is numbered in the low 70s. And I think that it is
very clear that we're going to continue to do that. As we indicated at that the time of the merger, that's not something
that can get done in three or four years. It's really an ongoing process of continuing to drive more and more efficiency,
so I think there's more to come there.
Obviously, how it shows up in the P&L is through the cost of goods eventually. There's always – if you measure things
in terms of PGM percent, then you get the blend between the efficiencies and productivity coming through the cost of
goods sold versus the pricing that you can realize. And that really comes down to again the innovation and the exciting
new products that we bring forward. But I do think that clearly on the cost of goods sold, that's an ongoing action that
we've talked about.
Just going down the P&L, on the R&D side, I think what I know Roger and I have talked a lot about is it's really a
question of the ROI that we think about there. If we have the right opportunity such as a PD-1, we're going to spend the
money on that, and we are intending to have an exciting pipeline. So it's not a goal of ours to have unexciting – not to
have exciting opportunities and not spend money. Conversely, we do we really want to pay close attention to how we're
spending and making sure it's focused on, as Roger said, the really big things that can make a big difference in the
marketplace and then obviously drive the top line. So R&D I think is very much of a focus for us from a productivity
standpoint but very much of an ROI perspective. If we have the great opportunities, we're going to go after them, and
we will make sure that we're doing it efficiently.
And then obviously, the last thing is on SG&A. We continue to evaluate that globally. What does our footprint look
like, and how do we operate in the most efficient manner? We made tremendous progress since the merger, as I think
we highlighted at end of last year. We actually hit and exceeded all of our merger synergy goals that we had, which
were pretty extensive. I think we highlighted that we achieved a net benefit of $3.5 billion, which actually means our
gross savings were over $6 billion. So that's a very, very substantial merger synergy program that we've executed.
But I think what's very important is, as Ken said in his talk today, cost management is very important for us, and it's a
resource that creates on the one hand a more efficient P&L. But quite frankly, it also allows us to spend on the growth
drivers, which is so important to our future. So I don't want you to conclude that we're simply thinking about our cost

structure as how do we take cost out, but it's also how do we reinvest to drive shareholder value and really create a lot
of value in this company, both through the pipeline as well as the commercial assets around the world. So I think
SG&A continues to be a focus for us. But on the other hand, I think we're also going to balance all those savings with
where we have opportunities to invest.
So I'm not giving you a very specific answer; I realize that. But I do want to make the point that while we have
opportunities and we're going to continue to pursue them, we've certainly executed well in the merger synergies that
we've laid out, and we're going to continue on that through the manufacturing network. Elsewhere in the organization,
we're thinking about return on investment and creating value, but we'll never be passive about that. As Ken likes to say,
we're going to be ambitious in driving performance in the short term, but we're never going to back away from
investing for long-term potential and long-term value creation.
<A - Joe Romanelli>: Okay, great. Thanks. And, Andrea, I think we have time for two more callers, so we'll get
started with the next question.
Operator
Yes, sir. Your next question comes from the line of Steve Scala with Cowen.
<Q - Steve M. Scala>: Thank you. First, why will the tax rate be so much higher in the second half of the year versus
the first half, and what does this tell us about the tax rate in 2014? Secondly, you mentioned 2013 R&D spend will be
lower, but you haven't quantified it. I guess we should assume it will only be modestly lower. Would you like to
recalibrate that expectation? And then thirdly, why was ZOSTAVAX sequentially down in the second quarter? It had
been sequentially up in the second quarter of 2012. Thank you.
<A - Peter N. Kellogg>: Yes, Steve. Thanks, this is Peter. Let me take the first question on tax. So I think you had a
couple questions there, so let me just take them one at a time, if I can. You asked why would the tax rate be higher in
the second half of the year than in the first half of the year. So as we went through the first half of the year, I'm just
going to take it quarter by quarter. In the first quarter, we saw some significant tax benefits that came through. I think
we highlighted them at that time, and they're very one-time in nature. They were R&D tax credit being reimplemented
and so forth. We also had – a couple resolutions of some tax audit situations allowed us to release some reserves, and
so that caused our tax line to be lower in the first quarter.
In the second quarter, we also had a reduction in some tax reserves because we had the expiration of some statute of
limitations, and so that allowed us to free up some tax reserves. And basically, some of these benefits were things that
we thought about over the course of the full year. We didn't really actually when we first put the plan together
anticipate getting all these things in the first and second quarters.
So as you think about how the year comes together, when you think about the full-year tax guidance of 22% to 23%,
the way you get to that on a full-year basis is it ends up being a weighted average of all the quarters. So if the first two
quarters were lower, that by definition means the third and fourth quarters will be higher. And they'll only be higher
because we just won't have those one-time benefits pulling the rate down. We're going to return to more natural run rate
that we would expect.
And I think that you'll recall that what we talked about in the past is the ongoing tax rate of the company will be a little
higher than what you're seeing right now. And so generally, we've talked about the long-term tax rate recognizing it's a
little uncertain because things can move around. But excluding any unusual items or any items that pull it down or
move it up that are unique in nature, we expect it to be running at a higher rate, in the range of something like 25% to
26% on an ongoing basis. But I think we want to be careful that always each year, as we go into the year, we'll update
you in terms of what we see on the horizon relative to how the taxes are evolving.
I think on the second question, you were asking about R&D and why will it be lower in the second half, and in the first
half in fact, how should we think about what we're looking at? So obviously, in my comments, I highlighted that in
prior year, we actually did have a payment for Endocyte in the second quarter of last year, so we are lapping that in a

sense. But we also basically see, as we move forward, this flow of activity. Roger is making decisions and so forth.
And I think that basically we're using the most recent updated view of R&D as we think about it. And quite frankly, it
ties to productivity, to focus, and we're not talk about a sea change. We're just simply changing – previously we thought
it would be a little bit higher, and now we're indicating it will be – our expectation is, based on what we see, it will be a
little bit lower.
And the third question was...
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: Yes, I'll take the third one. Steve, this is Adam. And with regard to ZOSTAVAX, there's
definitely a seasonal nature to the business, and we have been predicting that all along. In 2012, it was our first year
with full U.S. supply. So when we had full supply, the offices were buying the vaccine and they were stocking and
getting ready for vaccinations. In addition to that, we had just started our direct-to-consumer promotion in the second
quarter of 2012 because we wanted to ensure that we'd have adequate supply before we'd actually drive demand
through the DTC promotion. So I wouldn't use 2012 as a direct year-over-year comparison to 2013. We expect that the
second half of this year will be stronger, and the strongest quarter will be dependent upon when flu vaccinations occur
because that's when we believe we'll see many people getting vaccinated for ZOSTA as well.
<A - Joe Romanelli>: Great, thank you for the question, Steve. And I think, Andrea, there's time for one last question.
Operator
Yes, sir. Your last question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thank you. For Roger, I'd love to get your personal view on the opportunity and the risks
associated with odanacatib at this point. Secondly, could you be in a position to file lambro [lambrolizumab] in
melanoma early next year given the unmet need in that population and your breakthrough status? And maybe lastly,
Adam, can you talk about what prompted the GARDASIL decision in Japan and whether that has implications
anywhere else? Thanks.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: [audio gap] (1:10:32 – 1:10:52) But at the same time asks that we continue this study in
order to obtain additional efficacy and safety data, we are continuing study in that way. We do anticipate that we'll have
the opportunity to look at those data in the not too distant future. And based on what we see there, we hope to be able to
move forward with the odanacatib filing, but we have to see the data of course.
With respect to PD-1, again, the information that we have is that, as you can see from looking at ClinicalTrials.gov, we
have ongoing pivotal studies in melanoma refractory to therapy. We have a Phase III study in melanoma versus
ipilimumab. Those studies will deliver results either in the latter case at the end of next year or in 2015. If, in fact, it
were the case that there were overwhelming efficacy earlier on, there might be opportunities for a more accelerated
filing strategy, but that's something that we really will have to wait to see data on. And of course we're working very,
very closely with the FDA on that.
<A - Adam H. Schechter>: And with regard to Japan, the government suspended the proactive, so it's important to say
the proactive recommendation of HPV vaccines. The vaccines still remain on the market in Japan. And the MHLW is
just looking to some post-marketing use that they've seen specific to Japan. We have not seen any significant impact at
this time in other markets around the world. And MRL continues to monitor the AEs as appropriate, and we are
confident in the safety profile for GARDASIL.
<A - Roger M. Perlmutter>: Absolutely.
Kenneth C. Frazier
Okay. So thanks, Gregg. Let me just close by saying I think this was a good quarter, a solid quarter. Going forward, our
strong focus will remain on growth for the company as well as driving greater profitability. It was good to see a bounce

back in certain sales, particularly JANUVIA. We had good vaccines and immunology sales. It's great to see that the
emerging markets are still moving ahead in a very strong way.
As we go further, we will continue to invest thoughtfully in these commercial opportunities as well as our pipeline
opportunities. We're very excited about, for example, PD-1. And as we think about this business going forward, we
continue to think that innovation has got to be the key, but we've got be very careful to deliver the right kind of
reductions in our cost base that will allow us to do that in a sustainable way.
So thank you very much for your attention, and I look forward to talking to you in future quarters and in future venues.
Thank you, bye-bye.
