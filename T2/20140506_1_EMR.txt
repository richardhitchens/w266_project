MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Emerson Investor Conference Call.
During today's presentation by Emerson management, all parties will be in a listen-only mode. Following the
presentation, the conference will be opened for questions. [Operator Instructions] This conference is being recorded
today, May 6, 2014.
Emerson's commentary and responses to your questions may contain forward-looking statements, including the
company's outlook for the remainder of the year. Information on factors that could cause actual results to vary
materially from those discussed today is available at Emerson's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with
the SEC.
I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Patrick Fitzgerald, Director of Investor Relations at Emerson.
Please go ahead, sir.
Patrick Fitzgerald
Thank you, Vince. I'm joined today by David Farr, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Emerson; and Frank
Dellaquila, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.
Today's call will summarize Emerson's second quarter 2014 results. Conference call slide presentation will accompany
my comments and is available on Emerson's website at emerson.com. A replay of this conference call and slide
presentation will be available on the website after the call for the next three months.
I'll start with the highlights of the quarter as shown on page two of the conference call slide presentation. Net sales in
the quarter decreased 2% to $5.8 billion. Underlying sales up 2%. Sales were lower than expected, primarily due to

harsh winter weather and weak GDP growth in the U.S., as well as a slowdown of the global project execution in the
process industry. At the same time, process customers proceeded with plans for future investment helping drive total
Emerson orders up 9% in the quarter with strong acceleration in March.
Gross profit margin expanded 140 basis points to 41.2%, while EBIT margin was unchanged from the prior year as
currency volatility affected comparisons by $35 million and the Artesyn Technologies equity investment reported a loss
of $34 million. EBIT margin improved 60 basis points excluding the equity loss. GAAP earnings per share of $0.77
equal to prior year. Cash generation was strong, overcoming lost cash flow from Artesyn divestiture. Operationally,
there was a strong execution in the quarter despite the economic weakness among operating items.
Moving to slide three, P&L summary. As I stated, sales declined 2% but the Artesyn divestiture deducted 5% and
acquisitions added 1%, such that underlying sales grew 2%. 140 basis points of gross profit margin improvement was
driven by pro forma changes and cost containment. SG&A expense declined in large part due to the lower stock
compensation expense. Significant restructuring costs in the Artesyn investment [ph] resulted in (3:19) equity loss and
other deductions of $34 million. Additionally, currency volatility swung from gains in the prior year to losses in the
second quarter for a change of $35 million. The total EBIT margin was flat or up 60 basis points due to the equity loss.
3.3 million shares were repurchased for $214 million with our earnings per share of $0.77 was unchanged in the prior
year.
Next slide, sales by geography. By region, underlying sales grew in the U.S. by 3%, Europe by 1%, Asia by 4%, which
includes China growth of 9%, Latin America by 3%, and Canada by 2%. Middle East and Africa declined 9% [ph]
affected by (4:19) robust growth in the prior year quarter. Total underlying sales increased 2%. Strong momentum
continued in China, where all business segments grew for the third consecutive quarter.
Moving to slide five, business segment earnings and cash flow. A 2% decline in business segment EBIT includes $35
million unfavorable impact in currency volatility. Corporate expense reflects the Artesyn equity loss partially offset by
lower stock compensation expense.
Moving down to cash flow, flat reported results overcame lost operating cash flow from the Artesyn divestiture. Higher
capital expenditures reflected ongoing growth and productivity investments. Trade working capital improvement
improved due to strong inventory and payables performance.
Next slide, Process Management. Process management's underlying sales grew 1%, with North America up 6%, Asia
down 1%, which includes China up 5%, Europe up 4%, Latin America down 3%, and Middle East and Africa down
14%. Acquisitions added 4%, and currency translation deducted 1% for net sales growth of 4%.
Growth momentum continued in energy and chemical industries, but more cautious project implementations by
customers slowed sales growth. U.S. strength drove growth in North America, with growth in Europe led by North Sea
project activity. Asia declined as softness and difficult comparisons in India and Australia offset 5% growth in China.
Middle East and Africa weakness reflected ongoing political instability in the region. The decline in margin was
primarily due to currency volatility that lowered earnings by $31 million. Orders increased 12%, led by unconventional
upstream oil and gas projects. The robust orders growth reinforced continued strength in process automation markets,
particularly in North America.
Moving to slide seven, Industrial Automation. Industrial automation net and underlying sales grew 2%, with North
America up 1%, Asia up 6%, including China up 18%, Europe flat, Latin America up 7% and Middle East and Africa
up 1%. Demand improved for capital goods, especially in emerging markets. Asia growth was led by China, and
mature markets were slower. Modest growth in the fluid automation, motors and drives, electrical distribution and
hermetic motors businesses offset modest declines in the mechanical power transmission and power generating
alternators businesses. Orders growth accelerated to a high single-digit rate in the quarter led by double-digit growth in
power generating alternators. The order strength supports the expectation for improved growth in the second half with
acceleration in the U.S. and Europe.
Next slide, Network Power. Network Power underlying sales increased 1%, with the U.S. up 2%, Asia up 4%,
including China up 6%, Europe down 3%, Latin America down 8%, and Middle East and Africa flat. The Artesyn

divestiture deducted 21%, and currency translation deducted 1% for a net sales decline of 21%. Growth was solid in
telecommunications markets, led by U.S. and Europe, with China and India also up. Demand for data center
technologies remained slow overall, as growth in Asia and North America was offset by weakness in Europe and Latin
America. The margin expansion reflects Artesyn divestiture benefit, partially offset by strategic investment programs.
High-single-digit orders growth reflects improving global market conditions, especially in Europe. Gradual recovery in
data center markets is expected to continue with the outlook for modest growth unchanged.
Next slide, Climate Technologies. Climate Technologies underlying sales increased 6%, with North America up 2%,
Asia up 11%, including China up 14%, Europe up 3%, Latin America up 36%, and Middle East and Africa down 4%.
The global refrigeration business was strong, particularly in transportation, along with modest growth in
air-conditioning markets. U.S. sales were strongest in the temperature sensors business, up double-digits with
residential air conditioning up mid-single digits and commercial up low single digits. Strong demand in China drove
Asia, led by the refrigeration, solutions, and sensors businesses. Europe market conditions continued to improve. Order
trends remained steady, led by strong growth in Europe, and global refrigeration markets are expected to remain strong
along with improving market conditions in the U.S.
Moving to slide 10, Commercial & Residential Solutions, Commercial & Residential Solutions net underlying sales
increased 1% with North America down 1%, Asia up 18% including China up 23%, Europe up 10%, Latin America
down 7%, and Middle East and Africa up 23%. Strong growth in international markets offset weakness in the U.S.
related to the harsh winter weather. Growth was led by the professional tools, wet/dry vacuums and food waste
disposers businesses. Profitability in this segment remains very strong. Orders growth acceleration in the quarter
reflects recovery from the weather impact. U.S. residential and commercial construction markets are expected to
improve, supporting stronger growth in the second half.
Next slide, 2014 Outlook. Robust orders growth in the quarter reflect continued improvement in the global
macroeconomic environment. Large, multi-year industrial projects and recovering demand for capital goods helped
drive order strength. At the same time, uncertainty persists in some markets as reflected in the anemic U.S. GDP
growth in the first calendar quarter. Recovery appears underway based on March orders. The preliminary trailing-three
month orders growth in April are approximately 8%. Based on current market, the 2014 outlook is unchanged with
underlying sales growth of 3% to 5%, reported sales change of minus 1% to 1% reflecting the embedded computing
and power divestiture, [ph] completed (11:16) acquisitions and currency translation, margin expansion of
approximately 0.5% excluding charges in the prior year and an equity loss in the current year, and reported earnings per
share of $3.68 to $3.80, up 4% to 7% excluding impairment and repatriation charges in the prior year.
And with that, I'll turn it over to David Farr.
David N. Farr
Thank you very much, Pat. Thank you, everybody, for joining us today, I appreciate it.
First, I want to also thank [audio gap] (11:28 – 11:35) this quarter with solid margin improvement, strong cash flow
making up for cash we lost from net sales embedded, and then also pressing forward on the strong internal growth
initiatives both in the service area, solutions area and technology to try to drive longer-term growth across our Emerson
businesses.
Yet the quarter sales were much weaker than we anticipated in February as we met in Boston, snowy Boston, based
primarily on a much weaker U.S. residential marketplace for us. As I look at the various markets from what we saw in
February to what actually finished at the end of the March quarter, Europe was stronger, China was stronger, India
weaker, Middle East weaker, Latin America weaker primarily because of Brazil, and a little bit of slowdown in Mexico
with the election and the changes in the energy programs.
In addition, we saw with the quarter being much weaker, this from the general economic view around the world, we
saw some of our large process and industrial customers really start slowing down with the execution of the projects that

we have underway. Not canceling but just slowing them down, pushing them out. In fact, orders have continued to be
strong so that the confidence is there in our customer base. They're just slowing it down.
As we look at the late March and the April orders on a per-day basis because they're several days moving back and
forth with the Easter and the Easter holiday and the various holidays this year, on average right now, we're growing
underlying orders around this 8%, 9%, high-single digit basis, so we had April again looking at pretty good orders.
Again, this is the third month as I look at orders trending upwards. And so I think that the key thing for us right now is,
orders have turned. We now clearly need to continue to execute in delivering at the high level backlog we have right
now, and drive down the backlog and deliver those sales in the second half of the year.
Again, just stepping back and thinking about the markets that we face today versus February when we talked about
them, the one real negative is that U.S. residential marketplace is much, much weaker than we saw back in February.
On the positive side, nonresidential continues to solidify, and we're actually seeing that look stronger in the second half
of this calendar year, both here in the United States and other markets around the world. In Europe, I feel better about it
except for the unfortunate situation between the Russia, Ukraine situation in Eastern Europe and potential slowdown
impact on Europe. But right now, Europe continues to look better than it did originally and trending the way we want it
to trend.
And as you look at the world, it has been a very, very muted global economic recovery coming out of the 2008-2009
recovery. Not much of a typical recovery from business or the consumer or the investment profile. As we talked about
in February, we're going against this, and we're pushing hard both internally. We're making internal investments in
technologies. We're making investments right now in our capacity capabilities, our productivity capabilities, our new
product initiatives. We are pushing our money that we're generating at record levels of cash flow into the company to
drive higher levels of growth.
We've also stepped up our acquisitions in the first couple of months this year, already spending $1.2 billion, targeting
$1.5 billion, and we will continue to push pretty hard that how we can emphasize and increase our acquisitions for
external growth going forward here in the next couple of years. Clearly, our balance sheet, our operational
performance, our cash flow is at the level that we can invest more aggressively to drive growth and push our way
through this, what I call is globally muted recovery as this continues to happen around us from month-to-month.
Overall, cash flow very good, we're increasing our capital spending this year, as you know. We'll be driving close to
$800 million of capital, up from less than $700 million last year, investing in our new products, our innovation, our
global capacity utilization areas, investing in productivity and focusing on how we can make the company stronger and
drive a more profitable business and try to drive little bit faster growth.
So overall, the quarter clearly disappoints in the topline growth. I was pleased with the execution with the operations
from profitability and cash flow. And the recovery around the world continues to move forward, but at a very, very
slow pace, and it would not take much, unfortunately, to knock back some of the economic recovery, in particular, in
Europe, if we saw a situation emerge relative to Russia, Ukraine, and whole Eastern Europe.
So concerns at this point in time, we're pushing forward with our investments, and we will continue to push forward
our investments to drive better growth, better levels of profitability and better returns for our shareholders. We are still
targeting to deliver back to our shareholders this year at least 60% of our operating cash flow, right now our trend
probably is a little bit above 60% unless we see external investments that we see the opportunity of coming back, we'll
keep at that level until we see the money needed to grow the company faster.
With that we'll open the phones up for questions-and-answers.

Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Scott Davis with Barclays. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi. Good afternoon, guys.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Scott.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Dave, you mentioned in your comments that this has been a different type of recovery and I
think we'd all agree with that. But based on the order book that you have which seems pretty strong and just the
backlog, and then you look at it, things like process where there's some pretty big projects coming down the pipe, does
it feel like to you that we're at the tipping point here where that investment spend is getting ready to really kick in for
real for the cycle? Or do you still feel like it's vulnerable?
<A - David N. Farr>: My discussions with the customer base, the CEOs out there, is that we are all starting to push
forward and spending more money. I'm not alone. If you look at our spending pace right now, we made a decision a
little bit earlier than some of our customers to push forward. Scott, I feel it is at that tipping point. The one big negative
is if all of a sudden you saw the situation really unfold in Europe where the European economy is really starting to stall
again, then I think you would see the CEOs around the world will be very cautious again and pull back. But right now,
I feel significantly more positive about that that tipping point's coming. And, therefore, we're going to push forward.
We're seeing the desire, seeing the core pace, but people still will be concerned about the world with the things
happening. And today, people can react so much faster than ever before I became CEO back in 2000.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Yeah. So I guess the natural, and these are all high-class problems, I suppose. But I think the
natural follow-up on that is specifically in process. I mean, if you look at the projects that have been announced in
chemicals, and oil and gas and refinery et cetera, I mean, there's a lot of, lot of projects in that 2015 to 2018 timeframe.
I mean, how do you balance between having a natural level of skepticism that a big chunk of them might get canceled
to the other side of it, where you really need to invest pretty heavily to make sure you're there? Because there could be,
I would imagine, some capacity constraints when you get to that time period, if not in product, but in just engineering
talent and manpower. How you think about that, Dave?
<A - David N. Farr>: Right now, based on the quote activity, which continues to be at record levels both in the
process world and in some of our industrial space, too. We're pushing forward. We're making the investments. I see the
order book. I see the projects were winning. I saw the projects coming down the pipe again this month. And I feel very
confident that these projects will go forward. They may take rather than 18 months to be unfold, they might take 24
months. I feel quite strongly they're going to happen, because the capacity is needed, I know where this product is
going. So I feel it will happen, and we have to get out in front of that because we are winning clearly a strong fair share
of those orders, if you look at the order pace coming out of the process and then improving industrial for us, too. So we
have to be ahead of it, and that's why we're investing.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. Good. Good luck, Dave. I'll pass it on.
<A - David N. Farr>: See you later, Scott. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone, or good afternoon.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Deane.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Dave, could we go back. You're reaffirming the guidance, but we're well into the second half,
and you're baking in some second half ramp, especially in process. Maybe just talk a bit more about, within the
segments, what sort of upside you're expecting, how that ramps, is it a question of easier comps, or are there some
opportunities that are baked in the second half assumptions?

<A - David N. Farr>: On the early cycle businesses, the Climate Technologies business and now the Residential
Solutions business, some of our early cycle industrial businesses, we are seeing the activity to start picking back up
again. So, we're expecting them to get a little bit stronger in the second half of the year. Right now, Climate
Technologies is still looking at a very good year on a global basis. They've had a good first half. I think personally
they'll have a better second half.
On the Industrial space, the Process guys, the Industrial Automation guys, the Network Power guys have the orders. It's
a matter of getting execution around those orders and getting some, what I'd call, incremental book-to-ship type
businesses. Our backlog right now has the capability to deliver in the second half of the year. We need to execute
around that backlog, and we need some of the early cycle guys, which we're starting to see, as we've seen in the last 45
days of orders. We need to see those orders being booked and shipped. And I think that's where we're coming from
right now.
Profitability-wise, we have the capability right now. Our cost structure is in good shape. The price/cost is in good
shape. It's just a matter of getting that sales book, which we are, look to taking the backlog down, and then getting out
the door. And I firmly believe, going back to the question from the previous person asking, based on what I see right
now, if things are stepping up, you're going to see going into 2015 with a strong pace of business for us.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Great. That's very helpful. And just to go back on one of the comments you made on process
particularly, and may be just reconciled, because it seems a bit contradictory. One, you said some of the customers are
pushing out projects, the project implementation is slowing them down. Meanwhile, you've seen a pickup in what you
call robust order growth. Are these separate parts, separate end markets within Process, but it would seem that you
wouldn't give the same customers making both actions?
<A - David N. Farr>: Well, yes, you do, because some of these projects are getting much larger and they're more
complex. And obviously, we had more than two customers in Process. So from our perspective, we're seeing customers
around the world. Some will slow it down and try to spread the capital out a little longer to make sure that they don't
get ahead from a capacity standpoint. And secondly, you're started seeing also from the standpoint of customers have
long-term projects, they want to get them going, they want to get the engineering work done, and get it in the queue.
So you're seeing both. The activity level in the global process world by industry is sitting at record levels, and we have
not seen that curtail that much. It may be a slower growth rate this year, but it's still running at a pretty high level. So,
yes, they've got one foot on the gas pedal, one foot tapping the brake, and they're doing both right now which is not
uncommon for us.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Great. That's helpful. Thank you.
<A - David N. Farr>: You're welcome. Take care.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Hi. Thanks.
<A - David N. Farr>: Hello, Julian.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Hey. I just wanted to follow up on the 8% to 9% run rate you talked about on orders. I
guess is that a run rate that you expect to continue for some time? Or is that 8%, 9% really just reflecting the one-off
big boost you had in the March sort of standalone month? Or do you think you can see 8% to 9% as the daily orders
increase for some time?
<A - David N. Farr>: The word sometime is a long time. I would say that, Julian, as I looked at the last six weeks, it's
growing at 8%, 9%, I think you could see a couple months of that at this point, my visibility from that standpoint. If

you saw a solidification of the residential marketplace and start seeing that pick back up, which some people are saying
that it's going to improve as the year progresses on a calendar year basis, and you continue to see the European
recovery continuing not have a hit from what's going on in Russia or Eastern Europe, then I think you could see this go
on for several more months after that. But right now I think I'm a little bit nervous in saying is that residential going to
come back after how much it weakened? And also what is the side effect of what's going on in Russia, Ukraine and
Eastern Europe?
So, I think, that – I'm looking right now, I see at least two months of pretty good underlying daily run rate of orders,
and if I see things continue to improve in residential and in Europe, then that could go up for another couple more
months.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Got it. Thanks. And then in the Network Power, the margin was about 8%. I think you're
looking at over 10% for the year, so you've got a decent jump up in the back half. Is that sort of just a leverage game of
year-on-year growth? Or is it just a release of a lot of cost savings coming through at the same time?
<A - David N. Farr>: It's a function of our growth. If you look at our Network Power business, historically, we have a
stronger second half. And then also some of the cost savings are just starting to come through. But we have built quite a
bit of backlog the last couple of months here, and now it's a matter of just executing on the sales level there. Our
normal second half Network Power is usually a better margin if you look back over time.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Thanks. And then lastly, very quickly, Middle East and Africa had a very big swing from
kind of December quarter organic growth to what happened in March. Just wondered what you're thinking for June or
the next six months in that region for organic sales?
<A - David N. Farr>: I'm more nervous about Middle East at this point in time given the turmoil going on in the
Middle East. We have a lot of projects underway in the Middle East. We have a lot of orders going on in the Middle
East right now. But I am a little bit nervous and just the general business environment, if you look at what's going on in
the Middle East, I'm a little bit concerned about that, both in the Middle East and Africa. So we expect it to be positive
second half of the year. I think when we get done with it, there will be other regions that look better and the Middle
East will be not as good. That's my general feel right now.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Great. Thanks.
<A - David N. Farr>: You're welcome.

Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Thanks. Good afternoon.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon.
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: Hey, Chris.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Dave, was just wondering with the pronounced orders surge of Process, if you had a
sense what sort of concentration of large projects drove that? And in what part maybe was it a general broad
acceleration and pick up in activity?
<A - David N. Farr>: We are seeing the pick up in orders coming out of our, what I call, Downstream business and in
our North America. We're seeing some of that. We're also seeing some very, very large projects happening around the
world right now that we've been working on for a while, and the last several months we've seen them book. But it's a
very broad group of orders right now. It's not focused on one or two customers. It's very broad based. And a lot of large
projects coming around Asia, coming around United States and some downstream. So from my standpoint, I look at
that. That's why I feel pretty good about the second half and going into 2015 in Process, because they're building the

backlog. They're building the order base to be able to deliver that. And the question is will we see more confidence in
what I call the MRO type of business early on here? So I like the mix of the large projects, medium projects in Process
right now. It's a good mix.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Okay. And then just looking at the 2016 Network Power target of 12% to 14% margin,
what would it take to enter the bottom of the range in fiscal 2015 in terms of how much is volume dependent versus
realizing some of your self-help?
<A - David N. Farr>: Right now, I would say most of that would be volume-dependent, because we are investing right
now in Network Power to get through some of the next-generation technology, some innovation in the service area. So
if we could see continued good improvement in our orders in particular, right now we've seen a recovery in orders in
Europe, we've seen recovery in Asia. What we need to see is recovery in North America. So if we see very much
stronger North America, then you'll see that profitability come in faster. North America is the key one to watch.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Okay. And then just lastly on the cooling side, you've weathered a mix down in that
space. To what extent do you think that's run its course or remains a dynamic to contend with?
<A - David N. Farr>: On Network Power side or the Climate Technologies side?
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Network Power.
<A - David N. Farr>: Well, I think from the standpoint of what we're seeing right now, the mix and our faith that we
have in the complete offering, I think, we've weathered that and we're starting to see that trend upward. I feel good
about where we are right there now.
<Q - Christopher D. Glynn>: Thank you.
<A - David N. Farr>: You're welcome.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Yes, thanks. Good morning, Dave. Sorry, good afternoon, Dave.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Nigel. Depends where you are...
<Q - Nigel Coe>: I just want to pick up on the Process orders. I think I know the answer. I just want to clarify. Do you
think that from here on we see larger orders hitting the backlog? And longer duration orders, so therefore we should
expect to see a bit more volatility in the order pace going forward? And perhaps the correlation between order growth
and revenue growth gets a bit more extended?
<A - David N. Farr>: I think the answer to that is yes. The projects are definitely – as you know I talk about, are
definitely much larger, they're more complex, we book them sooner, and we're having to manage those over time. So I
would say based on the type of businesses and the type of projects we're doing, we'll get much larger projects. There
will be a lot more volatility within that, both from a sales standpoint and a profitability standpoint, within a quarter or a
year.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. Great. And again, you talk about some of these projects getting pushed out a little bit. Is your
sense that maybe there's some sensitivity on the macro volatility maybe in Ukraine, etc., Middle East? Or do you think
it's just a bit more of a push towards capital efficiency from the majors?
<A - David N. Farr>: There's two things going on. One, my large customer base is being asked to slow down some of
their expenditures and redirect some of that money towards, I would say, shareholders, both on a broad basis, the big
capital projects guys. They're not stopping the projects. Rather than projects taking 14 months, it's going to take 16
months, and so they're having pressure on them to spread their cash and to allocate more cash back to the shareholders.

But the projects still have very high payback so they're going to do them.
And then from the standpoint of just projects, because of some of the large complexity of projects, sometimes it takes
longer than anticipated, and with the uncertainty in certain things around the world, both the Middle East turmoil, like I
said Eastern Europe turmoil, some of the questions coming in say Australia, they say, "Okay, let's slow this down a
little bit and take a little longer." So you've got two things going on right now working on our large customer base. The
projects are going; they're just going to take their time, and use that cash a little bit longer.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. That's really helpful, Dave. And then just one more on Artesyn, we had $0.03 this quarter. I
think a lot of that was restructuring. I think you've got about $17 million for the full year, which suggests another $35
million in the second half the year. Is that correct? And is that more restructuring? Or is that more of a run rate going
forward?
<A - David N. Farr>: I think for the whole year, Frank, are we doing $70 million, $80 million?
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: No, no, he's looking at that reconciliation probably. Where do you see...
<A - David N. Farr>: He is talking about restructuring.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: The 30 bps in the appendix. The 30 bps margin from JV...
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: Okay. So if you look at the reconciliation at the back of the slides, the $34 million, $35
million that we took this quarter should be all there is. We're not expecting anymore for the year. It's really 1.4 points in
both the Artesyn and whatever rounding is in there as a result of just using ranges for those estimates. All got jammed
into that 30 bps. So the answer is no, there's no more behind it.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: I see. Thank you very much.
<A - David N. Farr>: What I was answering the question, if you're looking at internal restructuring which we do on an
ongoing basis, yes, we're still talking about $70 million, $75 million for that.
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: Oh, absolutely. I thought your question, though, was strictly on the Artesyn piece.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: It was. Thanks for the answer.
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes, yes.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Good afternoon, everyone.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Shannon.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Hey, Dave, on the gross margins, so up 140 basis points, meaning you have a benefit
there from the exit of embedded. But maybe break that out if you could, and what other factors drove the gross margin
improvement? And then are there any headwinds coming in the second half to that?
<A - David N. Farr>: From the standpoint of our GP margin, obviously Artesyn did help us, and as you know, we talk
about 50 basis points at the EBIT line. It's probably about, we have 60, 70 points, 90 basis points at the GP line...
<A - Frank J. Dellaquila>: At the GP line.
<A - David N. Farr>: At the GP line. So the rest is just operational improvements in mix going on, so I expect our GP
margin to be pretty good for the year. We actually forecast a pretty good GP margin for the year. And then we are
looking for underlying operating performance, only a mild underlying operating performance, but investing more into
the company. So that's why you're seeing not as much spread improvement between GP and OP as you normally would

see. So we're investing internally right now.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. And then you mentioned a couple times about executing against elevated
backlog. I mean, is that unusually backed up because of some of these project delays, or what's sort of behind that
comment and how soon do you think that'll get released?
<A - David N. Farr>: The comments, one, both for you guys but also my own operating people who are on the phone
right now. They all listen to what I say. So I mean, the key issues are our backlogs is sitting at very high levels, would
the orders last say, 45, 60 days, we've been building backlog. So the key issue for us is to execute as much as we can in
that backlog. Clearly some of this is in the Process world, the Network Power world and the Industry world with a little
bit longer lead time, but anything that we can work on execution. Our operations are fine, it's just a matter of what can
we execute with our customer base to figure out how to get done and work that backlog back down. I don't like
carrying that much backlog.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Thanks, and good afternoon, gents.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Steve.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: On the gross margin point, just following that up and given what, I think this is the highest
gross margin ever for this quarter, right?
<A - David N. Farr>: From my knowledge, yes.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: What's the price cost dynamic, and could you give us a sense of the green-versus-red
comfort level you have there as you're looking forward?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yeah, right now, Steve, let's go back, let's step to February. We thought from a price cost
standpoint that we'd be pretty much neutral this year, maybe slightly plus or minus point one just very, very much
neutral. Right now we're doing pretty well. What's happened is, our net material inflation as the economy has been
weaker, or actually our net material inflation's got more negative and so right now, we are definitely green from a –
slightly positive green, so we're probably going above the line. I would expect that that will hold for the rest of this
year, and then we'll start going in – if net material inflation continues to, let's say, become more negative because of the
weakness around the world and excess capacity, then you'll see us have more pricing pressures next year. But right now
we're in pretty good shape from a price cost standpoint finishing this year and going into 2015, so I like where we are
right now.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: It sounds like a sweet spot actually on that front.
<A - David N. Farr>: It is a sweet spot right now. But you get sweet spot for about three months and then you get
whacked.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay. And on the acquisition point that you made – well, actually acquisition and CapEx.
On the acquisition point you made about your spending level, I mean, we're looking at an environment where it feels
like some the prices being paid are moving into frothy territory, particularly in some of your end markets. I mean, how
is that impacting your placeholder for that?
<A - David N. Farr>: For this year we'll get pretty close. We may not quite get to [ph] 1.5% (38:02), but we're going
to be pretty close. From my perspective right now, we are actively working trying to figure out how to build our

pipeline of acquisitions. I'd like us to see us do more acquisitions given our strength of cash and our profitability
statement and our capabilities globally, but at the same time we have to be very, very careful that we don't obviously
get too aggressive on the pricing and pay too high a price. But right now, my operations from the standpoint of places
we want to go, I like where we are and I think we're ready to handle some more. But nothing's, say, imminent, but I'm
really turning up the heat internally, both with our operations and with our corporate people to see if we can identify
more. But you're right, the pricing is a key issue. You can't get carried away.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: And just lastly on CapEx, that $800 million number. How much of that is sort of growth
CapEx versus maintenance versus maybe if you even think about productivity? I'm not sure where you put that one.
<A - David N. Farr>: I would say the big increase this year for us is two-fold. Productivity, so if you look at the $100
million-plus that we're putting, I would say one-third of that is probably productivity increase, as we're trying to drive
our plants more efficiently, and then the rest would be capacity. We're adding capacity around the world and we've
continued to expand. And we took a lot of capacity off-line in the last downturn and before the last downturn, and now
we're replacing that capacity in what I'd call in more appropriate areas, in the areas that want it, and it's going to be
much more efficient capacity. So we're adding capacity and getting geared up for the continued growth of our customer
base around the world.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: And is that in process, the capacity, or multiple places?
<A - David N. Farr>: It's across the board. It's both in process, it's industrial. It's also in sort of our residential
solutions area. So it's around the world. We're seeing this around our bases, all the companies.

Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Rich M. Kwas>: Hey. Good afternoon, everyone.
<A - Patrick Fitzgerald>: Good afternoon, Rich.
<Q - Rich M. Kwas>: Just, Dave, your comments on residential, what are you seeing – new construction was weak in
the first quarter and most people expect that to come back. But what are you seeing on the replacement side that would
give you more cause for concern? Because it seems like you're a little more cautious, that some of this should come
back because it's weather-related. But just a little more color on there.
<A - David N. Farr>: I would say the underlying, just the demand, the numbers coming out are very concerning to me
and the fact if you look at the – if you really start cutting down the employment numbers and looking where the jobs
are being created and lack of employment, lack of hours, I'm very, very nervous about, will people spend? I mean, the
residential recovery has been very, very short-lived. Bam! You know, like what, five quarters? And so I'm a little bit
nervous about the fact will people get concerned about their incomes, spending? I mean their cost of – the cost of living
has gone up, and so how much more money are they going to really allocate towards the houses? Will they move and
then refurbish? I mean, that's a key issue for us. Will they refurbish? Will they upgrade? And right now, I think people
being very cautious relative to that. And my concern is we see it should be a little bit better the second half, but it
doesn't, that will be a problem.
<Q - Rich M. Kwas>: Okay, all right. And then...
<A - David N. Farr>: It's not a good sign out there right now. Those job numbers last week were not good.
<Q - Rich M. Kwas>: Okay. And then on Network Power, just with Chloride in Europe, the orders are picking up
here. How much of this is improvement in underlying demand versus just the comparables are favorable and they

continue to be favorable? How confident are you in the European piece?
<A - David N. Farr>: We're seeing – we've got our act together through the integration. So, we made a lot of changes,
both from an operational standpoint and a leadership standpoint. And so I'm seeing better execution within the
leadership and win the space that we had actually lost. And secondly, I'm seeing some of our core markets actually do a
little bit better where they have under-invested for quite some time. And in particular, the UK, which we're very strong
in the UK and we're starting to see some good improvement in the UK. So from my perspective, I think we are seeing
the momentum and the question is now, can we keep that going as the European economy continues to progress? Our
programs are continuing to kick in. I feel better about Europe as we go forward here.
<Q - Rich M. Kwas>: Okay. And then just a last one for me on process, with the project activity picking up, how
should we think about incrementals, because that would seem to have a dampening impact on incrementals beyond this
year?
<A - David N. Farr>: It will hold it down. I mean, our process business, we're going to run high levels of profitability
in any quarter. As I talked about earlier, you could get some good MRO type of business in it or small, what I call,
brown type – brown expansions versus a greenfield. So right now, we're running at this, on an average, about 20%
operating margins or EBIT margins within Process. And I think we're going to stay around that level, but because the
big projects will hold us back, leveraging that a whole lot.
<Q - Rich M. Kwas>: Okay, all right. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeremie Capron with CLSA. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jeremie Capron>: Thanks, Dave, good afternoon.
<A - David N. Farr>: Good afternoon, Jeremie.
<Q - Jeremie Capron>: China, clearly, 9% growth, third consecutive quarter of pretty good growth there, and this
despite weaker macro indicators. Could you give us some color on what you're seeing in that country?
<A - David N. Farr>: In the market space we're serving right now, we're seeing pretty good continued investment. The
process world, the industrial productivity world, some of the refrigeration stuff we're working on, some of the core
spaces, a lot of investment going on again in their telecommunication infrastructure in China right now. These are the
markets we play in. We're not into the big infrastructure type of projects, which have slowed down. So, we continue to
see pretty good opportunity here. I would expect it for us to see pretty good high-single digit growth this year,
throughout this year. I'm obviously watching it very, very closely relative to the business space. And both Ed and I are
spending time there because it's an important marketplace for us, but we've now seen several good quarters and I expect
it to go forward. I do not expect to see an acceleration and I do not see a deceleration at this point in time. I see pretty
good high-single digit growth for us and all coming off of a pretty good base.
<Q - Jeremie Capron>: Okay. So when you look at your order intake in March and so far in April, are you seeing the
same trends unfolding?
<A - David N. Farr>: Yes. In China, yes.
<Q - Jeremie Capron>: Great. Thanks very much.
