We plan to cover a lot on today's call. Tom will provide an update on the company's five strategic priorities along with
a few highlights of our 2012 operations. Art will then provide an overview of our 2012 financial results and economic
outlook in our 2013 sales forecast, highlights of our latest capital expenditure and financing plans. And finally, our
earnings guidance and dividend objectives. After closing remarks from Tom, we will move to Q&A.
As always, our goal will be to engage in a full and open discussion, but we also want to be respectful of your time.
Therefore, based on feedback we've received from many of you, we will make every effort to end today's conference
call no later than 2:15 p.m.
At this time, I'll turn the call over to Tom Fanning.
Thomas A. Fanning
Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. Overall, 2012 was an outstanding year for Southern Company. As we
move into 2013 and beyond, I'd like to provide you with an update of our five strategic priorities. The first priority is
excel at the fundamentals. First and foremost, I want to commend our employees for one of our safest years on record.
Nothing is more important than the well-being of our employees, which requires constant focus and an unwavering
commitment that we will return each one of them home to their families in good health at the end of each workday.
While we were not perfect in this regard in 2012, I'm very proud of our employees' commitment to our target zero
safety philosophy.
We also recorded another year of outstanding operational results. The peak season equivalent forced outage rate for our
fossil hydro generation fleet has been the leader in the industry for six years running and eight of the last nine. We have
also continued our superior performance in transmission and distribution reliability and our customers continue to
benefit from our trend of improvements over the last decade.
We continued the ongoing transformation in our generation mix, generating more energy from natural gas than coal for
the first time in our history. Largely as a result of our diverse portfolio and the ability to respond to low gas prices, our
customers benefited from approximately $1 billion in fuel savings as compared with 2011.
Our operational performance along with our strong commitment to service resulted in top quartile rankings for
customer satisfaction for all four of our regulated utilities in 2012. All of these operational accomplishments are
evidence of Southern Company excelling at the fundamentals, but this priority is a broader objective than indicated by
any of these metrics. In fact, each of the other four priorities, I'll discuss is an extension of this first priority.
The second priority is achieving success with our major construction projects, specifically Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4
and the Kemper project, both of which are continuing to progress in an outstanding manner. While projects of this scale
and magnitude always face unforeseen challenges, we continue to demonstrate our ability to constructively manage
those issues and achieve a favorable outcome.
Since our receipt of the first-ever combined construction and operating licenses from the NRC in February 2012,
significant progress has been made on both units with construction now approximately one-third complete. Specific
accomplishments include complete assembly of the Unit 3 containment vessel bottom head, 40% completion of the
Unit 3 cooling tower and 90% completion of the Unit 4 containment vessel bottom head. We have also begun assembly
of the Unit 4 condenser.
In addition, on Tuesday, the NRC issued no objection letters in response to our preliminary amendment requests. This
enables final work to be completed prior to the pouring of basemat concrete. We intend to pour concrete following the
expected issuance of the license amendment later this quarter.
We are anticipating the Georgia Public Service Commission's response to the seventh Vogtle construction monitoring
report on February 19, and expect to file the eighth construction monitoring report in late February.

Meanwhile, the Kemper project is now 75% complete and remains on track for its May 2014 commercial operation
date. To-date, approximately $2.5 billion has been spent on the project. The plant is scheduled to begin start-up
activities this summer with first fire going to the CTs in June and the first gasifier heat up taking place in December.
Reliable syn gas is expected to begin flowing to the CTs in February 2014.
As many of you are aware, Mississippi Power signed an agreement with the Mississippi Public Service Commission
last week that includes a procedural schedule and framework for cost recovery for the Kemper project. This settlement
demonstrates once again our long-standing practice of engaging with regulators to achieve constructive solutions and
provides a greater level of transparency on cost recovery for this project. We held a separate Analyst Call regarding this
settlement last Friday. A replay and related documents can be found on our Investor Relations website.
As an update since that call, Mississippi made its first filing under the settlement agreement this past Friday. The
company asks for $172 million in rate release, which represents a 21% increase in customer bills. If approved, we
expect those rates to be implemented as early as April 2013.
Also the legislation permitting securitization and multiyear rate stabilization has been sponsored by the Chairs of the
House Public Utilities Committee and the Senate Energy Committee. Both bills have been single referred and passed
out of their respective committees earlier today. We look forward to monitoring their progress over the next few weeks.
Overall, we continue to anticipate that Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and the Kemper project will benefit our customers with
clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy for decades to come.
The third priority involves promoting a sensible national energy policy. This is an area that is especially important right
now with the fiscal issues the country is facing and the potential for economic recovery on the horizon. We have seen
some progress in this area recently, with the December passage of a bill that preserves a rational approach for dividends
and capital gains taxes, a discussion in which we were particularly active.
This development should help maintain our ability to attract capital for future energy infrastructure investments, but
more work remains to be accomplished and we will continue to have an active voice in those debates.
We will continue to argue for a balanced approach to energy resources, and emphasis on energy innovation through
proprietary research and development and the importance of restoring America's financial integrity, all for the benefit
of the customers we serve.
The fourth priority is promoting Smart Energy. As you know, we achieved a major milestone in 2012, the completion
of 4.4 million smart meter installations in Georgia, Alabama and Florida. We believe, however, that the concept of
Smart Energy involved more than just the building of a smarter grid, it's a much broader concept that also includes
generation, transmission, distribution and the beyond the meter uses of electro technologies.
In fact, it's really more than all of that. It's really about energy innovation and the ways in which we can use technology
to help drive better service and reliability for our customers. We will continue to dedicate ourselves toward achieving
that outcome.
The fifth priority – and it's really the foundation of our business – is about valuing and developing our people. We will
continue to drive performance and accountability in 2013, while also continuing our emphasis on succession planning
and cross-training.
Over the past two years, we have transferred some 700 employees across system lines, improving the breadth and depth
of our expertise and sharpening the skill sets of many of our key leaders. We will continue with this approach in 2013
and beyond.
I'll now turn the call over to Art for a financial and economic review.

Thanks, Tom. As you can see from the materials we released this morning, we had strong 2012 results for both the
fourth quarter and the full-year. For the fourth quarter of 2012, we earned $0.44 per share compared to $0.30 per share
in the fourth quarter of 2011. For the full year of 2012, we earned $2.70 per share compared to $2.57 per share in 2011.
Our full-year 2012 results, include a $21 million net benefit or $0.02 per share recorded during the second quarter of
2012 for an insurance recovery associated with the 2009 Mirant bankruptcy settlement. Excluding this item, full-year
2012 earnings were $2.68 compared with $2.57 per share for 2011. As a reminder, our earnings per share guidance for
2012 was $2.58 to $2.70 and our adjusted results were in the top end of that range.
Several factors affected our year-over-year results for 2012. Two of the most significant drivers were the weather and
our ability to respond to it as reflected in our successful effort to improve operating efficiencies in our business units.
Weather in 2012 for our service territory was milder than normal across most of the year, which had a negative impact
of $0.11 per share. Weather in 2011 was quite the opposite, driving a positive $0.09 per share impact. This means that
weather had a negative $0.20 per share impact year-over-year. Largely offsetting this impact was reduced non-fuel
O&M for our traditional operating companies, which drove a positive $0.11 per share contribution for 2012 as
compared to 2011.
The other significant driver for 2012 as compared to 2011 was retail revenue effects for our traditional operating
companies, which contributed a positive $0.22 per share. In our slides, we have provided a summary of all the
year-over-year EPS drivers for 2012. We have also included drivers for the fourth quarter in the appendix for your
reference.
Turning now to a discussion of our retail sales results for 2012. Total weather normal retail sales for the full year grew
0.4% over 2011 and 1.7% for the fourth quarter. Industrial sales grew at 0.2% for the full year 2012. After a weak third
quarter; fourth quarter industrial sales grew 1.2% over the fourth quarter of 2011.
During the fourth quarter of 2012, six of our top seven industrial segments reflected energy sales growth over the same
period in 2011. Chemicals, our largest segment grew 2% for the quarter.
Other highlights for the fourth quarter include automotive manufacturing with energy sales growth of 7%, petroleum
refining with 6% and lumber with 9%. This expansion in fourth quarter energy usage was supported by 3%
year-over-year growth in manufacturing jobs, twice the national rate and 1.4% growth in total employment in our
geographic footprint.
We ended 2012 with 23,000 additional residential customers. This helped drive weather normal growth of 1.1% in
residential sales, our strongest annual growth in that sector since the recession began.
While our fourth quarter numbers reflect the benefit of additional customers, they also reflect the expected reversal of
the year-over-year revenue anomalies to which we alluded in our last earnings call.
As a reminder, we explained that Georgia Power had refined its methodology for calculating un-billed sales using smart
meter data, which provides greater accuracy compared to previous years in which the process required more estimates.
As we peel back the numbers and look across our operating companies, we are very encouraged by what we see in the
residential sector with overall growth of 1.1% in 2012, about half of which is accounted by customer growth and the
rest by increases in usage, indicative of a strengthening economy.
Despite promising trends in industrial and residential sales, our commercial sales have remained essentially flat on a
weather normal basis. From an economic development standpoint, the potential project pipeline in our service
territories remains robust. The current projection includes more than 300 potential projects, representing up to 40,000
jobs and $9 billion in capital investment.
The recent announcement of General Motors adding more than 1,000 highly-skilled IT jobs in Atlanta for its new IT
service center is evidence of the type of projects our jurisdictions pursue. This announcement adds to a string of
1,000-plus job announcements in 2012 that included major companies like Airbus, Caterpillar, Ingalls Shipbuilding and

Baxter International.
In fact, since the fourth quarter of 2010, we have seen a total of 10 such announcements, representing nearly $6 billion
in capital expenditures. However, many companies continued to delay final decisions on expansions and relocations
until Congress further resolves looming fiscal issues. These conditions, which were noted during our last earnings call,
continue to persist despite Congressional action in December on income, dividend and capital gains taxes.
Earlier this month, we reengaged with our economic roundtable participants. As a reminder, this group consists of
several regional economists and executives from a handful of our largest customers. The roundtable participants helped
to validate the observations we gleaned from our fourth quarter sales results and the assumptions we've made in our
2013 forecast, which include forecasted GDP growth of approximately 2%.
Most of the economists believe that most of this growth will be driven by the higher than 2% growth in the second half
of 2013, offsetting what is likely to be a slow start for 2013, while Congress contemplates its fiscal issues.
Most outlooks include an assumption for an improved global economy in 2013, which could positively affect exports
out of our region. Industrial production is seen as improving with an emphasis on business-oriented goods.
Participants also observed that housing markets in the region are continuing to rebound with foreclosures decreasing
and inventories of developed lots falling towards replacement levels. These trends along with continued positive
migration into the region bode well for continued residential customer growth in our markets.
Finally, our roundtable participants were cautious in their outlook for the commercial sector, but do see growth
emerging, particularly in the private sector. That brings us to a forecast of total retail sales for 2013, which we are
projecting at 1%. This forecast is essentially the midpoint of a range of potential economic scenarios that result in sales
growth of between 0.7% and 1.3%.
Industrial sales growth is projected to be 2% for 2013. This growth rate is reflective of previously announced industrial
expansions as well as a continuation of some of the increased activity we saw in the fourth quarter of 2012.
Commercial sales growth is projected to be 0.5%, while residential sales are expected to grow at 0.6%. Our residential
customer growth assumptions for 2013 are consistent with our 2012 results of 23,000 new customers.
Now, I'd like to update you on our latest capital expenditure forecast and our financing plans. Our 3-year forecast for
capital expenditures totals $16.5 billion. As in previous years, the largest component of our forecast is maintenance,
which totals $4.2 billion for the three-year period.
Environmental compliance spending, including our capital cost to comply with the MATS rule is also significant at
$3.6 billion. Of the $2.4 billion 3-year total CapEx for Southern Power, approximately $2 billion is allocated as
placeholders for potential acquisitions or new self-build projects that fit Southern Power's rigid investment criteria,
including the requirement for long-term contracts with credit-worthy counterparties.
These placeholders contemplate additional solar projects, primarily in the southwestern United States and efficient
natural gas generation projects, which are a prominent part of Southern Power's portfolio.
As mentioned in our last earnings call, we are exploring opportunities to apply our low-risk business model in other
regions of the country, where co-ops, municipals and perhaps even other investor-owned utilities would benefit from
securing long-term capacity through bilateral agreements.
Moving now to our financing plan; our forecast assumes long-term security issuances of $9 billion for 2013 to 2015.
This financing plan does not assume any refunding or refinancing of existing securities, something we have done
extensively over the past few years to lower the average cost of our portfolio to 3.8%, while lengthening the average
maturity to 15 years.
We continue to target a consolidated equity ratio of approximately 44%. Based on the capital expenditure forecast of
our traditional operating companies alone, we do not anticipate any equity needs for the three-year period. To the
extent, Southern Power finds projects that meet its rigorous investment criteria, we could need as much as $300 million

in any one year.
Now I'd like to share our earnings guidance for 2013. For 2013, we are establishing an annual guidance range of $2.68
to $2.80. This represents a growth rate of approximately 4% over our 2012 EPS guidance range and encompasses
numerous planning scenarios for normal variances in weather, the economy and operating expenses.
Our long-term earnings growth rate is 4% to 6%, represented by a range extrapolated from the top and bottom of our
2013 annual guidance. This slight revision in our long-term growth rate is consistent with the significant reduction
we've seen in environmental compliance capital, which has been further reduced in our latest update to reflect the
longer compliance horizon for potential coal ash and water rules and the cumulative effect of slow economic growth
over the past few years. One final note on our earnings outlook, our first quarter 2013 earnings per share estimate is
$0.51.
As most Southern Company investors know, our common dividend has been a key component of our value proposition
for decades. 2012 marked the 11th year in a row that our dividend was increased, a practice that continued even during
the difficult economic times of just a few years ago.
We have always taken the long-term view of dividends and recognized that the informational content of our policy
around dividends and actions is important. Supported by the earnings growth assumed in our guidance, our financial
plan contemplates a growing dividend consistent with the path chartered over the past several years.
I'll now turn the call back over to Tom for his closing remarks.
Thomas A. Fanning
Thanks, Art. I am always proud and almost never surprised by our ability to deliver superior results. For more than a
decade now, Southern Company has maintained a singular, steadfast commitment to a low-risk, customer-focused
business model that in turn has resulted in an outstanding track record of operational and financial performance.
Our ability to sustainably deliver clean, safe, reliable and affordable electricity continues to be the foundation for our
success. We maintain that same focus for Southern Power, remaining committed to a low-risk business model that
delivers exceptional value to shareholders.
As we do with our traditional operating companies, we keep it very simple with Southern Power. In short, we require
Southern Power to first, sign long-term bilateral contracts; second, partner with credit-worthy counterparties, primarily
co-ops and municipals; and third, take no or minimal fuel or transmission risks. Sticking to this model has produced
solid results for Southern Power since it was formed in 2001 and has kept that business unit poised to deliver continued
value and growth going forward.
Our ultimate objective is to deliver superior risk-adjusted total shareholder return. Over the last decade, this has been
driven by strong earned returns for our traditional operating companies, steadily growing cash flow and earnings at
Southern Power, stable earnings per share growth, and finally, a sustainable growing dividend, all of this, while
maintaining the best overall financial integrity and credit ratings in the industry.
In today's uncertain world, none of us in this industry know what challenges may lie ahead. Southern Company has
demonstrated a track record of anticipating future challenges and managing them successfully for the benefit of our
customers and our investors. We appreciate your interest in Southern Company and we take seriously our obligation to
build successfully for the future. We are now ready to take your questions.
So, operator, we'll now take the first question.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group. Please proceed
with your question.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks. Can you hear me?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Greg. How are you? Yeah.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: I can't complain, always looking good on Bloomberg as usual.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: That's enough out of you.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: So, I guess, when I look at your earnings growth forecast for the next several years, as articulated
by the growth rate. Your growth rate, the high end is slightly lower, you're at 4% to 6% versus what you thought you
could do on a multi-year basis off of last year's base earnings, which was 4% to 7%. And I know a lot of stuff moves
around in your CapEx forecast, where you're spending money, how you're financing it. But if you could summarize
what are the key factors that have caused you to reduce the high-end of the growth rate for us? That would be helpful.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, it was simple. What we said last year – I know we got a lot of questions before,
about how do you hit 7% growth year-over-year-over-year and it really dealt with the outcome on the MATS
compliance.
Remember last year, and even the years before, we were projecting with the proposed MATS rule something like 17
baghouses. As a result of the final rule, recall there were, like 11 major segments of comments that were filed by EEI
that we were pretty influential in. One of those dealt with schedule, 10 of them dealt with some technical issues that
were critically important. And as a result of the resolution of at least 4 of those 10, it caused us not to build 17
baghouses, but 4.
There were other corresponding changes, but the net effect is that CapEx over the 3-year period is less than what we
would have projected. The other thing that is in our CapEx that you will notice is that we have pushed out CapEx
associated with ash and water. So, we'll see how that resolves itself. But in the 3-year period, we're not showing any
CapEx associated with proposed rules there.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Got you. Got you. And so, it doesn't have to do in any meaningful way with a re-evaluation of
what you think your authorized returns will be, or whether or not certain assets are going to go fully into rates over
time, like Vogtle or the way the Kemper County plant is going to be treated?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Has absolutely nothing to do with those issues.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay. Thank you, Tom.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yep.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Paul.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Good afternoon. Can you hear me?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Can you just comment your expectations for O&M relative to 2012 and your 2013 guidance?
And then secondly, probably five years, six years back, you were pretty bullish on the outlook for Southern Power and

then you tapered expectations a little bit. It sounds like you're getting more positive. Is that a fair read of your
commentary?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, Paul, let me deal with your O&M question first. If you look over the last three or four
years, none of those years was normal in terms of our O&M spend. We were either holding back or spending more
because of good weather. So, it's an excellent question. But let's approach it this way from giving you a baseline to
work with.
If you take 2012 non-fuel O&M and you add $200 million to $250 million back to that number and then grow that
number by 3.5% to 4%, we think you're going to be in the ballpark of what a normal level of non-fuel O&M would be
that we're expecting. Now the second part of your question relates to Southern Power.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So, let me jump on that one. I guess, it's on your slide package on page 20, we have some
charts that shows a variety of statistics, including Southern Power net income. You may note that in 2012 we had our
best year ever, earning net income at $175 million. We did have one downturn that was in can and that was really
associated with the downturn in the economy. So that kind of explains that.
Yeah. We are bullish for Southern Power. They have this wonderful, I think, business model that we replicated to have
a risk profile similar to our traditional operating companies, whereby we have a long-term bilateral contracts,
credit-worthy counterparties little or non-fuel or transmission risk. We think that works wonderfully. We think frankly,
we've been turning down business outside the Southeast. And we think that we're willing to consider some projects
outside the Southeast, but which meet our rigorous business model.
Frankly, we think this is a gap that we can help fill in some of the deregulated markets, particularly in the near-term
Texas and MISO. So, let's just see what happens there. Otherwise, we've been reasonably active in the renewables
space. So, you've noticed our announcements on solar projects, we've done the biomass deal and been immensely
successful there in Texas. So, I think we can continue that track record and continue to build for the future.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Then, Tom, just with your financing plans, you're not excluding any opportunity to Southern
Power. Did I hear you say there's no equity needs? Does that mean no DRIP or new program shares? How should I
interpret that?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, in 2012, Paul, we actually bought back some shares with the proceeds from stock
options that basically left us close to a zero point in 2012. We would expect to do the same thing outside of Southern
Power's equation in 2013 through 2015 as well.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: So, basically again, excluding assumptions around Southern Power, a flattish share count for
the next few years?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah.
<Q - Paul T. Ridzon>: Thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ali Agha with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Thank you. Good afternoon.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: How are you? Hey, how are you?
<Q - Ali Agha>: Good. Thanks. Again, going back to your 2013 guidance, if I look at 2012, you reported $2.68 and
then you told us that weather, which is normal, hurt you by about $0.11. So on a weather normalized basis, you would
have been around $2.79, if my math is right. So your 2013 guidance, $2.68 to $2.80, suggests that at best you're flat and
could be down, if you take the midpoint or lower. I know Art talked about O&M, but is there anything else that's
causing – assuming normalized weather, why would you guys be flat at best in 2013 versus 2012?

<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, Ali, again, we talked a lot in the last call about the uncertainty around the economic
outcomes in 2013. And we're still allowing for, I guess, some of that downside effect, because there's still a lot of
unknowns out there. There's still a lot of people on the sidelines waiting for signals to move ahead. And that has
nothing to do with – you've added back weather to the number without considering what we would have done with
O&M. And the facts are, we cut a drastic amount of O&M in 2012 in order to offset that weather impact. And so, you
can't make the single assumption that your earnings would have been if weather had been normal just adding back that
piece. It just doesn't work that way.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: I mean, think about it. We improved earnings by $0.11 and we had headwinds of
year-over-year weather of $0.20. So, we've kind of been through this before, I think. We do manage our O&M based on
the stress of the system, based on weather. Also, with the advent of weather-related revenues, we take advantage to, in
essence, fix the roof while the sun is out and actually add to our maintenance. The evidence that this all works is borne
by the fact that our operational performance in terms of our generation fleet, in terms of our transmission, distribution,
in terms of our customer satisfaction numbers, are spectacular.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Okay. And, Tom, if I could take it a little further, because in your assumptions you have assumed 1%
weather normalized sales growth kind of midpoint for 2013. As I recall the old equation, that equates to about $0.08 or
$0.09 of earnings incrementally in 2013. So it looks to me that it's all coming back to the cost side going back, Art, to
your point about the competitors. Is that fair? I mean, because you're getting weather normalized sales growth in there;
and yet again, you're seeing flattish comparisons. Is it all coming on the cost side?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: I hate to say that it's all coming on one side. I think what we've been able to demonstrate
on the cost side is that we've been able to manage our business exceptionally well from an operational and customer
standpoint and respond to changing conditions, be they economics, be they weather, be whatever.
This notion of Value Line counting Southern as one of a handful of companies they follow as having an earnings
predictability score of 100%, but we can never predict the future. We've been able to provide for earnings per share
growth over the years; that is regular, predictable, sustainable and that strategy has enabled us to have a dividend policy
that likewise is regular, predictable and sustainable and allows us to have dividend increases even during downturns in
the economy, when a lot of people pulled back.
I think, the strategy we're putting forward here with earnings per share range that we have and forward expectations of
4% to 6% earnings per share growth, will enable us to continue in that vein for years to come.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: And I'll add, I think there's another element there as well and when you think about
economic growth, we certainly didn't get the weather-normal sales growth we expected in 2012, so you're starting from
a lower base there. And our growth rate around the economy and our sales growth continues to be less than historical
levels. So, until we get all of our segments back into full engagement, it's going to be difficult to move the range higher
than what we have outlined here.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Understood. Tom, one quick one on the contractor dispute at Vogtle. Any updates to share?

<Q - Kevin L. Cole>: Hi. Good afternoon. This is actually Kevin, on his team. Sorry, he couldn't appear. I guess
another question on demand growth. So, I guess, we fully appreciate your comments regarding uncertainty around DC
policy and the evolution of your tone from cautiously optimistic to just cautious last quarter. But nonetheless, it sure
seems like the Southeast continues to outpace the rest of the country?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah.
<Q - Kevin L. Cole>: How should we think about the visible industrial recovery kind of working into a residential
demand recovery? And what do you think the likelihood is that we're actually receiving the residential recovery today,
but...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, Dan (sic) [Kevin] (39:57) – I wish you guys could see how we obsessively prepare
for these calls and we really work on our language and try – we really struggled with what our language should be
about our expectations, and I forget what we said, we were optimistically cautious this time.
Listen, we are seeing signs of recovery here. While we did see kind of a flattening in the last half of 2012 of industrial
sales, when we look at our economic development backlog and we have, think about this, only 0.3% of manufacturing
facilities employ 1,000 people or more. The Southeast over the last two years has gotten 10 of those, and in fact, we've
gotten 5 recently and some of those could be significant. Airbus has 1,000 people direct employees, but we think 4,000
indirect. You add on top of that, Caterpillar and Baxter and Ingalls and a variety of other things, GM IT workers, and
we're starting to see I think in the residential and the customer growth numbers the fact that we are adding jobs in the
Southeast.
Look, we could be conservative here. I mean, I'll admit that. But let me give you one more comment on the fiscal side.
When we gave you the comment in October on that call, I have to complement our economic forecasting guys and the
marketing people at Southern that are very close to their customers; I think we were right on the money with what
happened in the economy in the Southeast and I feel good kind of about where we are now.
I think the issues – remember, we talked about uncertainty related to fiscal issues and the fiscal cliff and all that. We
did avoid the fiscal cliff in a so-called way, but I would argue what we really did was a tax patch. It was helpful and
certainly helpful to our industry and any dividend-related investment, but we still have fiscal issues to deal with.
The constructive kind of evolution of that discussion really goes to the notion, I think, that Congress will not use the
national debt ceiling as hostage in these deliberations, rather moving to a more constructive approach of proposing
solutions, for example, that are sensible, like requiring the Senate to come up with a budget. So, we still have big
issues, but I think the issues are being handled in a more constructive manner. And I think, therefore, our kind of color
on where we believe the economy is headed is slightly more bullish than we were, say, in the third quarter. We are
expecting a back-end loaded economic recovery, but I feel pretty good about it right now based on what we see.
<Q - Kevin L. Cole>: Okay. I guess with those comments, then, I guess, give us – you have visibility into good – like
the backlog of industrial jobs coming to your region? And then to Greg's question, it seems like the growth rate today
was lower due to a deferral of CapEx versus an abandonment of CapEx? And so, should we assume that the growth rate
– I guess, the legacy growth rate of 5% to 7% could possibly return for the next guidance season for 2014?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Who knows what'll happen in the future. But, yeah, I mean, the near-term – the Greg
Gordon answer was exactly the right answer. I mean, how we got to 7% before was building a lot of baghouses. It was
17. It was that kind of CapEx environment. Because we were successful in arguing some of the technical issues on
HAPs MACT for the benefit of our customers, we're not going to spend as much CapEx complying with MATS, and
therefore, because we're deploying less capital, the growth rate drops on the top side from 7% to 6%. But the
fundamentals of our business remained strong. Who knows what happens outside the 3-year period.
And recall, the CapEx associated with ash and with 316(b) and a variety of those issues are really out of this 3-year
period. So, the presumption as you're making is they're in the next 3-year period. We'll see. We only comment on the
3-year period we see ahead.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Kit Konolige with BGC. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Good afternoon, guys.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hello, Kit.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: With regard to Southern Power, does your interest in other regions now have anything to do with
a perception that there's a lower growth rate in the core region?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Not really. But, I mean, it is a little slower. When you think about our focus is on either
renewables and that has been where the renewables are; desert Southwest largely, a little bit in Texas, otherwise
gas-fire generation. When you look at I think some of the flaws of the deregulated markets, the so-called organized
markets, they've not been able to build within those market structures long-term capacity commitments. We think, we
have demonstrated success in a business model, which permits those kinds of investments to occur. So, we see some
attractive markets available.
Southern Power has brought some of those deals back to us. And we have kind of said no, that we like where we are.
The question we've been asking ourselves over the past year or so is why not? Why shouldn't we pursue those kinds of
opportunities so long as we can still meet the rigorous business model that we have in place. I think we can do that.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: And can you give us a little more color on kind of a little closer view of what types of projects
you'd be looking at? What regions – I think you mentioned Texas and MISO?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Well, Kit, it would be similar to what we've been doing. Southern Power's capacity is
something like 95% gas-fire. So, it's going to be combined cycles, maybe some CTs. And the other thing I would just
add to you, when we think about the Southern Power strategy, this is not a significant contributor in the next year or
two or three. Rather, our strategy here positions us well long term. Said another way, we're going to be able to hit the
4% to 6% growth even without Southern Power adding new projects in any other region.

general thoughts there?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, Mark. This is Art. We continue to negotiate with DOE. We've extended those
discussions officially through midyear. We've had some recent positive movement in those discussions. And we still
remain hopeful that we'll be able to come to an agreement. But at the end of the day, we're still looking, too, at the fact
that we've been able to finance a lot of Georgia Power's needs at record level of interest rates. So, we still have to make
the judgment about what's in the best interest of our customer. So, we continue to move in that direction and hopefully
we can come to some agreement with them on the loans this year, but you'll be hearing more about that throughout the
year.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Okay. And I guess just maybe a follow-up to some of the other questions about Southern Power.
You mentioned if there's going to be some upside; it's obviously going to be beyond the 3-year window. Does that
mean that you're not currently participating in any RFPs whether in the Southeast or outside?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Really, I don't want to comment on anything they're doing from a commercial standpoint.
<Q - Mark Barnett>: Fair enough.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: I mean, in terms of participating with RFPs and everything else. If you just look at the
trajectory of net income in the package that we've given you, I would follow, if I were doing planning assumptions, I
would follow that trajectory.

<Q - Paul Patterson>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Paul.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Hi, Paul.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: I apologize if I missed this, but I noticed that your growth – I was wondering whether that 0.6%
sales growth for GDP was still the case with your 2013 sales growth forecast? And if I – if it is, am I looking at it and
that you guys are assuming something between – something basically at the top end of about 2.2% and something more
likely in the midpoint under 2% for your GDP assumptions?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: GDP growth assumption is around 2%.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Around 2%. Yeah.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And therefore, our sales growth assumption is around 1% with a range around that.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. So, you guys are now using about a 50% – the 0.6% number is basically what you guys
are still using. Is that basically the way to think about it? There's been no change in that?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay.

<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And then when we look at...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey. Paul, let me add one thing. It's just kind of interesting. We always try and get
[indiscernible] (50:56). There's been great interest in, net of energy efficiency, are we still seeing consumption growth,
and in fact, we are. We've done more science on that work that we showed a lot of you all in October – or I guess, it
was November at the financial conference.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And in fact, what we're seeing is for the Southeast anyway, energy efficiency has almost
no influence on the consumption of our customers. 88% or so of usage can be explained by either the income growth of
our customers, the price of our product and weather. If you account for those three things, you're speaking for virtually
all of the usage growth.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. So, you're seeing very little impact from energy efficiency in your service territory so
far?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: We are seeing energy efficiency. Make no mistake. It's just not reducing usage. You may
want to think about it as producing in essence a dividend to disposable personal income and therefore, people are
having more money to spend on more stuff.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Oh. I got you. So what they save with various appliances, they're re-spending on other electric
consumption. Is that the way to think about it?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, and just think about where the economy is going. We all have these goofy devices.
We all have iPads and iPhones and bigger plasma TVs and everything else. And when we see the progression of people
moving from small homes to apartments into now primary housing, we see a growth in kind of square footage per
person, if you will. We also have seen, associated with a recovering economy,+ growth in personal income. All of these
things contribute to usage growth.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Now with the residential sales growth, it just seemed very strong in the fourth quarter –
and I'm sorry, if I missed this again. Why was it so strong in the fourth quarter? Was it because of the employment
figures you were talking about? I wasn't clear on that exactly. It was 5% approximately.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: No. Paul, you recall in the third quarter call, we talked about a lot of that unbilled issue that
we thought was going to rebound in the fourth quarter, and that is in fact is what happened. If you look back at the third
quarter for residential sales, it was like negative 2.1%. In the fourth quarter, it was positive around 5%, I think.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: So, what you saw here is a rebound. Now the percentages aren't alike, but they shouldn't be,
because you're moving kilowatt hours out of a very heavy quarter of usage into a quarter of usage, which is rather light,
so the percentages are going to get skewed.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. And just on an annual basis, we don't have really any of that. Is that all evened out for
the year pretty much?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, I think you're more comfortable and more safe looking at the year-to-date number.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. I think the rest of my questions have been answered. Thanks so much.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hey, Brian.
<Q - Brian James Chin>: Hey. Good afternoon. More of a federal policy question. There's been a lot of media chatter
since the inauguration speech about Obama's inclusion of climate change in that. And, Tom, obviously you're pretty
close with a number of the key opinion makers in Congress and on Capitol Hill. With regards to this thought that the
Executive branch could try to resuscitate carbon regulation or a carbon tax, any sort of updated thoughts there that you
can give us relative to what you told us at EPI?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, so I think there's very little chance of anything like that getting through Congress.
So, you're right to kind of look at, will EPA be able to put something in place that will advance that cause? So, right
now, we know that EPA is evaluating or has made a proposal on new sources.
Interestingly, you know that Southern is the only company still committed to robust proprietary research and
development. We've developed our own technology. The Kemper County plant actually meets and exceeds the
proposed new standards for carbon for new generation. So, that's kind of interesting. We'll see how that goes. There's
lots of comments going in and we'll wait eagerly to see what the final rule looks like. But it is pretty clear that if the
final rule is anything like the proposed rule, conventional coal generation is just not doable. So, they're really making
an energy policy statement there.
One of the things that I have been pretty vocal about here lately and that is this energy policy issue, I've been very clear
that energy policy is the purview of Congress. Congress has the portfolio, really as we do, in thinking broadly about the
ramifications of such policy mechanisms.
For example, we say, we need clean, safe, reliable, affordable energy. EPA will tend to focus on clean without taking
into account perhaps all of the other issues that are so important to balance for our customers' welfare. I go back to the
families we serve, 48% of which make $40,000 or less. Those folks make tough, kitchen table, economic decisions
every day. Their demand for energy is relatively inelastic, and so anything the EPA does which adds cost to energy
tends to slow down our economic recovery and causes them to make choices for things like housing, healthcare, food
and education. These are broad policy areas that are better handled in Congress rather than a single regulatory agency.
We will be enjoined in this discussion as it evolves in the months ahead.
<Q - Brian James Chin>: Great. And any thoughts on carbon regulation for pre-existing plants being executed by
EPA without Congressional approval?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: We'll see. Nothing to say at this point.

<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hi, Mike.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Hey, guys. Hey, Tom. Hey, Art. Two questions unrelated to each other. First question, can
you talk a little bit about Vogtle, just in terms of there was some testimony in the 7th monitoring report regarding just
potential delays, especially if the concrete pour didn't occur in the fourth quarter of 2012. Just kind of give a broad
update in terms of just where you are versus the schedule and how the schedule may or may not move?
And then second, when you think about Southern Power, there are more infrastructure funds and various energy funds
out there than there probably are projects and you have what is a collection of very good assets that many of which are
contracted for a very long time. Just curious, if you've thought about monetizing that business in terms of, is that a

business that's potentially better off in the hands of an entity that might capitalize it with significantly more leverage
than a publicly-traded utility company might use?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah. So, Mike, let me hit that last one first. We've kind of chatted about that for years.
Wait a minute. We are EVA driven here. In other words, we always kind of look at what is the return on invested
capital versus our cost of capital and if we can beat our cost of capital, we create value for shareholders with every
dollar we invest. So, that's kind of how we think about Southern Power, and from time to time, there do kind of develop
in the market opportunities to monetize those assets. We certainly consider that and you remember one time it got
pretty hot.
My caution to you there would be that we remain customer-focused, and many of our customers, our co-op and munis,
who had entrusted us with full requirements obligations for long periods of time. We want to honor the relationship we
have with those customers. That's why we get the business. And so, we're not going to just transact to get the next
dollar. We want to be very careful to take a long-term view on developing the customer base and growing as much
value in a sensible way as possible.
With respect to Vogtle, we've talked a lot about that in the past and I'm going to kind of point you to the VCM-8 that
you're very aware of. I mean, in terms of VCM-7 testimony that you obviously are very aware of and there was a lot of
discussion back and forth about that. And recall that we were reluctant to kind of weigh in, in a very specific way in the
VCM-7 discussions, it was clear that our contractors were operating on kind of a mid-17, mid-18 schedule. There was a
schedule that our contractors were following. We had not agreed to that schedule.
Recall that the commercial dispute we have with our contractors deals with delays that came from the licensing, from
the DCD to the COL and how that may manifest itself in the project. What I would do I think most constructively here
is point you to our filing in VCM-8, which will be at the end of February, in which, we will provide more clarity about
our point of view on schedule.

<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Hi, there. Sorry about before. I cut myself off. Tom, one question I have just on the
growth story is you described 2013 as being a week first half and then something of a rebound in the second half and
then sort of it nets out to 1%. So, what kind of sales growth are you embedding in your 4% to 6% earnings growth
assumption beyond 2013? And how does the segment pieces look versus what you've shown us on 2013, which I guess
is a bit weighted to industrial and less residential?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: The longer term, I guess the question we'll go to, Jonathan, make sure I'm answering this
right, is kind of a longer-term GDP expectation, and we kind of think that our electricity sales will migrate upwards
into say, 1.4%, 1.5% kind of range for years beyond this year. Is that helpful?
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: So that's kind of what underpins your 4% to 6%? Or if we see that, could it nudge you
back up again, or...?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, yeah, yeah, correct. So, I'm sorry, go ahead.

<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: No. So, just to be clear the 4% to 6% is predicated on 1%? Or more like 1.5%? Or am I
getting too cute with the numbers?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: You're a little cute, but it's 1% this year and beyond this year, kind of 1.4% going forward.
But the bigger indicator I think is watch CapEx. If you look at rate based growth based on the CapEx we're showing,
roughly $5.5 billion a year augmented by whatever Southern Power does opportunistically. I feel very confident in our
4% to 6% range.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you, Tom. And then, I'd also ask on Vogtle and there have
been these press reports about the vessel being stranded in the port and issues with the railcar. Can you kind of give us
your version of what's going on with that story, how big an issue is it? Is it not an issue?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, I hope I don't offend anybody. I think it's been over reported a bit. The vessel never
really left the car. We turned the car back up. We put it back in the port and they're managing it, it provides interesting
pictures but I don't think it's particularly important. We'll be able to manage that little bump in the road – excuse the
pun – and we'll continue with our progress in an outstanding way.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: So not something that will influence you one way or the other really?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: No, sir.
<Q - Jonathan P. Arnold>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: You bet.

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Anthony Crowdell with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question,
<Q - Anthony C. Crowdell>: Thanks. A question on Kemper. In press, some of the utility press had a story on
Monday about the Supreme Court in Mississippi was questioning the constitutionality of the – I guess, the settlement
you entered into last Thursday. Can you provide any color on that?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, Anthony, this is Art. There are a couple of issues at the Supreme Court, one being the
Sierra Club's appeal. There is another issue that is brought by an individual out of Hattiesburg that is challenging the
constitutionality of the Baseload Act. Basically, that would provide for cash CWIP before the plan was operational,
so...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And then the third one was this issue of actually the company – it was really kind of
muted by the company and the commission agreeing to the settlement agreement.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Right.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And in front of the Supreme Court, those folks have basically put that issue in advance.
Our expectation is ultimately, that piece will be dismissed. So, of the three pieces, one has kind have been muted by the
settlement agreement. We think it will be dismissed in the future. The second is an individual from Hattiesburg. On the
other side is the Attorney General of Mississippi. And then the third is just the Sierra Club...
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Sierra Club.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: ...appealing the second amended certificate...
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Right.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: ...which we think is fine.

have a window when they have to give a decision on it?

Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Andrew Weisel with Macquarie Capital. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Hi. It's actually Angie Storozynski. Most of my questions have been asked and answered,
but I have a question regarding the O&M reduction in the fourth quarter. Could you tell us how much of that was
associated with the Hurricane Sandy?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, Angie, there was a number of things that influenced the fourth quarter, and one of
those was – you hit it right on the head, was our sending – I can't remember the number.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: 2,400.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: People up north for – some were there for up to two weeks. So, that helped offset some
O&M that we expected to be spent in our service territory.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That was about a penny, a little under a penny, but you round up to a penny.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Some other issues were bad debt expense was way down. It was not only down in the fourth
quarter, but it was actually down throughout the year, compared to year-over-year. That provided basically another
penny of benefit.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And that was lower bills. So, you had the benefit of lower fuel expense, you had mild
weather, you had personal income growth associated with the economy. So, essentially disposable income went up, bad
debt expense went down.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah. And then there were variety of small accounting adjustments that might add to half a
penny, maybe a little more. I won't go into that detail, but we also had lower O&M than expected. We kind of
back-ended our activities on O&M to the third and fourth quarter, so that's why you saw more of it in the fourth. But
the facts are that, because we ran so much gas generation last year, we were able to push a lot of maintenance outages
that may have been scheduled on some of our coal units, because they just weren't needed as much and we had some
room to work there.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: In fact, what was it? Our Eastern coal units had a capacity factor in the high-20s.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So, they just weren't stressed very much. The other thing is, along with Smart Grid, along
with our smart meters, along with a variety of other initiatives that we have in place, the system is just operating more
efficiently. We make systematic improvements in our business practices, we create optionality in our expenses and I
think our 26,000 employees did a great job.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Okay. Secondly, the share buyback in the fourth quarter, I might have missed that in
previous quarters, have you done that before?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, we were trying to target our – match our equity with what was going on in our
construction program and we target approximately a 44% equity ratio, so in order to get there, we had talked about I

guess two quarters ago, two calls ago, about buying back some of that equity that was being issued to keep us at a
certain target. We ended up the year at a 43.7% equity ratio, which is kind of right where we like to see it. So, we're
right on target with where we expect it.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: And that's the second time we've...
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Okay.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: We also funded our pension of how much?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, that's true. We put $445 million into our pension this year at the end of 2012. Our PBO
funding ratio was at 90% for the pension liability and it's 84% when you throw in the non-qualified liabilities.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So, we're in great shape there.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: So, we're in great shape from that perspective as well.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So, we really took advantage of good performance.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: And my...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Sorry. Go ahead. I'm sorry.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: My last question is, the low growth assumptions. I heard your views on energy efficiency.
Now when you look at the EIA, the Department of Energy's expectations of low growth, I mean, even they expect
about 1% or even slightly below 1%. So, your 1.4% assumption, is that a function of migration into the Southeast?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Weather. EIA does not account for weather. When you account for weather, in fact, if EIA
dials down their national projections for the Southeast and then you account for weather, they are right on where we
are. That's the difference.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: I think it's also to point out that nationally there's a lot of talk about weather being hotter than
normal last year. Actually in the Southeast, it was very mild. So, that's something that's influencing their numbers as
well.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: That's the point.
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: Yeah...
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So when you look at a hot weather year and then you go to a normal weather year, the
assumption would be from the EIA that growth is low. Well, but when we do it, when we strip all the stuff out, and we
can get very granular, I really believe our numbers.
<Q - Angie Storozynski>: I was actually referring to longer-term numbers. But that's fine. Thank you very much.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, that's the same thing. Okay. Thank you.

<Q - Ashar Khan>: Hi. Good afternoon.

rate? I apologize, I might be repeating a question.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: I don't think we really specifically said anything on that front. They were $175 million this
year; we're kind of looking at a $190 million, $175 million, $190 million. We're looking at some projected growth
every year out of those guys. We generally don't comment on anything beyond the current year for them. But you
should expect some continued growth trajectory.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: Okay. So, you're saying this year between $175 million and $190 million?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Yeah, we're going to hold them accountable in their pay for improving on their
performance in 2012.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: Okay. Okay. Because I was just trying to think, right, you're putting in like nearly 15% of your
CapEx dollars into the sub, so there has to be some return coming from that CapEx dollars?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So, it depends on what the projects are. So like if you do solar projects, which typically
are much more kind of near-term oriented in terms of their cash flow as a result of tax benefits, you tend to get more of
a near-term pop. If you're dealing with gas combined cycle, those tend to have a longer construction period and
longer-term profiles. So, it just depends on what kind of projects they do.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: Yeah, but let me ask you, wouldn't you be more inclined to like even my home utility over here in
New York has gone into solar. Isn't like solar and near-term getting that more, something more on your wish list versus
building or getting/acquiring a gas plant?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: You know what? We really like long-term results. We are always cautious as a matter of
corporate dogma, not to invest in tax-advantaged investments as a primary strategy, because that tends to be addictive
behavior.
In order to provide a long-term growth trajectory, you have near-term pops and then you've got to double it for the next
year and double it for the next year and double it for the next year and then you'll find yourself some years, because of
storm activity or a variety of other things, in carry forward positions. And, therefore, your tax benefits aren't worth
what you thought they might be. I don't like particularly tax-advantaged investing as a long-term, good corporate
growth strategy.
The other thing is they could disappear with the hands of Congress at any time, right? We know that we're in a revenue
hungry Congress and how long can Congress afford to hand out preferential treatment to the renewables industry? So,
there will be some tax-advantaged investing in the form of solar investments. I get that, but we really like building
long-term books of business that we've done successfully in the past.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: Okay. Okay. And then can I just – can you just, Tom, I guess there was this cooperation that you
guys did with Turner, right? Where does that stand in this whole scheme of things?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Turner has been a great partner with us in co-investing. I guess, what is the ratio, 90:10?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yes.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: So, we invest 90%, they invest 10%...
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Right.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: ...and they're great guys.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: So, how much investment has gone into that joint venture? Can I ask?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: We don't disclose that.
<Q - Ashar Khan>: Okay. Okay.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: It's not much from their side. I mean, what we do disclose of the projects we've done.

Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board.
Please proceed.
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Hello, Dan.
<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: Hi. How are you?
<A - Thomas A. Fanning>: Excellent. Hope you're well.
<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: Yeah, good except for the snow that's falling up here. I was wondering, when we think about
O&M you talked a little bit about what's going on, but you've also announced a number of plant retirements particularly
in those small coal plants and so forth. And how should we think about that affecting O&M? Will that just be replaced
with some other costs? Or will those costs go away related to those plants?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, they're factored into our plan. They'll disappear as we move through time, but those
units probably have capacity factors that are well below the number Tom mentioned a moment ago. So, their O&M
levels and operation levels aren't very high to begin with. So, they'll be factored into our plans that are reflected in our
earnings growth rate.
<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: Okay. And then I was curious, in your last quarter, you included a couple slides that showed
some upcoming construction for both Vogtle and Ratcliffe, and I just wondered if you could give us an update? Are
those still the key items that we should be thinking about in the first half of 2013? Are there any revisions to those
slides?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Yeah, Dan, Tom already mentioned I think in some of his remarks, we'll begin to finish up
the rebar under these preliminary amendment requests that we have approved by the NRC. We plan to pour first
nuclear concrete sometime in March, and after that, we can set the cradle, which will hold the bottom head and those
are expected to be done in the second quarter of the year. So that will move things within the nuclear island on along a
good bit. So, that's kind of where we expect to go with at least this version of milestones.
<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: And given that you had the shipping problem with the vessel, is that on site yet? Or when
will that be on site?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: I would expect it's going to be on site within the next few weeks, sometime within the
quarter.
<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: When is it critical that it be there to just so we can monitor that?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: It's not critical at all. It's way down the list.
<Q - Daniel F. Jenkins>: Okay. How about with the Ratcliffe? You had a number of items that you listed there?
<A - Arthur P. Beattie>: Well, I think the pictures that we showed you on some of the slides do more justice than any
of those specific descriptions, because you can see just by the pictures alone year-over-year that plant has come a long,
long way. We've got specific work on the gasifiers going on. That's going to be completed sometime within the next
quarter, and that is a critical piece of it. We still have piping that is being installed as well. So, those are kind of the
critical elements at this point.
