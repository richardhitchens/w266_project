Operator
Good morning and welcome to the Johnson & Johnson First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. All participants
will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session of the conference. This call is being recorded. If
anyone has any objections, you may disconnect at this time. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call
over to Johnson & Johnson. You may begin.
Louise Mehrotra
Good morning and welcome. I'm Louise Mehrotra, Vice President of Investor Relations for Johnson & Johnson, and it
is my pleasure this morning to review our business results for the first quarter of 2014. Joining me on the call today is
Dominic Caruso, Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer.
A few logistics before we get into the details. This review is being made available via webcast accessible through the
Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website. I'll begin by briefly reviewing first quarter results for the
corporation and for our three business segments. Following my remarks, Dominic will provide commentary on the
results, including some highlights for the quarter, a review of the income statement and guidance for 2014. We will
then open the call to your questions. Included with the press release that was issued earlier this morning is a schedule of
sales for key products and/or businesses to facilitate updating your models. These schedules are available on the
Johnson & Johnson website as is the press release. Also, please note we will be using a brief presentation to

complement today's commentary. The presentation is also available on our website.
Before we begin, let me remind you that some of the statements made during this review may be considered
forward-looking statements. The 10-K for the fiscal year 2013 identifies certain factors that could cause the company's
actual results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements made today. The company
does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements as result of new information or future events or
developments. The 10-K is available through the company and online.
During the review, non-GAAP financial measures are used to provide information pertinent to ongoing business
performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered replacements for GAAP results. Tables
reconciling these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures are available in the press release and on the
Investor Relations section of the Johnson & Johnson website at investor.jnj.com. A number of the products and
compounds discussed today are being developed in collaboration with strategic partners or licensed from other
companies. This slide lists acknowledgments of those relationships.
Now I would like to review our results for the first quarter of 2014. Worldwide sales to customers were $18.1 billion
for the first quarter of 2014, up 3.5%. On an operational basis, sales were up 5.3%, and currency had a negative impact
of 1.8%. In the U.S., sales were up 2.2%. In regions outside the U.S., our operational growth was 7.9%, while the effect
of currency exchange rates negatively impacted our reported results by 3.4%. On an operational basis,
Asia-Pacific-Africa region grew 10.3%. The Western Hemisphere excluding the U.S. grew by 7.1%, and Europe grew
6.6%. The success of new product launches and continued growth of key products made strong contributions to the
results in all regions.
Turning now to earnings, our earnings were $4.7 billion, up 35.2% compared with the 2013 results. Earnings per share
were $1.64 versus $1.22 a year ago. As referenced in the table reconciling non-GAAP measures, 2014 first quarter net
earnings were adjusted to exclude a net gain of approximately $300 million for after-tax special items. First quarter
2013 net earnings included a net charge of approximately $600 million for after-tax special items. Dominic will discuss
special items in his remarks. Excluding special items for both periods, net earnings for the current quarter were $4.4
billion and diluted earnings per share were $1.54, representing increases of 7.8% and 6.9% respectively as compared to
the same period in 2013.
Turning now to business segment highlights, please note percentages quoted represent operational sales change in
comparison to the first quarter of 2013 unless otherwise stated and therefore exclude the translational impact of
currency.
I'll begin with the Consumer segment. Worldwide Consumer segment sales of $3.6 billion decreased 0.6%, with U.S.
sales down 2.9%, while outside the U.S. sales grew 0.7%. Excluding the impact of divestitures net of acquisitions, both
worldwide and U.S. growth were approximately 1%.
Major drivers of the results were Skin Care and Oral Care, offset by the divestiture of the North America Women's
Health business. Skin Care results were driven by AVEENO and DABAO new product launches supported by robust
marketing campaigns. Oral Care results were driven by results for LISTERINE due to new product launches and
successful marketing campaigns.
OTC sales were negatively impacted by a weaker cold and flu season, partially offset by strong sales of ZYRTEC with
the U.S. launch of Dissolve Tabs, including sales related to the initial stocking.
Moving now to our Pharmaceutical segment, worldwide net sales of $7.5 billion increased 12.2%, with the U.S., up
7.7% and sales outside the U.S. up 16.9%. As a reminder, in the first quarter of 2013, U.S. results included a positive
adjustment to previous estimates for Managed Medicaid rebates under the Affordable Care Act related to new data
received from the states. The most significant impacts from the adjustment were in Immunology, Neuroscience, and
PROCRIT. Excluding this item, 2014 worldwide sales were up over 15%.
In addition, in the early part of last year, the company made certain supply chain changes for REMICADE, resulting in
sales to distributors previously recorded as U.S. export sales now being recorded as international sales. Adjusting the

2013 base to reflect this impact as well as the U.S. Managed Medicaid adjustment, the first quarter 2013 U.S.
Pharmaceutical segment U.S. growth was over 19%, and growth outside the U.S. was approximately 12%.
Pharmaceutical growth was driven in part by our recently launched hepatitis C product called OLYSIO in the U.S. and
SOVRIAD in Japan, contributing over 5% to the worldwide Pharmaceutical growth versus the first quarter of 2013.
Other significant contributors to growth were ZYTIGA, XARELTO, STELARA, INVOKANA, and INVEGA
SUSTENNA or XEPLION, partially offset by lower sales of CONCERTA and ACIPHEX due to generic competition.
The strong results for ZYTIGA in the U.S. were driven by increased market share in the combined metastatic
castrate-resistant prostate cancer market combined with estimated market growth of 10%. ZYTIGA has captured
approximately 34% of that market. The expansion of the label to chemo-naïve patients and continued progress on
reimbursement drove the strong results outside the U.S. ZYTIGA is approved in more than 80 countries.
XARELTO sales doubled compared with the same quarter last year and grew nearly 18% on a sequential basis. Total
prescription share, or TRx, at the end of the quarter in the U.S. oral anticoagulant market grew to 12.5%, with
cardiology TRx estimated at nearly 22%. INVOKANA sales contributed 2.5 points to the U.S. Pharmaceutical growth
rate and at the end of the quarter, achieved 2.1% TRx within the defined market of type 2 diabetes, excluding insulin
and metformin, up from 1.5% in the fourth quarter of 2013.
TRx with endocrinologists grew to 6.6% by the end of the quarter, up over 1% sequentially. Continued momentum and
market share for STELARA complemented by strong market growth drove results in Immunology, while increased
market share drove results for INVEGA SUSTENNA or XEPLION.
I'll now review the Medical Devices and Diagnostics segment results. Worldwide Medical Devices and Diagnostics
segment sales grew 1.8%. U.S. sales declined 1.6%, while sales outside the U.S. increased 4.6%. Growth was driven by
Orthopaedics, Specialty Surgery, Vision Care, and Cardiovascular Care, partially offset by lower sales in Diabetes Care
and Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics. Lower price, primarily related to competitive bidding, continued to impact the
Diabetes Care business in the U.S.
Orthopaedics sales growth was driven by trauma, knees, and hips. Trauma was up 7%, with the U.S. up 10%. In the
U.S., strong market growth and the positive impact of the recovery from the prior-year nail recall was partially offset
by pricing pressure. Knees worldwide increased 3%, with 2% growth in the U.S. and 6% growth outside the U.S.,
driven by the successful launch of the ATTUNE Fixed Bearing Knee, partially offset by price pressure across the
region and softness in the U.S. market.
Hips growth of 2% worldwide was driven by nearly 4% growth in the U.S. due to strong results in primary stem
platform sales, partially offset by continued pricing pressure. Specialty Surgery growth was driven by new products
launched and market growth in our worldwide Biosurgery business and Energy business outside the U.S. as well as
strong sales for both infection prevention and MENTOR products.
Vision Care sales growth is primarily due to a customer inventory build anticipated to reverse in the second quarter.
Cardiovascular growth was driven by 15% worldwide increase in our Biosense Webster business due to new catheter
launches and continued market expansion.
That concludes the segment highlights for Johnson & Johnson's first quarter of 2014. I'll now turn the call over to
Dominic Caruso. Dominic?
Dominic J. Caruso
Thanks, Louise, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with our strong start to 2014, and I believe we are
well positioned for continued growth in this dynamic healthcare environment. As Louise did, I have also added a few
slides to accompany my remarks, which we hope you will find helpful as you are following along on the webcast.
I'll take the next few minutes to review our financial performance and then provide our guidance for you to consider in
refining your models for 2014. But before I do that, I want to comment on what we are seeing in the market for

healthcare. The early first quarter data we've seen so far shows continued softer utilization trends impacted by the
severe winter conditions. The data we have shows continued slight declines in the rates of surgical and lab procedures
in the United States, similar to what we saw over the past 12 months.
Additionally, the strong fourth quarter utilization in orthopaedic procedures softened in the first quarter due to some
seasonality, as we and many of you had expected. Overall, as economic conditions continue to recover and given the
positive democratic demographic trends, we remain confident about the long-term health of the market. And at Johnson
& Johnson, we continue to make very good progress on our near-term priorities of achieving our financial targets,
restoring and relaunching our U.S. OTC products, continuing to capitalize on the potential of DePuy Synthes, and
building on our strong momentum in Pharmaceuticals.
At the same time, we also continue to make good progress on our long-term growth drivers, which we discussed in
detail during our January meeting. During the quarter, we had several key developments across our three business
segments, including key regulatory milestones in the Pharmaceutical and Medical Device segments, and I will mention
a few of them here.
In the Pharmaceuticals segments, these included several CHP [CHMP – Committee for Medicinal Products for Human
Use] recommendations for approvals in Europe for simeprevir, siltuximab and VOKANAMET. VOKANAMET is a
fixed-dose combination product of canagliflozin and metformin for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. As well, we
received FDA approval for the use of IMBRUVICA in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
And in the MD&D segment, Biosense Webster received FDA clearance for the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH, the
first catheter ablation therapy to feature direct contact force technology for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. During
the quarter, we accepted The Carlyle Group's offer to purchase our Clinical Diagnostics business, and we expect that
transaction to close towards the middle of the year. We also made decisions regarding our Consumer portfolio, as we
have signed a definitive agreement to sell global rights for the K-Y brand to Reckitt Benckiser.
If you turn to the next slide, you can see our condensed consolidated statement of earnings for the first quarter. As
Louise has already covered our sales results, I will review some other key points on the balance of the statement of
earnings. Please direct your attention to the boxed section of the schedule where we have provided earnings adjusted to
exclude special items.
We are pleased to report adjusted net earnings of $4.4 billion, which are up 7.8% over the first quarter of 2013, and
adjusted earnings per share of $1.54 versus $1.44 a year ago, up nearly 7%, which exceeded the mean of the analyst
estimates as published by First Call.
As referenced in the table of non-GAAP measures, the 2014 first quarter net earnings were adjusted to exclude a net
after-tax gain of approximately $300 million for special items, which consisted of the following: a charge for in-process
research and development related to the discontinuation of the development program for Purtox, continued costs
associated with the integration of Synthes; and finally, during the first quarter a capital loss was realized for tax
purposes on the sale of shares associated with Conor Medsystems, which resulted in a tax benefit of approximately
$400 million. The value of the Conor business was previously written down for book purposes.
Now let's take a few moments to talk about the other items on the statement of earnings. I'm pleased to point out that
we saw very good operating performance in our results. Cost of goods sold at 30.1% of sales was 160 basis points
lower than the same period last year. Included in last year's cost of goods sold was the inventory step-up associated
with the Synthes acquisition, which we characterized as a special item.
Excluding this, cost of goods sold was lower by 80 basis points, reflecting the mix of our results this quarter, which
were driven primarily by our Pharmaceutical business as well as cost improvements across many businesses. This was
partially offset by the impact of the weakening of the Japanese yen, which we discussed as a headwind for 2014,
although that negative impact to gross margin will increase throughout 2014.
Selling, marketing and administrative expenses were 28.6% of sales, or 120 basis points lower as compared with the
first quarter of 2013, again, due to the growth in our Pharmaceutical business of new products and overall good

management of cost, primarily our MD&D businesses. Our investment in research and development as a percent of
sales was 10.1% at a similar level as we saw in the prior year as we continued to make important investments for the
future.
Overall, our pre-tax operating margin when excluding special items was 31.2%, or 200 basis points higher than the
prior year, a strong performance early in the year but not fully reflective of the investment plans we have for the
remainder of the year or the headwind related to the weakening of the Japanese yen as I noted earlier.
Interest expense net of interest income of $118 million was slightly higher than the prior-year period due in part to
higher average debt levels. In other expenses net of other income was a net charge of $86 million in the quarter
compared to a net charge of $515 million in the same period last year. Excluding the special items that are reflected in
this line item, other expenses net of other income was actually a gain of $32 million compared to a net gain of $83
million in the prior-year period.
Excluding special items, the effective tax rate was 20.4% compared to 19% in the same period last year. This effective
tax rate is higher than our guidance for two reasons. First, it does not yet reflect the benefit of the R&D tax credit, as
that legislation has not yet been passed. And secondly, the mix of our business this quarter, which reflects a higher
portion of our earnings from the U.S. driven primarily by the success of our new Pharmaceutical product launches.
Now I will provide some guidance for you to consider as you refine your models for 2014. Before I discuss sales and
earnings, I will first give some guidance on items we know are difficult to forecast, beginning with cash and interest
income and expense. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $12 billion of net cash, which consist of
approximately $29 billion of cash and marketable securities and approximately $17 billion of debt.
For purposes of your models, assuming no major acquisitions or other major uses of cash, I suggest you consider
modeling net interest expense of between $400 million and $500 million, consistent with our previous guidance.
Regarding other income and expense, as a reminder, this is the account where we record royalty income as well as
gains and losses arising from such items as litigation, investments by our development corporation as well as
divestitures, asset sales and write-offs. We would be comfortable with your models reflecting 2014 other income and
expense excluding special items as a net gain, ranging from approximately $600 million to $700 million, this is
consistent with our previous guidance.
And now a word on taxes, our guidance for 2014 anticipates that the R&D tax credit will be renewed by Congress,
although that has not yet occurred. We would be comfortable with your models reflecting an effective tax rate for 2014,
excluding special items, of approximately 19% to 20%. If the R&D tax credit is not approved, it will negatively impact
the tax rate by approximately 0.5%. This guidance is higher than our previous guidance, reflecting a change in the mix
of our business resulting in a higher portion of our earnings in the United States. As always, we will continue to pursue
opportunities in this area to improve upon this rate throughout the year.
Now turning to sales and earnings, as I noted earlier, we have received and accepted a binding offer for our
Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics business of approximately $4 billion. We expect the transaction to close midyear and that
the resulting gain will be treated as a special item. As of today, we are considering how to best allocate the net after-tax
proceeds from the divestiture. As is our practice with acquisitions and divestitures, we will update our guidance after
the transaction closes to reflect the impact this divestiture could have on our sales and EPS, excluding special items, for
the remainder of the year. Therefore, our guidance today will not include the impact of this transaction. However, at
this time, we believe that any such impact will be certainly absorbed within the range of EPS guidance we are
providing today.
Our sales and earnings guidance for 2014 takes into account several assumptions that I highlighted to you in January.
Let me just review those briefly now. Those key assumptions are for sales, our assumption for PROCRIT is that there
will not be biosimilar competition in 2014 and for INVEGA SUSTENNA and RISPERDAL CONSTA, we do not
anticipate generic entries for these products this year.
And as for earnings, there are several factors to note. First, some comments about foreign currency fluctuations that
impact real economic transactions as opposed to only translation, which I will discuss later.

As we highlighted in January, the Japanese yen devalued by approximately 25% versus the U.S. dollar and the euro in
2013. The impact of the yen devaluation on 2013 results was not significant because of our policy of hedging foreign
currency transactions 12 months to 18 months in advance. However, the impact of the devaluation is a significant
headwind in 2014, and our 2014 guidance reflects a negative impact to gross margin of approximately 60 basis points,
or a negative impact to EPS of approximately $0.11 per share. In the event of a significant devaluation of any other
major currency such as the Venezuelan bolívar, we will look to mitigate that impact depending on the magnitude of that
impact. However, such a potential devaluation of the bolívar or any other currency is not reflected in our guidance.
We also expect continued pricing pressure in 2014 across many markets, particularly in Europe. The impact of this
negative pricing pressure is expected to negatively impact our pre-tax operating margin by approximately 50 basis
points. So as we've done for several years now, our guidance will be based first on a constant currency basis reflecting
our results from operations. This is the way we manage our business and we believe this provides a good understanding
of the underlying performance of our business.
We will also provide an estimate of our sales and EPS results for 2014 with the impact that current exchange rates
could have on the translation of those results. As of last week, the euro had strengthened versus the U.S. dollar as
compared to 2013 average levels, however, many other currencies have weakened versus the U.S. dollar, such as the
Canadian dollar and the Brazilian real as compared to their average levels for 2013.
Considering the factors I just noted, we would be comfortable with your models reflecting an operational sales increase
on a constant currency basis of between 5% and 6% for the year. This would result in sales for 2014 on a constant
currency basis of approximately $74.9 billion to $75.7 billion. We are not predicting the impact of currency movements
but to give you an idea of the potential impact on sales if currency exchange rates for all of 2014 were to remain where
they were as of last week, then our sales growth rate would decrease by nearly 0.5%. Plus under this scenario, we
would expect reported sales growth to range between 4.5% at 5.5%, for a total expected level of reported sales between
$74.5 billion to $75.3 billion, which is higher than our previous guidance.
Now turning to earnings. Our earnings guidance reflects the major assumptions I noted earlier and reflects the strong
performance we saw in the first quarter and our plans to continue investing in future growth. Considering those factors,
we suggest that you consider full-year 2014 EPS estimates, excluding the impact of special items, of between $5.74 and
$5.84 per share on an operational or constant currency basis.
And again, we're not predicting the impact of currency movements but to give you an idea of the potential impact on
earnings per share if exchange rates for all of 2014 were to remain where they were as of last week, then our reported
EPS, excluding special items, would be positively impacted by approximately $0.06 per share due solely to exchange
rate fluctuations. We therefore suggest that you model our reported EPS, excluding special items, in the range between
$5.80 and $5.90 per share for a growth rate of between 5% and 7%. This is higher than our previous guidance.
As you update your models for the guidance that I just provided, you will see that we do expect that our pre-tax
operating margins will show a stronger improvement in 2014 over 2013 levels than we had previously expected,
although not at the level we saw in the first quarter despite the negative impact of the devaluation of the yen on our
gross margins and the expected pricing pressures. This is due to the strong performance of our business, primarily
driven by new product launches and continued management focus on our operating expenses. You should also see that
our net income margin will expand despite the increase in our effective tax rate.
In closing, we are very pleased with our strong results for the first quarter of the year, the breadth of our business,
which provides balance and consistency to our overall performance, as well as the extraordinary achievements and
dedication of our talented people around the world positions us well to sustain and drive growth throughout the year.
Thank you. And now I'd like to turn things back to Louise for the Q&A portion of the program.

Thank you, Dominic. Stephanie, could you please provide the instructions for the Q&A session?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with JPMorgan.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Morning, Mike.
<Q - Mike J. Weinstein>: Thank you and good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. So, Dominic, if I take it
back to three months ago at the Analyst Meeting and even on our subsequent call in February, I pushed a little bit on
the sales guidance for the year. And I thought at the time you were being conservative, and now you've come in here
and you reported a better than expected first quarter and you raised your guidance for the year. So can you talk a little
bit about from the January call to today, what has increased your confidence? And how much of that is from OLYSIO,
which obviously had a much stronger quarter this quarter? And can you talk about that product's performance and its
sustainability? Thanks.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure, Mike. You're right. You did challenge us on that presumed level of conservativism. I
would say just as a way of background, we're trying to forecast new product sales in a dynamic healthcare environment
and we're also trying to forecast various economic trends and utilization rates in the marketplace. So we do our best to
give you our sense of what we're seeing at the time. What we're seeing now is a better overall sense of the launch,
particularly the launch of the new products within Pharma.
And OLYSIO, as you pointed out, has done remarkably well. Yes, it's done better than we expected. It's primarily due
to the fact that the Liver Society [American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases] issued guidelines in January
recommending the use of OLYSIO along with the product from Gilead, SOVALDI. And that has been adopted by the
community, by the medical community as a standard of care based on the liver guidelines of the Society of Liver
Specialists [American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases] guidelines. So that's something that we learned after
our guidance. We saw it take off and we are very pleased with the results. And if you look at the total increase in our
sales guidance, which is about roughly $1 billion, I would say the majority of that is due to the fact that OLYSIO now
is performing much better than our earlier expectations, and we're very pleased with that. And obviously, more patients
are gaining the benefit of utilizing this new therapy.
As far as sustainability is considered, I think you know that there are competitive products on the horizon. The goal of
searching for interferon-free therapy seems like it will be a reality, and there are products that are expected to be
approved later this year. So we'll have to wait and see whether those products are in fact approved. Then of course we'll
reassess the long-term outlook for OLYSIO given any new product or new competition. Just as a reminder, we are also
studying OLYSIO in a Phase III clinical trial along with SOVALDI, so we'll have that data after that trial has
concluded, and that will give us a better idea of the overall sustainability as well.
<Q - Mike J. Weinstein>: And, Dominic, just one follow-up on the EPS guidance for the year. It sounded to me what
you were saying on the FX line that there was another $0.06 of earnings cushion or upside based on real-time FX rates
if they were to hold that you were not including in the guidance. I wondered if that's right. And two, I assume that
would offset the impact of the OCD divestiture. Is that a fair way to look at it?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: No, Mike. Let me just reiterate that. So the $0.06 that I referred to as the benefit from
exchange rates versus last year is related to simply we gave guidance on an operational constant currency basis of $5.74
to $5.84. But then when you consider the uptick in exchange rates, particularly the euro, that will benefit that constant
currency range by $0.06. And therefore we've increased our guidance by that $0.06 to $5.80 to $5.90, or a midpoint of
say $5.85 compared to the midpoint in January of $5.80. The overall increase in FX impact between those two
guidance points is only about $0.01. It was about $0.05 in the January discussion and just about $0.06 now.

<Q - Mike J. Weinstein>: Got you. But the OCD piece, you're indicating that you will absorb that dilution or do you
expect to when that occurs?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: We expect that given the strength of the business today and the range of guidance we've
provided, assuming the transaction closes at midyear, we believe that any remaining negative impact from not having
those earnings for the balance of the year would certainly be absorbed within the range of guidance we've now just
provided for earnings per share.

Your next question is from the line of Matthew Dodds with Citigroup.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matthew J. Dodds>: So, Dominic, on the SG&A, usually it looks like the first quarter does start low as a percent
and then it gets higher during the year, but you're starting at a much lower base this year. Is there anything in particular
this quarter, or is the cost-cutting expense control going to be lower this year as you move through the year even though
the percent goes up?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: I think a couple things. One is we're starting the first quarter with tremendous growth from
new product launches in Pharma. They don't have a pro rata increase in SG&A from the prior year. Secondly, we have
implemented some cost reductions and combined some businesses in the MD&D sector of our business to better
compete in the current dynamic marketplace. And thirdly, we do have a number of programs, as we've talked about
before and Alex spoke about in January to overall streamline some operations and not only reduce some costs but also
get more focus and more simplicity and agility into our operations.
So I think all of those things will help and would result in SG&A being lower this year as compared to last year
although, as you pointed out, we haven't yet invested everything we would like to invest for the balance of the year. So
my guidance does include the fact that we would ramp up some investment in the balance of the year which is not yet
included in the first quarter results.
<Q - Matthew J. Dodds>: And just quickly on Europe, you grew it looks like organically, around 7%. Can you just
say probably, was that mostly driven by Pharma, or did MD&D, Consumer do okay in Europe? And how's the Europe
trend been in those businesses, or how was it in the first quarter?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: I think that we obviously benefited from strong growth of new product launches in Europe
in the Pharmaceutical business. I don't think there's anything in particular to point out in any of the other businesses.
There's nothing substantially positive or negative in the Europe business. I would say it's primarily driven by the
Pharmaceutical launches in Europe.
<Q - Matthew J. Dodds>: Thanks, Dominic.

<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning, Kristen.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Good morning. I was just wondering if you could just explain the tax benefit associated
with Conor Medsystems, why that was – it was included within this quarter's results. Did you do something, sell part of
that business?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure, Kristen. Just to remind you, we excluded it from our ongoing operating results. So the
earnings excluding special items of $1.54 exclude this benefit, just to be clear. It's reported in the overall GAAP results
of $1.64. That's primarily why the GAAP results are higher. So that business was the business we acquired for the next
generation of drug-eluting stents several years ago, and you know we pulled out of that business. We wrote down the
assets associated with that business previously. And when we took that write-down for book purposes, we also
excluded that from our ongoing earnings and recorded it as a special item.
Now what happened in this past quarter is the underlying shares of the business that we bought, we bought the stock of
that company, we sold that company along with its related intellectual property, and as part of that sale, we recognized,
for tax purposes, a capital loss. That capital loss generates, as you know, a tax benefit and so we thought it'd be prudent
to record that tax benefit as a special item because it essentially offsets the previous write-down for book purposes,
which was also a special item.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: And the sale was this quarter and can you comment who you sold it to?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: We did sell it this quarter and no, we're not going to comment on who the sale is to.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. And then can you maybe just provide a little bit more color just in terms of what
you were seeing within the Medical Device business? I know you commented on lower utilization trends, but then also
commented on expectations I guess for things to improve within Orthopaedics, but any additional color just on the U.S.
markets?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure. So what we saw in the U.S. markets, as I commented in my script, was a similar type
of year-over-year decline in the rate of utilization, particularly hospital admissions as well as lab procedures. So these
have been trending now for the past year or so at minor downticks in quarter – year-over-year growth in the quarter or
depression in utilization in the prior year. So we saw that continue in the first quarter.
With respect to Orthopaedics in particular, we did expect – I think many you all expected that the higher utilization in
the fourth quarter wasn't a result of seasonality primarily related to the health plans and also probably some influence
from the Affordable Care Act rush to get coverage and maybe some confusion over what was happening in the
marketplace. So in particular, the orthopaedic trends did slow down in the first quarter compared with the fourth
quarter. And we saw this very same phenomenon a year ago, so it's now become quite a seasonal business from that
perspective, that we see a real uptick at the back end of the year and then a slowdown in the early part of the year.
The only other thing I would say that in the Medical Device business more broadly, we did see some softer trends in
elective procedures, we think, in the U.S. That's probably due to the winter conditions, the severe winter conditions.
We don't have any exact data on that fact but, anecdotally, that's what it appears has impacted the utilization rates in the
first quarter slightly as far as the data we have's concerned.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay, thanks very much.

<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Hi, Larry.
<Q - Larry H. Biegelsen>: Morning. Thanks for taking the question. So maybe for Dominic or Louise, you guys have
a pretty robust late-stage Pharma pipeline again. I count six Phase III products right now. Could you maybe talk about
the key pipeline milestones we should look for in 2014 on the Pharma side?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure. Louise, maybe you could help with any particular milestones we have. So we have –
we obviously have IMBRUVICA, for example, has a number of new indications that we're studying. Some have
already been approved, as you know, but there's a series of new indications being studied for IMBRUVICA, and
hopefully, we'll hear some of that this year. Simeprevir is also being studied, as I mentioned earlier, in a Phase III trial
along with SOVALDI. And I don't know that there's anything in particular that's a data – or a conference where data
will be disclosed or provided in the near term but, Louise, you might have more on that.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Yes. So we'd announced that the RESONATE data for IMBRUVICA should be shown this
quarter at ASCO. There are also a significant number of abstracts scheduled to be shown for INVOKANA. But at this
point, I'm not going to be able to give you the specific conferences because they haven't been published at this point in
time. We're also waiting for the fixed-dose combination for INVOKANA. That would be something to watch out for
this year as well.
<Q - Larry H. Biegelsen>: Right. Thanks. That's very helpful, and then one last question. Emerging market growth
this quarter, Dominic, can you talk about what you saw there or BRIC growth? Thanks, then I'll drop.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure, so for BRIC growth this quarter, we saw about 13% growth in the BRIC markets; and
for the broader emerging markets, about 7% growth.

Your next question is from the line of Jami Rubin, Goldman Sachs.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning, Jami.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Hi, Jami.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Good morning, just a couple of follow-up questions. Did you – the OLYSIO numbers, was there a
stock change in that $354 million? And I don't know if you disclosed the IMBRUVICA numbers. And then just a
question on sort of general pricing that we've seen in MD&D. I think you said several times during your prepared
remarks that growth in Orthopaedics was offset by pricing pressure, particularly in hips and knees. So I guess it sounds
like utilization trends have worsened a bit. Have pricing trends worsened? And
what are your expectations for pricing for the remainder of the year? Thanks.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Okay, why don't we – Louise has all the facts in front of her so I'll let her take that question.
Go ahead.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Okay. So for OLYSIO in the U.S., I only have data for in the U.S., it's about 20% of the sales
were inventory build. So the majority of it was certainly flowing through out to the patients, which is good news for the
patients. Regarding the hips and knees pricing, I can get that number to you. In the – this is again U.S. commentary –
the price change for hips was negative 4.1% in the first quarter, offset by a very modest positive mix to net of the 3.7%

negative. That is slightly negative versus the fourth quarter of 2013. We also, for the knees, we have a 2.4% negative
price offset by about a 2% positive mix for net of a 0.06% negative for knees, which is very similar to the first quarter –
the fourth quarter of 2013.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: So what about IMBRUVICA?
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: So IMBRUVICA we did report a little modest bit of sales on that but we're going to leave the
IMBRUVICA comments for Pharmacyclics in their call because it's actually from the U.S.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Okay. And just, Dominic, can you comment on pricing
expectations going forward? Do you expect this to stabilize, worsen, get better?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: So in January, when we provided guidance in January, we said that we thought that
negative pricing pressures particularly in Europe would impact our pre-tax operating margin by about 50 basis points.
We still see that, so we don't think it's got any worse. So we're consistently seeing the same type of pricing pressure we
saw when we developed our plans for 2014. So no change in our expectation.

Your next question is from the line of Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Morning, Glenn.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Hi. Good morning, guys. I just wanted to follow up on the comment about U.S. knee
softness. So in February here in the U.S., we did have bad weather and that may have contributed, given the fact that
ATTUNE is still having a very strong rollout. So I'm wondering did you see your volumes in knees, and maybe even
hips too, did they improve throughout the quarter? So in other words, February was hit because of weather and then
these patients came back in March? Or if there is a weather impact, are we going to have these patients come back
more in the second quarter? That's my first question.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: So to frame the weather impact, I also want to pick up the additional selling days. So in
recon, we had one additional selling day. It's very specific to recon. It does not include trauma. And that pretty much
offset the impact of the harsh weather. So net-net, there was no impact, we believe, to the knees and hips because of
that combination. But when you look back at – I went and looked at last year's seasonality, in knees we had about a 5%
seasonality, and in hips, we had about a 2% seasonality, which is very similar trends to what we're seeing in this
quarter. As far as January, February and March, we don't go into that detail of the monthly sales.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Okay. And sticking on Ortho, can you give us the spine results? You didn't give us the spine
results in your commentary, maybe U.S. and global spine revenues and any pricing commentary.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Okay. So spine in the U.S. on an operational basis is down about 3%. OUS is up about 4%,
for a flat on a worldwide basis. And in terms of price, it's down – again, this is U.S. only – it's down 3% in price, slight
positive mix for a net of down 0.8% in terms of price/mix. And that's much less negative than it was in the fourth
quarter.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Yeah. Okay. That's great. Then let me slip in one question. Just on the fixed-dose
combination with INVOKANA because I believe you had a complete response letter recently. So what's changed in
terms of – it sounds like you're a little bit more confident that we make get approval this year. So I'm just curious. Was
there more data, or what's changed in your view on the fixed-dose combo?

Your next question is from the line of Derrick Sung, Sanford Bernstein.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Morning, Derrick.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Hi, Derrick.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Going back to gross margins, I appreciate some of the
qualitative commentary you gave there, Dominic, on the increase in the impact from the yen moving out to the year.
Was just wondering if you could maybe give us a better sense this quarter of what the impact from the devaluation of
the yen was. And also how much of the strength is coming from OLYSIO in the Pharma product launches that might
sort of carry through the rest of the year?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Yeah, sure, sure, Derrick. Well, as we said in our overall guidance both in January and
today, we expect the impact of the devaluation of the yen to impact gross margins for the year about 60 basis points.
And I said that it would accelerate through the balance of the year just because of the way the transactions were
hedged. In the first quarter alone, we estimate that, that impact was only about 20 basis points negative to gross margin.
So we haven't yet seen the full impact of the yen devaluation. And with respect to overall gross margin performance,
even excluding that, primarily driven by the mix of the business because, of course, our Pharmaceutical business is our
highest gross margin business and that's delivered most of the growth this quarter. And yes, in fact, that growth in gross
margin has been positively impacted by the sales of OLYSIO.
<Q - Derrick Sung>: Thank you. But in the Consumer business, that was the one area that came in a little weaker than
we expected, particularly OTC, Baby Care, Wound Care were the kind of three categories that kind of missed our
estimates. Just more broadly speaking, I was wondering if you could kind of talk to us strategically about plans to
accelerate growth in that business. Can you get that business back up to sort of market growth? And also, how can we
think about the margins in that business now that it seems that most of the OTC products are back on the market? Can
we expect to see any sort of margin leverage from that business?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure, Derrick. Well, just to give you an overall perspective on the Consumer business, as
Louise mentioned, the business was impacted by tough comparisons because of the Women's Health products that we
divested. So the overall growth, excluding divestitures and even excluding some acquisitions that we did, was about 1%
in the quarter. Couple things to note about that 1%, that last year's first quarter of the year 2013 was a very strong cold
and flu season, and despite the severe winter conditions, this was actually a very weak cold and flu season. We think
that has, overall, 1 point or 1.5 points of growth impact between the two periods. So the underlying business, excluding
those impacts, is about 2.5%. We did in fact, as you know, launch the products back into the marketplace in early 2013.
We're very pleased with the uptake, it was showing double-digit consumption growth in the products, and of course,
we've launched some new products such as ZYRTEC quick-dissolving tablets.

So overall, we're pleased with the progress that the Consumer business is making overall. We have great plans in place
to launch new products and, overall, the margins, as you point out, should improve as we complete the work with the
consent decree which we expect will approach completion towards the end of this year or early next year. So after that,
we would then expect to see the overall margins improve as the business recovers from that activity and obviously the
new products take hold in the marketplace.

Your next question is from the line of Rick Wise with Stifel.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Morning, Rick.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Hi, Rick.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Hi, Louise. Hi, Dominic. Couple questions, Dominic, just one bigger picture question, political
turmoil, trade issues rising in Russia, can you remind us what percentage of your sales are in Russia or in that region of
the world? And are you concerned – is this an incremental concern for the rest of the year at all?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure. So let me give you sort of a sense for Russia. So we said the growth for the BRIC
markets overall was about 13% this quarter and the growth within Russia was at mid single-digit growth. Now if I look
back, first quarter of 2013, our Russia growth was actually negative in the first quarter of 2013. And that has to do with
the timing of tenders within the Russian market, so there's lots of fluctuations.
The only thing we've seen so far that's a little bit of a concern is that there does appear to be some funding restrictions
in governmental buying patterns with respect to capital budgets in the hospitals but overall, it's not a very significant
piece of the overall business. With respect to our total BRIC business, it's relatively a small piece of the business,
obviously, China and Brazil drive the majority of our growth and the majority of our business in the BRIC markets
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Okay. And one other question, Dominic, I mean with the sale of Diagnostics, it's hard not to
reflect on the rest of the portfolio and look around for other underperformers, and I know you're doing that all the time,
but Diabetes comes quickly to mind. I appreciate that you're going to anniversary the price cut in this summer, maybe
in the third quarter, but maybe talk about the Diabetes outlook. What changes as we get past that anniversary? And are
you taking a harder look at underperformers like Diabetes? Do you need to be in this business longer term for the rest
of the franchise, or is there something that maybe you could carve out at some point? Thanks, Dominic.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Okay. Sure, Rick, just a few comments on Diabetes overall and our approach to portfolio
analysis. Alex, as you may remember, has been very clear about some of the criteria we use to analyze the portfolio.
One criteria is, are you number one or number two in your market or do you have the technological wherewithal, the
technology, et cetera, new products that could propel you to that number one or number two spot; and lastly, are you
complementary to any of our other businesses.
So with respect to Diabetes, despite the significant pricing pressure in the market overall, all companies have faced this,
the Diabetes business is a market leader. They have very strong market share positions. The business is doing very well
outside the U.S. It continues to grow nicely and also it is very complementary to other parts of our business. We
attribute the successful launch of INVOKANA partly to the fact that we have very good relationships with the
endocrinologists as a result of our LifeScan business already. So at this point, we haven't made any decisions with
respect to any other portfolio choices. But the Diabetes business is well positioned overall in the marketplace, and it is
complementary to a significant part of our other business.

<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Maybe just to follow up, Dominic, I apologize. With $3 billion in cash and significantly more
likely all things equal by year end, any updated thoughts on capital allocation, acquisition, share buyback? Thanks so
much.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure, Rick. So just to correct you, I think you said $3 billion in cash, it's actually nearly $30
billion.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: $30 billion, yes.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: No change in the way we look at it. We've been very consistent with this approach. We
think that looking first at our dividend, and we'll obviously know more about the dividend at the annual shareholders
meeting in a couple weeks. After that, we look to invest for growth and for value creation so that we're appropriately
generating returns commensurate with the risk associated with putting our investors' capital to work. And then finally,
after exhausting those possibilities, we then look to share repurchases if they're at the right time, so no change in our
overall approach. We think it's a very good approach. We consistently follow it. It's proved to be successful in overall
balance of both returns to shareholders and investing in growth over the long term; so as of now, no changes in our
approach and nothing else to report.

Your next question is from the line of Matt Miksic with Piper Jaffray.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matt S. Miksic>: Hi, thanks. So just one follow-up detailed question here that I don't think you provided, and
then I have a question on Consumer. So in your remarks, Louise, I think you had not covered the Trauma detail. I'd
love to get some color as to exactly what happened there.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Okay. So the U.S. growth is 10%. The OUS growth is 4%, for a total of 7% operational
growth. In terms of the pricing, pricing was about 0.7% negative in the quarter, and that's the first time we've actually
seen that. It was more than offset by a positive mix of about 2.5%. So net-net, the price/mix in the U.S. was about 1.8%
favorable. It's slightly favorable versus the fourth quarter 2013.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: One thing I'd add to that is I think that the Trauma team has done a remarkable job
recovering from the nail recall that happened. And so they deserve to be congratulated for bringing the product back to
the market. And of course, patients are better for it and our customers should have the confidence in us to be able to do
that, and we've demonstrated that their confidence is well earned.
<Q - Matt S. Miksic>: Great, thank you for that. And then on Consumer, I guess we didn't spend much time here in
Q&A talking about it, but that had been a topic of some discussion over the past couple years. You've made some
changes there and you announced this licensing arrangement around K-Y. I'd love to get a sense of maybe strategically
how you're thinking about that business, particularly as it relates to that $30 billion in cash that you have outstanding
there.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure, Matt. Just to clarify with Consumer, we basically – we did enter into an agreement to
sell the K-Y brand to Reckitt. That transaction should close in the second quarter. That was a strategic portfolio
decision. We're looking at the portfolio in Consumer as we look at the portfolio in each of our businesses and obviously
through the filters that I've just described earlier. And with respect to the utilization of our cash, the Consumer
business, like any of our other businesses, MD&D or Consumer (sic) [Pharmaceuticals], competes for capital in the
same way.

We look at strategically where we should be investing the capital and then, of course, whether or not that allocation of
capital will give us an appropriate rate of return given the risk involved. So we don't treat the businesses any differently
except for a change in the risk-adjusted rate of return that's required based on the obvious risk involved. That's different
between the businesses. So there are no specific plans with respect to the $30 billion, as I mentioned earlier in answer
to Rick's question.
<Q - Matt S. Miksic>: Can I push you just a little bit on that, Dominic?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure.
<Q - Matt S. Miksic>: I thought I remembered there was a time when we thought of Consumer, Pharma, MD&D as a
three-legged stool and Consumer being the shorter leg of that stool. Is there still thinking that you'll work to try to make
this a more balanced divisional portfolio?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: So let me just comment a little bit on that, Matt. When we look at the three-legged stool,
we're thinking of a broadly based healthcare business across many aspects of the healthcare marketplace, both
Consumer, Medical Devices, and Pharma. The relative percent that each of those businesses represents as a percent of
the total in the pie, if you will, is really the result of decisions previously made. There's no forward-looking
predetermined mix that we think is appropriate. Each and every investment is evaluated on its own merits. And the mix,
today it's 40%/40%/20%, is the result of making the investment decisions we've already made. So as we make other
investment decisions with appropriate risk/return profile, that mix might change, but there's no predetermined picture of
the pie that we think is ideal.
<Q - Matt S. Miksic>: Helpful. Thank you.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Okay, you're welcome.

Your next question is from the line of Jeff Holford with Jefferies.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning, Jeff.
<Q - Jeffrey Holford>: Thanks for taking my questions. So just a bit more color on OLYSIO, can you give us a bit
more color on the usage of this product? Do you have any information about how much of it is being used in
combination with which products?
Secondly, I don't know if I heard you break out INVOKANA sales yet. If you can, give us any color either on the
actual sales or how much it contributed to growth as you've done previously. And then just lastly, if you can, update us
on the reexamination of the REMICADE patent and just what kind of visibility you might have out there on the
potential timeline for biosimilar introductions? Thank you.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Sure, Jeff. With OLYSIO, as I mentioned earlier, the guidelines from the Liver Society was
very clear that recommended usage in conjunction with SOVALDI, the new product from Gilead, we did see sales tick
up right after those guidelines were issued. So we don't have all the specific information that I could share with you
now, but we do believe a large majority of the sales are in combination with SOVALDI, an apparently interferon-free
regimen.
I'm going to skip INVOKANA and let Louise talk about that. There's nothing we can report on the examination of the
REMICADE patent. No new information. And with respect to biosimilars, we don't really see any biosimilar impact in
the U.S. And we have seen biosimilar impact outside the U.S. but it's been very modest with REMICADE from the
product that has been approved to date, which is called what, Louise?
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: REMSIMA.

<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Yes. But it's very, very modest and I think that has to do with, generally speaking,
biosimilars are not expected to have the dramatic impact of change in the marketplace as you see in small molecules,
for a number of reasons that I'm sure you're aware of. And with respect to INVOKANA, Louise?
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: In my prepared remarks, I said it contributed 2.5 points to the U.S. growth rate.

Your next question is from the line of Danielle Antalffy with Leerink Partners.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Morning, Danielle.
<Q - Danielle J. Antalffy>: Morning, everyone. Thanks so much for taking the question. I just wanted to, if I could,
follow up on Rick's question regarding capital allocation and more specifically focus on M&A. Dominic, I know you've
touched on it a few times this morning but I guess, specifically, not really related to predetermined mix of businesses,
but where do you see the most meaningful areas of interest for J&J, the highest growth profiles of markets where you're
not currently participating? And how do you see deals going down from here on out, knowing that Synthes was the
largest acquisition ever but it looks like you're largely integrated at this point? So any more color there? What markets
are interesting to J&J that you're not participating in? And sort of how big of an acquisition would you guys make from
here on out?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Danielle, let me just comment a little bit on our strategies. So again, we want to participate
in the fastest-growing segments of healthcare, and we want to do so in a meaningful way where the asset would be
better in our hands as opposed to the hands of current owner. But having said that, regardless of the growth trajectory
of the market or the asset, the valuations have to be right. So today, for me to give you any indication on which markets
we'd be more interested than others, we'd sort of leave out the corresponding equally important characterization of
whether or not the valuations are appropriate. So I can't really comment today on that very specifically.
And also with respect to size of transactions, we've done hundreds of acquisitions over the last 15 years or 20 years,
and just about a dozen or so have been over $1 billion. And very few, Pfizer Consumer Healthcare, ALZA, Synthes, of
course, have been in excess of $10 billion. So it is pretty rare for us to do a large acquisition like that, not because we
have any particular predisposition to not doing it, but because, as I said earlier, the valuation has to be right, the asset
has to be better in our hands than in the hands of the previous owner and therefore, and obviously the premium to be
paid has to be sensible. And then we are already broadly based in human healthcare so there are very few areas that we
need tremendously significantly greater presence.
Having said that, a lot of our capital is in fact allocated to pharmaceutical licensing and collaborations, which we think
is an enormous benefit to us because it's the most efficient allocation of capital. We take some risk afterwards but we
don't put the capital out on day one, obviously, we do it through the development program that we control. So that's the
way we think about it. I'm sorry I can't give you any more specifics today with respect to any markets or specifics
beyond what I just said.
<Q - Danielle J. Antalffy>: No, that's helpful. Thanks, Dominic. I guess just a follow-up on that, specifically to the
Medical Devices, as you mentioned recently, you've allocated a lot of capital to the Pharma business. I know that you
acquired Synthes, that was a big acquisition for you guys, how do we think about the outlook for the Medical Device
business relative to Pharma? I mean Pharma's really been the engine driving growth for J&J. Is that for – how the
future for the company looks, that Pharma will be the engine going forward and Devices are there to sort of generate
cash? Or how do we think about how the med tech business continues to fit into the broader J&J business?

<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Okay, so that's a great question. So as you know, we think of ourselves as a broadly based
company in healthcare and you think of the MD&D business, we have – we're the largest MD&D player in the market,
so we obviously have quite a significant presence in the hospitals. And that as you know, is a very important part of the
overall healthcare system. So Johnson & Johnson is best positioned in medical devices, I believe, than any other
medical device player given what's happening in the market, with respect to hospitals and I'll specifically speak of the
U.S., with the advent of the Affordable Care Act and the accountable care organizations, we're working to not only
remain the largest player in medical devices but to take advantage of that position in the hospital setting with respect to
providing total solutions for the marketplace.
So it's a very important part of our business, it does drive substantial cash flows for the business. In the past, it's been a
significant contributor to growth for new products. I'm confident it will also be a significant contributor of growth for
new products in the future as well. And we have an upcoming Medical Device Business Review coming up May 22
and you'll hear Gary Pruden and Michel Orsinger specifically talk about the surgery in the Orthopaedics business and
the plans there, and I look forward to sharing that information with you then.
<Q - Danielle J. Antalffy>: Thanks so much.

Your next question is from the line of Josh Jennings with Cowen and Company.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Good morning, Josh.
<Q - Joshua Jennings>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Dominic, it's clear that Pharma was the
driver for the margin performance in Q1 and also for your updated guidance, and it sounds like Consumer, there's some
room here as you work through the consent decree for some margin expansion as well in that unit. Can you speak
specifically to the Device business and particularly on margins, was it a drag in Q1 or a contributor, and then also the
outlook for the year here for the Device business in terms of margin contribution?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Josh, we don't give outlooks or forecasts by business of margin, but I did say that we expect
to have overall margin improvement both pre-tax operating margin greater than what we expected when we gave
guidance in January, but not to the extent that we saw in the first quarter. With respect to the first quarter, the SG&A
line showed very nice leverage in year-over-year and that was due in part to the Pharmaceutical business but also very
much due to the MD&D business. The MD&D business has done a very good job of consolidating businesses, of
streamlining operations, et cetera. And also in the supply chain, the Medical Device business has even further
opportunity to streamline footprint, et cetera, in the supply chain.
So we do think that Medical Devices will continue to be a contributor to margin, although I must say that the business
does operate at a relatively high margin already. And as a leader in the marketplace, I think we should operate at that
higher margin. So that's where I'd characterize it for now but I can't give you an outlook by sector at this time.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Thanks, Dominic.
<Q - Joshua Jennings>: Okay, understood.

<Q - David R. Lewis>: Good morning. Dominic, it sounds like the operational strength of the business is going to
offset any pressure from OCD but can you just remind us on an annual basis, we had OCD potentially at $0.10 to $0.15
impact to the business, is that in kind of a rough ballpark?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Yes. On an annual basis, that's a rough ballpark in terms of its contribution to earnings,
$0.10 to $0.15 on an annual basis. That's right.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: And it did sound [ph] – I don't want to put words in your mouth, (01:09:55) but it did sound
like you think operational upside of the business can offset that number this year, not $0.10 to $0.15, but obviously the
annual impact, and you don't necessarily need to rely on a buyback to do so?
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Well, right now we have no buyback planned. And I did say that the current guidance that
we're giving – the guidance range that we're giving is sufficient to absorb any impact from the loss of [ph] profitability
(01:10:20) of the Diagnostic business for the balance of the year.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Okay. Very helpful. Then Dominic, I don't want to take anyone's thunder from next month, but
as it relates to Cardiovascular and Cordis, it comes to mind that there's a new management team in place there, I think,
for 12 months to 15 months. And it hasn't really come up much on these calls the last couple of quarters. Can you share
with us any strategic or operational changes that are happening in the Cardiovascular franchise that perhaps we're
unaware of that you find interesting? Thank you.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Well, one thing I would say about our Cardiovascular business is that the Biosense Webster
business is just fantastic. I mean it has been growing year after year in double-digit growth rates, launching new
products, making meaningful innovations for patients, et cetera. I'm sure that at the MD&D Day on May 22, you'll hear
much more about that business in particular and new innovations there.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Thanks, Dominic. Two more questions and then we'll close the call. Next question, please.

Your next question is from the line of Bob Hopkins of Bank of America.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Morning, Bob.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: Can you hear me okay? Good morning.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Yeah, hi, Bob.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: So thanks. I'll go back into the weeds a little bit here after going big picture for a while. So I
was wondering if you guys could just talk a little bit about what the divisions were telling you in the quarter as it relates
to general surgery trends. It didn't look to me like those softened at all, unlike what you saw in Orthopaedics. So I was
just wondering if there was any commentary from the divisions on general surgery that you think we might find
relevant.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: The one comment that the teams told us was that with respect to elective procedures in the
U.S., given the severe weather conditions, we did see some slowdown in those types of procedures. Anything else,
Louise, that you want to...
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Yeah, so when we went back and talked to our Surgical Care team, they did tell us there is
some normal seasonality within the Surgical Care business. And then was some competitive pressure in the
endomechanical. But there is some seasonality actually in the Surgical Care business, as Dominic referenced.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: And then one last one. Again, did the guys give you any indication on why pricing in hips got
a little bit worse? And just general comment on pricing within the Device franchise for the quarter.
<A - Dominic J. Caruso>: Well, I don't think we have any specifics on...

Your next question is from the line of Damien Conover, Morningstar.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Morning, Damien.
<Q - Damien L. Conover>: Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just a quick question on the
non-biologic injectable business. Just wanted to get a sense both with INVEGA SUSTENNA and RISPERDAL
CONSTA kind of what you're seeing longer term with generics entering the market. I think you mentioned INVEGA
SUSTENNA not seeing any generic competition this year, but just kind of wanted to get a sense of when you think that
generic competition might come and some of the complexities here that the generic firms have to deal with. Thanks.
<A - Louise Mehrotra>: Okay. So the patent on INVEGA SUSTENNA in the U.S. expires April 2014 and then there
is certain other patents that go out to 2017 and 2018 related to formulations. We are not aware at this time of any
applications in the U.S. for either INVEGA SUSTENNA or RISPERDAL CONSTA. RISPERDAL CONSTA is [ph]
May (01:13:55) 2014 that particular patent on it. And as far as the international, INVEGA SUSTENNA in Europe is
about June 2018 and RISPERDAL CONSTA is November 2014. And again, we're not aware of any filings on it. Both
of them are protected by formulation patents well beyond the composition of [ph] matter products. (01:14:13)
Louise Mehrotra
So with that, we will close the call and I'll ask Dominic to make some final remarks.
Dominic J. Caruso
Sure. Thanks, Louise, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Obviously, we're very pleased with our strong results
for the first quarter and I think we're very well positioned to drive growth throughout the year. We do look forward to
seeing you all at the Medical Device Business Review on May 22. So thank you again and have a nice day.
