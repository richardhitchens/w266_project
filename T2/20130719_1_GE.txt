Jeffrey R. Immelt
Great. Thanks, Trevor. Good morning, everybody.
Look on the first page, our environment improved slightly in the second quarter. Emerging markets remain resilient
while Europe stabilized. Orders in the U.S. were the strongest we've seen in some time with 20% growth and overall
our orders grew by 4% and backlog increased to $223 billion.
Earnings were solid, reported EPS was $0.36 but this included $0.02 of uncovered restructuring. On a sustaining basis,
it would've been $0.38, up slightly from 2012. And year-to-date EPS is $0.75 up 6%.
Operations strong in the quarter. Margins grew by 50 basis points, and we're on track for 70 basis points for 2013. Our
simplification efforts have resulted in $470 million of cost out year-to-date, and we had a solid performance in cash.
Our disciplined and balanced capital allocation plan continues. Through the half, we have returned about $10 billion to
investors, well on the way to our $18 billion goal. As for M&A, we've completed Lufkin and Avio, and Avio remains
on track for a third-quarter close. So all in all, a good quarter for operating and strategic execution.
Our orders growth remains solid at plus 4%. And as I said earlier, backlog grew to $223 billion. Performance was
broad-based. We had services growth in 5 of 6 businesses. Orders growth accelerated in China, the U.S. and Europe.
Aviation and Oil & Gas remained very strong, with their combined backlog growing by $7 billion.
Let me give you a few of our other highlights. Oil & Gas orders grew by 24% with double-digit growth in 4 of 5
segments. Aviation and commercial spare orders grew by 19%. Healthcare solutions equipment orders grew by 9% in
the U.S. Energy management orders grew by 19%. North American power generation service orders grew by 24%. We
still have a few headwinds like heavy-duty gas turbines, but there's signs of strength.
We continue to add price to backlog, with orders pricing up 0.9%, and we've now had positive orders price for the past
6 quarters. This will contribute to a positive value gap in the second half of 2013 and beyond.
Our organic growth was down 1% for the quarter, but it's really a wind-turbine story. Organic growth ex Power &
Water grew by 5%. Growth markets expanded by 5% with 4 of 9 regions up by double digits. We continue to make
progress in key regions like Russia, Africa, and China. Our growth market position is a competitive advantage for GE.
Services grew by 2% with broad-based strength, and we're encouraged by services in the Aviation, Oil & Gas, and
Transportation. Transportation services is a particular highlight with growth of 28%.
We continue to be impacted by the sluggish European economy for gas-turbine services, and U.S. sequestration
impacted our military spares business. The service margins grew by 70 basis points and backlog grew to $166 billion.
We made solid progress across the company with our new product launches. The Paris Air Show was very successful
for GE with $26 billion of wins. We're gaining share in Healthcare with robust product launches and are expanding
service offerings with new software launches in Aviation, power, and Healthcare.
In the second half, revenue will be positively impacted by Power & Water shipment timing. Specifically 70% of our
gas turbines, wind turbines, and distributed power products will be shipped in the second half.
We have strong margin expansion with growth of 50 basis points. Every business grew in the quarter, except for home
and business solutions. And even in that segment, appliances expanded while lighting lagged. And we're on track for 70
basis points for the year.
Key margin-execution drivers are within our control. We'll have one of the strongest value gaps in history as we
generate both price and material deflation. We'll manage R&D to be flat for the year. We'll reduce SG&A by at least $1
billion. We continue to execute multiple restructuring projects with attractive paybacks, and we're in the process of
completing our projects for 2013 while developing a pipeline of new ideas.

A key driver for margin improvement in the second half is the Power & Water volume growth, where we remain on
track. Overall margins were slightly better than we expected in the second quarter, and that gives us more confidence
going forward.
Our cash execution improved in the quarter. Our second-quarter Industrial CFOA was up 60% excluding the impact of
NBC-related taxes. In the quarter, we announced that GE Capital will pay up to a $6.5 billion dividend to the parent for
the year, and we remain on track for our CFOA goals.
We've returned $9.9 billion to investors in the first half through dividends and buyback. This is well on our way to our
$18 billion goal. Our announced deals of Lufkin and Avio will close in the second half. Both fit our model of bolt-on
deals that are accretive to earnings.
We end the quarter with a consolidated cash position of $89 billion with $19 billion at the parent. This is a symbol of
our financial strength and supports balanced capital allocation.
And now over to Keith. As you know, this will be his last call, but you'll see him again at GE Capital. And welcome to
Jeff, my new partner. So Keith, over to you.
Keith S. Sherin
Jeff, thanks. I'll start with the second-quarter summary.
We had continuing operations revenues of $35 billion. That was down 4% from last year. Industrial sales of $24.6
billion are down 2%, driven by Power & Water, as you can see on the right side.
GE Capital revenues of $11 billion were down 3%. Operating earnings of $3.7 billion were down 8%.
Operating earnings per share at $0.36 were down 5%. As Jeff said, that includes actually $0.03 of restructuring, which
I'll cover on the next page, including the Capital restructuring. And we also no longer have the NBC earnings, which
was $0.02 in 2012 in the second quarter.
Continuing EPS includes the impact of non-operating pension, and net earnings per share includes the impact of
discontinued operations, which I'll also cover in the next page.
As Jeff covered, the CFOA was $3.7 billion, including a very strong performance in Q2 from the industrial CFOA, plus
$1.9 billion of GE Capital dividends back to the parent.
For taxes, the GE rate of 17% for the quarter is below the 20% rate we previously communicated for the year. We had
an audit resolution with the IRS in the quarter and because that's required to be recorded entirely the quarter rather than
spread over the year it caused the rate to be lower in the quarter. We might have other audit resolutions during the year
and depending on the outcome we currently expect a rate of high-teens to 20% for GE for the full-year.
The Capital rate's down from our forecast because of larger benefits, including the tax efficient foreign disposition
transactions as well as the recapture of prior untaxed losses at real estate. As we previously indicated we do expect a
GE Capital rate in the mid-single digits for the year but there could be some variability at GE Capital as well depending
upon IRS audit resolutions and the tax on other possible dispositions.
On the right side you can see the segment results, total industrial segment profit was up 2%. Ex-Power & Water, our
industrial businesses grew their segment profit by 12%. Power & Water was down in the second quarter, however, the
results were a significant improvement over Q1.
GE Capital earnings down in the second quarter in line with the lower assets, and we'll cover all the segments in more
detail over the next several pages.
Before I get to the businesses I'll start with the Other Items page from Q2. At the top, in total we had $0.03 of
restructuring and other charges in the quarter, $0.02 related to industrial that's in the corporate line of the industrial

reporting and $0.01 was in GE Capital. We continue to reduce our cost structure by lowering our SG&A head count,
we're rationalizing our footprint and this should be a nice tailwind for margins as we go into the second half. We also
had a $0.01 charge in the quarter related to an impairment for an investment that we made in Brazil and that charge was
also included in the corporate line.
We had two one-time benefits in the quarter, first, as I mentioned on the previous page, we had a favorable IRS
settlement which resulted in almost 4 points of lower GE tax rate in Q2, and the total contributed a $0.01 industrial
benefit. And second, in GE Capital we exited our fleet platform in Canada which resulted in a $0.01 benefit in the
quarter and the benefit from this transaction was mostly tax-related and contributed to a lower GE Capital tax rate.
For discontinued operations at the bottom of the page we had $122 million after-tax impact in the quarter. On WMC we
recorded $128 million of new pending claims so that's down significantly over the run rates that we've been seeing and
we added $47 million in reserves in the quarter resulting in a total reserve balance of $787 million covering both
pending and future claims.
On Grey Zone we booked $76 million of additional reserves to reflect ongoing claims and we ended the quarter with
$557 million in reserves. On the bottom of the page is a summary of our operating EPS and our industrial gains and
restructuring. In the first quarter we reported $0.39 of operating EPS and that included $0.04 of net benefit as the Q1
NBCU gain was greater than our industrial restructuring. In Q2 we reported $0.36 and that included a $0.02 drag from
industrial restructuring, again, in the corporate line. And we expect to have at least $0.02 more of industrial
restructuring in the second half. So for the total year we don't expect the NBCU gain and restructuring to have any
impact on EPS.
Moving onto the businesses and let me start with Power & Water, orders of $6 billion were down 1% and Europe
remained challenging, down 40%. Ex-Europe, orders were up 6%. Equipment orders of $3 billion were down 5%.
Thermal orders remain soft at $690 million down 50%. We had orders for 24 heavy-duty gas turbines versus 30 last
year. We had a strong renewables quarter, with orders of $1.4 billion, up 55%. Distributed power orders of $700
million were up 3% and service orders of $3 billion were up 2%. Again, ex-Europe services orders were up 13% driven
by the strong U.S. Power Gen services both in outages and upgrades with orders up 29%. Overall for Power & Water,
orders pricing was up 1.6%.
Revenue of $5.7 billion was down 17% driven by lower volume. Equipment revenue of $2.6 billion was down 30%.
We shipped 19 gas turbines versus 31 last year, and we shipped 351 wind turbines versus 726 last year. Service revenue
of $3.1 billion was down 3%. Power Gen services revenue was down 1% in total but up 14% ex-Europe again driven
by the strength in the U.S. which was up 20%.
Segment profit of $1,087 million was down 17% driven by the lower volume. SG&A costs were down 9% in Q2 value
gap was positive and margins increased by 10 basis points.
So Q2 showed improvement over Q1 for Power & Water. If you look at the second half dynamics, as Jeff said, we've
got a lot of volume and we expect Power & Water volume to be higher in the fourth quarter than the third quarter.
Renewables will continue to improve, distributed power and services continue to improve and costs are going to
continue go lower. So our current outlook is to deliver the total year framework that Jeff covered on Power & Water at
EPG.
On the right side is Oil & Gas, results in the second quarter were very strong. Orders of $5 billion were up 24%,
equipment orders of $2.8 billion were up 42%. We saw double-digit growth across all the segments, turbo machinery
up 74% driven by U.S. midstream LNG orders, subsea was up 30% driven by large projects in Indonesia and Angola.
Service orders of $2.3 billion were up 8%. We saw a nice growth in global services, up 14%, and we're making
significant progress in growing our subsea service business which was up 44%. This was partially offset by
measurements and controls which was down 1%, while still down, this is up from the first quarter when M&C was
down 13%, so some improvement in the market.
Our backlog grew by $1.1 billion in the quarter to $18 billion and orders pricing was up 80 basis points, our ninth
quarter of positive order price increases. Revenue of $4 billion was up 9%, equipment revenue of $2 billion up 11%

driven by growth in subsea and drilling and surface and service revenues of $2 billion were up 6% driven by stronger
global spare parts sales.
Segment profit of $532 million was up 14% as the benefits of higher volume, positive price and SG&A reductions
more than offset higher program spending and drove 70 basis points of margin expansion.
Up next is Aviation; the Aviation team had a strong quarter, orders of 5.8 billion were up 4% with equipment orders of
$3.2 billion up 7%. Commercial engine orders of $2.5 billion were up 81% driven by $1.4 billion of CFM orders
including $670 million of LEAP orders.
Military equipment orders of $300 million were down 72% driven by no repeat of the Saudi F110 order last year which
was $890 million. Service orders of $2.6 billion were up 1%. Commercial service orders of $2 billion were up 11%.
The 2Q average daily spares order rate was $24.6 million, up 19%. As we continue to see a nice rebound from the
higher year-to-date GE fleet utilization, it's up 2.6% globally, and as airline shop visits and parts restocking return to
more normal buying behaviors. Military service orders were down 25% as we're seeing some impact from reduced
flight hours and inventory management.
Overall for Aviation, order pricing was up 2.5%. Revenue of $5.3 billion was up 9% driven by equipment up 12%. We
shipped 596 commercial engines in the quarter, which was up 30 units, or 5%. We shipped 33 GEnx units, up from 27
last year and we shipped 280 military engines, which were up 21 units or 8%.
Service revenues of $2.6 billion were up 6% driven by commercial services up 12% partially offset by military
services, which was down 6% on lower spare parts. Segment profit at $1,067 million was up 16% driven by the strong
value gap, pricing up 3.6%, and also by higher volume. And margin rates grew by 1.1 points in the quarter.
On the right side is Healthcare. Orders of $4.8 billion were up 2%. Equipment orders of $2.8 billion were up 4% and
that's 7 points better than we saw in the first quarter. Developed markets were up 3% with the U.S. up 5%, Europe was
up 7%, Japan was down 26% but it's down 8% excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Developing markets were up
8% driven by China up 16%, Latin America up 4%, India up 1%. If you go by modality, MR was up 14%, CT as down
6%, ultrasound was up 13%, Life Sciences was down 1%, and Diagnostic Guidance Systems was down 5%.
Service orders of $2 billion were down 2%. Revenue of $4.5 billion was flat and again that's driven by the growth
markets up 10% offset by the developed markets down 4%. Segment profit of $726 million was up 5% as the benefits
of restructuring and higher volume more than offset the impact of lower pricing and margin rates were up 80 basis
points in the quarter.
Next is Transportation. Orders of $1.1 billion were down 23%. Equipment orders of $444 million were down 45% as
we continue to see the impact of soft North American locomotive and global mining equipment markets. Service orders
of $633 million were up 7% driven by locomotive services. Orders pricing was up 40 basis points and revenues of $1.6
billion were up 2% as the growth in signaling and parts more than offset lower equipment revenues, which were down
14%. We shipped 170 locomotives in the quarter versus 243 last year. Segment profit of $313 million was up 11%
driven by the positive value gap in services growth, which also drove margins up 160 basis points.
Energy management had a strong quarter versus last year. Orders of $2.3 billion were up 19% driven by digital energy
up 24% and power conversion up 20%. We saw strong growth in digital meters and in the marine segment in Brazil in
China. Revenues of $2 billion were up 6% driven by power conversion up 7% partially offset by lower revenues in
digital energy. Segment profit of $31 million as up $4 million last year driven by the improved value gap and segment
margins were up 140 basis points.
Home & Business Solutions had another positive quarter. Revenues of $2.1 billion were up 5% as 8% growth in
appliances was partially offset by a 4% decline in lighting sales and segment profit of $83 million was up 5%.
Appliances was up 31% driven by positive pricing and lower program spending partially offset by the results in
lighting. Margins were flat for the quarter and we continue to see strength in housing. Second quarter housing starts
were up 18% boosted by single-family up strong double-digits and multifamily starts up over 20%.
So with that, let me turn it over to Jeff Bornstein to cover GE Capital.

Jeffrey S. Bornstein
Thanks, Keith.
GE Capital revenue was just under $11 billion in the quarter, down 3% driven by lower assets partly offset by higher
gains. Assets were down 7% or $37 billion year-over-year. Net income was $1.9 billion, down 9% from prior year
primarily driven by lower assets and high gains were offset by losses, marks and impairments in the quarter. Tax
benefits were essentially flat year-over-year with the rate down driven by lower pre-tax income on lower assets.
We ended the quarter with $391 billion of ending net investment. That's down $40 billion from last year and down $11
billion sequentially. Our net interest margin was up 18 basis points versus 2012 to 5% and flat with the first quarter.
Tier 1 common ratio on a Basel 1 basis improved 11.2% in the quarter driven by the reduction in investment in the
balance sheet and after paying $1.9 billion in dividends in the quarter.
On the right side of the page, asset quality trends continue in the right direction with delinquency rates improving
across the portfolio. The only exception being the seasonality we expect in our U.K. mortgage business. In addition,
non-earning assets totaled $6.6 billion, that's down $600 million from the first quarter and down $1.6 billion versus last
year. CP ended the quarter at $36 billion, well on its way to the $35 billion plan for the year and liquidity was very
strong ending the quarter at $70 billion.
Now to walk through the segment performance. On CLL, Commercial Lending and Leasing businesses ended the
second quarter with $174 billion of assets, that's down 6% from last year driven by a reduction of non-core assets of
about $7 billion and $4 billion of lower core assets primarily driven by asset sales, including the fleet Canada
disposition Keith referred to.
On book core volume was 6% higher than the second quarter of 2012 and new business returns remained attractive at
about 2% returns on investment.
Earnings were stronger across all the regions and up 31% total driven by the fleet disposition. Asset sales, higher tax
benefits in Europe partially offset by asset impairments. Asset quality continued improving with delinquencies down 15
basis points versus last year and non-earning assets were down 30% versus the second quarter of 2012.
In the Consumer segment we ended the quarter with $136 billion of assets, up 1%. Net income of $828 million was
down 9% primarily driven by the removal of reserve seasonality in our U.S. retail business under the new modeling
approach that we completed in the first quarter.
We expect reserve coverage in the U.S. retail business to be about the same as the third quarter. The U.S. retail business
earned $563 million in the second quarter, down $78 million from last year driven by the reserving change I just
mentioned and partly offset with core growth.
Asset growth in this business was strong at 9% and asset quality continues to set new benchmarks with 30-day
delinquency down to 3.85%.
Our core Europe business earned $149 million in the quarter which was essentially flat year-over-year.
The real estate team continues to execute very well; assets ended the quarter at $42 billion, that's down 28%
year-over-year. Net income of $435 million was up 2 times versus 2012 and that was driven by higher gains on the
equity portfolio and higher tax benefits.
The business sold 180 properties with a book value of $1.9 billion for about $200 million in gains in the quarter. Asset
quality continues to improve with 30-day delinquencies on the debt book at 2.1% and that's 6 basis points lower
sequentially.
The verticals. GECAS earned $304 million, that's down 1% with assets and down 3% driven by lower gains on aircraft
sales and modestly higher impairments on aircraft held for sale. Returns remained very attractive on new volume. EFS

earnings were down driven by the impairment of a single asset in our energy book and modestly lower gains across the
portfolio.
For our total results we did have roughly $300 million of tax provisions in the GE Capital Corporate, they partially
offset the tax benefits in the segments to book to a total year expected rate of mid-single digits. This, along with the
non-repeat of the $200 million tax benefits from BP business properties transaction in the second quarter of 2012
explains the higher corporate charge year-over-year.
So overall, GE Capital continues to perform well. It's results were in line with our strategy to reduce the size of the
business and as you look forward to the third quarter with the loss of earnings from shrinking assets and adjusting for
one-time items, a normalized run rate for GE Capital is still in the range of 1.8 to 1.85 in earnings.
So with that, I'll turn it back to Jeff.
Jeffrey R. Immelt
Great, Jeff. Thanks.
As to the framework, we have really no change to the 2013 operating framework. We're not planning for an improved
environment for the balance of 2013, but execution levers are in our control. A solid backlog, good technology, strong
cost control and disciplined capital allocation.
In addition, we have a very diverse global footprint which is well-positioned for the macro tailwinds that are out there
like in Oil & Gas. So again as I said, no change to our 2013 operating framework. We still plan on solid industrial
earnings growth for the year driven by expanding margins. Our second quarter profile supports this growth. GE Capital
will have solid growth for the year and we have no change in our framework for corporate costs or cash. We still plan
on double-digit EPS growth for the year. So everything is consistent with what we said at EPG and we're
well-positioned to deliver for investors.
And in conclusion, let me recap our status versus investor goals we set for the year. First our Industrial earnings growth
will improve during the year. Power & Water was a drag in the first half but should have positive earnings growth in
the second half. The other segments are executing so we should see strong growth for total Industrial in the second half.
We plan to achieve 70 basis points of margin improvement for the year. The second quarter exceeded our expectations
and the teams did a solid job on execution.
We expect to receive up to a $6.5 billion dividend from GE Capital this year. Organic growth will likely be at the
low-end of our 2% to 6% range for 2013. Again, the wind turbine cycle is a headwind but we're well positioned for the
future with a solid backlog. And the balance of our Industrial businesses should grow in line with our 5% to 10%
organic growth goal. We're on track to return $18 billion to shareowners through dividends and buybacks.
So for GE, this is a solid quarter and we're on track for good year. Now, Trevor, back to you and we'll take some
questions.
Trevor A. Schauenberg
Great. Thanks, Jeff, Keith and Jeff. Shakwana, why don't we open up the lines and take some questions.

<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Scott.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Jeff, when you think about last quarter and the disappointing margins you put up, your
confidence in the 70 basis points for the year seemed to be somewhat wavering and maybe it seemed like a reach goal.
I mean, putting up the 50 basis points this quarter, does that indicate to you an increased confidence that you're going to
see this back half of the year margin ramp, particularly given what you saw in value gap?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Scott, it really does. Again, I think the teams have been executing well. I would decompose
it a little bit the way we talk about margins. The value gap is on track to be significantly positive this year. Our SG&A,
our simplification efforts I think are just gaining momentum so that looks good. R&D I think levelizes for the year, mix
levelizes for the year. And Power & Water units are in backlog so, Scott, I think as we execute that ramp, we feel pretty
confident in the 70 basis points for the year. We still have a slight hedge in the numbers and I just think we're building
momentum.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Makes sense. And I know it's hard when you look at backlog and orders just given the timing to
figure out exactly when revenues are going to pull through but when you really look at the order growth and the fact
that you are getting – you were down including Wind but excluding Wind up 5% you said, but you said in the slides not
counting on environment improving but the order book does imply that the back half of the year is going to have some
unit volume tailwind. Am I reading that correctly?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Oh yeah, you know it definitely does. Just given the way the Wind – Scott, like you know,
just looking at the Wind profile, if you look at Power & Water, it's going to strengthen in the second half and the other
businesses I'd say are already demonstrating some nice momentum so things like Aviation spares, which were a drag
last year, have turned into a tailwind this year. Oil & Gas I'd say four or five segments double-digit orders growth, even
M&CS I'd say a better quarter. So if you just pick through one by one, you're going to get some gathering momentum I
think in the second half of the year.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. And just clarification, the loss in Brazil, I assume that's the EBX Eike Batista investment.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Yep. That's right.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. Okay. Fair enough. Thanks, guys. I'll pass it on.

<A - Keith S. Sherin>: John.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Morning, guys. I have a couple of clarifications. So one, I just want to confirm: were there any
gains that you would consider one time within the industrial segments that might've helped to the 50 basis points of
margin this quarter?
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: We had a small disposition in Aviation but it was immaterial, John. In total across the
Industrial segments, the impact of gains was zero.
<Q - John G. Inch>: And then the rise, Keith or Jeff, in the year-over-year corporate, you did call out, right, the asset
impairment of $0.01 but was there any kind of an industrial reclassification in the way you look at the businesses that
might have, again I'm sorry to be nitpicky but may have helped the margins and then in turn that flowed through the

corporate line? Why again was the corporate up as much as it was?
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: There was no reclassification but I can take you through corporate. If you look at the corporate
second quarter number it's $1.883 billion. Remember you got to take out the non-operating pension which on a pre-tax
basis is $661 million, so we're at $1.2 billion in the quarter. There's really 3 things: We have $280 million of pre-tax
restructuring in corporate, which is the $0.02 and again that for the year will be against the NBCU gain, we had the
impairment of $108 million in the corporate line. And the third thing that is not really related to corporate but it just
flows in that line is that GE Capital preferred dividend for $135 million. So if you take the second quarter and you get
to a run rate, you're basically at the run rate we need to be about $3 billion for the year.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Okay. No, that that make sense. Keith, can I ask you about WMC in Japan? We're still taking
charges for it and just remind us, if I'm not mistaken wasn't there a statute of limitations in New York that prospectively
kind of makes the run rate on WMC hopefully or you tell me sort of much lower going forward? And then maybe this
is for Jeff, is there not an opportunity to pay off these Japan liabilities sometime early next year? I'm just wondering
what, I realize it's still early but, Jeff, what your thoughts are towards perhaps pursuing that kind of attack?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Sure I think I can start with both of those for you, John. On WMC, yes, the statute of
limitations runs six years from the date of the securitization and we basically are completed all the securitizations that
came out of WMC have gone through that six-year period now and I think that's why you see a slowing of the
additional pending claims. And so we need to resolve these. We're in negotiation and discussion on the claims and
we're going to work our way through that as you go through the second half of the year and we'll continue to update
you.
From a Japan perspective, there is a contractual discussion point in the first quarter with Shinsei and we will have a
discussion with them and whether we can reach agreement or not remains to be seen but there is an opening there in the
first quarter that we'll be pursuing and negotiating with them.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Perfect. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague representing Vertical Research Partners. Please proceed.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: How you doing, Jeff?
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Hey. First, just back on the question of gains, you said it kind of netted out year-over-year in
the quarter but can we just put a finer point on what it actually was TransDigm and what other stuff you might have
had?
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Yeah, the Aviation TransDigm benefit was immaterial in the segment and I didn't say it netted
out year-over-year I said it was zero in the quarter in the segments. So...
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Okay. I thought you said net neutral year-over-year.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: No, no, no. In the quarter the small benefit we got in TransDigm in Aviation if you go to the
segment profit level it was zero across the segment profits for the Industrial businesses.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Okay. Great. And just shifting to power, so power price looked decent in the quarter. I just
wonder if you could give us a little color around service price versus order price and what's driving that?
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Sure. Power & Water, if you look, the equipment pricing was up 3.5% in the quarter. The
service pricing was down 0.3% and overall up 1.6%. Thermal and PGS was down 2.2%, renewables was very strong up

11%. Those would be the biggest drivers.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And then just a little more color if you could on just what's going on in service? Europe
obviously weak, sounds like they got a little less bad maybe. How do you see that playing over the balance of the year?
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Yeah, I think the one bright spot in service was certainly in the U.S., if you looked at the U.S.
PGS, the orders were up 29%. In the first quarter we talked about some advanced gas path upgrades. The team did a
pretty good job executing in the quarter. They had about 12 of them in the quarter and that's a good sign for us in the
U.S. service business, revenues were up 20.
In Europe PGS had a really challenging quarter, down 59%, Jeff, the fleet operating hours, we had reduced outages, it's
U.K., Italy and Spain. So we're seeing some positive benefits of the fleet in the U.S. and we're more than offsetting the
drag that we have from the fleet in Europe right now in the PGS business.

Your next question comes from the line of Steven Winoker representing Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Thanks, and good morning.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Hey, Steven.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Hey. First, a quick clarification again on that corporate versus segment impact
restructuring and other charges, those $0.03, was any of that in corporate or was it all in the segments?
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: No, if you go to the corporate line, you adjust for the non-operating pension, out of the $1.2
billion there's $280 million of restructuring on a pre-tax basis that's industrial. There's another $0.01 that's in Capital in
corporate. So out of the $0.03, $0.02 is an industrial and $0.01 is in Capital.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: But that $281 million is part of that $1.883 billion, right?
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Yes, it is.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: So that was at corporate, okay.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Right. And so was the NBCU gain in the first quarter and we said the restructuring would be in
corporate through the year.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Right.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Let's just repeat that, Keith, because I want to make sure everybody gets that right. That on
the NBCU gain.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Sure, so in the first quarter we had the NBCU gain, we made a set of decisions to lower our
cost structure in the company, from an accounting perspective you have to actually complete of the actions to book the
accounting charge to reflect the downsizing that you're doing and so not all that could happen in the first quarter. We
have additional work to do to identify and complete the projects.
So we had $0.04 of restructuring in the first quarter against the NBCU gain and that left a net of positive $0.04 in that
first quarter EPS. In the second quarter we had a naked $0.02 after-tax of industrial restructuring and in the third
quarter and the fourth quarter we'll probably have another $0.01 at least each quarter so that for the year, Steve,
basically it's a zero, it's in the corporate line, in the first quarter it was a net positive, in the second quarter it's a net drag
and in the third quarter and fourth-quarter it'll be a slight net drag. Does that help?

<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay, great. Yeah, it does, a lot. Thanks. And then a little more clarification on the GE
Capital side, guys, since we have a lot of GE Capital horsepower there now.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: [Laughter] As opposed to before, I think.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: No, no, no, no, it's always good, right? The commercial real estate gains, the $200
million you talked about, we continue to see an environment where you're getting these every quarter. As you run down
that book, what's your visibility to that going forward? And how long and sustainable it is?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Yeah, so we did have 200 in the quarter and the team has done a pretty good job as we
reduce that book down to about $17 billion of our investment of doing that as profitably as possible. It is going to get
progressively more difficult to generate the same level of gains unless we continue to see improvement in the markets
where we're selling these assets. We've been very focused in the U.S., that's where the recovery has been the biggest the
fastest. We're seeing some signs of life in Europe, in Northern Europe and the U.K. and France but there's still a long
way to go there and Japan's a little bit better.
So I think there still will be the opportunity to generate gains. Whether we'll be able to generate them as we move down
the next $17 billion at the same rate I think remains to be seen. I think that's going to be little bit of a challenge.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: And then on provision side, they were at least a little lower than I was expecting, maybe
just comment on how you're thinking about the amount of provisions in the quarter?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Well I think provisions came in about where we thought they would be. They were up
about $300 million year-over-year. $200 million of that was associated with our retail business in the U.S. and we went
to that reserve model change that we completed in the first quarter, one of the outcomes of that is we removed the
seasonality that we historically had had in the second quarter and so that didn't repeat year-over-year, and then we
added $100 million of reserves in CLL, principally in our U.S. CLL business. So I think provisions came in just about
where we expected them. They were down sequentially because we made that final change in the retail reserves in the
first quarter which was like $600 million, so that's why they sequentially look lower.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. And maybe just sneak one last in for Jeff. Energy management and intelligent
platforms, does that continue to be a targeted growth area both sort of acquisitively and organically?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Well it is organically, I would say, Steve. There's been commentary about transactions and
even though we don't like to specifically talk about companies, I would say when you guys think about what we've
outlined in terms of the priorities for the company, the one transaction that's been rumored really doesn't fit our screen
as to the kinds of places we're going to put capital. So is that a good way to answer your question, Steve?
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Couldn't be more direct. Thanks, Jeff. I'll pass it on. Thanks.

So I don't think incrementally it is anything that we won't be able to deal with. I think our capital is in very, very good
shape. I think our processes are improving every day. So I don't think at the margin that the designation is going to
mean all that much to the business.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Great. And then for Jeff Immelt, at EPG, there was a lot of focus about prospects for a
staged exit of a business, and how the proceeds would be used for buybacks and changing of GE's earnings mix. And
can you give us any update as to where that process stands?

I don't think we're quite ready to talk detailed specifics. But you'll be hearing from us in due time. But the notion, the
strategy that we outlined at EPG is still on track.

<Q - Nigel Coe>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Good morning, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: First of all, Jeff and Keith, congratulations on your new roles.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Thank you.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Just wanted to go back to the price-cost benefit this quarter. The value gap of [ph] 293 (41:56). How
does that compare to the plan? And given that pricing on orders is improving, the backlog price is improving, raw
material environment remains pretty benign, how does that develop over the balance of the year?
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Well, you've seen our pricing on orders quarter after quarter. Six quarters of positive OPI
across the company. That's coming through in revenue this quarter. We had 1% positive price in sales. I think that
continues. I think we've put it in the backlog, and with the OPI strong on the new orders coming in, I think you're going
to continue to see pricing.
I think the change that we've seen year-over-year has been a big improvement in deflation. Last year, at the half, we
had close to $60 million of inflation, and this year we've got significant deflation. So I think we expect that to continue.
We do a lot to lock in our purchases on a forward-buy basis.
And so we're feeling pretty good about the value gap. Jeff's talked about it. I think that's going to be, as we show on the
margins chart, a significant contributor to us getting to 70 basis points this year. And as you listen, as we go business
by business, we talked about the value gap in just about every one of the segments being a positive contributor.
So the teams have been focused on pricing. They're focused on delivering projects at the margins we quote or better.
And the sourcing deflation has been positive for us this year.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Actually, I think this is going to be better than our plan. And I think that's where the source
of our hedge is going to come from.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. So you think a point or more of margin benefit in the back half of the year from price
inflation.

And then obviously the Power & Water margins were pretty incredible, given the sharp decline in revenues. And you
called out the price value gap obviously, and – but then mix. And I'm wondering to the extent to which you benefited
from some of these [ph] hot part (43:55) upgrades on the gas turbines, versus what you might characterize as regular
MRO work on the installed fleet?
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Well, it was a positive for us. I mean if you look at the Service business, it was actually up
slightly on op profit. So the net benefit of everything they did, whether it's the part sales or the upgrades and outages in
the quarter, gave them a little lift.
And so I think it's a positive. We were up on op profit, even with the revenue being down a little bit. So services versus
equipment was a benefit, certainly in the energy segment.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: And then a quick one on the GE Capital dividends. $1.9 billion in the quarter, $6.5 billion for the full
year. How you expect that will phase over the balance of the year?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: We've got that loaded in evenly over the third and fourth quarter. So $1.5 billion in the
third and $1.5 billion in the fourth is the assumption today.

<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Morning, Shannon.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Shannon.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Hey, so I just wanted an update on gas-turbine order expectations for the year. I think
you had been talking about 120, 130. We're only at 32 here in the first half. Is that still the target? And if it is, [ph] what
are the things (45:28) and where do those orders come from?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Shannon, my hunch is that the overall market is not going to be quite as strong as we
initially expected. So my hunch is that the orders for the year will be between something like 100 and 115 – in that
range.
And again, still they come in buckets. I'd say there's still a fair amount of activity in the Middle East. China and Asia
aren't bad. We expect the U.S. to be better this year than last, but at a small level. Europe pretty sluggish. Africa okay.
But they tend to come in buckets. But my hunch is that's where the orders will come in.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: You have pretty good visibility into those. Are there some lumpy things in 2H to get
there?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Yeah, we do. I think we have a pretty formal process we go through on booking orders and
stuff like that. So we kind of see – what I would say is pretty good visibility there.

<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: There's still more to come in the second half. And again, it's always between when we book
the order and the revenue. But I think we've got something like 50, don't we, Keith? For the year?
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: We have goal of 50 for the year. We did 2 in the first quarter, 12 in the second. We've got 8 in
the backlog and we've got a number that are working. So I think there's a lot in progress.
What we talked about in the second quarter – we had three of them that were working that slipped, and two of those
actually booked in the second quarter. And in addition, another 10. So I think the team has made a lot of progress there,
and they're positioned probably for the first-quarter 2014 outages, as you look at where they go. So they'll be in the

<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Hi. Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Julian.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Hi, Julian.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Hi. Morning. I just had a question around the simplification and the cost-cutting. You
had sort of $474 million of cost-cutting savings in Q2. It looks like there wasn't much back in Q1 at all.
Back in the Q1, you talked about the majority of the cost savings coming in the second half. So I'm just trying to square
away – you've got $500 million of savings already in the first half. You talked before about $1 billion or so. Is that $1
billion number for the year a lot higher now? Because I guess you should – again, per the Q1, you should be getting
most of the cost-saving benefit in the second half?
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: We had actually $200 million in the first quarter, Julian. So that's how you get to the $468
million or whatever at the half.
We're targeting at least $1 billion. And we have an intense focus in this company around simplification. There's a
regular rhythm. Everybody's engaged. We're reducing P&Ls. We're putting things in centers of excellence. And we're
going to look at more restructuring projects as we go into to the second half here. If we have good returning projects,
we're going to continue to evaluate those.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Good momentum. I'd be disappointed if it wasn't above $1 billion. And we've got a good
backlog of projects.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Okay, great. And then within the services overall, the – just total company – the orders
were much better in Q2 than Q1. You talked about revenues being obviously at the bottom end of a two to six range. Is
that solely on equipment? How has your view on the services revenue outlook for the year changed? Particularly given
the big improvement in orders sequentially?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: The goal for Services is still around 5% for the year. And that's the focus we have on it. So I
think the mix is still mainly equipment-driven on the total revenue.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Got it. Thanks. And then lastly, just any color you could provide on Europe. You'd
mentioned right at the beginning that it felt like a better quarter. Obviously Power is still bad. But just what you're
seeing generally from your customers there?

<A - Keith S. Sherin>: We had obviously a big improvement in Europe in the orders. You remember the first quarter
was down 17. The second quarter, we're up 2.
And it was mixed. We talked about Power being tough. But the positives – Oil & Gas was very strong. Oil & Gas
orders were up 37% in the quarter. A lot of those were up in the Nordic. We have a great position in Oil & Gas in the
North Sea.
Aviation was up 26%. It was a mix of both equipment orders as well as service orders. We've seen a rebound of
services in the Europe poll. Services were up about 15% for Aviation. And Healthcare had a nice turnaround.
So the Power & Water was down, but some encouraging signs in some of the other Industrial businesses here. Overall
up 2 versus 17 is a significant improvement obviously for us.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Yeah. Just another nuance on Keith's – I'd say the most short-cycle business we have in
Europe is Healthcare. And they had the first positive orders – I'd say in a couple years probably. Three years?
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Three years. 4% up. Yeah.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: So that's a decent – but, Julian, I'd echo what Keith said earlier on the power-gen-usage side.
It's still pretty weak in Europe. But it just seems to have – net/net, in the GE world anyhow – stabilized in Q2.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Great. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin representing Bank of America. Please proceed.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Good morning.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Yes, good morning. How are you doing?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Andrew, how are you doing? Good.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Just a question on rising interest rates impact at GECC. How should we think about the second
half, given the funding mechanism. And when do you think we'll see impact, if any?
<A - Jeffrey S. Bornstein>: Well, Andrew, I'd say, first of all, we've issued about $28 billion of debt year-to-date, in
addition to the $1 billion preferred we talked about. So $29 billion total against the total-year plan $30 billion to $35
billion.
So most of our borrowing in the year is done. Fortunately we were able to get out a little ahead of what's happened to
benchmark rates in the last couple of months.
Long-term, generally, higher interest rates have historically been good for GE Capital as well as most banks. Margins
tend to expand. Spreads tend to expand vis-à-vis benchmark rates.
So I would say generally, I think on a longer-term trend basis, higher rates are better for the business. I think from a
liability perspective, we're in great shape. We run a match-funded book, so a short-term change in interest rates really
shouldn't impact us much, because our variable assets are matched with variable debt, and our fixed assets with fixed
debt. So we should be in pretty good shape.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: And just a question on Healthcare. Just surprised how strong the equipment orders were in North
America in the quarter. And at the same point, CMS released 2014 proposed Medicare hospital outpatient payment
regulations, and those seemed pretty bleak.
And how should we think about, A, the positive surprise in Healthcare this quarter, how sustainable it is? And where do
you think the business is going, given where regulations are going?

<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: I'd say – look, I think our product line is pretty good right now, and our positioning is pretty
good. We're not counting on the U.S. market in Healthcare to be super robust. And look, I think on the outpatient side,
there's been pressure on reimbursements for a long time. So we're pretty cognizant of where it goes there.
But I'd say the U.S. market feels like it's growing flattish to maybe up a couple points, and I don't see that changing that
much.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: So this quarter for you, it's market share [ph] again (53:40), you think?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: You never know until you see the Nieman data. But it seems like a better run-rate for us this
quarter. And then we'll see when we get the market data. It's usually a lag of a couple weeks.
But I think – and then outside the U.S., the growth markets were up 10%. And that's a decent profile for the Healthcare
guys.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Thank you very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa representing JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Hey. Thanks for fitting me in. I appreciate it.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Steve.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Steve, how are you?
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Good. The orders price in Power & Water was 1.5%, yet the industry seems like it's obviously in
relatively tough shape. Can you just walk through what drove that?
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: Well, I went through some of the pieces. If you looked at it, for equipment, thermal was down
5.5% so that's more in line with what you're seeing in the softness in the Thermal market. But the renewables was up
12%.
So I think – those were the two biggest pieces. Distributed power was about flat -
<Q - Steve Tusa>: What's driving that renewables dynamic?
And I guess just pricing generally – with obviously volumes down too across your business, maybe, Jeff, you can just
from a macro perspective, but pricing holding in there, is this a – you're making a conscious choice to kind of walk
away from some business? Does it really not matter what the price is? It's more about the level of activity that's out
there? And that's just more of a macro question I guess.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: In the Wind business, we've got tremendous new product introductions and we're delivering
value to our customers. I think that's the biggest piece of the Renewable price index performance for us in 2013.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Okay.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Steve, it's really product by product. I'd say our service pricing is still pretty good and that
shows up in service margins. Your reference on the power gen market, it's a tough market so you're seeing pressure
there. Aviation the pricing has been really pretty good. Same way locomotive behind product performance. So it's kind
of a mix business by business but I think on the input cost side, we're not seeing any inflation really and so we see a
favorable trade, let's say, in the short term between our ability to sustain decent pricing in our market versus incoming

inflation.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: And just one last question on the Power & Water services stuff. Clearly good news that some of
these upgrades and service work is coming through. Is that just the delayed reaction to the significant increase in gas
utilization last year? And if that is the case, is this something you have a line of sight on into 2014? Or is this a pent-up
demand being released this year as they switch back to coal perhaps and then you've got a little bit of a tougher comp
next year? How do we think about that?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: My sense, Steve, is that the power gen service piece ought to be pretty stable between 2013
and 2014. We've got a decent backlog of these advanced gas paths. We do have some turnarounds next year that are
going to be helpful so I view this is the ability to have stable growth in the power gen service side.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: It's really good economics for the customer. We're developing additional new product upgrades
for them that give them better efficiency and operating performance and we can demonstrate those economics. It's not
really related to just whether they run a little more from a cost of gas perspective. It's really about over the long term,
what's the value of that asset for them.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: How many did you do last year?
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: This is a new product introduction. So there have been upgrades through the periods but this is
a specific advanced gas path...
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: More significant.
<Q - Steve Tusa>: Okay, great. Thanks.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Great, Steve. Thanks.
<A - Keith S. Sherin>: All right, Steve.

Your next question comes from the line of Jason Feldman representing UBS. Please proceed.
<Q - Jason Feldman>: Good morning.
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: Hey, Jason.
<Q - Jason Feldman>: At Healthcare you called out the translation impact of the yen on the Healthcare business in
Japan. More broadly, have you seen any kind of competitive implications of the move in the yen, either in Healthcare
or Energy or any of the other businesses?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: We really haven't. A lot of the things we do in Aviation and stuff like that are dollar trades
anyhow but we haven't seen the Japanese companies becoming more competitive, if that's what you mean. And one of
the advantages we have is we also make things in Japan and have a supply chain in Japan, so we're pretty naturally
hedged as these things go on, from a cost position standpoint.
<Q - Jason Feldman>: Got it. And also in Healthcare, Healthcare seems to be the segment where pricing has been
most stubborn and I certainly understand particularly in North America and Europe it's been a challenging market, but
what do you see as needing to change before that improves? Is that something that's possible any time in the near to
medium term?
<A - Jeffrey R. Immelt>: It's kind of a historical thing. The Healthcare business is a little bit on the electronics cost
curve. Half of it's physics and half of it's electronics and you have a fairly rapid new product standpoint. So Healthcare
kind of grows its CM rate even when we show kind of the way we look at price, it shows some erosion. But that's
usually offset by sourcing and by margin on new products that are replacing the old ones. So it's kind of a unique
character in our portfolio.
