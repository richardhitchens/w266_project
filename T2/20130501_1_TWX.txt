MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the Time Warner, Inc. First Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. My name is Dawn and I will be your operator for
today's call. [Operator Instructions] Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this
conference is being recorded.
I will now turn the call over to your host for today, Mr. Doug Shapiro, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations for
Time Warner. Please proceed.
Douglas S. Shapiro
Thanks and good morning. This morning we issued two press releases, one detailing our results for the first quarter and
the other reaffirming our 2013 business outlook. Before we begin there are two items I need to cover. First, we refer to
certain non-GAAP financial measures. Schedules setting out reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to
the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release and trending schedules.
These reconciliations are available on our website at www.timewarner.com/investors. Reconciliations of our expected
future financial performance are also included in the business outlook release that is available on our site.
And second, today's announcement includes certain forward-looking statements based on management's current
expectations. Actual results may vary materially from those expressed or implied by these statements due to various
factors. These factors are discussed in detail in Time Warner's SEC filings, including its most recent annual report on
Form 10-K and subsequent quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Time Warner is under no obligation, and in fact, expressly
disclaims any obligation to update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information,
future events or otherwise.
Thanks. And let me turn it over to Jeff.

Jeff L. Bewkes
Thanks, Doug, and thanks for listening in this morning. Before I talk about our first quarter results, I'd like to touch on
the biggest news that we came forward with over the last few months and that was our announcement in March that we
intend to spin-off Time Inc. as an independent public entity by the end of the year. We think it's the right step for Time
Inc., for Time Warner and for our stockholders for a few reasons. As you know, Time Inc. is by far the largest
magazine publisher in the world with iconic brands and massive reach. After the spin, it will have much more strategic
financial and operational flexibility and it will be able to develop a shareholder base that's aligned with its strategy and
its growth prospects. Also, it will be able to attract, retain and reward talent with equity that is directly tied to its own
performance.
Ultimately, we concluded that these benefits substantially outweigh the relatively smaller strategic links between Time
Inc. and our other businesses. These are essentially the same reasons why we separated both Time Warner Cable and
AOL four years ago. Back when we did those transactions, it wasn't common for large media companies to take steps
to become smaller, but we did them because we believe they were in the best interests of our stockholders. And in light
of the performance of those companies and their stocks, I think it is fair to say that they are both in a far stronger
position today as independent companies. We fully expect the same for Time Inc.
Following the spin offs of Time Warner Cable and AOL we quickly saw the benefits of making Time Warner smaller,
more nimble, and more focused. With the separation of Time Inc. we'll complete the final natural step in that process.
After the spin, Time Warner will be the leading pure play video content company in the world, operating the largest
cable networks business, the largest TV production company and the largest film studio with the largest library. We'll
derive 80% of our profits from our cable networks and when you consider that roughly half of Warner Bros.' profits
each year come from its TV production businesses that means 90% of our profits will come from the broader television
ecosystem. With video consumption, pay-TV subs, pay-TV ARPUs and television CPMs all growing globally, we
think that's a very good place to be.
It was certainly a good place to be this quarter and we're off to a great start this year. In the first quarter, we grew
adjusted operating income 7%, adjusted EPS increased more than 20% and we returned over $900 million to our
stockholders through buybacks and our dividend. We also saw a number of very encouraging operational trends. At
Turner, the headline this quarter was again the outstanding performance of March Madness. Across TNT, TBS, truTV,
and CBS, total viewers were up 11%, making it the most-watched tournament in almost two decades. We also saw a
really strong digital engagement. For instance we delivered close to 50 million live streams, that's up more than 150%
over last year.
Since we acquired the rights, the tournament has far exceeded all our expectations for ratings, linear ad revenue, digital
usage metrics and digital ad revenue. We also continue to see solid performance across most of our networks. TBS was
the number one ad supported cable network in prime time across adults 18 to 34 and 18 to 49, powered by the
continued strength in The Big Bang Theory and the success of some of our new series, including Cougar Town and
King of the Nerds.
TNT faced some difficult NBA comparisons this quarter against the lockout affect of season last year, with fewer
games and fewer compelling match ups. But TNT grew ratings for its entertainment programming, which included
originals like Dallas and the new unscripted show, Boston's Finest. As usual, we'll air the bulk of our original
programming on our big entertainment networks between now and the end of summer. In June, we'll bring the biggest
original shows back to TNT, including Rizzoli & Isles, Major Crimes, Falling Skies, and Perception and launch several
new unscripted series. At TBS, our biggest original comedies returned to the lineup in the second quarter, Men at Work
and Sullivan & Sons, and we'll debut a couple of new unscripted shows. And you can expect to hear more about the
continuing evolution of our original programming strategy for both TNT and TBS at our up-front presentation in a
couple of weeks.

Turning to some of our more targeted networks, Adult Swim continues to be a juggernaut. It posted its most-watched
quarter ever and again ranked number one on all of basic cable for total day delivery of adults and men, 18 to 34 and 18
to 49. And truTV saw extremely strong performance from some of its biggest hits and some of my favorite shows like
Hard Core Pawn and Practical Jokers and Lizard Lick Towing. Check that out.
At CNN, coverage of the recent tragic events in Boston and Texas reaffirmed that it is more essential than ever,
reaching more viewers in the key demos than any other news network as well as experiencing record traffic levels on
CNN digital. I'm optimistic that under its energized new leadership, CNN will build on its position as the leading
source of breaking news to become the destination for compelling TV all the time.
I'll shift next to HBO, which continues to perform at the very top of its game. Unless you've been hanging out with
some White Walkers north of the Wall, you know that Game of Thrones has become a cultural phenomenon. So far this
season, it is averaging over 13 million viewers per episode, making it the most-watched series on HBO since the
Sopranos. As a sign of its popularity, despite challenges in the home video business in general, the just-released second
season of Game of Thrones posted the highest first-day DVD and DST sales of any HBO series ever.
And Game of Thrones is only one part of what is arguably the strongest programming line-up in HBO's history. We
just debuted the second season of Veep to critical acclaim and we'll follow that with the return of True Blood in June,
The Newsroom in July, and Boardwalk Empire later this year, among others. We also have several exciting pilots in
development, including new shows from J.J. Abrams, Damon Lindelof, and Ryan Murphy.
At Warner Bros. we're finishing up a very strong TV season. Among adults 18 to 49, we've got four of the top six
comedies on the air: The Big Bang Theory, Two and a Half Men, 2 Broke Girls, and Mike & Molly. We've got both of
the breakout new dramas this season, Revolution, and The Following, and we have the number one reality show on TV,
The Voice.
With a really strong slate of returning shows and a promising crop of pilots this year, particularly 30-minute comedies
we think we're again really well-positioned heading into the up-front, over the next few weeks. Our theatrical results
over the last quarter were somewhat disappointing, as both Gangster Squad and Jack the Giant Slayer fell short of our
expectations. But our ability to post strong financial results in spite of this is a testament to the resilience and breadth of
Warner's businesses.
And importantly, all of our most promising and highly anticipated theatrical releases of the year are yet to come. Next
week, we'll premiere The Great Gatsby, followed by The Hangover Part 3, then Man of Steel, then Pacific Rim and at
the end of the year, the second film in The Hobbit trilogy. We're particularly excited about Man of Steel, which is
shaping up to be one of the biggest movies of the year and it's a real opportunity for us to re-launch the Superman
franchise.
As you may have seen in the press, we recently received a few very favorable legal rulings related to the Superman IP.
Those court decisions paved the way for us to be more aggressive in developing our future plans for Superman. We
hope to share more on that front soon. So all in all, it was another successful quarter for us both financially and
operationally, and although it's just the first quarter, we're really pleased about how we're starting off the year.
With that, I'll turn it over to John.
John K. Martin
Thanks, Jeff, and good morning. I'll begin by referring to the first slide which is now available on our website. And
starting with the consolidated highlights, we're off to a terrific start this year with adjusted operating income up 7% to a
first quarter record of $1.4 billion and adjusted EPS up over 20%. And if you look at the company, excluding the
results of the Publishing division, adjusted operating income was even stronger, up 10% year-over-year. We were able
to do that despite relatively flat revenue in the quarter, as costs were down low single digits year-over-year. That
resulted in margin expansion of 140 basis points on a total company basis and around 250 basis points for the Time
Warner, excluding the Publishing division. That's consistent with our expectation that we'll post a fifth straight year of

margin expansion in 2013, reflecting both underlying growth in our businesses and our commitment to efficiency gains.
Moving down the P&L, we continue to leverage growth in adjusted operating income into even faster growth in
adjusted EPS, and that was mostly due to a combination of a lower effective tax rate and our ongoing share repurchase
program. Coming into the year, we set a goal to once again deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth, and as Jeff
mentioned, with the first quarter now behind us, we have increased confidence we'll achieve that goal. We also had a
great start to the year for free cash flow generation, generating over $900 million in the quarter. So we fully expect to
deliver a lot of free cash in 2013, supporting our continued significant returns to shareholders.
During the quarter, we repurchased about $670 million of common stock and we paid $273 million in dividends. So we
think we're set up for another great year, as our investments in content, international expansion, and digital initiatives
continue to pay off.
Now let me turn to the segment highlights and let me begin with our largest segment, the Networks, where revenue
growth and margin expansion at both HBO and Turner resulted in record first quarter adjusted operating income for the
segment. Subscription revenues were up more than 5%, relatively consistent with the trends we saw for the full year
2012.
Our underlying rate increases are not changing much this year, but changes in unit growth, currency, and various other
factors can move the needle one way or another in any given quarter. We expect to remain in the mid-single digit range
for the balance of the year and we fully expect to see an acceleration in Subscription revenue growth in 2014 as Turner
will begin to see the benefits from its upcoming affiliate renewal cycle.
Turning to Advertising, revenues were down 1% year-over-year in the quarter, which is about in line with what we
expected coming into the quarter. There were a number of headwinds, and let me just mention a few. These included
the timing of the Final Four games, which fell into the second quarter this year. It also included the closure of certain
networks in India and Turkey last year and the transfer of management of SI.com and Golf.com to Time Inc. last year.
Looking through these items, domestic advertising was up in the mid-single digits with entertainment advertising,
including kids and young adults, up in the mid to high single-digit range, while news was down about 10%. And
International Advertising would have been down mid-single digits due to double-digit increases at International
Entertainment, which was more than offset by declines at International News.
Looking at the second quarter, we expect overall networks advertising growth to rebound and accelerate into the high
single digits. Recall that next quarter, we'll benefit from the timing of the Final Four and we'll finally lap the transition
of SI.com and Golf.com, back to Time Inc., as well as, the shutdown of India's Imagine.
In addition, the second quarter scatter market has been very healthy with double-digit premiums over up-front pricing.
Adjusted operating income was up 7% in the quarter at the networks with margins increasing 150 basis points. That
was a result of cost discipline, the timing of programming expenses, and the international network shutdowns last year.
However, we continue to invest in our most important brands, including a double-digit increase in Turner's original
programming spend this quarter.
For the full year, we continue to expect overall programming expenses to be up in the mid-to-high single-digit range.
We also anticipate that margins will be up for the year at the Networks Division, as revenue growth should improve,
beginning in the second quarter. So 2013 should be another really strong year of financial results for the Network
segment.
Turning now to film and TV. Despite the somewhat disappointing box office performance start of our films this quarter
Warner Bros. had a strong quarter financially. Adjusted operating income grew 23% year over year and margins
expanded more than 200 basis points. That was driven by the strong performance of our carryover films, the home
video sales from the first Hobbit film, and lower prints and advertising spend in the quarter. The performance of The
Hobbit on home video was part of a broader trend of stabilization for the industry. For the overall industry, the first
quarter was particularly encouraging in that regard as both sell-through and total home entertainment revenue increased
year-over-year.

Growth was especially strong for electronics sell-through, which was up over 60% from a year ago. It's particularly
encouraging to see these signs of stabilization even as some of the industry's digital initiatives, including UltraViolet,
remain at a relatively early stage.
On the SVOD front, we recognized about $75 million of revenue at this segment in the quarter, similar to last year,
with significant contribution from international territories. If you include Turner as well as Warner's, we recognized
about $100 million of SVOD revenue in the quarter and we continue to expect the SVOD distribution channel to be a
significant contributor to our results this year.
Looking ahead, as Jeff mentioned, over the next few months we'll start to release our most promising and anticipated
films of the year. Likewise we're optimistic about this TV pilot season and between a strong stable of returning shows
and a great line-up of pilots, we expect to be in a very strong position again this fall in television. With a really strong
film slate and continued momentum in TV, Warner Bros.' profits this year should be at least as good if not better than a
year ago.
Now moving on to publishing where both first quarter revenues and adjusted operating income were down somewhat
versus last year. A significant portion of the decline in adjusted operating income was due to higher restructuring
expenses this year and absent that increase, adjusted operating income would have been about flat in the quarter.
Advertising revenue was up 2% in the quarter, but that included the positive impact from the transfer of management of
SI.com and Golf.com back to Time Inc. And without this transfer advertising revenues would have been down
modestly year over year. And based on our current outlook for Q2, we expect advertising to be down somewhat again
in the second quarter.
Subscription revenues were down 11% in the first quarter, though that included the impact of certain weekly titles
having fewer issues in the quarter than in the prior year quarter. As we look to the rest of the year, we anticipate
subscription revenue declines to be more similar to the mid-single-digit declines that we experienced in 2012 at Time
Inc. We remain very focused here on taking costs out of the business, both to improve efficiency and to allow for
investment in growth initiatives. So as we previously announced, Time Inc. made significant reduction in its workforce
during the first quarter and restructuring costs were a little north of $50 million in Q1. This process is an important step
in preparing Time Inc. to operate successfully as a standalone public company.
Now let me move over and provide some additional context to our 2013 outlook. As I noted earlier, we're off to a great
start this year and we're on track to deliver another year of double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. In terms of quarterly
progression, we expect the second quarter to be very strong, and it could be perhaps the strongest growth rate quarter
we have in the year. And if you recall, in last year's second quarter, we had a significant inter-segment elimination
resulting from the Warner Bros. sale The Mentalist to Turner and we also had our softest quarter of the year at Time
Inc.
Along with positive underlying trends in our businesses, those year-over-year comparisons set us up for a very strong
second quarter growth rate. The second quarter should also benefit from an effective tax rate that will look similar to
the first quarter and below our expectation for the full year. That means our growth will likely be more heavily
weighted to the first half of this year, which is somewhat different from the past couple of years. But it is consistent
with what we expected as we entered 2013, and we feel pretty good about how things have started this year and how
things are shaping up.
I also want to remind you that we expect to begin accounting for our nearly 50% stake in Central European Media
Enterprises as an equity investment during the second quarter of 2013. And due to accounting rules associated with
this, we will be recasting, in the second quarter, our historical financials as though we had always accounted for CME
as an equity investment.
Now since CME produces net losses, this accounting change will be somewhat of a drag on earnings, but based on
what we know today, we're still comfortable with the absolute range of adjusted EPS in 2013 that is implied by our
current guidance.

Turn to the next slide, which looks at free cash flow. We generated about $935 million of free cash in the first quarter,
and that's up significantly from a year ago and that's primarily due to an improvement in working capital as well as a
decline in cash taxes. The reduced drag from working capital accounted for more than half of the improvement in
year-over-year free cash flow this quarter. And that was due largely to lower production spending at film and TV and
the timing of sports payments at our Networks division. The decline in cash taxes was a result of tax law extenders that
were passed by Congress in January, earlier this year. Given the strong start and our expectations for the remainder of
the year, free cash flow should be up nicely in 2013.
And moving over to our final slide, which looks at our net debt, we ended the quarter with $16.9 billion in net debt,
which is pretty similar to where we ended 2012 as we used slightly more than 100% of our free cash flow in the quarter
for dividends and share repurchases. That's almost $950 million in the quarter and that includes about $600 million –
$670 million of share repurchases.
Our leverage ratio is now 2.4 times, in line with where we ended 2012. We remain comfortable that a target leverage
ratio of 2.5 times strikes the right balance of maintaining balance sheet strength while allowing us to continue to invest
in our businesses, making acquisitions and returning capital to our stockholders. So we'll continue to manage our
balance sheet to stay in that range over the course of the year.
With that, let me turn it back to Doug in order to start the Q&A portion of the call. Thank you.
Douglas S. Shapiro
All right. Thanks, John. Dawn, could we please get the Q&A started, and I'd ask everyone to please limit themselves to
only one or two questions so we can get to as many people as possible. Thanks.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have John Janedis from UBS online. Please go ahead.
<Q - John Janedis>: Thank you. Jeff, to your point on HBO, creatively it's going great. Can you talk about what
you're seeing from a subscriber perspective? Any change in churn given the programming strength? And do you still
think you have pricing power given the increase in lower-priced substitutes? Thanks.
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: Yeah, I think subs are growing very well at HBO both domestically and overseas, particularly
overseas. I don't know if you're asking about first quarter but they were pretty – they move around in terms of the mix
of paying versus not paying subs. In general the trend is very buoyant. We think that subscribers love the programming.
We've got several shows that are record-audience shows led by Game of Thrones. HBO GO continues to pick up users,
registrations, and tremendous reports from the families are using it. Let me – what are you asking exactly?
<Q - John Janedis>: I guess what I'm asking is that given the strength of Game of Thrones et cetera, is that bringing
churn lower, I guess number one? And then number two, given some of the lower-priced substitutes for, let's say, $8 or
$10, is there any kind of impact in terms of your sub as it relates to some sort of substitution effect as a result of that?
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: Okay. Now I got it. No, I don't think there's any effect of other complementary services like
Netflix, et cetera. Remember both Netflix over-indexes in HBO homes and HBO over-indexes in Netflix comps, so
these are very complementary things.
On the churn side, churn is certainly kind of restrained and improved by strong programming at HBO, but the churn
dynamic for any pay TV service that floats on top of basic packages has a lot more to do with what the distributors are
doing in terms of price offers, vigor of marketing and so forth. Not that much to do with programming. But having said
that, HBO has the lowest churn of any premium service.

<Q - John Janedis>: Thank you.
<A - Douglas S. Shapiro>: Can we have the next question, please?
Operator
One moment please for your next question. Our next question comes from Ben Swinburne from Morgan Stanley.
Please go ahead.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: I think that's me. Is that me? Hi. Good morning. I have two questions, one housekeeping
just on the advertising, John. What was the actual domestic, international year-over-year growth rates or declines at
Networks this quarter?
<A - John K. Martin>: Hey, Ben.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Hey.
<A - John K. Martin>: So in the first quarter, I think I might have even said this, we reported down 1%. The
movement of the NCAA Final Four from Q1 to Q2, probably cost us about 200 basis points, and then all of the other
sort of noise, whether it's the Network shutdowns, the transfer of SI.com and Golf.com and FX was about another 200
basis points. So overall, organic ads were up call it around 3%.
And if you look at that between domestic and international, domestic was up mid-single digits right around 5% and
international was down mid-single digits right around 5%. And internationally, we saw particular strength in our
entertainment properties, which were up double digits with a very strong rebound in Latin America, and that was more
than offset by double-digit declines at News.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Okay. And then Jeff, I would love to hear your comments on some of the comments
Richard Pepler made I think over the last couple of months about HBO potentially exploring kind of a broadband-only
distribution plan with MVPDs. Sort of how real is that in your mind, how big of an opportunity is that? And in
particular, why would you argue that's consistent with your TV Everywhere strategy at Time Warner overall?
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: I'm not sure you have – I mean we always look at opportunities to increase the distribution, the
availability of HBO, and so I think Richard was speaking to that. We have done, for example, that model in
Scandinavia, where you can buy HBO the traditional way on TV with HBO GO attached to it from a traditional video
distributor there, but because they don't have that many multi pay subs over there, basically we also offered it through
broadband. So if you then go to the United States – I think you're asking about that?
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Yeah, yeah.
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: HBO's got 40 million HBO Cinemax subs here. We are vigorously offering HBO GO through
all our distributors. If you then go and say, well should we add it as a broadband only service, which you could do
through facilities-based providers or you could do it through non-facilities-based providers, which I think was the
discussion Richard was having, we have the rights to do it, and we would do it if we thought it was in our economic
best interest. At this point we don't think it makes sense, we don't think the target market is sufficiently large to be
attractive at this point. So what we're doing, and this is working pretty well, is we're working with the MVPDs to
increase the penetration of HBO in a mutually beneficial way. We're always going to keep evaluating it, depending on
the country. And I think that's what Richard was talking about. I think he's right to say it that way.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jessica Reif Cohen from Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: Oh, thanks. I have two questions, two topics. One is on SVOD. You mentioned that this
will be a strong year and I was just wondering, wondered if you could give us your current thoughts, you've talked
about in the past?
And also, how much of an opportunity do you think there is with Netflix moving away from Viacom? You guys have
one of the biggest, if not the biggest television library. So that's the first question.
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: All right. So you're asking just about SVOD outlook for 2013?
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: Yes.
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: Like going forward? Good. It's pretty good. What we have said, I'll try to remember all the
things we've said publicly. We have disclosed that we generated over $350 million in revenue from SVOD sales in
2012. We think that's near the top of our competitive set and then that does not include the revenue from the CW
Network deal, which is pretty significant. As we look at this year, we feel very good: we've got some deals we've
already done; we have a number of agreements that we did last year that have ongoing components; we've recently
signed additional deals with both Amazon and Netflix, and we did that both at Warner's and at Turner. We're in active
negotiations with all the major players, including those buyers. So we think it'll be a significant revenue stream for us
again this year and it may well grow this year.
But we do want to keep it in perspective. It's a small percentage of our revenue; it's only around 10% of our TV
syndication revenue last year and it's about 3% of total Film and TV. So hopefully it'll grow. I want to make another
point, which is, take the biggest SVOD buyer outside of HBO, which is the biggest, Netflix on the new basis it's getting
more selective what Netflix is trying to buy, and we thought that would happen and we think it's a good trend for us, I
think what'll happen with SVOD providers, broadband, is they're going to focus more on current content, especially
back seasons of series that are currently on the air and some select high-value library series. We have not done – we've
got the biggest supply in all of those categories – we haven't done kind of general deals that require people to take less
[ph] designs (32:28) here. So we think we're in the catbird seat from that point of view with all the SVOD buyers.
<Q - Jessica Reif Cohen>: Great. And then just a completely separate topic. On CNN, can you talk a little bit – you
made a lot of changes and continue to make changes, but what is the upside over the next couple of years with ratings
improvement? Are the affiliate contracts from the same cycle as the Turner Networks?
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: Yeah, they are. The biggest upside is in affiliate improvement; we think there's a lot of
correction there. There's certainly a lot you can do on the advertising side, but let's focus on really the strength of CNN
as it comes back here. We think the new leadership's off to a great start; there's real momentum in the ratings. If you
look at April, it's significant progress. CNN is number two. HLN is number three. If you look at online, we had our
highest day in history this last month. You can see, as you just look at what happened in Boston last week, and we keep
all of us saying this over and over, whenever there's a global news item of interest, CNN is the first place to go. We're
getting better all the time at extending that and covering it in all its dimensions.
So we have said as, having said that, that CNN can't just mean politics and wars. We're good, we will cover those, but
we don't need to start a war to have a success at CNN. We do need to be more competitive in the mornings, we're
working on that. I think you can see the focus on some of our broadening of what we're doing in the hires of Chris
Cuomo, Jake Tapper and Rachel Nichols. You can see it in the success of Anthony Bourdain. And so we think because,
remember, more people tune in to CNN than any other news channel and the issue is how long do they tune in, we're
making strides on the length of time that people watch CNN as we really basically deepen the programming.
<A - John K. Martin>: Just a quick amplification too. Looking at the second quarter, I talked a little bit about ad
revenue strengthening. We are seeing improvements in the news category both domestically and internationally in Q2,
so that's also encouraging.

<A - Douglas S. Shapiro>: Okay, the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Morris from Davenport and Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael C. Morris>: Thanks. First, just following up on that question of news. The news ratings, not just for
CNN but some of your competitors have been down pretty significantly so far this year. Now I'm curious, where do
you think that audience is going? And hopefully that does kind of tie into the comments you just made about the new
programming, but I guess I want to get a little better understanding of why you feel certain that, that opportunity is
there, where those people are going and how you're – where you're winning them back from? And then I have a
follow-up.
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: Well, remember – Okay. The reason is it's really what – it's in your question. You have, the
ratings were down at all the news networks, the number of people tuning in was not down. And so what you have is a
variation in either the sense of urgency people have around the country or the world as to whether they want to watch
news coverage or if there's something happening of great interest to them. And then secondly, you have the question of
whether the news channels are delivering the kind of coverage that would motivate people to stay.
So it's not an issue of reach. It's not an issue of whether people are showing up and are interested in the news. It's really
a question of whether the programming is engaging and whether, what the news is, is drawing audiences. We have seen
Fox, as one of our competitors, moving more to the extreme and MSNBC doing the same thing on the other side. We
think that's a huge opportunity for us, and because we have more people tuning in to us than either of them do, we think
that if we just do a job on finding the news and the coverage that satisfies them, that they find relevant to stay for a little
longer than just getting the headlines, that we have a great upside.
And I would add one thing, which is the media world, the press world covers very intensely all the developments in
online or digital that are relatively, they think, small but portend the future. CNN's digital and online business is the
biggest one out there. It ought to get more attention.
<Q - Michael C. Morris>: Great. Thanks for that. And then also on the international side, on Turner International, I
think you made a management change about a year ago right now. Can you talk a little bit about the progress there in
terms of strategy, both any markets that you're focused on or increasingly focused on? Or also whether – is news the
focus? Is more entertainment content a focus? Just any update there would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: Yeah, you're referring to Gerhard Zeiler who's the CEO of Turner International. First thing I
would say is we're coordinating more and we have more positions of strength between Turner, HBO and Warner's in
various places overseas where we're concentrated, particularly in Latin America. Secondly, I think we've said many
times, and we're pretty much on track, that our international business is on track to make $1 billion in operating
earnings in the next few years; it'll be either 2014 or 2015 that we hit that. Some of the change, if you're asking for
specifics, has been the cleaning up of efforts that didn't work like in India and Turkey, and a lot of the rest of the
change is essentially focused on the places where we've been churning along.
I think it's important to point out that the margins overseas, we're usually the leading share player on the multi-channel
side where we're competing, and our margins overall are still in the 20%s. They've improved 500 or 600 basis points on
an underlying basis over the last couple of years if you leave out shutdowns. And so there's kind of a – we all know
there's a growing multi-channel market out there; we've got tremendous position in distribution; we have channels from
Turner to HBO to Warner that make a nice package; and you have basically an opportunity, because these are scale
operations of raising margins pretty rapidly, because we're in that phase of growth in Latin America, Eastern Europe
and in Asia. So that's basically the outlook. It's pretty strong.
<A - John K. Martin>: Just one further thing, Michael. Specific to next quarter and then this year, we do anticipate
our international network ratings at Turner to begin to improve in the second quarter, so I think Q1 will probably be the
low watermark for the year. And then because of the restructuring initiatives that have already been put in place, we

think that the profit growth internationally at Turner this year is going to be really, really substantial and we're going to
experience meaningful margin expansion in 2013.
<Q - Michael C. Morris>: That's very helpful. Thank you.
<A - Douglas S. Shapiro>: All right, can we get to the next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente from Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Anthony Joseph DiClemente>: Hi. Thank you. Two questions. At the Film and TV segment, John, you called
out EST growth of 60%. Wondering, as you look at your newer home video releases like Hobbit or Argo, what
percentage of units sold for a property like that these days are digital versus physical? It seems like digital is
accelerating. Is that – and what is that from? Is it distribution of EST platforms? Is it pricing? Is it tablet growth?
And then, second question, there's been some talk out there about Turner carriage of The Final Four in your talks with
CBS and the chance that that could move up. I wonder if you could remind us strategically of the puts and takes there,
your willingness to absorb a greater percentage of the licensing cost in order to perhaps strengthen your content
portfolio ahead of your affiliate renewals? Thanks for the two questions.
<A - John K. Martin>: Thanks, Anthony. I'll take the first one. I don't know title by title specifically the differential in
EST versus traditional physical sales. I mean something like The Hobbit frankly across all distribution methods
exceeded our expectations. If you look at EST in the quarter for us, and we probably have the lead EST share across the
industry, we were up in the first quarter 20% year-over-year and the overall EST revenues were north of $75 million. If
you look at EST and VOD, which is another important form of digital distribution, it was up significantly in the quarter
and we approached – we were north of $150 million, close to, approaching $200 million in the quarter. And just a
reminder, if you add SVOD onto that; if you add EST, SVOD and VOD, last year we were at $1 billion. So those three
forms are already big, and frankly that's one of the reasons why you're seeing stabilization in the overall home
entertainment market in general, and it's one of the reasons why we're feeling more optimistic about the going forward
performance of the home entertainment business. So I apologize, I don't have the specifics for the newer titles.
<Q - Anthony Joseph DiClemente>: That's helpful.
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: On the NCAA question, we do have the option to start airing The Final Four next year, and that
does not involve any incremental payments from us. So we have not made an announcement on that front yet, but it's
something we've been discussing with CBS, so stay tuned.
<Q - Anthony Joseph DiClemente>: What would be the downside to doing that if there aren't any incremental costs
or losses incurred?
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: There would not be a downside.
<Q - Anthony Joseph DiClemente>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Douglas S. Shapiro>: Stay tuned. Next question, please.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Greenfield from BTIG. Please go ahead.
<Q - Richard S. Greenfield>: Hi, thanks. When you look – we love the HBO GO app especially because the way it
curates a deep catalog experience, yet when you look at apps like the Turner apps, the content is significantly more
limited and we've even seen you sell back episodes of things like Fallen Skies to Amazon or Netflix. I forget which off
the top of my head. But why not follow the HBO GO strategy with authentication to drive sub fees even higher when

you force people to authenticate and really drive more usage of those apps? Basically, why the difference in strategy
between HBO GO and the Turner assets?
And then if you could just touch on, Cinemax, seems like you've had real progress over the course of the last six
months. You never really talk about Cinemax on your conference calls; could you just update us on how big it is today
and how big it could be over the next couple of years?
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: Yeah, thanks, Rich. Let's go with Cinemax first. So Cinemax subs have been growing well in
America and overseas. Cinemax original programming has a new genre over the last year or so, you have Strike Back,
Hunted, Banshee. I've watched them all. If any of you on the call have not seen every episode of all those shows, go
home. Well don't go home, just turn on your iPads right now and watch them all, take the rest of the day off. They're
really good.
If you're asking – and I think it's a good question about, what about a more robust offering of VOD rights for basic
channels, Turner are ours, but there's all the other ones owned by other companies. I think it's a good question but you
said a lot when you mentioned the distributors. What you have to do in basic is you have to try to figure out how to get
the industry, or if you're going to do something different, have it work in a package of other channels. So up to now, we
were the lead company, we did it first of put in at least five episodes of every series that we have on our Turner
Networks up there for free to subscribers on VOD and on broadband availability. We haven't been acquiring the back
season rights, for as you asked, deeper stacks of full seasons for the TV offerings yet. It's a big question because we're
not really able to monetize them through carriage fees. If you took a show and put it on right now, it's not that easy to
get monetization, whereas if you're selling kind of library serialized – think of a series – to an SVOD provider, you can
get monetized and those are the natural places for consumers to find those shows and look deeply at 10, 20, 30
episodes. So kind of Video on Demand is the best way to watch serialized – series. It can be VOD like it is on HBO as
it could be on TNT, but it's essentially a model that has to evolve. So we're keeping an eye on the balance of how to
make all of these networks, TBS, TNT, [ph] TruTV along with HBO stronger and be things that viewers know they can
go there and watch their favorite series and whichever episode of that. It's easy to do in pay TV, as you saw us do with
all our shows on HBO, than it is on basic.
<Q - Richard S. Greenfield>: And, Jeff or John, is there any way to just quantify what percentage or even like the size
of Cinemax in the portfolio relative to HBO just as it keeps growing? It seems like a big opportunity that – trying to get
our arms around that size potential.
<A - John K. Martin>: Domestically, I think we ended 2012 with about 41 million HBO/Cinemax subs. We don't
break out the specific numbers, but HBO generally has twice the number of Cinemax, but Cinemax, just to echo what
Jeff said, has been growing very, very healthily. And then outside the U.S., I don't even know how many we have, I
mean it's – we have 71-plus million HBO/Cinemax subs outside the U.S., they grew by 35% last year. A big chunk of
that growth was Cinemax, particularly in Latin America.
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: I just want to say, we – in domestic we have – the relation HBO to Cinemax [indiscernible]
(47:09) it's more than two times HBO. HBO is a bigger share than that.
<Q - Richard S. Greenfield>: Thanks.
<A - Douglas S. Shapiro>: All right. Next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Alexia Quadrani. I'm sorry, from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Hi. Thank you. Just looking at the WB, the TV studio business, are you seeing any change
in demand from where the traditional syndicated programming domestically as more networks are focusing on original
programming and if so, maybe that's more than offset by international demand?

And then just a second question, just to follow up on your earlier comments on the SVOD business that you made. Is
there any way you can quantify how big of an opportunity there is for potential revenues outside of Netflix, if Netflix
were to really pull back on the syndication programming?
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: All right so you're – you're asking about demand in syndication first, or – is that what you're
asking?
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Yeah, just demand by the -
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: The demand by regular syndicated buyers?
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Exactly.
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: Okay, it's up for A titles and it's up around the world as well. So, it's a very strong market for A
titles. The B titles are tending to go more and more to either some cable or some SVOD players and it kind of divides,
as we've said many times, between serialized things versus non-serialized things; the serialized are more used to
subscription VOD players. What was the other question?
<A - John K. Martin>: Oh, on SVOD.
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: SVOD.
<A - John K. Martin>: We've been doing deals with other SVOD providers outside of Netflix actually all along and if
you just look at the first quarter, about 30% to 35% of the deals that we did – that we recognized in revenue were
non-Netflix and a considerable portion of those are outside the U.S. And so, I just want also reiterate and repeat what
Jeff said a little bit to you earlier – to an earlier question because I think your question somewhat assumes that we have
a lot of risk should Netflix pull back and change its buying patterns. We don't really see that. And as Jeff said a little bit
earlier, we haven't really sold these huge, blanket, library deals perhaps as some of our other media companies have
had. So we think if – to the extent that a Netflix or frankly all of the SVOD providers become more selective, we've got
the best shows that we think demand is going to go up.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: So that $350 million that you saw last year, that could potentially grow – grow this year in
2013?
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: Yeah.
<A - John K. Martin>: Yeah, I mean. Yeah – yeah.
<Q - Alexia S. Quadrani>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Douglas S. Shapiro>: Next question, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Nathanson from Nomura. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Brian Nathanson>: Thanks. I have one for John and one for Jeff. John, could you give me some help on
programming cost growth I know the shutdowns of the networks internationally have helped you. What is – what
would like-for-like programming expense growth be in the first quarter? And when you gave your guidance for the
whole year, how are you factoring in the shutdown within your guidance?
<A - John K. Martin>: Well, if you look at programming costs, which were basically essentially flat in the quarter, I
think they were down 1%.
<Q - Michael Brian Nathanson>: Right.

Page 13 of 14
<A - John K. Martin>: They were lower than they ordinarily would be for really three reasons. It's the NCAA
shutdown – excuse me the NCAA move from Q1 to Q2, it was also the shutdowns, as you said. And it was also – we
had a pretty big right off for a series at HBO last year. So on a normalized basis, programming costs would have been,
call it mid-single-digits, which is consistent with our plans to grow programming mid-to-high single digits over time
and I think I even said that in my proactive remarks in 2013, that's the expectation. But I just want to remind everybody
that that does include significant investments in original programming and sports.
So in other words, we're already factoring that into the mid-to-high single-digit outlook. Because we know that we've
got several components of programming expenses that are growing more slowly than that, are either flat or low
single-digit. So we do expect overall programming costs to increase, but we think they're going to be at a very
measured and controlled pace. And obviously beyond programming costs, we are looking to restrain growth in all
non-revenue generating expenses, and you saw that again and again this quarter. So...
<Q - Michael Brian Nathanson>: And, John, that's on a reported basis, your guidance, is reported mid-single digit
programming expense growth?
<A - John K. Martin>: Correct. Underlying.
<Q - Michael Brian Nathanson>: Okay. Okay. And then – and then, Jeff can you just go back to?
<A - John K. Martin>: I'm sorry, Michael. Just to qualify, it's going to basic – over an annual period, it is going to
basically be about the same.
<Q - Michael Brian Nathanson>: Okay.
<A - John K. Martin>: Reported and normalized.
<Q - Michael Brian Nathanson>: Okay. Hey, Jeff, the last question about the value of A titles are going up in the
world, and that's totally true. The question I have though is, as a buyer of syndicated content at Turner, does your
definition of A titles change over time? Like what was considered an A title two years ago [audio gap] (52:45).
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: [audio gap] (52:57) comedy A titles, let's take Two and a Half Men. I mean Two and a Half
Men, Big Bang. Two and a Half is on Fox, Big Bang is on, what's that? Big Bang is on TBS. Clearly, extremely
successful and valuable and holding up well on whichever networks they go to. So that's a very healthy ecosystem. It's
a very good part of our programming mix for a basic channel. That's comedies – as we know, they've been resilient for
decades. Dramas are kind of interesting. It's a bigger field. We certainly think titles like Mentalist, Hawaii Five-O are A
titles. There are plenty of buyers for them. The question that is going to emerge over time, is that as the cable networks,
TNT, USA, FX, et cetera, move into drama production, it started at HBO, now everyone is doing it. You end up with a
kind of a continuum of successful cable originals that, depending on the kind of niche appeal of a show on AMC versus
a show on TNT, et cetera, that then starts to proliferate production into those cable hour drama originals.
It's then – you still have the power and value of hit hours that come off of the big networks like Mentalist, like NCIS,
but the relative performance of those kind of off-network, hour drama hits, still A titles, may change just because you
have more and more kind of fragmentation and focused appeal of cable hours. So, you know, it's a moving – it's a
moving spectrum. We feel very happy about our position at Warners as the biggest producer and seller of those across
the five broadcast networks, so we have a lot them to put into syndication or cable networks or SVOD. And then on the
Turner side we have such an advantaged schedule of, kind of – you know we've got a very healthy schedule of both
originals and acquired. We have great access to acquired hits. So as we figure out what the optimal mix of acquired
dramas is versus cable original produced dramas, we're going to be able to dial it up and down on both sides. So that's
essentially how we see it and we've got a pretty good position of flexibility.
<A - Douglas S. Shapiro>: All right, Dawn, can we get the last question, please?

Sure. Our last question comes from Michael Senno from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael Senno>: Hi. Good morning. Two quick ones if I could. One, in terms of international, if you were to
look at any M&A opportunities, would you provide some context on what attributes, what type of assets you may be
looking at, and what areas of the globe you're interested in complementing the current portfolio?
And then second, just in terms of, you know, Time Warner being one of the more aggressive TV Everywhere early
adopters, do you think a virtual MSO is the catalyst that's needed to really accelerate the adoption of TV Everywhere in
its ultimate form?
<A - Jeff L. Bewkes>: No to that question. We don't have theological views about it. On your international first
question, we've said this a lot and certainly we can remember it. I'm not sure you should, but the areas that we focused
on are ones where we think there are – there is basically high secular growth both in the underlying economies and in
the video habits of the population. And then secondly, where there is reasonably hospitable rule of law and acceptance
of non-local media network operators – foreign ownership. So basically, what we've said, and still say, is that South
America, Central America, that's all of Latin America it has been a very strong market for us. We have the leading
network position of any non-local broadcaster or network operator across all of Latin America.
We've said Eastern Europe and while the Eastern Europe economic macro situation is a bit difficult, we've got an
interesting position at CME that we're optimistic about. And we're in the midst of helping to strengthen the financial
resources of CME. So we think that's going to be a great long-term network across numerous countries in Eastern
Europe. And we think Eastern Asia – we think Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia where we've got a lot of – we're
number one actually in all of our HBO territories, including the Asian ones, and we've got some good position with our
Turner Networks there. We think that's the other obvious growth area so we're going to put more emphasis there.
