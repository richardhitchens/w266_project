H. Lawrence Culp
Matt, thanks. Good morning, everyone.
In the second quarter, better than anticipated core revenue growth and outstanding execution from our team led to
strong earnings, margin, and cash flow performance. Core revenue growth of 2.5% was slightly higher than expected,
led by Hach, Gilbarco [GVR], Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, and our Life Sciences platform, all of which were up
mid-single digits. Investments we've made in innovation and go-to-market initiatives in the high growth markets
continue to drive growth and help us capture market share.
The impact of the Danaher Business System and the quality of this growth were evident in the excellent year-over-year
margin improvement in the quarter. Our gross margin improved by $140 million or 100 basis points, and our core
operating margin expanded 95 basis points.
As we look to the second half, we intend to make additional investments aimed at share gains and margin expansion for
2014 and beyond.
So with that as a backdrop, let me move to the details of the quarter. Today we reported second quarter diluted net
earnings per share of $0.87, a 3.5% increase compared to our diluted net earnings per share a year ago, and representing
another record quarter for Danaher. Excluding a $0.03 gain recognized in the prior-year period, adjusted net earnings
per share increased 7.5% year over year. Revenues increased 4% to $4.7 billion, with core revenues up 2.5%. The
impact of acquisitions increased revenues by 2%, while the negative impact of currency translation reduced sales by
0.5%.
From a geographic perspective, high-growth markets grew single digits. In particular, we saw sequential improvements
in Brazil and the Middle East, as each region was up more than 15% year on year. China saw low double-digit growth
in the second quarter, led by our Life Sciences & Diagnostics and Dental segments, which grew in excess of 20%. In
addition, our water quality platform in China grew at a double-digit rate for the second quarter in a row. Developed
markets were up slightly, with the U.S. and Japan up low single digits and Western Europe down low single digits.
Our gross margin increased 100 basis points year over year to 52.7%, driven by both volume increases and prior
year-over-year productivity improvements. This significant improvement has allowed us to increase our growth
investments while still delivering excellent bottom line results. Our reported operating plan in the second quarter was
essentially flat at 17.8%, while core operating margin improved 95 basis points.
The Danaher Business System continued to serve us well, helping to generate yet another quarter of solid cash flow
performance. Second quarter operating cash flow was $899 million, and free cash flow was $763 million. Our free cash
to net income conversion ratio for the second quarter was 124%.

We continued to find attractive bolt-on opportunities and closed over $300 million of acquisitions in the quarter,
focused in our Environmental and Life Sciences & Diagnostics segments. Given our healthy balance sheet, we have
more than $8 billion of potential M&A capacity available through 2014 to expand and strengthen our strategic growth
platforms.
Turning to our five operating segments, Test & Measurement core revenues increased 0.5%. Core operating margin
decreased 30 basis points, while our reported operating margin declined 60 basis points to 20.9%. In our Instruments
platform, core revenues declined low single digits. Fluke's core revenues were flat, with 10% growth in the high growth
markets offset by weak demand in most developed markets. However, we are encouraged by the mid-single-digit
growth we saw in North American industrial instruments during the quarter.
At Tektronix, core revenues declined low single digits, with growth rates in both developed and high growth markets
improving sequentially from the first quarter.
Core revenues for our Communications platform grew low single digits, led by strength in the high growth markets,
specifically the Middle East and Latin America. Across the platform, we've increased our R&D spending by
approximately 15% year to date, focusing on new product development and innovation to address the expanding needs
of our wireless and enterprise customers.
At Fluke Networks, we unveiled the new Versiv product family designed for copper and fiber certification during
network installation. The DSX-5000 CableAnalyzer gives field technicians unmatched speed and efficiency in
certifying performance in copper cables, while the CertiFiber Pro provides the same certification capability for fiber
networks.
At Arbor Networks, demand for network security solutions remains very strong across all major geographies. During
the quarter, we added over 50 new customers in both the enterprise and service provider markets, which include
significant expansion orders at two large global financial institutions. As a testament to Arbor's innovation in leadership
and network security, they were recently named the Best Overall Security Company during the Info Products Guide
Awards at the RSA Conference.
Turning to our Environmental segment, revenues increased 8% in the quarter, with core revenues increasing 4%. The
segment core-operating margin increased 70 basis points, with reported operating margin essentially flat, due primarily
to the dilutive effect of recent acquisitions.
Our Water Quality platform core revenues increased at a low single-digit rate. Hach grew mid-single digits, driven by
core lab and process instrumentation and mid-teens growth in service. We believe we are growing faster than the
market. Geographically, the U.S. was up mid-single digits in the quarter, while China grew double digits, driven by
solid demand for drinking water projects.
During the quarter, we launched several new products, including a value item electrochem product designed
specifically for China. We also unveiled the 5500sc silica analyzer, which features predictive diagnostics software,
allowing customers to avoid unplanned downtime caused by silica buildup on boilers and turbines in power gen
stations.
Gilbarco Veeder-Root's core revenues grew mid-single digits, led by healthy demand across all major product lines and
most major geographies. Sales in Asia and the Middle East were particularly robust, driven by large customer site
upgrades for dispensers and payment solutions. We believe we are gaining share with our point-of-sale and payment
products, both of which grew at mid-teens rates in the quarter.
GVR recently completed the previously announced acquisition of Automated Fuel Systems Group, a leading provider
of fuel management solutions to government, fleet, and mining customers in South Africa.
Moving over to Life Sciences & Diagnostics, revenues increased 5.5%, with core revenues up 5%. We saw outstanding
margin performance, with our core operating margin improving 180 basis points, and our reported operating margin
increasing 130 basis points to 14.4%. This strong margin performance occurred even with a double-digit increase in
R&D expenses at Beckman Coulter Diagnostics, where we continue to ramp up our product development efforts.

The Diagnostics platform continued their solid performance, with mid-single digit core growth in the quarter. At
Beckman, core sales increased at a mid-single-digit rate, with growth in all major product categories.
This quarter marks the second anniversary of the Beckman Coulter acquisition. And we are exceptionally pleased with
the progress that's been made by the team around the world. We've seen low single digit core growth or better for the
last five quarters, and the business is becoming more competitive each day. Over the last eight quarters, we've made
significant improvements in our internal capabilities, specifically addressing on-time delivery, service, and product
quality through improved design to ensure that we're serving our customers well. We've also made tremendous progress
to enhance efficiency, with second quarter operating margin expanding 150 basis points year over year.
We've also made considerable progress on the regulatory front. For example, we recently received FDA 510(k)
clearance for the Troponin Assay for use on our Access 2 system. This approval allows Beckman to offer Troponin to
new customers in the U.S. for the first time since 2010 and marks an important milestone for our customers as well as
the Beckman Coulter team.
As Beckman enters its third year with Danaher, we are actively increasing growth investments in the business,
particularly in R&D, to boost new product vitality and ultimately drive higher organic growth rates.
At Radiometer, core sales were up at a high single-digit rate, with growth in all major product lines. High growth
markets were up more than 20% in the quarter, led by China, which grew about 45%. Instrument placements were
particularly strong in the quarter, with blood gas up 25% and AQT up over 50%. As previously announced, Radiometer
closed the acquisition of HemoCue, a leader in hemoglobin and glucose point-of-care testing.
At Leica Biosystems, sales increased at a mid-single-digit rate, led by Advanced Staining, which was up low teens in
the quarter. Most major geographies saw growth, with particular strength in China, which grew at a high teens rate.
Further, our core histology business grew low single digits year over year. And we were pleased to report that Leica
Biosystems can be found in 100% of the top 50 cancer centers in America, as recently ranked by U.S. News & World
Report.
Subsequent to quarter's end, Leica Biosystems acquired Amsterdam-based Kreatech Diagnostics. Along with Leica's
Advanced Staining instruments, Kreatech's probes and reagents enable customers to detect genetic aberrations that may
lead to cancer and other diseases.
At our Life Sciences platform, core revenues increased at a mid-single-digit rate in the quarter. AB SCIEX core
revenues were up mid-single digits, led by robust growth in pharma and the applied markets, particularly food and
environmental. The 6500, our high-end Triple Quad platform, continues to be very well received by customers globally
in all major market segments, and is expected to generate more than $100 million in revenue on an annualized basis.
AB SCIEX recently launched its 3200MD CE-IVD series of mass spectrometers for clinical diagnostic use in Europe.
This is an exciting achievement for AB SCIEX, as the 3200MD expands their addressable market to include clinical
care customers. And we look forward to leveraging channel synergies with our diagnostics platform to help drive
growth of this largely previously focused product category from the research realm.
Leica Microsystems core revenues were up mid-single digits, led by double-digit growth in China, the Middle East, and
Japan. We continue to see solid demand for our Confocal Microscopy systems, which grew over 10% in the quarter.
Demand for our SP8 modular Confocal laser scanning microscope remains robust, growing at a high teens rate. To
expand our go-to-market efforts in Latin America, we acquired Aotec, Leica's distribution partner for microscopy and
histopathology solutions, based in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
Turning to Dental, segment revenues grew 3% in the second quarter, with core revenues up 2.5%. Core operating
margins increased 90 basis points while reported operating margin expanded 90 basis points to 15.3%. Dental
consumables core revenues grew mid-single digits, led by sales of professional dental consumables across most major
geographies. In addition, our implant business grew at a high teens rate, as they continued to take market share. Kerr
recently launched the Demi Ultra curing light system, the industry's first ultra-capacitor powered light curing system,
which provides dentists with more efficient curing and eliminates the need for battery power.

Ormco's Insignia Advanced Smile Design received the 2013 American Technology Award in health and medical
technologies from the TechAmerica Foundation. This award is presented annual to the product that most improves the
delivery of health services.
KaVo's core revenues were up low single digits, driven by demand in China and other high-growth markets. Last
quarter we highlighted the new i-CAT FLX, which achieved a full 3D scan at lower radiation doses than traditional 2D
panoramic X-ray imagers. Reception in the market has been outstanding, with the FLX receiving a Best New Product
award at the Henry Schein national sales meeting and the 2013 Pride Institute award for best-in-class technology.
In Industrial Technologies, total revenues increased 2% while core revenues declined 2.5% for the quarter. Both our
reported and core operating margin increased 110 basis points, with our reported operating margin at 23.5%.
Our Motion business's core revenues declined at a mid-teens rate, with weakness in most major verticals. We've begun
to see signs of stabilization in North American distribution, which grew modestly both year over year and sequentially.
As evidenced by strong profit performance, Motion continues to transition out of some of their lower margin business.
This transition will continue to impact core revenues, which are expected to remain negative in the second half of this
year.
Core revenues for our Product Identification platform were up mid-single digits, with solid demand from our in-line
variable printing technologies as well as our packaging and color management solutions. Sales increased across most
major geographies.
Those of you who joined us last week in Chicago at our Investor Day saw first-hand the evolution of our Product ID
platform from our core marking and coding businesses into a leading provider of integrated packaging solutions
spanning the entire consumer packaging value chain. I thought our team did a great job illustrating how we use strategy
and DBS to establish and then build and grow a strategic platform. For those of you that weren't able to participate, I
strongly encourage you to watch the replay available on our website.
At Videojet, new product introductions have been an important driver of our share gains. In the quarter, we introduced
the 1620 and 1650 lines of ultra-high-speed printers capable of speeds 40% faster than the previous industry benchmark
with minimal planned downtime. Also in the quarter, Procter & Gamble announced their adoption of Pantone's new
cloud-based color management solution, PantoneLIVE, which improves operational efficiency throughout the
packaging supply chain. This is the second major consumer packaged goods company to adopt PantoneLIVE, building
on early momentum in the market.
So to wrap up, we were very pleased with our second quarter results. Better than anticipated core revenue growth and
outstanding execution led to solid operational performance.
We are initiating third quarter diluted net earnings per share guidance of $0.78 to $0.83, which assumes 2% to 3% core
revenue growth. We are narrowing our full-year 2013 adjusted diluted net earnings per share guidance to $3.37 to
$3.42 from a previous range of $3.32 to $3.47. As we move into the second half of the year, we're maintaining a
conservative macro outlook while staying confident in our ability to deliver solid operating margin expansion. We
expect investments in innovation and the high growth markets to continue to drive growth and share gains. Our
earnings outperformance in the second quarter allows us to make additional high-impact growth investments and to
fund productivity and efficiency initiatives that we believe will position us well for the balance of this year and beyond.
Matt R. McGrew
Thanks, Larry. Jennifer, that concludes the formal comments. We are now ready for some questions.

Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Scott Davis with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi, good morning, guys.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Good morning, Scott.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Good morning, Scott.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the investments you're making. Larry, can you help
us understand? How much of this is driving growth versus restructuring and cutting costs? And I guess the question, the
obvious question here is are you investing more money because you're seeing or thinking there's going to be a
reacceleration of growth, or is it more focused on getting costs out ahead of continued weak – a relatively weak macro
environment?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Scott, I would say that operationally, this is really more of the same, consistent with the
path we've been on in this slower growth macro environment that we're operating in today. And frankly, I think we see
ourselves working through going forward. So there's no macro call here to suggest we've seen an inflection point
relative to things getting materially better, and hence we want to be ready for that. I think that, as we've seen through
the first half of this year, we've been well served, having in the past positioned ourselves not only with the step up in
R&D to drive new product launches but also our step up, particularly in the high growth markets, to go grab market
share where we can. And in turn, to make sure we're being smart about our cost structure, we can make those
investments and drive the margin expansion and the earnings growth that you've seen.
So what we're really talking about here in terms of taking the beat and putting it back into the business, if you will, in
the second half, is really a combination of stepping up those growth investments both in R&D and sales and marketing
as well as in those productivity efforts that you've typically seen us put through in the second half. We flagged last year
on that point or the end of last year that we probably had dialed in about $70 million this year in the back half to do
that. We're going to step that up here certainly as we look to the second half. But again, it's really a balanced approach
to make sure we're making the investments for share gains and margin expansion as we work our way through the
second half of this year.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Excellent. And as a follow-up to that, Larry, when you think about the step up you've had in
R&D, you're already fairly – you've always been a fairly large investor in R&D, so it's not as if you've underinvested in
the past. But the step up in 2013 versus 2012, do you anticipate this being an ongoing trend and then you have another
step up in 2014, or does this reset the bar and you hold to this level versus sales longer term?
I had just a quick follow-up to that. Just conceptually, every company we cover is raising R&D as a percent of sales,
and I think even in the medical world that's happening. Has this become a little bit of a tax, if you will, that it just costs
more to drive incremental growth and you don't really get that much net benefit because everybody is investing more?
So it's a bit of an arms race, or is there really some differentiation that you think can occur with that added investment?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Scott, this is Dan. As we look back at Q2, we really saw the benefit across a number of the
businesses in the step up at R&D. So we talked about Hach, Barco, PID are all businesses where we think we took
share in the quarter. There, our new product revenues improved sequentially 50% Q1 to Q2, and we think that was a
big driver of the share gains. So I think we're seeing – we're not seeing it everywhere, but some of this targeted step up
we've made in R&D, we are seeing the payback for that. And I think as long as we continue to see that and we're taking
share, our bias would be to spend more.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Sure. That's the crux of my question, right? If you can gain share, it's definitely worth it. If it's
just to grow in line with the market you have to spend more, then industry structure starts to come into question, I
guess.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Scott, to the structural question, I would just add. I think Dan is spot on there; that if you
were in the sessions with us as we talked to the businesses, the tone is really fundamentally an offensive one. We see

opportunities to do things no one else does. We see opportunities to help our customer in a way that maybe we uniquely
can. And that really drives the agenda, the budget, and any step up that you see. There are really not a lot of examples
where we're sitting there saying gosh, there's catch-up to be made, a tax, as you say, to be paid. So I think that
qualitatively combined with the quantitative market share impact that we're seeing suggests these are good investments
for us. But we'll continue to be prudent to make sure we're getting those returns as we put this additional money in.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay, it looks like it's working, so I'll pass it on. Thanks, guys. I appreciate it.

Operator
Thank you. We'll go next to Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Hey, good morning.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Just on the second quarter, I understand that it's a similar revenue seasonality, if I'm doing the
math correct on the core, as last year. Is that right, first of all, just a sequential decline?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Yes.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: So we were down – last year we were down about $140 million Q2 to Q3. We have probably
have become a little bit more seasonal, a little weaker in Q3 given some of the acquisitions we've done over the last
couple years. I don't think we'll be down $140 million sequentially, but maybe we're down call it $100 million.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. When I look at Beckman, for example, I think it was pretty – if you go back historically
with their business, it was flat to up seasonally. And then last year, I thought you had the initial drop off in some of the
more cyclical businesses, as well as that Life Sciences call it an air pocket or whatever you want to call it, on the
product side. So I guess that's the difference between the $100 million and the $140 million. I'm just struggling to – this
is probably – last year was probably your biggest sequential decline, and I'm just struggling to figure out what's
changed here relative to, I don't know, ten years of history.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: I think part of the history is a number of years where we've done Q2 acquisitions. So the
organic decline we've had historically over the last five years Q2 to Q3 is larger than our printed numbers.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Got you, okay.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: There's an acquisition element, so the seasonality was more severe last year...
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Yes.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: ...but less out of line than the numbers would suggest because of M&A.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. Is there any change in the level of restructuring this year as well? I think you talked about
a couple of pennies of investment in the third quarter, but I guess just the fourth quarter.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Yes, that's what I was trying to suggest in response to Scott's question, Steve.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Yes.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: So we're stepping up both the growth investments and the productivity moves.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay, perfect. Thanks a lot.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: You bet, Steve. Thank you.

<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: I think we flagged that both at Fluke and in Motion. I'm not sure we're ready to extrapolate
too much from that, at least at this point. I think we were encouraged to see Fluke improve sequentially in that regard,
but I think we need to see this play out for another quarter or so to think we've got legs there. There was some
inventory movement at Motion, which is part of what we saw there. But again, I think it's early signs, but we'll see how
the third quarter plays out.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: And how about on the Tek side of things, any movement in either direction in terms of
customers' attitudes around equipment spending on that side?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: No, clearly, sequentially things improved. We're still negative from a core perspective. I
think we've got the potential to be positive in the second half, in large part because of the comps. But as you know, one
geography in particular that we're watching closely, particularly in T&M on the instrument side, is China. China's been
a real struggle, particularly as the export base has struggled there. The comps help us probably more than necessarily
the underlying demand does. But I think that combination should help us get positive there in the second half, but not
wildly or overly so.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: So you haven't seen any significant change in behavior yet?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Not yet, we're looking. Believe me, we're looking.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: All right, thanks.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Thanks, Shannon.

We'll go next to Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Good morning, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Just a couple quick follow-ons to some previous questions. So, Dan, I think you referred to the step
up in R&D. Obviously, it makes sense if you're getting the payback. But the 40 bps in the quarter, is that indicative of
the step up you expect in the back half of the year?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: In that range, Nigel.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Okay. And then, Larry, the construction expense, you mentioned a couple cents in 3Q. But the 4Q,
how do we think about that? Do you have a number in mind, or is that number fundable depending on how the back
half plays out?

<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Nigel, I think we're still a little fluid in that regard. As Larry highlighted, we talked about $70
million in our plan in the second half. That will be more fourth quarter than the third quarter. That's pretty typical, but
we're going to spend more than that $70 million here, and we're still figuring that out. We're trying to embed that in our
guidance.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: But more than $70 million in the fourth quarter rather than the second half?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: It tends to be more Q4 focused, yes. There will be some in Q3, but it will be more biased to
Q4.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: And then switching to the performance at Beckman, obviously, it's very encouraging to see material
growth so early. Can you maybe just give a little bit more color in terms of what's driving that? Is it a fall off in
attrition? Are we seeing more gross adds? Any help there would be interesting.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Nigel, it's really not any one thing, but I think the program that we've been working to
improve our retention in win rates in North America, I think our step up in terms of the investments in the high-growth
markets, which really have been driving most of the growth at Beckman. And certainly as we really fix the quality
issues, witness Troponin and others, but also bring on some additional new products, every little bit helps. So to see a
mid-single-digit quarter here isn't necessarily in any way a declaration of victory. But having been out there here in the
last couple of weeks, I just think we've got a lot of progress and momentum building in the commercial execution of
new product development, which bodes well for the business. But again, as you heard me say, there's still a lot of work
to do, but we're highly confident we're going to continue to improve Beckman and make that as good as any Danaher
business that we have.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: How would it be true to the upside of Beckman for the second half of the year? Have you seen a
great quarter but let's see if it continues, or have you rolled forth some of that upside in the second half of the year?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Nigel, I think we're still working with a low single-digit focus in the second half here, but
clearly a little bit more encouraged given what we've seen, not only the numbers we've printed but just the general tone
of the business.
<Q - Nigel Coe>: Thanks, Dan.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Thanks, Nigel.
Operator
Thank you. We'll go next to Steve Winoker with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Thanks and good morning.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Good morning, Steve.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Just first question, the T&M core margin decline of 30 basis points, was all of that due to
operating leverage, or any other dynamics in that?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Steve, it's really a combination of two things. One, as we noted, Instruments is down.
Instruments is the higher margin piece of that segment, so that hurts. And communications is an area where we are
stepping up our growth investments. Clearly, that's the best growth quarter they've ever registered; but as you know,
probably one of our best growth businesses here the last couple of years with a tremendous amount of runway given
their focus and mobility, our opportunities in security, and certainly building up more of a position with the enterprise
customer base. So it's really the instruments, volume, and the R&D step up, really the OpEx step up in comms which
creates that pinch.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. And then we talked about Beckman a bunch. But if you step back now two years
later, how are the financials compared to your original expectations both for ROIC and accretion at this point now?

<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Steve, we're right on track. Probably the revenue is a little better. Margins are ahead of where
we thought they would be. We thought we'd have $250 million of cost by the end of this year. We're north of $300
million, so a little ahead of the margins and a little bit ahead on the revenue line as well.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. And maybe just a little bit of overarching commentary on any changes in the
M&A environment is always helpful on these calls.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Yes, I don't think we've really seen a change, Steve, in the last 90 days. I think we're
encouraged and fundamentally optimistic about our ability to deploy the capacity that we have, the $8 billion or so that
you heard us talk about in terms of the next couple of years. Clearly, valuations are up. That means we can't buy every
company we might want to buy, but that's never our MO. We're looking for great fits where we can add value where we
can generate a return for our shareholders. And the silver lining in an environment like this, particularly for a strategic
well positioned buyer like ourselves, is you can have high quality conversations with high quality companies. We're
doing just that. So we continue to I think have that level of optimism of confidence that we will smartly deploy that
capital to help build out the businesses as we move forward here; but again, not a dramatic sea change 90 days on.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay, thanks.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: You bet, Steve. Thank you.

Thank you. We'll go next to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Partners.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Thank you, good morning, everyone.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Jeff, good morning.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Good morning. I'm wondering if we could just put a little finer point on some of this
incremental spending. Dan, I guess you made it pretty clear the $70 million is in flux and you don't know where it goes.
But I guess first point, would we be talking about it if it's only $5 million or $10 million?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: No, we would not be. So if it was $10 million – $15 million more, we wouldn't be talking
about it.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Okay.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: So maybe it's in that $90 million – $100 million range.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Okay. And then I'm just trying to get my head around the incremental R&D and SG&A growth
spending. You gave the basis points in R&D to Nigel. But relative to what you were thinking, how much is that
changing? We heard the story of 170 new marketing people just at Videojet alone last week. It seems like there is a lot
going on. But was that all baked in the plan, or was there a real increase there too?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: In terms of what we're talking about for the second half, there are real increases both in
R&D and some on the sales and marketing side. We've mentioned the high growth markets. You flagged some of the
marketing efforts there as well, Jeff, that you fortunately saw in Wood Dale. It's really a step up because as we go
through the year, we obviously are reading and reacting. We're learning. We're developing skills, and we don't want to
be too static in those growth investments. So when you hear us talk about dynamic resource allocation, we're really
trying in real time to fund the opportunities as quickly as we can as opposed to being slaves to an annual budget.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Okay, so even there we're not talking about single-digit millions. We're probably talking $5
millions and $10 millions thing?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: That's correct.

<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: That's fair.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And then just back to Q3, I get the whole sequential discussion. But on a year-over-year basis,
the comp is really easy against obviously what was a pretty disappointing Q3 last year. Why wouldn't you accelerate a
little bit against that just a 0.8% organic last year?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Right, there's no question, Jeff, there's an easier comp in the third. I think what we're trying
to share with you today is in essence what we're seeing customers and markets saying and doing today. So as we work
through what's happening at point of sale, as we talk to our distribution partners, as we go through our sales pipelines
with our direct business, as we take the pulse of both the headwinds and the tailwinds out there externally, I think we
come up with a top line figure that suggests that on a core basis, we're likely to be in that 2% to 3% range here in the
third quarter. It's really as simple and straightforward as that.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Great. And then just finally, can you just size in basis points or dollars, whatever is easier, just
how significant the Motion headwind is, just from unwinding the lower margin products?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: There's probably call it 400 or 500 basis points of core revenue headwind within Motion as
a result of that, I think, appropriate and smart transition out of some of that lower margin business. So we take the core
revenue hit, but you clearly see the resilience of those Motion revenues as the positive offset, a trade we'll take any day.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: The Motion margin.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Yes, excuse me.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Okay, great. Thank you very much.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Thanks, Jeff.

Thank you. We'll go next to Jon Groberg with Macquarie Capital.
<Q - Jon P. Groberg>: Hey, thanks a million. So you've talked a bunch about Beckman, Larry. On Leica, I just
remember last quarter. Leica Bio, you had the control issue, Europe distribution change, worried of potentially a new
competitor coming to market. Can you just give a little bit of an update on each of those issues and where you stand on
Leica Bio for the quarter and the rest of the year?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Sure. I think in terms of the control issue for the broader audience, we have seen in the U.S.
some policy guidance changes which have negatively impacted some of our underlying volume in the business. I think
that is modest and working its way through the business. Our European distribution change there continues. But I think
we certainly had a better quarter in that regard than we did in the first, and continue to believe strategically we're
headed in the right direction. And financially, we should see less headwind as a result.
And you mentioned competition. I have no idea who you're thinking of there, Jon, but we haven't really seen any
material competitive pressure change here of late, and continue to believe that particularly in Advanced Staining, we
saw very strong underlying growth vis-à-vis the market.
<Q - Jon P. Groberg>: So would you expect what you saw in the second quarter here to continue in the second half
for that at Leica Bio?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: We certainly have that expectation with LBS as we drive into the second half.
<Q - Jon P. Groberg>: Okay, and then just one more. If I do the math on the core diagnostics at Beckman, it looks
like you said in your Q, I think you said North America and Europe were actually down low single. So I was looking at
high-growth, and probably China is still plus 20%. Anything at all you're seeing there given what's going on in China
that makes you concerned that that could slow some? Just maybe an update geographically on that business, thanks.

<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Yes, Jon, I think it's hard not to be a little bit cautious on that front, just the number of the
quarters we've put back to back to back with 20% in China and other parts of the high-growth markets. So we think
they'll continue to be very good. Could there some tempering? I think that's a possibility. And while Europe and the
U.S. were down, they were down less than they were the last couple quarters. So hopefully, we can get a little bit of
improvement in the developed markets because I think there's some likelihood we'll have very good growth in the
high-growth markets, but it's going to be probably be hard to sustain at these levels.
<Q - Jon P. Groberg>: So do you think North America and Europe could be getting to the point where they actually
turn positive within the next few quarters here given some of the successes that you talked about at Beckman?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: We're not yet prepared to forecast, but we like the trend line.
<Q - Jon P. Groberg>: Okay, thanks a million.

Thank you. We'll go next to Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Hi, thanks a lot. Just on the operating cash flow, it was down 2% in Q1. It was down
14% in Q2. And you talked in the Q about timing of customer deposits in T&M and some on the network comm side.
Can you maybe talk a little bit about how quickly you expect the operating cash flow to normalize and what has driven
that customer deposits issue?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Sure. Julian, there are probably three factors driving the first half cash flow being down
slightly year on year. I'll come back to the customer deposits on the third point. One of which is just the timing of tax
payments; we've had relatively higher tax payments here in the first half. That will normalize through the year. The
second element is we have slightly higher inventory levels. Part of that is related to a number of new product launches.
We talked about some of the benefits we're seeing of that at Hach Gilbarco, Product ID. Again, we expect the inventory
levels to normalize through the year.
And then finally, customer of the deposits, last year on some large projects, we were able to get some upfront
payments. That will probably not normalize through the year. So that will be a slight headwind but these other two
factors will help, and you should see an acceleration back to more normalized level of cash flow through the balance of
the year.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Okay, thanks. And then within Environmental, you talked a bit about municipal spending
being down. Not a surprise, but I guess any sense on the pace of the declines or how you think that will trend as we go
through the year?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: It was a little bit bifurcated. So the lower ticket municipal spending actually got sequentially
better Q1 to Q2. We're probably a little cautious of that because the governments have year end at June 30. So we may
have seen a little bit of benefit, but it's okay. It's not great, but again, probably a little better than what we saw in Q1.
We continue to see the high ticket stuff to be challenging, and I don't think we're calling for a turn in that part of the
business.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: And that comment is really focused I think in the U.S. and to a degree in Europe. We were
pleased with the China growth that we saw for now two quarters here coming in no small part from the muni side,
which had been a bit more sluggish for us over the last couple of years.
<Q - Julian C. H. Mitchell>: Okay, great. And then just lastly on Europe, there's been some hope around slightly
higher PMIs and so on. It doesn't sound like you have seen anything at all around any inflection point in market in
Europe. Is that fair, or?

<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Julian, we were down a point or two in Europe, which has been comparable to maybe slightly
better than what we've been seeing. We've seen a few of our businesses – PID had a better quarter in Europe. But I'd
say generally speaking, we're not seeing much of any turn here.

Thank you. We'll go next to Brandon Couillard with Jefferies.
<Q - S. Brandon Couillard>: Thanks, good morning.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Good morning, Brandon.
<Q - S. Brandon Couillard>: Larry or Dan, could you give us a view around the book-to-bill in T&M in the quarter?
And how would you expect that business to trend in the second half, particularly for Tek instruments? And to what
degree are you beginning to see any change in demand trends out of China?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Yes, T&M book-to-bill was flat. I think as we look at Tek for the second half and really
instruments more broadly, I think we have the opportunity to grow, call it low singles if all goes well. China's really
important. China's important both at Tek and at Fluke. As I mentioned earlier, we've seen softness, prolonged softness
both with the export base, which we largely serve at Tek, and frankly in a host of other verticals that deal with domestic
infrastructure, principally at Fluke. But as we have gone through those reviews recently with the teams, again in part
because of the comps and in part because of some of our own execution opportunities, we think we can go positive here
in the second half, and we're going to be working hard to do that. But China will be an important swing factor for that
Instruments platform, no doubt.
<Q - S. Brandon Couillard>: Thanks. And then, Dan, in terms of the overall core revenue growth experience in the
quarter, can you give us a breakdown between equipment and consumables?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Sure. Consumables and aftermarket stayed right in that 3% to 4% range all up. And
equipment and instruments were a little better than Q1, so we were essentially flat in Q1 and we were up 1% to 2%.
Again, we talked about some of that Gilbarco and some of the Life Science businesses benefiting to that number.
<Q - S. Brandon Couillard>: Great, thank you.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Thank you, Brandon.

Thank you. We'll go next to Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Isaac Ro>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Hi, Isaac.
<Q - Isaac Ro>: So just on Industrial Tech, I wanted to put your comments on Motion in context to that core growth
target of zero to 3% you put out last December. You guys trended a little bit lower than that in the first half. So I just
want to make sure I understand what's embedded in your assumptions for the back half of the year.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: The back half, we're looking at Industrial Tech to be flat to slightly down in the third quarter.
The biggest driver of that would be Motion, which we expect to be down high single digits, most of that getting out of
some of that very low margin business. And then the fourth quarter we'd expect sequential improvement from that.
<Q - Isaac Ro>: Got it, okay that makes sense. And then just in China maybe quantitatively, we touched on that issue a
couple different ways here. But I did want to spend a minute with regards to the nature of your customers in China,

specifically with regards to capacity utilization. I think we all know a lot of the growth in China has been driven by
success in investment. And I think one of the things that's harder for us to read is what your customers' capacity
utilization looks like on your products over there. Just qualitatively, can you maybe comment on that and just how you
think about what your customers' underlying demand looks like just given the current environment there?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Isaac, I admittedly can't give you a figure as to our Diagnostics customers, our Chinese
Diagnostics customers' utilization of our installed base over there. But I would say, that as you might anticipate, it's
higher closer to the coast. Those new installs that have gone in are ramping, but there's probably very few places
outside of the major coastal cities where our installed base is anywhere close to capacity. So we're proud to be part of
this healthcare initiative in China. And certainly as that installed base is utilized more actively in the delivery of
enhanced care, that will be good for those patients and it will be good business for us.
<Q - Isaac Ro>: Got it. All right, thanks so much, guys.

We'll go next to John Inch with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Hi, John.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Hi, guys. Troponin, is that going to be significant to growth in the segment? When does that kick
in, do you guys think?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Those are two different questions, John. I think it's kicking in now that we have that 510(k)
approval. And frankly, it's kicking in not only in terms of the resumption of being able to sell that product, but it's
another box that's checked in terms of the commitments we've made to not only our regulators but our customers,
which helps the overall business.
I think we've tried to downplay the specific quantitative or financial impact, John, of getting those assays back on the
market, just because largely I think that was overdone. I think this was more a reputational issue. And as we've gone
through this hoop and others, I think people understand that we're getting Beckman back in the shape that it once was
in and will be again. And that helps us with retention. That helps us with new customer wins, not only here in the U.S.,
where this issue was most acute, but more broadly as well.
<Q - John G. Inch>: No, Larry, I'm just wondering. Is there a short-term pop up, if you will, that maybe is significant
to Beckman's results that you could see near term associated with Troponin?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: I would say if there's any near-term pop, it will be muted and immaterial.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Okay, that makes sense. Can I ask you about just – maybe Dan is aware of this, pricing trends
perhaps juxtaposed with some declining ROS. How are you guys seeing that across your portfolio or say across
significant differences in geographies, if anything is noteworthy?
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: John, I just probably have just a top level point of view. Our prices remained about 70 basis
points the last two, three quarters; again, getting it on the consumables and the aftermarket, relatively flat on the
equipment, on the instruments. So part of that 100 basis points of margin improvement is the cost actions we took last
year. But clearly, we're seeing some price/cost benefit right now. We're not getting a lot of price. We're getting a little
bit of price and seeing some benefit on the cost side.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Are there any discernible differences, Dan, in terms of pricing trends sequentially that would be
noteworthy?

<A - Daniel L. Comas>: No, we did say, and this started a couple of quarters ago, that it got tougher to get price on
equipment and instruments. And we went from maybe slightly positive to flattish, slightly negative price but probably
overall flattish instruments and equipment. And that has stayed relatively steady here, at least through the second
quarter.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Yes, okay. That's helpful. And just lastly, Larry, as you think about emerging markets, and you
guys obviously are doing extremely well in China, part of the playbook I think had been to broaden that success into
the Indias and Latin Americas of world. But clearly, the world looks perhaps different today than it did even a year ago
in terms of the run rate for those markets. How are you, Danaher, strategically thinking about that? Why not maybe go
for even more penetration in China if some of these marks around the world, maybe with the exception of the Middle
East, look like they could be significantly more challenged in the coming few years in terms of realizing growth rates?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: I think strategically, John, as you rightly point out, and you know this as well as anyone;
what we've tried to do is build on our China-first strategy the last couple years and taking the successes we've had and
the learnings that we've taken to all the other high-growth regions of the world. I think the evidence that we're having
good traction in that regard, for all the examples peppered through our prepared remarks in terms of the successes we're
having in the Middle East, what we're seeing in Brazil, Eastern Europe, right on down the line. India has been a little
softer for us this year, to be sure. Latin America, in part because of a couple of tough comps, was tough in the second
quarter. But that basket, which is no longer a China-only basket, was up high singles here.
I think we're mindful of the headlines relative to that basket as we think about the second half. I think that's part of our
conservative posture on the macro. But strategically, you hit the point. These markets may slow in their overall growth,
but they're still going to be best game in town. And the penetration levels of most of our products in these parts of the
world are still pretty modest. So you pick your market, take 200 basis points – take 500 basis points of growth off the
top. Yes, that will define how much investment money we have to put into play. But that underlying growth, our
penetration opportunities to grow in excess of those market rates still make those spaces, those places incredibly
important targets for us, and that's the way we're operating.

We'll take our final question from Deane Dray with Citi.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Daniel L. Comas>: Good morning, Deane.
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Good morning, Deane.
<Q - Deane Michael Dray>: We covered a lot of ground here already, and maybe just some closing comments
regarding guidance. Larry, last quarter you had some specific commentary about having more of a midpoint bias to
earnings guidance. Now you put up a solid second quarter. You're playing a little bit more offense and making some
growth investments. So how would you characterize that bias today, and then same question for core revenue growth
for the second half?
<A - H. Lawrence Culp>: Yes, I think what we've done here, Deane, with the update on guidance is really stay true to
that midpoint mindset you heard me express back on the first quarter call. So being at the halfway point here, having a
little bit more clarity as to the puts and takes, it doesn't really change our outlook materially in that regard, and we
thought we could tighten up the guidance accordingly. I really think it's that simple.
In terms of the core outlook, I think we're looking at a low single-digit environment here in the second half. We've
quantified that as 2% to 3% as best as we can figure here for the third quarter. But in essence, I think what we saw in

the second quarter is on balance likely what we're dealing with here in the second half. We wish it were otherwise, but
it is what it is, and we're going to outperform accordingly.
