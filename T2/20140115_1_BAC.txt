Thanks, Lee, and good morning to all of you, and thank you for joining us to review our fourth quarter results.
As we talked over the last several quarters, we've been on a journey of simplifying our company, and we talked to you
about some consistent areas of focus: capital generation, reducing our costs, managing the risk down, addressing the
legacy issues and driving business growth overall. Each quarter you have seen the progress our teammates have made
and the momentum is becoming more evident.
On the first page, slide 2, of the deck you can see the annual comparisons that will show you the progress over the last
couple of years. First, we've improved the balance sheet. Our Tier 1 common capital has grown 16% this year.
Liquidity and time to required funding have further strengthened. This strength in capital and liquidity allowed us to
begin returning capital through share buybacks to shareholders in 2013.
Another area of our early focus has been rightsizing our expense base. We have been meeting the goals of our cost
programs each year. While we make progress on those each quarter, there's still significant progress when you look
across the last couple of years. After reporting expenses, excluding goodwill impairment of $77 billion in 2011, we
worked that number down to $69 billion in 2013. As we've been clear with you, we expect additional cost savings in
2014 as we continue to execute on both our New BAC and our Legacy Assets and Servicing [LAS] initiatives.
We've also focused on addressing our legacy mortgage issues and although we still have work to do, we have made
progress. On our credit costs and our provision costs, we've seen tremendous results, as net loss rates in our portfolio
are at levels not seen in nearly a decade. As a result of all this work, earnings have improved significantly, but we still
have not approached the true earnings potential of Bank of America.
So as we move to slide 2, let's talk about recent results in the business on a business-by-business basis. We have been
delivering solid growth in activity and relationships across all the groups of our customers and clients we serve. Let me
highlight a few of those for you. Deposit levels continue to reach records each quarter. While this growth has been
occurring in balances, the rate paid has been declining to what we believe is low against our peers at 8 basis points in
our Consumer business.
Our operating costs, which we focus on heavily, of our Deposit business has declined to just 200 basis points now.
Driving this improvement is the work we've got done to optimize our delivery network, our stores, in response to
customer behavior changes across time. Banking Center over-the-counter transactions continue to go down but ATM,
online and mobile transactions continue to grow. We understand this and we observe this in our customers, and we're
working with them to capitalize on arguably the largest and best-positioned branch network in banking.
However, branches do remain a critical component of everything we do. We have about 8 million customer visits a
week, the kind of traffic that most – we really appreciate and most retailers would give their right arm for. Meanwhile,
as that traffic comes in, the customer behavior continues to shift to ATMs, online and mobile, and that's giving us an
opportunity to be more efficient and at the same time continue to deliver innovative products to our customers.
When you move to our mass affluent customer base, we've seen deepening across the customer relationships. Merrill
Lynch Brokerage assets continued their strong growth. We've invested heavily in the sales force for what we call our
special sales force and that's grown to 6,700 people in 2013. Looking at what that sales force has been able to do, this
year we opened 350,000 new Merrill Edge accounts, 125,000 new small business deposit and card accounts as well
during 2013.
As we move to our industry-leading Global Wealth and Investment Management business, we continue to break
records on top line profitability. We just recorded the best year in the company's history for Wealth Management
results. We have more customers and clients doing more business with us, and now we manage client assets of over
$2.4 trillion.
In our Global Banking business loan flows have been very strong, now growing for six consecutive quarters.
Investment Banking is coming off of a very strong year and a very strong fourth quarter. We once again maintained our
number two position overall in fees overall and grew market share year-over-year.

As we look at our Trading business – our Global Markets business, we've been really pleased with the success we've
had in equities over the past year and that's helped offset some of the industry challenges facing the larger FICC
business that we have. Now both remain very large important customer-facing businesses for us. They face some tough
regulatory changes as the rules have changed about what the scope of activity is over the past couple of years, but the
team under Tom Montag has been managing those changes well. Importantly, we ranked for the third year as the top
Global Research firm.
All in all we believe if you think back, 2013 was a significant year for the progress that this company has made against
all of the focus areas I mentioned earlier. As we look to 2014, we are well positioned as a company to meet our
customers' needs by delivering the whole company to every client and every customer and winning in the marketplace.
With that brief introduction, I'd like to turn it over to Bruce to cover the numbers for the quarter. Bruce?
Bruce R. Thompson
Great, thanks, Brian, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start by going through the fourth quarter results starting
on slide number 4.
We earned $3.4 billion or $0.29 per diluted share this quarter. Total revenues in the quarter on an FTE basis were in
line with the third quarter of 2013 at $21.7 billion and were $22.3 billion if we exclude the negative impact of FVO
[Fair Value Option] and DVA [Debit Valuation Adjustment] as a result of the significant credit spread tightening we
saw in our credit spreads during the quarter.
Our revenues benefited from increased net interest income, strong Investment Banking and Wealth Management fees
during the quarter and were partially offset by lower equity investment gains.
Total non-interest expense of $17.3 billion increased from the third quarter of 2013 as a result of increased litigation
costs, which were $2.3 billion during the quarter. If we back those litigation costs out and back out $1.4 billion of the
foreclosure look-back expense that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2012, our expenses during the quarter declined $300
million from the third quarter of 2013 and $1.4 billion from the fourth quarter of 2012. Asset quality continued its
improvement and resulted in provision expense of only $336 million.
I would also mention two additional items that impacted results during the quarter. As I mentioned, FVO and DVA,
$618 million, and we also recorded discrete tax benefits of approximately $500 million during the quarter that were
driven by tax items that were related to non-U.S. operations as well as the resolution of certain global tax matters.
On slide 5, you can see that our period end balance sheet came in at $2.1 trillion, below the prior quarter on lower
trading assets versus that third quarter of 2013. Ending loans declined $6 billion due to the decline in residential loans
in our discretionary portfolio. Outside of residential mortgages, client and customer lending reflected good commercial
and seasonal credit card growth that was offset by expected declines that we have within our runoff portfolios. Period
end deposits grew $9 billion from the record levels that we saw during the third quarter of 2013.
Moving down the page, tangible book value improved to $13.79 as the full benefit of earnings was partially offset by a
negative move in AOCI as result of higher rates. Tangible common equity increased to 7.2% during the quarter and
during the quarter we repurchased 92 million common shares for roughly $1.4 billion.
The last thing that I would mention on this slide is despite the earnings of $3.4 billion, our return on tangible common
equity at 8.6% remains lower than we would like it to be but we continue to make very good progress on this front.
On slide 6 you can see our Basel I Tier 1 common ratio of 11.19%, increased from the third quarter of 2013. If we look
at Basel III on a fully phased-in basis, we remain above our 8.5% 2019 minimum requirement under both the
standardized, as well as the advanced approaches. It's the first look at the advanced approach, under that approach Tier
1 common capital increased from the third quarter of 2013 to more than $132 billion. Our Basel III risk-weighted assets
remain steady at $1.3 trillion and our common ratio improved slightly from the third quarter of 2013 to 9.96%.

Under the standardized approach our estimate of Basel III Tier 1 common ratio improved a touch from the third quarter
of 2013 and remains slightly above 9%. If we turn to the supplementary leverage ratios, based on the proposed U.S.
requirements that are expected to take effect in 2018, as of the end of 2013 our Bank Holding Company leverage ratio
improved from the third quarter of 2013 and continues to exceed the proposed minimum of 5%. Looking at our primary
bank subsidiaries, BANA [Bank of America, N.A.] and FIA [FIA Card Services], they also continue to boast the in
excess of the 6% proposed minimums.
The last point I would make on this topic, the BCBS [Basel Committee on Banking Supervision] published final
supplementary leverage rules over the weekend, and while we do note some improvements from the original proposal,
we're still evaluating the exact impact to us.
If we turn to slide 7, Funding and Liquidity, our long-term debt ended the quarter $6 billion lower which further
improved our funding cost. Global excess liquidity sources during the quarter increased $17 billion to $376 billion and
was driven by our strong deposit flows. The time to required funding at the parent company increased to 38 months and
as we look at 2014 we have $31 billion of parent company maturities during the year and once again we would expect
the issuances to be below that number as we both reduce as well as smooth the maturity profile of that debt footprint.
The other thing I would mention is that we do expect to see some additional issuance within our banks this year given
the applicability of the new liquidity rules and how they apply to the bank subsidiaries.
If we turn to slide 8, Net Interest Income, our net interest income on an FTE basis was $11 billion, which was $520
million over the third quarter of 2013. The fourth quarter of 2013 did include $210 million of positive benefits in
market-related adjustments driven by lower premium amortization from slower prepay assumptions on
mortgage-backed securities as long-term rates rose 30 basis points from the end of 2013 to the end of 2014. Our net
interest income excluding those adjustments was $10.8 billion, representing a $241 million increase from the third
quarter of 2013. Roughly two-thirds of that improvement was driven by trading related net income, and the balance,
once again, excluding market related adjustments, was driven by lower long term debt levels and, to a lesser degree,
higher deposit levels and lower rates paid. Net interest income and those benefits was partially offset by lower
consumer loan balances and lower yields.
As result of these different factors, our net interest yield excluding market related adjustments, improved from 2.44% in
the third quarter of 2013 to 2.51% in the fourth quarter of 2013. As we move into 2014, I do want to remind you that
the first quarter includes two less interest accrual days. So the Q4 2013 base of just below $10.8 billion excluding the
market related adjustments, all else being equal, would start at roughly $10.6 billion for the first quarter of 2014. Our
asset sensitivity position remains positioned to benefit from higher rates, particularly from the short end of the curve.
If we move to expenses, as I mentioned earlier, non-interest expense was $17.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014 and
included a $2.3 billion charge for litigation expense. Litigation expenses increased $1.2 billion from the third quarter of
2013 as we continue to evaluate our legacy exposures, largely RMBS litigation, which led to additional reserves.
Excluding litigation, total expenses were $15 billion during the quarter, which compares favorably to the $15.3 billion
in the prior quarter and $16.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012.
Our Legacy Assets & Servicing costs, once again excluding litigation, declined nearly $400 million from the third
quarter of 2013 and were below $2 billion this quarter as we previously guided. This drove the $300 million
improvement in expenses adjusted for litigation in the quarter. As we continue to reduce the delinquent loans serviced
over the course of 2014 and reduce operating costs, we expect the fourth quarter of 2014 LAS costs excluding litigation
to be roughly $1.1 billion.
Move for a moment to New BAC. The benefits from New BAC in the most recent quarter were offset by a small
seasonal uptick in costs when comparing to the third quarter of 2013, and when comparing to the fourth quarter of
2012, our New BAC savings are partially offset by roughly $300 million of increases from revenue related costs on
higher Global Banking and Markets and GWIM revenues. We remain on track to achieve the expected $2 billion of
New BAC cost savings in mid-2015 as these initiatives wind down near the end of 2014.

We move to the number of full-time equivalent employees. We ended the quarter at 242,000 employees, a decline of
more than 5,000 or 2.3% from the third quarter of 2013. And that was split pretty evenly between staff reductions in
LAS and the production side of the Mortgage business as volumes declined and, to a lesser extent, we reduced staff
associated with our branch optimization.
Before I leave expenses, I do want to remind you all that the first quarter typically includes the annual costs of
incentives for retirement eligible associates and, once again, we expect in the first quarter of 2014 that number to be
approximately $900 million, which is consistent with what we saw in each of the first quarters of 2012 and 2013.
If we move to slide 10 on asset quality, you can see that credit quality, once again, improved nicely. Net charge-offs
declined to a reported $1.6 billion or a net loss ratio of 68 basis points. The quarter did include $144 million of
charge-offs related to clarification of regulatory guidance on accounting for TDRs [Troubled Debt Restructurings] in
the home loans portfolios. If we exclude that change, net charge-offs were approximately $1.4 billion or a 62 basis
point net loss ratio and improved $250 million or 15% from the third quarter of 2013. Delinquencies, which are
obviously a leading indicator of net charge-offs, declined again as well. Our fourth quarter provision expense was $336
million on the back of this steadily improving consumer data, resulting in a reserve release of $1.1 billion excluding the
regulatory guidance change. As we move into 2014 we continue to see credit quality improve.
Now let's move into a discussion of the businesses and I'm going to start on slide 11 with Consumer and Business
Banking. Within this segment we delivered improved earnings from both the previous quarter as well as the prior year's
quarter. Net income of nearly $2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2013 is up 11% from the prior quarter, and 36% from
the fourth quarter of 2012. Stability in revenues, lower credit costs as well as expense reductions driven by network
optimization drove the improvement in both periods.
If we take a step back and review customer activity during the quarter, we saw our average deposits grow steadily and
rates paid down to 8 basis points. Our brokerage assets increased 7% from the third quarter of 2013 and are up 26%
year-over-year on both improved market valuation as well as account flows.
Our consumer card loans showed seasonal growth this quarter as well as continued strong issuance with one million
cards issued during the quarter. I would note that our fourth quarter of 2013 balances reflect the reclassification of
roughly $1 billion of an affinity portfolio that was moved to loans held for sale and we would expect seasonality to
move these balances lower in the first quarter of 2014.
Our risk-adjusted margin on credit cards is now back above 9% driven by seasonal spending and improved credit
quality as net charge-offs and delinquencies continue to improve. Our expense levels during the quarter do include
approximately $112 million of litigation costs and that masked the benefit of our delivery network optimization as
mobile banking usage continues to increase and we continue to consolidate banking centers.
Let's move to slide 12, Consumer Real Estate Services, which as you all know, represents only 8% of the company's
revenues. In our supplemental information we report two separate components of this segment, one focused on loan
origination and the other focused on servicing and legacy issues. As we signaled last quarter, our first mortgage retail
originations of $11.6 billion were down 49% from the third quarter as the amount and level of refinancing opportunities
slowed given the rising-rate environment. Lock volumes declined 37% leading to lower core production revenue.
We continue to reduce our production staffing levels to be consistent with these lower volumes that we're experiencing.
Our rep and warrant expense was $70 million during the quarter and declined by roughly $250 million from the third
quarter of 2013, which benefited mortgage banking income.
One item I do want to mention from the Appendix of our slide deck is on page 20 regarding rep and warrant exposure.
We did receive increased levels of private label claims, but it's important to note that the vast majority showed no
evidence that the claimant reviewed the individual loan file ahead of the submission, and that obviously impacts the
overall claim quality and therefore the process for claims resolution.
The other primary revenue component in this segment, servicing revenue, declined $54 million from the third quarter
of 2013 as a result of our smaller servicing portfolio. From a cost-of-servicing perspective, our number of 60-plus day

delinquent loans dropped 73,000 to 325,000 units at the end of 2013, and as a result of this, once again, our LAS
expense ex-litigation declined nearly $400 million during the quarter to $1.8 billion.
Global Wealth and Investment Management on slide 13 -- this represents 21% of our company's revenue, and our
Wealth Management business achieved records for net income in both the quarter as well as for full year 2013. Within
this segment, both Merrill Lynch, as well as U.S. Trust, maintained their strong leadership positions managing a total of
$2.4 trillion in client balances. Revenue approached $4.5 billion in the quarter, increasing 7% year-over-year and 2%
on a linked quarter basis. And I would also note it's the fourth consecutive quarter in which the pre-tax margin was
above 25%.
Our asset management fees once again achieved a new record during the quarter, driving the revenue improvement
from the third quarter of 2013. Our client engagement remained strong and market levels are providing an additional
tailwind. Our long-term AUM flows for the quarter were $9.4 billion and $48 billion for the year, nearly doubling the
2012 production level. Ending deposits also grew nicely again, and our ending client loan balances of almost $119
billion reached record levels as we continue to see very good activity in both consumer real estate as well as our
security space lending.
Turning to slide 14, Global Banking, our fourth quarter earnings of $1.3 billion showed good growth over the third
quarter of 2013 with strong Investment Banking results, but are down from the fourth quarter of 2012 due to higher
provision expense. Provision in the year-ago quarter included reserve releases while we built reserves in the fourth
quarter of 2013 associated with the commercial loan growth that we've seen. While we're on credit quality, I would
note that our net charge-offs within the banking segment for the quarter were only $7 million versus $132 million in the
fourth quarter of 2012 and $35 million in the third quarter of 2013.
Our expenses reflect effective cost control but also reflect increases related to revenue-related compensation for
Investment Banking. Our Investment Banking fees this quarter across the company were a record $1.74 billion, up 9%
from the fourth quarter of 2012 and 34% from the third quarter of 2013. Based on Dealogic, we did maintain our
number two position in fees with an 8% market share, and in addition, during the quarter we ranked number one in
Americas investment banking fees with a 10.7% market share. During 2013 we advised on 10 of the top 20 announced
M&A deals, and as we move into 2014, the pipeline remains strong.
If we move to the balance sheet, average loans increased $8.8 billion from the third quarter with solid C&I growth,
particularly in large corporate and healthcare, along with growth in Commercial Real Estate. Our average growth did
outstrip our $2.3 billion end-of-period growth as we funded several deals near the end of the third quarter of 2013,
which benefited the overall average balances. We see solid customer demand for loans as we head into 2014, but would
note that competition is particularly aggressive for middle-market loans.
Lastly on Banking, our average deposits increased almost $20 billion from the third quarter of 2013 as our customers
continue to show strong liquidity.
If we switch to Global Markets on slide 15, ex-DVA we earned $341 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, consistent
with the fourth quarter of 2012, but down $190 million compared to the third quarter of 2013 after we exclude the UK
tax charge. Higher revenue in both comparisons was offset by litigation costs, mostly associated with RMBS securities
litigation.
Our sales and trading revenue, once again ex-DVA, was $3 billion, 19% above the fourth quarter of 2012 and in line
with what we saw in the third quarter of 2013. Our FICC sales and trading revenue were up roughly $300 million or
16% compared to the fourth quarter of 2012 as the strength we saw in our Credit and Mortgage businesses more than
offset slowness in both rates and commodities. Our fourth quarter of 2013 did include roughly a $200 million benefit
from recoveries on certain legacy positions within the FICC business.
Our equity sales and trading area finished a very strong year. Revenues, although down 7% from the third quarter of
2013, were up 27% over the fourth quarter of 2012 as we continue to benefit from the repositioning of this business
over the past 18 months. We gained market share and improved our performance in each of the different product lines.
Expenses excluding litigation showed very good cost controls and small increases in line with revenue improvement.

Our average trading-related assets are down $54.3 billion or 11% from the year-ago period and are generally flat with
the third quarter of 2013.
On slide 16 we show you the results of All Other. Profitability this quarter compared to the third quarter of 2013
declined as the tax benefits this quarter that I described earlier were more than offset by lower revenue and less reserve
release. The revenue decline from the third quarter of 2013 was driven by lower equity investment gains. If you recall,
we sold CCB shares during the third quarter of 2013 as well as more negative FVO valuations. The expense within All
Other includes $250 million of litigation in the fourth quarter of 2013. And lastly, I would note we expect an effective
tax rate of approximately 30% in 2014 absent any unusual items.
Before we open it up for questions, let me make a few comments on the quarter. Capital liquidity has never been
stronger. On the revenue side, customer activity drove stronger core business results. Our Consumer Banking saw
modest improvement on card income and service charges after troughing in early 2013. Our Global Wealth &
Investment Management business had a record year. Our Global Banking had a record year as well with higher
Investment Banking fees and stronger lending activity, and our Global Markets business is performing well against the
market opportunities that they're seeing.
We kept our cost initiative work on track, and credit improvement continues its track towards historic lows. We also
made significant progress in 2013 in continuing to resolve legacy mortgage matters with the more significant ones
being settlements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on GSE rep and warranty issues, MBIA in the monoline space,
and the Luther, Maine State class action suit in the Private Label area of RMBS litigation.
And with that, let's go ahead and open it up for Q&A.
Q&A
Operator
We'll take our first question from John McDonald of Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Hi. Good morning. Bruce, I was wondering in terms of the core net interest income,
you mention that the seasonally adjusted starting point for the first quarter would be $10.6 billion, but it sounds like
you expect that to keep grinding higher with the debt paydowns and rates being a little bit higher on the long end. And
the $300 million that we saw this quarter, is that a good representation of the pace that core NII could grow at?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think as we look at – I think, John, if you look at what we saw during the quarter, we
had a series of benefits for the quarter. You can see that the – if you look back at our tables, that the margin that we saw
within some of the repo and other Global Markets lending activity was up nicely. As you mention, we benefited from
the continued reduction in the long-term debt footprint, which was clearly a positive, and we had a little bit of benefit
even if you back out FAS-91 on the debt securities lines. So I think that those three things were clearly favorable.
We'll have to see with respect to the markets margins as well as just overall rates where we go in the first quarter of
2014 relative to 2013. I would be careful to assume that you're going to see $300 million type improvements in the NII
as we go forward on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but over time with the work that we're doing we would expect that
number to continue to grind upwards, all other things being equal.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Any material change in your interest rate sensitivity overall, Bruce, to long
rates and/or short rates?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I'd say that whenever rates move up you tend to widen out a little bit as maturities extend
in the mortgage space as rates move up, so you always have a little bit of that in a rising-rate environment, although
given where rates are, we think we're largely through that. And the only other thing from an asset liability management
perspective I would note is that as it relates to both managing OCI risk as well as managing to LCR, you saw it a little
bit in the fourth quarter and you'll see it a little bit more going forward that we are purchasing on the margin some

additional Treasuries given the treatment that they have under LCR.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then I was wondering if you or Brian could speak at a high-level about
how you approached this year's CCAR. Are you looking to grow your buybacks off of the $5 billion common request
from last year? And do you feel that you've improved the earnings enough and consistency here to start moving the
dividend up yet?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, we're not going to comment, John, on specific items with respect to the CCAR
request. I think we've been pretty consistent as we came into 2013 that we were focused on increasing the core
profitability of the company, and as you look at the last couple quarters from an EPS perspective, we think we've done
a good job of that. You can see the capital build that we've had and you can see the reduction in the legacy exposures
that we've made. So we feel like we did a good job of preparing ourselves for CCAR this year and we're obviously
working hard as we go through the rest of the process between now and mid-March.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. And then last thing is, you mentioned, Bruce, the 8.5% return on tangible and
hope that, that goes high over time. Your ROA was 64 basis points. I guess what kind of goals do you have for ROA
and ROE over the next few years? And any thoughts on timelines that you hope to get there on?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think as we look out over the three years, I would say it's more of the same for us that
you can see a tangible common equity ratio that's just over 7%. The three metrics, if we assume we stay at around that
7% level, we were above it in the fourth quarter, but if we stay at that level we're looking to get to the point where we're
returning 1% on assets which translates into a 14% return on tangible common equity and those are the types of levels
that we see ourselves looking to achieve over the course of the next three years.
<Q - John Eamon McDonald>: Okay. Thanks.

We'll move next to Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Hi. Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: A couple of questions, one on the NIM discussion that we just were having. When you look
at what happened with the yield and the cost of funds, it looks like you're getting a little bit more competitive on
non-resi consumer and I'm just wondering how to think about how you're looking to shift either the loan growth going
forward and how you're thinking about that loan yield relative to your cost of funds in an environment where NIV
probably doesn't grow as much as it had been in the past, maybe your cost of funds is flattening out or potentially
increasing a little bit?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I'm not sure exactly which piece that you're looking at Betsy, but if you back to our
earnings supplement which is back on page 10, I think it's interesting that you can see from the third quarter of 2013 to
the fourth quarter of 2013 that our yields on residential mortgages did increase about six basis points to 3.74%. And the
other interesting thing is that we have started to see and been able to do more home equity type business with our core
customers. I think it's interesting if you look at the yields on that portfolio, they were up 20 basis points to just under
4% for the quarter. So as we look at the yields and the rates that we're able to get, I think we're competitive in the
market and we've been able to see some slight increases within the rates that we're able to earn.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Sure, no, it's an interesting mix shift because you've got a little bit of shrinkage going on
obviously with the legacy resi still coming off, yet the yields there are increasing. And on the non-resi consumer,
you've got some yield compression happening but your loan growth at the margin inflecting more positively. And at the
same time, your cost of funds looks like it's probably settling out here and potentially even going up a little bit. I mean,
NIV average balances were still up Q-on-Q but end of period was down. So that's kind of the core context of the
question.

<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yeah, and the thing is work – you've got the volume going through and then either the
receives or the pay on both sides of the rate question, and then we continue to see deposit pricing, liability pricing came
down, the contribution of non-interest-bearing sort – you know, size, and the balance sheet continue to go up. But just
focusing on the production, what's really been happening across the last several quarters is that we're seeing
stabilization in some of the balances and the runoff portfolio impact gets smaller and smaller from some of the core –
non-core portfolios we're getting rid of.
But in the fourth quarter, for example, our direct auto which is – in 2013 our direct auto business, not our indirect but
our direct-to-consumer auto, was up 55%. The home equities in the fourth quarter were up almost 100% over the prior
year's fourth quarter. Year-over-year they're up 60%. The Card, we had about 19% more production in the fourth
quarter of 2013 versus 2012. So we're building the – in the Business Banking, Small Business area we're seeing
production up, so we're building the basics that are producing the balance growth.
And the pricing spreads are holding, it's competitive as heck in middle-market, things like that, but so I think it all
serves us well, largely having runoff stuff that may have yielded high but had a high credit cost content you've got to
remember. And we're replacing it with stuff that's good and core and a great credit quality, and so we're seeing a shift a
little bit from the commercial loan growth, which was really more positive, to where the consumer loan growth is
starting to stabilize and come along.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: And when do you think you get that inflection point in loan growth? I mean, clearly it's a
function of legacy basically not weighing on the loan growth overall. When does that inflection point happen?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: And if you look at the various portfolios, I think in Card we've kind of seen it, where we
got – as Bruce talked about, we've got a sale I think in home equity, still got a ways to go, Betsy, because remember
we've got about 40% or so of our home equity is still in the non-core portfolio. And then I think in the Commercial side
you've seen the straight growth, whether it's large, corporate or commercial middle market. So I think that that would
be the overall summary, so I just – I think that it sort of chains through from the corporate activity move faster to the
smaller business activity and then the consumer activity, but we're stabilized in most important portfolios and growing.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then just turning to the mortgage for a moment, on LAS expenses did I hear you
right that you are looking for LAS expenses to be at about $1 billion at year-end? Is that correct on a quarterly basis 4Q
2014?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, we quoted roughly $1.1 billion, Betsy.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. So that's an uptick, right, from what you had been saying before, sub-$1 billion by
year-end?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, that's correct. It's about $100 million higher than what we had said before. And I
think the work that we're starting is that, take a step back, that we got through roughly $400 million during this quarter,
which was a little bit better than we would have expected to do, so we felt very good about that. And if you look at the
number of 60-plus days delinquent loans, it came all the way down to 325,000 loans. So what we're going to be
working on over the course of the next 90 days is a little bit of a reset of that expense base so that we can continue to
drive that number down. That $1.1 billion doesn't reflect that, but given the work and the activity levels, we need to go
back and do some more work on that.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then so, $1.1 billion by year-end 2014. Is there still runway in 2015 to bring that
down further?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yes.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: We still think and we've been consistent that we would expect and look to end 2015 at
roughly $500 million a quarter.

<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. And then just lastly on the litigation reserving, you called out the $2 billion litigation
reserve for the Mortgage business, highlighted that that reflects a lot of the litigation risk you think you have. The
question we get from people is, how many more quarters of this should we build in going forward? Because you do still
have some lumpiness in the losses that you face.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, and that's always a tough question. What I – I think what I'd say, Betsy, is that there
was obviously a lot of new learning that we saw during the fourth quarter of this year. And as a result of that, we
adjusted the reserves for the legacy exposures to reflect that which we learned. And as we've said, that it was largely
with respect to RMBS litigation and beyond that, it's just a number that's difficult to predict.
<Q - Betsy L. Graseck>: Okay. All right. Thanks.

Our next question comes from Matthew O'Connor of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Good morning.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Good morning, Matt.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: We're seeing some peers that came out yesterday actually increasing liquidity and long
term debt levels to meet the LCR. I think you guys are starting at a higher point maybe than they were. But just give us
a sense of maybe where you are for LCR with the current proposals? And as we think about kind of the net impact of
long-term debt running off at the holding company, increasing at the bank, how does that all shake out on a net basis
this year?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I'll let Bruce talk you through it, but you remember, we've got to remember how we got
here, which is with the legacy set of companies put together, they had debt structures that were built for their company
and their industry without the core funding we have. So a little bit of we're coming down to a level most of our peers
were below, and they may be coming up a little bit. So you got to remember that, whether it's Countrywide or Merrill
Lynch, the funding structure was so different. So we had $400 billion in long-term debt we've been bringing down, but,
and the size of the balance sheet shrank. Remember that we started off about $2.5 trillion and we're down to about $2.1
trillion.
So I'd be careful about comparing where they're going versus where we're going based on this just because what we had
is different than what they started with. And then, Bruce can talk about what we think, where we are now going
forward.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: As we look out, Matt, I think at the parent company, as we look at and with our
understanding of the LCR ratio, we are in the 100% area as it relates to LCR. So at the parent, you can look at us being
where we need to be based on 2017 levels.
The one area that we will look to do more in, and I highlighted is to further build and take out more term financing
within the bank levels, to look to build that. So I think we're in great shape at the parent. We're in great shape at the
banks, but you will see us doing a little bit more bank financing activity to be able to meet those requirements. And if
you look at where we've financed at the banks, there's no incremental cost for that, that's different than what we've
communicated before.
And the other thing I would just point out on the overall debt footprint and the cost of it is with the work that we've
done on the balance sheet and with where our credit spreads are now in the market, we will be refinancing our debt at
lower rates than the debt that's coming off the books as it matures.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: And at the parent being around 100% right now, any sense of how much cushion you want?
I think some banks are running maybe like a 15% cushion. Some banks are still trying to get where you're at.

<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think to project a cushion three years out, I think we clearly are going to run at a
cushion. We're going to run the company, so this is not an issue. But until we get out to 2016 and 2017 and understand
the exact composition, as well as to any puts and takes that we see, it's probably a little bit premature to talk about a
cushion. The focus has been to get to the 100% at the parent immediately, so it's not an issue to discuss.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. And then just separately, we saw out of JPMorgan yesterday a one-time valuation
adjustment on certain derivatives, and just wondering is that applicable to you? Or have you been absorbing it over
time? Or still to come?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: It's obviously applicable to anyone that has an uncollateralized derivative book, so it is
applicable to us. I think that clearly the industry view and how you account for FVA is still very much evolving.
JPMorgan obviously came out today with their adoption, and as a company it's something that we continue to evaluate.
I think the important thing to remember when you look at this, and I'm sure you know this, is just that this is a question
of do you take a reserve for something that you earn back over the average life of your uncollateralized balances? So
it's not something that changes the core economics of the activities that we're doing.
<Q - Matt D. O'Connor>: Okay. All right. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr of ISI.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Hi. Thanks very much. So it just kind of weaves into some of the previous questions, but on
balance sheet migration over the past year, cash and equivalents up 19%, repo, trading assets and derivative assets all
say 10% to 14%. Is that a function of some of the sluggish on the trading side during the year in the market and it's just
a reaction to what's out there? Or is this your obviously, intent to get on sides for SLR and LCR?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Well, I would say that as we look at and what we've said is that from an LCR and an SLR
basis, given that we're at the levels at the parent and then with respect to the supplementary leverage ratio at the banks,
given we're at the levels that we need to be that phase in between 2015 and 2019, there's not anything directly related to
those given that we're in great shape with respect to those.
What I would say is that as we move forward, and as we look at the bank level and some of the rules, you will see us,
on average, carrying a little bit more cash at those levels and you saw that as you look at the year-end numbers, and as
it relates to the different repo activity and the like, within the Global Markets business you continue to look to manage
and balance what's the size of that book, how it affects the overall size of the company and the yield that you're able to
achieve.
I think that was one of the things as some of these different regs come out that we feel good that if you look at the repo
book we were up 7 basis points from an average yield perspective Q3 to Q4. Those are numbers that are going to ebb
and flow but I would say directionally we feel very good about where the balance sheet is.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Our approach has been, as these rules come out to put ourselves in compliance, or
whatever the right word would be, immediately and not wait so that we didn't have hanging over us, could you get to
the LCR, could you get to the supplemental leverage, so we just said, position our balance sheet but I'd say as you look
at the company's, sort of constitution in terms of business mix and balance sheet mix at the year end 2013, we're very
comfortable with that and so it'll be ebbs and flows, loans will grow here or maybe market as we use a little more
balance sheet on a given quarter but Tom and the team have done a good job to be able to face against the customers
and maintain our strong market position in all our businesses, investment banking, sales trading, fixed-income and
equities both while at the same time bringing the balance sheet in year-over-year down but we're completely
comfortable with it being in the size range it is now and expect it to stay roughly in there. So I don't think we see
massive change in how the company looks to comply with rules because we're already complying.

<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay, I appreciate that. In Global Markets, the trading in absolute numbers and relative to
some peers is pretty good. The question I have is, if you look at the return on capital or the return on average assets, it's
pretty low. I'm curious: a) how much litigation caused a dent to that because I know it dented it we just can't see exactly
how much? And are these metrics we should be looking at on a consistent basis? They're in the supplement, I'm
assuming that they mean something, I just don't know if the capital allocations and asset allocations are fair things to
judge on.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think as it relates to the capital allocations, they clearly are and one of the things that if
you look back in the footnote that we highlighted is we'll refresh those allocations in 2014 and continue to have more
capital pushed out within the businesses.
As you look at the returns within the markets business I think you need to adjust for two numbers when you look at
those; the litigation number within markets business was north of $600 million for the quarter, and then you had
another couple hundred million dollars during the quarter for DVA. So when you look at the returns you need to adjust
for those two numbers and realize that in the fourth quarter you're looking at what's, seasonally, the slowest quarter.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. That's totally fair. Final one is in mortgage, I think there was a bit of a hiatus as you're
getting things battened down, I think you've picked up about 100 basis points market share since then on the retail side.
Just curious for an update on: a) how the fourth quarter looked? And then: b) your thoughts on going out in terms of
intentions to continue to push that share higher.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think if you look at it, you've got the statistics, but we're down. We had two things going
on during 2013 in the second half especially as the HARP volumes started to fall off because we sized our portfolio
down in terms of total servicing size so our HARP opportunity went down and then obviously as rates went up sort of
midyear out that the volumes dropped. And so third quarter the pipeline pull-through helped us get $20-odd billion and
then fourth quarter down to $11 billion. But if you look at it sort of the non-HARP share we are pleased with the
progress we're making and we'll continue to grind that direct-to-consumer, grind that forward from where we are now
at about $9 billion-ish this past quarter. And so I think we're fine. It's going to be a business, which we shape to serve
the customers, and the wealth management business does a couple billion a quarter, so it's a good solid position.
I would say in January with the rates moving down a little bit and stuff, you saw another kick up of about 20%, 25% in
application volume in our book already. Now I don't know if that holds and how much seasonality because the way
Christmas and New Year's fell this year and things like that as we move through the month but it immediately kicked
up over the last several days as rates moved a little bit in our favor and our purchase volume has also moved up in
January. So we're looking for this business to start to grow again but it obviously suffered a couple different both the
rate effect and also the HARP effect in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Glenn P. Schorr>: Okay. Thanks both very much.

We'll move next to the site of Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer & Company. Your line is open.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Yeah, I wanted to come back to the debt footprint discussion, and just looking on page 11,
you can see total average long-term debt down $27 billion year-over-year and at the same time, looking at page seven
of the presentation, the time to required funding expanded from 33 months to 38 months. So I'm just curious, is there
some other liability that is extending while you're bringing down the debt footprint? And how can we gauge for the
year ahead...? What I'm getting at is how much further can you get – how can we triangulate on how much further room
there might be in the debt reduction?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think that the important thing, if I understand your question, when you look at the time
to required funding, one of the reasons why – there are a couple of components that go into that, there's the amount of
liquidity that you have at the parent obviously, and then what the debt footprint is over of the course of the period of
time that you're measuring it. And if you look at what we've done, we basically, if you looked at our company at the

end of 2012, we had $70 billion of debt maturities that we needed to work through over the course of 2013 and 2014,
and you obviously need to carry significant amounts of liquidity to be able to basically meet your time to required
funding when it's that lumpy.
What we've done is, between the debt that we repaid this year as well as the activity you saw us, when we tendered for
debt several times in 2013 for debt that was maturing in 2014, was to knock down those maturity profiles. So you ask a
very good question, which is, over time what you should expect us to be able to do is continue to move the parent
company funding down and as we flatten out those debt maturities, we'll be able to do that and not have nearly the
impact on time to required funding, because the maturity profile will be much flatter.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Okay. And then as a follow up, looking at your 10-K and 10-Q you give us a very nice
breakdown of the debt by parent company versus Merrill versus BofA N.A. and your parent company debt looks like,
at least between year end and September like it was relatively flat and the declines in the long-term debt came primarily
from Merrill Lynch going from like $90 billion to $60 billion. Does Merrill Lynch, as an entity, need to continue to pay
down debt or can that essentially be all squeezed into other subsidiaries? And does that have an impact on the cost of
funds?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think a couple things, keep in mind is we told you when we reported the third quarter
earnings that the Merrill Lynch Holding Company that had previously issued debt before the merger of the two
companies, that has been merged into the BAC Holding Company. So when you look at that debt profile, realize today
it's one in the same.
So I think the important thing I would look at is on page 7, and what we do is that we do give you the actual, what we
consider parent company and that parent company back in previous quarters, prior to ML & Co. and BAC merging, is a
combined number. So if you look at those red bars on the bottom on page 7, that is the combined debt footprint of the
two companies that is now one, and you can see it over the course of five quarters migrating down.
<Q - Chris M. Kotowski>: Okay. All right. I'll follow up. Thanks. That's it for me.

Our next question is from Jim Mitchell of Buckingham Research.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Yeah, good morning. Just a couple of quick follow-ups. On your Basel III tier one common,
the standardized versus advanced, you have, I guess, almost a 90 basis point difference. Some of your large bank peers
are closer to a 10 basis point difference. Can you help us think about why you have such a large gap between the
standardized and advanced?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yep. The first thing I'd say is that generally we would expect that gap to narrow over
time. But as you look at the actual content of it, I think the biggest reason that you have is just given the percentage in
some of our commercial loan balances that we have relative to our peers that under Basel III advanced get impacted
significantly based on the actual credit quality where when you go to standardized it's just 100%. So I think you've got,
the first thing is, you do have some of that activity or difference between the two metrics.
And then I would say that the second thing is that we still do have some assets that, under Basel III standardized, do get
some fairly heavy risk weightings that we will continue to work off over the next couple years. So there's no question
relative to what we've seen out there we're a little bit lighter. I think those are a couple of the differences, and as I say,
I'd expect over the course of the next 12 to 18 months you'll see that gap tighten.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: So on the commercial side as credit gets better we should see that gap close for that reason.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: No, the commercial credit getting better really isn't going to -- that's not going to lead to it
getting tighter because under standardized, a commercial loan's a commercial loan, there's no benefit of credit quality.

It's going to be more the runoff of some of the different positions that we have within the company as opposed to
anything specific on commercial.
<Q - Jim F. Mitchell>: Okay; got you. And then just a follow-up on your ROE, eventual ROE target for a tangible
ROE of 14%. When you think -- when you're kind of discussing that target, is that assuming some help from interest
rates being higher? Or is that without that help?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: As we look out at and as we look at 2015, 2016, we don't do anything besides just look
out at the forward curve. So you do get a little bit of benefit at the very end of 2015 and a little bit more so in 2016. So
there is embedded some of that. At the same time, to the extent that we're not in an environment, in an economy that's
growing, and we're seeing some of that movement up in short term rates. If we're not seeing that, there are other actions
that we're going to need to take within the company.

Our next question comes from Stephen Chubak of Nomura Securities.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Good morning.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: So one thing that we did see over the past year is a pretty robust pace of DTA consumption,
which certainly helped boost your capital ratios. I know when contemplating DTA utilization, the mechanics can be
quite complicated. But how should we think about the potential level of progress as we enter 2014 as your earnings
profile continues to improve?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I would say on that, as we work through 2014, a fairly healthy percentage of what would
show up in the tax provision line will not reduce our regulatory capital. And as we go out in 2015 and beyond, how
quickly the balance of that goes is going to be a function of profitability. But what I would say is that as it relates to
working through the DTA, and it is a complicated calculation, that we should get a very large amount of what we pay
in taxes back in regulatory capital during 2014.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay; great. And then just thinking about some of the profitability targets you highlighted,
such as the 14% tangible ROE, what are you guys assuming in terms of capital return over that potential horizon?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Unfortunately, I can't answer a way around – we're not going to give any more guidance
on CCAR than we've already given.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Okay.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: It was a good attempt, though.
<Q - Steven J. Chubak>: Fair enough. All right; that's it for me. Thank you for taking my questions.

<Q - Paul J. Miller>: Yeah, and thank you very much. On the origination side you did talk a little bit about that you're

And also, what do you think about non-QMs [Qualified Mortgages]? I know some banks have come out and said they
will start doing some non-QMs, I didn't know where you stand on that.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: We think that ultimately if you look at our market share and other product capabilities,
given the ebbs and flows of the rate environment, Paul, and faster refis, slower refis, whatever is going on. But if you
look at the – we should be able to – we have a 10% or 13% deposit share, we think, in consumer deposits, we have a
higher percent in cards, et cetera. Home equity is bigger. We should be pushing towards upper-single-digit level in
mortgage. It just will take time because we're rebuilding the process which was not geared toward serving the core
customers and just doing it, and the team has been doing a good job of building that fairly steadily. And the purchase
volume percent I think is in the 30%s this quarter, and so we're getting there. So I – that's our goal. It'll just take us time
and we'll drive that. But in terms of direct-to-consumer production, I think we're second largest now and we plan to
keep driving it.
On the non-QM and the things like that, we'll meet the needs of our customers by using our balance sheet because
remember, we do a lot of mortgages today through our Wealth Management business and stuff. And so we'll work
through the rules, but for the standard products obviously, for the general consumer and the Fannie eligible, Freddie
eligible, FHA-type products, we'll be following all the rules and making sure they go through the standard process to
get them off the balance sheet and into the securitization process. But in terms of putting stuff on the balance sheet, I
think we meet the needs of customers and we've been doing it for years.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And on the jumbo loans, I mean how – I know a lot of the institutions are going after the jumbo
product. I don't think you break – I don't see it – you don't break out your jumbo product, but is that an area of focus for
you guys? And if it is, what type of yields are you getting on that product?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Inherently, when you have one of the largest Wealth Management businesses, it's a focus,
so, of our production about 20%-odd comes from the Wealth Management business. And the yields are – Bruce, I guess
the yields on the product are competitive. We have to compete in the market, so it's a market-driven business.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, [ph] Matt, (1:06:24) I would say that it obviously depends on the product, floating
versus fixed, but you're clearly seeing credit spreads on a floating basis for some of those customers in the spreads of
100 to 150 basis points over from a floating rate perspective.
<Q - Paul J. Miller>: And is there any update on the state of New York where they stand with approving the Bank of
New York settlement of $8.5 billion? Do we know when that's going to come to a conclusion?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: We do not. There's no update at all besides the fact that the trial is over, and at this point,
you know what we know.

Our next question comes from Orenbuch, Moshe of Credit Suisse.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Great. Thanks. A couple of things. In the Mortgage business I noticed that it looked like
the revenue stream from the LAS servicing actually went up from the third quarter. Is that something that will remain at
that level, or does that come down kind of with the servicing assets?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, I think you need to look at within Legacy Assets & Servicing, I know it's
completely counterintuitive, but recall that the reps and warrants is a contra-revenue line item.

<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: So we had the lower rep and warrant provision for the quarter was the big delta.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Got it. In terms of the Card business, I mean, you talked about the million-plus accounts
and you've kind of done that both third and fourth quarter. Just talk a little bit maybe more generally about the strategy
there. Are there any things that you're doing to kind of maintain or increase that? And also kind of on the other side, are
there other affinity portfolios that your partners are going to ask for back as we go into 2014?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I'd say on the affinity side, we identified the one – I think we're, we basically have
repositioned that business the last three or four years, and I think we're kind of where we are at this point. The strong
affinity partners we have, they've done well, we continue to support them and continue to drive production there. But
the real story in a card businesses is sort of, think about the Cash 123 product, the Balance Rewards and the Travel
Rewards products, core products that we continue to drive, and the production of those products continue to be up
significant year-over-year. And that's what's driving us from a couple years ago maybe 600,000, 700,000 – probably
700,000 cards a quarter up to a million-ish now per quarter.
And so that is good because it is our core branded product with a great product for consumer and they use it. And so
what you're seeing is if you look at some of the detail we give you in the supplement stuff, you'll see that the average
spending is going up, the average price – spending per card is going up and so that is obviously is more efficient and is
an indicator that you're becoming the primary card in the wallet for customers.
With that, though, one of the drags is the spend rate, so we're in the low 20%s on payment rate. In other words, when
people are paying this off and not carrying balances because of the affluent customers, that's a little bit of drag, but they
charge enough that you make it through the interchange. So we're very comfortable with the business. We spent three
or four years in positioning but the good news is with the credit quality that we've seen from originations in 2009 and
things like that, we're getting a 9% risk-adjusted margin. So we've ended up with the right spot where we're getting
production growth, i.e., more cards with our direct customers with a good strong margin and we like that. Then you
might say, well, why don't you push it harder because it's returning so well? The issue is, to do that you have to go to
places where I think it's not our core strength and so you should expect us just to grind forward on that.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Got you. Following up on the DTA question, how do you think about and how do you
believe the Fed thinks about that DTA consumption kind of as part of the CCAR submission?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Well, I think the interesting thing is that as you move forward into – as we move forward
and you look to test under Basel III, NOLs are not eligible as capital under Basel III so there's good news and there's
bad news. The bad news is you don't get to count it, the good news is that it eliminates the likelihood that you have a
difference relative to the way somebody else looks at your deferred tax position. So given that CCAR is based on the
way regulatory capital works, that's how the deferred tax asset flows through, and once again under Basel III you don't
get to count NOLs.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: So you're saying though they do consider the capital generation as opposed to just your
earnings then?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I can't comment on the way that the Federal Reserve looks at that, but our belief is, that's
correct.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Thank, Bruce.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: The point would be, this year you're sort of in transition, but as you go forward and the
expectation is you move pure to Basel III, it becomes sort of a non-element in that it's out of the calculation already.
<Q - Moshe A. Orenbuch>: Great. Thanks.

We'll take our next question from Guy Moszkowski, Autonomous Research.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Good morning.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Good morning, Guy.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: A question on how we should think about the fact that last year your capital return really
included not just the buyback authorization of shares, but also the redemption of the preferreds. So you could add the
two numbers together and say $10.5 billion out of last year's CCAR. Is there some conversion factor that we should
think of for the preferreds in terms of saying what the 2013 baseline really was?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think, Guy, as you look at the preferreds that we redeemed, the yields on those
preferreds were between 8% and 9% and our belief, and once again I'm not going to speak for the Federal Reserve, but
I think most people looked at that and said, or at least the way we looked at it was that we look at the heavy content of
tier common that we have and you look at preferreds at 8% to 9% after-tax and I think most people would look at that
and say it makes good corporate finance sense and it's a good thing for Bank of America to retire those.
Given the work that we've done on the balance sheet, you can see that the majority of what we have left from a
preferred stock perspective is priced at competitive rates. So I would be very careful to thinking of and including that
preferred stock redemption and assuming that it was evaluated as common stock.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Right. But I mean is there a factor that you use in thinking about what it would convert into
in terms of the capital return?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: No, because it was straight preferred stock. It had no conversion features whatsoever.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Okay. Fair enough. I've had a number of clients ask me the question this morning about the
significant increase in the yields on the securities portfolio just from the third quarter to the fourth, and obviously long
rates are up a lot. But is it just that? Or can you link that to the couple hundred million dollar benefit that you were
talking about in terms of the market related impact.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: No. You're absolutely correct. If you adjust for the FAS-91, the delta Q3 to Q4, the
increase was only 2 basis points.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. That helps. And I know you said that on the SLR with the Basel add-ons, you were
still evaluating that. But JPMorgan was out saying yesterday that their estimate was that it probably only increased,
above and beyond the NPR, increased, sorry decreased their leverage ratio by about 10 basis points. Are you thinking
similar order of magnitude? Or are you really not in a position to comment at all at this point?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, I think that they – I'd make a couple comments on that, Guy, and that we've got
teams, as you can imagine, culling data and spending a lot of time with it. The couple comments I would make is that
the changes that were made from prior BCBS rules to the new rules as it relates to both the credit conversion factor, as
well as the netting for securities financing transactions clearly are less punitive than what the original BCBS proposals
were. I would say on a very preliminary basis, as we look at it, I would say that we think the negative, or the impact to
us is a little bit more than what JPMorgan quoted. That being said, with our ratios above 5% at the parent and above
6% at each of the banks coming into this, we feel like we're in very good shape with respect to compliance with the
supplementary leverage ratio.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Fair enough. That's very helpful. And then I guess the final question that I have for you, and
it's along the lines of some of the ones you've been asked about, further reductions in the long-term debt footprint.
Obviously there's been some speechifying by members of the Fed about not seeing banks reduce their long-term debt
levels much below where they are now. Is there some rule of thumb that you guys are using in the absence of any
defined orderly liquidation or bail-in capital definition yet as to what you would want your total sort of long term debt
plus Tier 1 capital to look like as a percentage of risk-weighted assets that you're using as a guidepost to help you
figure out how much long term debt to bring down?

<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I'll let Bruce sort of give you sort of the thoughts on that from his perspective. But before
we get there, you've got to remember that what I said earlier is we are, our company has shrunk, and our equity has
gone up. So when you think about that, if you shrunk the company about $300 billion to $400 billion in size across the
last three or four years and your equity balance has gone up, and your deposit balance has gone up, the only thing to do
to balance the balance sheet is take the long-term debt footprint down. That is because we fundamentally got rid of
businesses and assets and things that weren't necessary to do what we do today.
So there's just a difference between us and someone, our peers who have been more organic in how they came together
in the last few years. So I'd just be careful that obviously we work with the Fed. And all these redemptions in stock, we
can make the capital plans, and as you said, liquidation authority and structure, but a lot of our reductions come by just
shrinking the scope of the company and to $2.1 and change trillion from $2.4 trillion to $2.5 trillion. And that's going to
allow us to sort of reshape it and get rid of assets that were non-core, not yielding.
So I'll let Bruce answer sort of the rules, but you remember we started from a different place because as someone said
earlier, Merrill had a lot of debt because they didn't have the deposit funding we did. So, Bruce?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think, Guy, that we hear the same thing that you do where we hear the numbers quoted
of very high teens that you need to be at from a common plus your debt footprint that's greater than a year. If we look at
where we are today from that metric, we're in the low 20s today which, as we compare ourselves to our peers, is higher
than where our peers are. I think what you're going to see as we go forward and I referenced this earlier that this is the
last year of big debt maturities where we've got north of $30 billion at the parent that comes due.
So I think what you'll see for us going forward is you'll see us issue less today at the parent than what matures at the
parent. As you get out to 2015 and beyond, it tends to be much more a $20 billion a year type maturity profile and the
impact in 2015 and beyond, assuming we continue to do what we should with the balance sheet the impact in 2015 and
beyond is going to be more about the cost at which we're raising debt relative to the debt that we're retiring. Whereas
we do have one more year, which is this year, of shrink in the actual total amount.
<Q - Guy Moszkowski>: Got it. That's really helpful perspective. Thanks so much for taking my questions.
Operator
We'll move next to Matthew Burnell of Wells Fargo.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Good morning. First, I guess, a bigger picture question then just a couple of administrative
questions. You've mentioned a couple of times your view about cards and the progress you're making not only in
getting cards in the hands of your customers but also the use that your customers are taking with the card in terms of
charging more. I guess I'm just curious as to what your outlook is for actual balance growth over the course of 2014
presuming that we are in a somewhat-better economic environment this year versus the last couple of years.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: If you look at a couple of things that would drive that, if you look at the last three or four
quarters you can see that we kind of flattened out, we had the – remember, around the holidays you get a seasonal
bump and it comes out. So Bruce said earlier that you should expect that the card balances come down in the first
quarter just because of that.
But if you look at it, it's been $90-odd billion in the U.S. business consistently. What we did see in the latter part of last
year is more uses on the credit slide, which from a general economy perspective, is actually good news in that people
were using the credits versus debit when we look at our usage of the cards and what they're used for in a given quarter.
So the credit spending was up better among all the customer bases leading in October, November and into December.
So I'd say we're set up because we've gotten rid of the balances of the cards that we were running off and that's really a
very low percentage now to have the things stabilize. I don't think it will have large balance growth because it will kind
of work with our customers and what they're doing and we have a substantial part of the people pay us off. But the
good news is underlying, you have seen a little more credit usage in the last, fundamentally, in the last couple of

quarters.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. And then, Bruce, I think you mentioned a couple of quarters ago that you were
targeting a branch count for the company, round numbers, around 5,000. You're basically there at the end of this year.
Is there potentially a push to get that number materially below 5,000? Or at this point do think you are where you want
to be?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: When I referenced the 5,000 that was in the context of starting at just under 6,000
branches and the work that we were doing with respect to New BAC. I'd say that we continue to track towards that
5,000 number, which is probably a little bit different from what we saw in New BAC is that we've been able to actually
sell some of those branches that are for us, out of market, to local banks as they look to build up their local presence,
which I think is a good thing for everyone. And what I would say is, as we look forward I think there'll be a continued
evaluation that we have at this point as to the opportunity and the cost versus the benefit of the branches. But I would
directionally think of us being 5,000, maybe a few less than that by the end of 2014 and there'll be a continued
evaluation that we have beyond that.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think we'd always focus people on the branch count as a fairly objective way to show
how we're trying to do it. The reality now is as you look at the different formats, we are always putting the branches in
the market when leases runoff, repositioning the branch, consolidating branches and adding these express formats that
we're testing and stuff. So the definition of a branch is changing in terms of what you would traditionally think so after
the period which Bruce talked about you're really going to be where the customer is leading you but the branches are
critically important and I always use examples in one market we were able to take four branches and put them in one
larger one, have Merrill teammates, U.S. Trust teammates, Commercial Banking teammates, and the core personal
bankers and teammates in the branch, and we – so we don't know exactly where this goes because it'll be dependent
upon customer behavior. But what we do know is we have to dominate the physical side and the e-commerce online
mobile side at the same time, and that's where we're investing heavily in both platforms.
So we have a, fairly stated, probably $500 million we put in the online mobile platform across the last three or four
years and we'll continue to invest at that rate, and you can see the feature functionality return and the usage of that
platform has grown tremendously. For example in the fourth quarter of 2013, 9% of all the checks deposited by
consumers went through the iPads and mobile phones. That was up from 7% the quarter before and didn't exist until
basically the third quarter of 2012.
And so that's what we're driving because of customer convenience and usage. At the same time, we have 8 million
customers coming to branch and our engagement rate with those customers is going up. And so, the team is less about
what number of branches and more about how the distribution process works between phones and ATMs and mobile
and branches and express branches, ATAs, which are tellers, through the branch. And then we're deploying more
people to sell in all of those regards, and that's what we're trying to do.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: So presumably over the next two to three years you could see the square footage of the total
branch base come down potentially fairly dramatically, given all of the electronic delivery mechanisms that you just
mentioned?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Yes, dedicated to transactions, but the square footage dedicated to sales could increase.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Fair enough. And then just finally, what was your percentage of the originate – of mortgage
volume this quarter that was dedicated to purchase, and how does that compare to the third quarter?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: 32% was purchase this quarter, I think it was 21% in the previous period.
<Q - Matt H. Burnell>: Okay. That's it for me. Thank you very much.

<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Good morning, Nancy.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: I think we all appreciate the tremendous progress you've made on increasing profitability at
the company and getting things turned around, but there is a perception out there that you're going to have a gap-up in
profitability when short rates start to go up. Can you just give me your thoughts about that? Is that indeed a correct
view?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: We look at – in each quarter we look at our asset sensitivity on the balance sheet. And as
we look out at, and our constant metric that we look at is what does 100 basis points do to our net interest income, and
obviously that flows directly to the bottom line. And at the end of the year, a 100 basis point move-up was worth
between $3 billion and $3.1 billion to us from a net interest income perspective. So we clearly will benefit from
short-term rates. That – we obviously don't control that.
And so I think the important thing, Nancy, is that what – as we look at near-term benefits that we have, we continue to
have a lot of work to do on expenses in both 2014 and 2015 because we've got another $500 million a quarter of New
BAC savings that will get implemented between end of 2013 and end of 2014 and then with the guidance that we gave
today, another $700 million a quarter to get out but going into 2014 to where we end 2014. So we do look forward to
those days of higher rates, but in the meantime we've got a nice chunk of expenses to get out that we do not believe will
impact the revenue-generating ability of the company.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: And just kind of to add on to that, I mean, do you have a sense at this point, and this sort of
goes back to the previous question, when rates do start up, how much will the profitability of – given everything you've
done in the deposit gathering network, how profitable will that be in the next cycle as opposed to, let's say, I don't
know, three or four years ago?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: Nancy, if you look at page 11 where we give the profitability of the Consumer and
Business Banking, and that's obviously the one that benefits the most by the short-term rate rise because they have a
huge constitution of deposits that's non-interest-bearing and it picks it up, then you can look at the returns in -there and
in the supplement, you can see we're up to about $2 billion in after-tax income and the returns clearly exceed the cost of
capital, and it'll benefit. But in the meantime, what we'll be doing is driving the cost structure down from – in the
deposit franchise from almost 300 basis points of cost to run the deposit franchise as a percentage of deposits down to
200 and opening that up. So it will absolutely help that business. But meanwhile we've earned $2 billion this quarter
after-tax, which is not bad either.
<Q - Nancy Avans Bush>: Okay. Thank you.

We'll move next to Eric Wasserstrom of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.
<Q - Eric Wasserstrom>: Thanks very much. Most of my questions have been answered but just one small question
also on the mortgage business. Doing the simple gain on sale mathematics, it looks like you had a rebound in your gain
on sales sequentially which is pretty consistent with what we've seen from others, but the magnitude looked much
greater, it looked as if your gain on sale in the period was back to, more or less, year-ago levels which doesn't seem
intuitively right, so just wanted to get your view on that.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, there was one piece internally between the LAS – excuse me, the home-loan space
within LAS and what we have in All Other. So if you adjusted that out, you're not seeing material changes in the gain
on sale.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: The core production margins have come down and stayed at pretty flat levels. Don't read
into that, that as something – that we're doing something differently.

We'll move next to Mike Mayo of CLSA.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Hi. You said the banking backlog was up. Was that versus the third quarter or year-over-year?
And can you quantify that?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think I characterized the backlog as strong at this point, and I would say it's strong both
relative to the third quarter as well as to the year-ago period.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And which areas in particular?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think the interesting thing that we've seen coming into this is that the M&A business,
and if you look at activity levels and just what's been announced over the course of the last week, that it does feel like
that some of the M&A deals are being talked about are going to happen. Obviously there are number of them that are
still being negotiated and may or may not happen, but I'd say M&A activity clearly feels like it's beginning to pick up
and ramp up from what we've seen. You saw within the overall debt businesses, very good growth both year-over-year
as well as linked quarter, and I would say that, that business, as well as the market conditions continue to be quite
strong.
You then move to the equity side, the fourth quarter was obviously a very good quarter from an IPO perspective, and
we typically, coming into the year you have a little bit less visibility on that because a lot of that tends to happen after
people wrap up their year-end numbers. But given overall valuations and what we're seeing, we're optimistic on the
equity side as well.
So I think there's not one piece that we look at within those pipelines that don't feel pretty good, and I would just – the
only thing I'd say is that for a cautionary note is that you are comping against a period that's the highest investment
banking revenue period we've ever seen in the history of the company.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then switching gears, the Wealth Management margin at 26.6%, can you give that to us
excluding U.S. Trust? It just helps with apples-to-apples comparisons with peers.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: U.S. Trust adds maybe 150, 200 basis points to it.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: So, Mike, so that gives you a sense of it but be careful, what drives our margins is what I
said before it's the holistic nature, the Merrill Lynch Wealth Management business because in there they have the
wonderful classic investment business but also they have a good deposit base and a good loan base and all the work the
team does there under John Thiel but it adds about 150 to 200 basis points.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. And loan utilization in commercial and wholesale, where does that stand?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Within commercial it continues to be in the very low 30s.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: So no change?

<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: No change. The only thing that we are seeing that's a little bit of a change and we've
talked about it before is if you look at the amount of funded commercial and corporate loans relative to our total
commitments, that's been very much a focus of what Tom has looked at and we've seen that migrate up to where it's
just under 50%. So while we're not seeing line utilization as much, we are seeing across our Commercial and Corporate
books that the funded commitments relative to total commitments has increased.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And I wasn't sure, what is your net interest margin outlook for the next quarter or two? And if
you could – you mentioned FAS-91 for the debt security yield. Is – to what degree, if the yield curve has flattened a
little bit here recently, do you give some of that back within interest margin?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think that the – we talked about that which drove the margin in the fourth quarter. I
would say that across the board the margin was very strong in the fourth quarter, so you've seen numbers in the low
240s, you've seen it at 251. I would think about that being generally range-bound at this point in time with what we see.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And with regard to New BAC, can you just repeat, how much do you have left and how much
do you think hits the bottom line this quarter? You spent a little bit more money for revenues, which I guess makes
sense if you have the opportunity, but I just want to size that again.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, we've said that we've got $500 million to get through over the course of the next
four quarters, and I would say that's going to generally be earned over time. So I wouldn't think of it being any more
than $100 million, $125 million is generally the way that you'll see it phase in.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: I'm sorry, like $100 million to $125 million per quarter then?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Right.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And that should hit the bottom line, or you might look at reinvesting those gains?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Well, the – we've committed to saying that our New BAC savings have to be net savings
to the company, with the caveat that to the extent that businesses are doing more revenues from where we started that
will pay out, and that's what we did see during the fourth quarter from both the Global Banking side as well as Wealth
Management. Keep in mind, and I think this is important as you look at the first quarter, is that we've got two things
that happen in or generally happen in the first quarter, one that we know does and one historically the trend would
suggest it does. I mentioned the FAS-123 that you have in the first quarter. We know that's going to be an incremental
$900 million.
The other thing that historically has been true is that the Sales and Trading business, the first quarter historically tends
or historically is the most significant quarter within that business. So the incentive compensation, given that we accrue
based on revenues, tends to be seasonably highest in the first quarter, and you add that plus the $900 million I
mentioned and it's not an insignificant number. So we once again feel very good we'll get the net New BAC savings on
a net basis over the course of 2014. Just realized the first quarter can – has those two components.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then lastly, you mentioned the goal for an ROA of 1% over three years, and I just want to
understand what you mean by that. Do you mean at the end of 2016 going into 2017, you look to have an ROA of 1%?
Or do you mean the average over these three years?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: No. See, what we're referencing is that at the end of it as we look out over three years, at
the end of the third year, that's where we would look to get to which, given our current leverage profile, is around 14%
on tangible common.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. So at the end of 2016 you look to have an ROA of 1%.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: That's correct.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: With the forward curve the way it stands. And with that – with those assumptions, what sort of
change do you expect with the certificates of deposits or CDs which are historically low for you and others? Do you
have money moving out of CDs at that point or not yet? You're around 15% of deposits; historically it's around 35%.

<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Okay. I think you would – I would say the general expectation should be that that number
is going to be at or probably move down a touch from where we are today as the core deposit -- given the performance
of the core deposit franchise.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: And then in your page 49 of the proxy it mentions some PRSUs, and they kick in with an ROA
of only 0.5%, whereas your – you seem to be shooting for an ROA of 1%. How will your kind of new expectations here
for the next three years translate into kind of more formalized metrics or compensation, or is it more than simply a
general target? How does it kind of [ph] sync (1:38:19) into the organization?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I mean, I think the targets that we have for performance we'll put out in a proxy this year
when the board goes through the process over the next several weeks here, Mike. But I think in the past it's been based
on getting us back to a level of profitability in the company, and that's what is reflected.
<Q - Mike L. Mayo>: Okay. And in very simple terms, if you look for a 1% ROA on $2 trillion of assets, you hope to
be at a kind of a $2.00 annual run rate in later 2016?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, the one piece -- and once again we're not going to give it -- is that if you're just
doing that simple math you've not made any assumption with respect to the change in shares. So, and once again, given
that we're in the middle of CCAR, we're not going to comment on that, but you do have some benefit over time through
share count.

We'll move next to the site of Derek De Vries of UBS.
<Q - Derek A. De Vries>: Thanks. Good morning, guys. I just have two questions. First, I think in the December
conference you mention there's been a 70% increase in referrals to Wealth Management from other parts of BAC. Just
wondering if you could elaborate on that a little bit. Is that environment driven? Or have you implemented some
specific programs? And then maybe just give us a sense of how meaningful those referrals have been at the net income
level.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: We have a very stringent program that's driven in each market by our market present
teammates where we count the referrals that go in. We count the close rate and who participates in all that. And then
markets are stack ranked, and then we monitor it monthly to see how they're doing and reward the people doing well.
Then we set aggressive goals, and this year for 2013 they hit all the goals. Every market was in good shape. And so it is
a fundamental way that our teams operate in the markets together. When you get specifically into things that work well
for Wealth Management, you have the connectivity when there are liquidity events, so-called business sales, IPOs and
things like that where we bring in business.
We'll get through November, and I haven't seen a final count yet. We had about 675 401(k) retirement plan closed sales
in 2013. We had about 200 and some in 2012. And that is driven through the Merrill retirement plan business that Andy
Sieg and John Thiel drive and delivered between national teams and the financial advisors in the markets. So that gives
you a kind of sense of how this works. The dollars of that is in the $5 billion, $6 billion range, if I remember exactly.
So it's all those types of flows, and then it's several tens of thousands of customers come from the consumer bank into
the Wealth Management platform referred from the preferred teams. That goes on, and those customers come into the
branch to have asset bases that are consistent with Merrill Lynch and U.S. Trust service models. We move them in.
So it's a whole bunch of things. But it's tracked literally person by person to make sure it happens. But frankly, the
teams like to work together and win in a market. And that's what you see when you go into our markets and talk to the

teams that do it.
<Q - Derek A. De Vries>: Okay. And then switching gears entirely and just talk about the leveraged finance business.
I think when you look at the industry, you're seeing like record covenant issuance and you're seeing some pretty
favorable pricing for issuers. How do you think about this business over the next few years, both from a revenue
perspective but also from a risk management perspective?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I would say the leveraged finance business is a very good business for us. If you look at
historically, we are number one or two in that business, and if you look at, on an overall basis, if you look at our debt
origination, both investment grade as well as non-investment grade, it tends to be an $800 million to $1 billion a quarter
type revenue stream. As it relates to the risk, and we believe particularly given some of the new capital guidelines and
the competitive landscape, that we are doing better in that business than we have.
From the risk management perspective of it, you've got two different components of it. You have the
underwrite-to-distribute component to it, which one of the most notable changes I think has been over the last couple
years is the risk gets distributed from the underwriter to the investor generally much quicker even in the context of
deals that have a lag time from the time that they're committed to to where they're distributed. So that's a positive from
a risk management perspective.
And then with respect to the hold pieces, we continue to be very disciplined with respect to the hold levels that we have
on those deals. And the other thing I'd say is that if you just look at mix of business now relative to what you saw over
12 months ago, a lot more of the leveraged finance business tends to be coming from corporate customers that are
either privately held or public, and as valuations have gone up, less of it tends to come from the private equity firms. So
it's a business that we think that we're very good at, our team has done a very good job of being mindful of the risk
that's associated with over the last couple years, and it's a business that we're optimistic of.
<Q - Derek A. De Vries>: Okay. Maybe just to follow up, just to clarify what you said, you're very comfortable on the
risk management side and you've taken market share it sounds like, but I don't think you gave an answer in terms of
where you think the revenue outlook is for this business over the next couple years.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: The revenue outlook I think in many respects as we look out at the profitability, we feel
very good about the outlook, and this is probably the business that most benefits from increased M&A activity,
particularly on the corporate side, so to the extent that corporate M&A picks up, you would look to see this business
continue to have favorable trends. The word of caution would just be is that it is a market-dependent business, and as
you all know that periodically there are gaps in time where the new issue market, particularly on the high-yield side,
does slow down sometimes materially, but on balance, we feel very good about the business going forward.
<Q - Derek A. De Vries>: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator
And our final question comes from Andrew Marquardt of Evercore Partners.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Morning, guys. I just wanted to go back to the retail branch banking strategy shift, and,
Brian, you've been clear about this evolution of everyone having a branch in their pocket, and so not totally surprised
about targeting maybe shrinkage in branch count in 2014, 2015. But to frame it out a little bit more, does that provide
additional expense leverage beyond what you kind of long been talking about on New BAC and LAS or is there an
investment spend component that we need to be mindful as well?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: Yeah, I wouldn't...
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: The relative amount – obviously, is you're getting more and more to the core franchise so
the relative amount of movement we can make and remember couple that with we're investing people and we're
investing in technology to make it all work, and so I'd be careful about assuming – we're always going to be working,
that's our job but I'd be careful about assuming beyond the New BAC costs that Bruce talked about that there'll be a lot

net after that only because we are investing so heavily in electronic space which is still building in front of us.
But the theme is right. It's really how do you keep driving down the overall operating cost of all the platform relative to
the revenue stream and the deposit base obviously because that drives a lot of the revenue stream of business, and so I
wouldn't hold the bottom line but you should assume that we're going to be diligent in terms of managing that change
of transition to help provide more investments, frankly, if we can.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: And where do you think you are in terms of that investment cycle for mobile banking,
other deliverables?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: We've got a great product and I think that it's sort of a steady state. We spend -- just overall
we decide which business -- about $3 billion and change in annual technology development and we expect that number
to stay constant over time here.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: On an annual basis?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: On an annual basis, yeah. Because we're rebuilding systems so I think that – but that's all
built into the dialogue we had about New BAC.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Got it. That's helpful and then separate but sort of related on expenses, so with New BAC
that's left to realize in LAS, how much of that should we have kind of a step function down on the absolute level of
expenses off the core 4Q run rate of, call it 15.5-type level? Should we see by the end of 2014 heading into 2015 should
we take out $1.5 billion or are there other kind of costs related to the investment spend elsewhere that we need to be
mindful of?
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: I think if you look at the chart we gave you, we tried to isolate on a cost – on page – the
bar chart on page 9, you can see that the red bars are sort of the core – take out the litigation, LAS so you have to put
some back because there'll always be litigation, you have to put some back for just running the servicing portfolio, but
we're shooting to drive in the numbers that – take those numbers and then you have to grow them and be careful of the
FAS-123 type of thing in which quarter you're looking at. But our job is to keep driving towards that core expense base.
And then it should grow, if we're growing revenues – the economy growth rate of 100 basis points above that, we'll
grow expenses probably half of that and that takes a lot of work to keep that expense down because the people content
reaches 50%, 60% of our expense base and our people do a great job and we'll pay them.
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: And I would just add that, Andrew, on the LAS piece, we guided to roughly $1.1 billion
at the end of the year. So with respect to the gray bar on page 9 that Brian referenced, I would look at and think about
$1.8 to $1.1 happening generally pro rata over the course of the year.
<A - Brian T. Moynihan>: And we've still got a lot of cleanup. If you look at our – if you look at one of our peers that
announced yesterday, you can see that they're probably doing their mortgage servicing expenses maybe 30% to 40% of
ours and that's because we just are still getting through the higher delinquency content portfolio and it lags a little bit
getting this stuff done.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Got it. That's helpful. And then, Bruce, you had said in I think some of your prepared
remarks that credit quality continues to improve into this year. Should we read into that that there's still meaningful
credit leverage left to be realized in terms of reserve releases, or are we closer to the end here in magnitude?
<A - Bruce R. Thompson>: I think you're closer to the end of that magnitude from a reserve release perspective. It's
always a little bit hard to predict obviously because the reserve releases are a function of what's happening in the
underlying credit. But generally, Andrew, I would say that you would expect to see charge-offs continue to decline and
you're obviously going to see the reserve releases, given the magnitude that they've been, you're going to see those slow
down as well with the one delta just being what's the overall loan growth that you're seeing.
<Q - Andrew Marquardt>: Got it. Got it. Thanks. And then just lastly, just to wrap up some the Q&A on the CCAR
capital deployment, just to be clear it seems like one should not use, kind of, the $10 billion combined kind of preferred
and common last year as a base. It really needs to be kind of a $5 billion as the baseline on common that you got

approved for last year, and hopefully we'll make our own assumption but it seems like it's fair to assume you could
move upward in terms of deployment this year on – off that kind of a base. Is that a fair kind of summarization?
