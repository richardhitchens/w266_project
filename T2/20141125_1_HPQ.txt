Meg Cushing Whitman
Thank you, Jim and thanks to all of you for joining us today. As we exit the third year of our five-year turnaround
effort, I have to say that fiscal 2014 overall was a very strong year. Our performance came in right where it should be,
and we've delivered on our promises. We've reignited innovation across HP, strengthened our leadership, delivered
cash flow above expectations, fortified our balance sheet and grown our non-GAAP earnings per share. And, we finally
stabilized our revenue trajectory delivering flat top line revenue for the company on a constant currency basis for the
full year.
We have also made significant operational improvements across each of our businesses that are paying off in our
improved profitability, customer and partner engagement and employee experience. In fact, we saw year-over-year
operating margin expansion in every one of our businesses in the four quarter for the first time in many years. In
addition, we once again delivered very strong cash flow in the quarter, generating $2.7 billion in cash flow from
operations and free cash flow of $1.9 billion.
For the full year, we delivered $9.3 billion in free cash flow, while returning $3.9 billion to shareholders through
dividends and share repurchases. As a result, our balance sheet now stands at an operating company net cash position
of $5.9 billion, a significant improvement from the $11.8 billion of operating company net debt in the first quarter of
fiscal 2012. And we once again achieved earnings per share at the high end of our previously provided outlook,
delivering non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.06 for fiscal Q4, up 5% over the prior year and $3.74 of non-GAAP
earnings per share for the full year, also up 5%.
We were able to deliver this performance while continuing to invest in the critical innovation that will be the
foundation of HP's future. In fiscal 2014 we increased research and development spending by 10% over the prior year,
as we increased investment in every segment, including cloud, infrastructure, 3D printing and of course, the machine.
Fiscal 2014 was a year of significant innovation for HP. We announced exciting new products and services across our
businesses, and as we enter 2015, we have the strongest portfolio we've had in a decade.
Earlier this year, we announced HP Helion, a portfolio of cloud products and services that enable organizations to
build, manage and consume workloads in hybrid IT environments. In the fourth quarter, we continued our momentum
in HP Helion with the acquisition of Eucalyptus, a provider of open source software for building private and hybrid
enterprise clouds. Eucalyptus CEO, Martin Mickos, joined HP as a senior vice president and general manager of our
cloud business.

We also announced HP OpenNFV, a network function virtualization technology initiative that will help communication
service providers accelerate innovation and launch new services faster, more easily and with less expense. NFV
represents one of the most significant shifts in the telecom industry in 20 years and HP is very well positioned to
capitalize on this shift.
With open and agile architectures, such as our software defined networking and Helion cloud technologies, we are
leading the move away from monolithic purpose-built products. In May, we announced the latest release of our HP
Vertica big data analytics platform, a key component of HAVEn. It allows customers to store and explore data with the
most sophisticated SQL on Hadoop capabilities, combined with advanced analytics and dynamic workload
management.
In June, we introduced the HP Apollo family of high performance computing systems capable of delivering up to four
times the performance of standard rack servers while using less space and energy. This includes the Apollo 8000, an
industry first liquid cooled supercomputer that combines high level of processing power with ultra low energy usage.
We also extended our converged storage portfolio with a solid state optimized, all flash HP 3PAR StoreServ system. It
delivers performance and low latency without compromising enterprise resiliency or adding data center complexity.
In August, we announced our new portfolio of HP ProLiant Gen9 servers. These servers are optimized for convergence,
cloud and software defined environments, and deliver flexible, scalable computing resources that are aligned to
customers' business goals.
In September, we expanded our commercial PC portfolio with the launch of HP Z Desktops and ZBook mobile
workstations. These powerful devices are built to address the constraints of compute-intensive industries like media and
entertainment, graphic design and oil and gas exploration.
And just last month we announced our vision for the future of 3D printing and computing with our blended reality
ecosystem. The first product available in this ecosystem, Sprout by HP, is a first of its kind immersive computing
platform that combines the power of an advanced desktop computer with a scanner, depth sensor, high resolution
camera and projector into one seamless device. It is early days for this breakthrough technology and it will take time to
build the ecosystem, but interest has been very strong among developers, partners and customers.
Also as part of this announcement, we unveiled HP Multi Jet Fusion, a revolutionary technology engineered to resolve
the fundamental limitations in today's 3D printing. HP Multi Jet Fusion leverages our 30 years of expertise and
intellectual property in inkjet printing to develop a 3D printing solution that is 10 times faster than even the best
technologies in the market today with better quality and lower cost. We have already begun engaging with customers
and the feedback has been very strong, and we expect general availability in 2016.
As I have said before, the innovation engine is now alive and well at HP and I expect that our pace of innovation will
only accelerate as we move into 2015. Last month we made another significant announcement that I believe will help
accelerate the progress we have already made in the turnaround. We plan to separate HP into two new market-leading,
independent publicly traded companies. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise will lead the next generation of technology
infrastructure, software and services for the new style of IT. HP, Inc., will be the leading Personal Systems and printing
company delivering innovations that will empower people to create, interact and inspire like never before. Both
companies will have strong financial foundations, compelling innovation roadmaps, sharpened strategic focus and
experienced leadership teams. And both will be well positioned to compete and win in today's rapidly-changing,
highly-competitive environment.
Over the past month, since the announcement, I have met with hundreds of customers, partners and employees and the
feedback is overwhelmingly positive. They are excited about the potential of these two laser-focused companies that
will each be leaders in their respective markets and what that can mean for their businesses and their careers.
It's still early in the process, but we have a comprehensive plan to ensure that we execute a successful separation with
minimal disruption to the business. We have already established a separation management office, tasked with driving
the separation process while allowing the company to continue to execute our FY 2015 programs. As our results in the

fourth quarter demonstrate, we have been able to begin this process with minimal disruption. We'll be giving regular
updates on the progress of the separation on each of these quarterly calls.
Now, let me turn to our business group performance in the quarter. Overall, results in Q4 were driven by strong
performance in Personal Systems, Industry Standard Servers and networking, as well as disciplined cost management
across all of our businesses.
In Personal Systems, we had an excellent performance with our fourth consecutive quarter of revenue growth, up 4%
over the prior year. For the full year, revenue was up 7%, despite having a tough comparison due to the Uttar Pradesh
deal in Q4 of last year. We gained share across commercial, consumer, desktop and notebooks and expect that we will
continue to gain share as the overall PC market continues to consolidate.
In Printing, we had another strong quarter of profitability, while revenue was down by 5%, primarily driven by supplies
revenues. For the full year revenue was down 4% over the prior year. We are seeing some competitive pricing in this
business, with some competitors using movement in the yen to price more aggressively. Overall, hardware units
declined 1% over the prior year, commercial hardware units were up 5%, but disciplined focus on profitable units
resulted in declines in consumer hardware, specifically low value home printers.
We continue to see momentum in our focus areas, with strong unit growth in value multifunction printers, where we are
now the market leader, graphics products, particularly in our Indigo printers, where we extended our leadership
position, and TCV growth in our managed print services business. Dion and his team have been addressing the
challenges in this business and have moved quickly to get the supplies channel inventory we identified last quarter back
in line with the target range.
Overall, unit placement trends and supplies growth will take some time to optimize, but the team has an aggressive plan
in place to address this, including targeted marketing programs and hiring on more supplies specialists. With these
activities, along with a very strong innovation pipeline, I'm confident that Dion is setting this business up for success.
In Enterprise Group, Q4 revenue declined 4% year-over-year, and full year revenue was down 1%. Overall, I'm pleased
with the performance, with solid execution in Industry Standard Servers and continued growth in networking, partially
offsetting declines in storage, business critical systems and technology services. Over the past several quarters, we've
made significant progress in our ISS business. Although revenue in the quarter was down 2% year over year,
normalizing for the large hyperscale deal in Q4 of last year, sales grew across all regions. We've improved our cost
structure in this business, driving profitability, while at the same time attacking the market with new, innovative
solutions and aggressive marketing. We're continuing to see incremental opportunities from the IBM server sale to
Lenovo.
Business Critical Systems revenue continued to decline in the quarter, but we are excited about the HP NonStop x86
platform that we are currently testing with customers, as well as new big data converged solutions that are already
generating revenue. Looking into Q1 we expect to see the benefit of our focus on driving innovation in this segment.
The Storage market continued its shift toward the mid-tier from the high-end, and our storage revenue declined 8%
year-over-year. However, we remain very well positioned with our 3PAR platform, which grew year-over-year and we
expect to gain share as the market moves to the mid-tier.
Networking continued to perform well with revenue up 2% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in switching. We
saw good performance in China, but the market there remains very competitive.
Technology Services revenue declined 3% year-over-year, driven by hardware declines in BCS and Storage, but we
continue to maintain stable operating margins and we are seeing signs of continued adoption of our new offerings,
including Datacenter Care, Flexible Capacity services, and Proactive Care.
In Enterprise Services we continue to make progress in turning around this long-cycled business, but we still have more
work to do. As expected, Q4 revenue was down 7% year-over-year, with a full year decline of just under 7%. As we
highlighted previously, key account revenue runoff, as well as weakness in EMEA, negatively impacted year-over-year
revenue comparisons. Profitability steadily improved through the year due to continued labor savings and

improvements in underperforming accounts. Total bookings for the year were down, but the quality of the bookings
was better. We had solid growth in strategic enterprise service assignments, as well as new logo bookings and increased
new logo win rates.
In Software, solid execution led to improved profitability and a return to growth in our licensed business in Q4.
Overall, Software revenue was flat in constant currency. Revenue grew in our focus areas of security and big data both
in the quarter and for the full year, with Vertica revenue growing high double digits in Q4. We continue to make
progress on SaaS bookings as we shift the focus on both our portfolio and operating model to SaaS and subscription
based offerings.
So overall, I'm very pleased with the progress we've made. The sharp focus on our fundamental operations, including
supply chain, go to market and cost structure, is clearly paying off in our strong profitability across the company. We
expect these improvements to continue into FY 2015.
On the top line, I have always said that turnarounds aren't linear, and while we are seeing clear pockets of growth, other
areas still need more work. But overall, our revenue performance has improved dramatically over the past three years.
And I believe our progress to date will be accelerated by the separation we've outlined. Against that backdrop, our
outlook for non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share for the first quarter will be $0.89 to $0.93, and for the full year
will be $3.83 to $4.03.
So now let me turn it over to Cathie for a closer look at our performance in the quarter. Cathie?
Catherine A. Lesjak
Thanks, Meg. Overall, I'm pleased with the performance this quarter. Revenue was as expected across most of the
portfolio, especially considering two major deals in the fourth quarter of last year that made for tough compares.
Profitability was strong with year-over-year rate increases in each of our business segments, in large part due to the
operational improvements we've implemented over the last few years. We expect these improvements to continue into
fiscal 2015. And cash flow for Q4 topped off what was already a strong year.
Total net revenue for the quarter was $28.4 billion, down 2% year-over-year, or 3% in constant currency. Fiscal 2014
net revenue was $111.5 billion, down 1% year-over-year or flat in constant currency. Gross margin for the quarter was
24.6%, up 1.6 points year-over-year and 0.6 points sequentially.
Over the prior year period, we experienced rate improvements across all of our major business segments, partially
offset by competitive pricing in hardware and an unfavorable mix impact on the strength of Personal Systems.
Total non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $4.2 billion, up 4% year-over-year, driven by investments in
R&D and go to market. Sequentially OpEx was down 1%, in line with normal seasonality. Non-GAAP operating profit
was $2.7 billion, or 9.6% of revenue, up 0.6 points year-over-year and 1.1 points sequentially.
We recorded $146 million of expense on the other income and expense line. With a 22.4% non-GAAP tax rate and a
weighted average diluted share count of 1.9 billion shares, we delivered fourth quarter non-GAAP diluted net earnings
per share of $1.06. Full year non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share was $3.74, up 5% year-over-year, and at the
high end of our outlook range.
Fourth quarter non-GAAP net earnings primarily excludes pre-tax charges of $604 million for restructuring, and $226
million for the amortization of intangible assets. Full year non-GAAP net earnings primarily excludes pre-tax charges
of $1.6 billion for restructuring, and $1 billion for the amortization of intangible assets. While we began to work on the
separation in Q4, associated costs were not material, and are included in our results. We plan to treat separation costs as
GAAP only beginning in Q1 2015.
By region in the quarter, Americas revenue was $12.8 billion, down 3% year-over-year, largely due to declines in the
U.S. We faced some execution challenges, a tough compare in the Enterprise Group, and continued key account runoff
in Enterprise Services. But the U.S. economy continued to expand, and we ended the quarter with strong backlog in

Industry Standard Servers.
EMEA revenue was $10.2 billion, flat year-over-year, or down 2% in constant currency. The Western European region
continued to grow while we experienced declines in Russia and Central Eastern Europe.
APJ revenue was $5.3 billion, down 5% year-over-year, or 4% in constant currency. We saw softness in Japan which
contributed to about half of the regional decline and as Meg mentioned, had a tough compare in India related to the
large PC deal won in the same period last year.
Turning to the business segments we had another strong quarter in Personal Systems, where the team continued to
execute well, and delivered growth in revenue and profit, while gaining unit share across all key segments. Revenue
was $8.9 billion, up 4% year-over-year. Commercial sales grew 7% year-over-year and we regained the number one
unit-share position in commercial notebooks. Consumer sales declined 2% but demand remains strong with growth in
EMEA and the Americas.
As you heard from Meg, this was a great year of innovation, and we have a very strong product lineup. For example,
with our x360 platform, we achieved a 12 point unit share gain in the high growth convertible notebook market taking
over the number one position worldwide. Overall, total PC unit shipments grew 5% year-over-year and we ended the
quarter with channel inventory well within our target range.
Operating profit of $355 million, or 4% of revenue was up 0.9 points year-over-year as the team continued to segment
and target the right market opportunities as well as streamline operational costs across the business.
Print performed largely as expected with total revenue of $5.7 billion, down 5% year-over-year, driven primarily by
supplies. Overall supplies revenue was $3.6 billion, down 7% over the prior year period, due to softer demand and a
reduction in channel inventory. As a result, we ended the quarter with ink and toner supplies channel inventory well
within our target range. Total hardware unit shipments declined 1% year-over-year, partly driven by low-end home
printers, offset by continued growth and share gains in our strategic focus areas of high value units.
We retained our number one market share position in value multifunction printers overall and for color and mono.
Also, Ink in the Office hardware units grew double digits year-over-year with triple digit growth in Officejet Pro X
printers. Total printing operating profit remains strong at $1 billion, or 18.1% of revenue, up 0.2 points year-over-year.
Enterprise Group top line performance was mixed, with revenue of $7.3 billion, down 4% year-over-year. While we
need to improve sales execution in Storage, most of the other business units performed well and overall operating profit
improved to $1.1 billion or 14.8% of revenue, up 0.4 points year-over-year. Within EG, the Industry Standard Server
business continued to gain traction. Revenue was $3.4 billion, down 2% year-over-year. Sales grew in EMEA and Asia
and while Americas revenue declined, we exited the quarter with strong order backlog, including our new Gen9
ProLiant servers.
Technology Services revenue was $2.1 billion dollars, down 3% year-over-year, driven primarily by hardware revenue
declines in Business Critical Servers and Storage. Total penetration rates declined while improving across BCS and
traditional Industry Standard Servers and gross margin performance remained strong in this business.
Storage revenue was $878 million, down 8% year-over-year. The market continues to shift from the high end to the
mid-range and entry level storage solutions and we saw the shift reflected in the strong growth of our 3PAR mid-range
offering. We continue to see positive growth overall in 3PAR, although converged storage declined 3% year-over-year.
3PAR plus XP plus EVA revenue declined 6% year-over-year. We expect external disk results to be largely in line with
the market for calendar Q3.
Networking revenue was $669 million, up 2% year-over-year, driven by strong switching growth. We saw good
performance in China in the quarter, specifically in the data center, although competitive pressures increased and we
expect that to continue going forward. Business Critical Servers revenue declined 29% year-over-year to $238 million.
Enterprise Services revenue was $5.5 billion, down 7% year-over-year, primarily driven by continued key account
runoff. Full fiscal 2014 revenue was $22.4 billion, down 7% year-over-year, within the outlook range we updated last

quarter. Overall, while there is more work to do to improve performance in ES, we made significant progress building
out the instrumentation to more effectively run this business.
By business unit, IT Outsourcing revenue was $3.4 billion, down 7% year-over-year, and Applications and Business
Services revenue was $2.1 billion, down 6%.Strategic enterprise services or services for the new style of IT, grew
revenue double digits.
Overall, for ES, we saw strong growth in new logos. The new logo total contract value was the highest it has been in
over three years. We finished the year with a trailing 12 month book-to-bill ratio of 0.9. The business continued to
deliver productivity improvements and the operating profit for ES was $374 million or 6.8% of revenue, up 47%
year-over-year. Full year operating profit was 3.6%, within the previously provided outlook range.
Now, turning to Software, we started to see the benefits of the work the Software team has been doing to strengthen our
portfolio and go to market approach. Software revenue was $1.1 billion, down 1% year-over-year or flat in constant
currency, with a strong operating profit of $338 million, or 31.1% of revenue, up 0.9 points year-over-year.
License revenue improved growing 2% year-over-year, driven by strength in Vertica and good recovery in the IT
management category, particularly our application development management portfolio. Support revenue declined 1%
year-over-year, and professional services sales declined 5%, as we strategically focused on higher margin engagements.
SaaS revenue was flat year-over-year, but we continued to see momentum in our new SaaS offerings. Service
Anywhere and Propel products are winning in the marketplace, driving year-over-year and sequential IT operations
management bookings growth. We also saw double digit SaaS bookings growth in security.
HP Financial Services revenue was $906 million, down 1% year-over-year, and operating profit was $110 million or
12.1% of revenue. Financing volume grew 15% year-over-year, the fourth consecutive quarter of double digit growth.
For fiscal 2014, the HP Financial Services return on equity was 18%.
Turning to cash flow and capital allocation, in Q4, we generated $2.7 billion in operating cash flow, and $1.9 billion in
free cash flow. Our cash conversion cycle was four days, down four days sequentially driven by improvements in days
sales outstanding and days payable outstanding. DSO was down two days from Q3. Normal sequential seasonality was
more than offset by strength of collections and currency movements. DPO was up two days from Q3, due to extended
payment terms and business mix. This cash conversion cycle is not at a sustainable level, and is below our expectation
of 10 to 12 days for fiscal 2015.
We repurchased 21.7 million shares in the quarter and paid $309 million in dividends, returning approximately $1.1
billion to shareholders in Q4. For fiscal 2014, we returned approximately $3.9 billion to shareholders in the form of
share repurchases and dividends. This is below the 50% of free cash flow target we laid out at the beginning of the
fiscal year and we intend to make up the difference in fiscal 2015.
The restructuring program remained on track, and approximately 41,000 people exited the company by the end of our
fiscal year. Overall, our full year results reflect the progress we've made on improving our cost structure across the
company, to enable the right investments for the future. As we said in October, it is because of these foundational
improvements that the planned separation will be done from a position of strength.
Looking forward to Q1, in Personal Systems we expect to leverage the strength of our product lineup to continue to
gain share in a consolidating market. Commercial PC growth is likely to further moderate as the XP refresh is now
largely complete. In Printing, we intend to place high value hardware units for both laser and ink, improving the quality
of our installed base and the supplies attach. We expect Graphics and Managed Print Services to continue to be growth
drivers for the business.
In the Enterprise Group, overall, the hardware market is likely to remain highly competitive. In Industry Standard
Servers, we expect some momentum going into Q1 from the sales ramp of our Gen 9 portfolio as well as Apollo and

differentiation across the Networking portfolio, including software defined networking to drive share gains.
In Enterprise Services we expect to deliver results to support the full year fiscal 2015 outlook provided in October. In
Q1, we anticipate operating profit will decline sequentially due to normal seasonality and key account runoff.
In Software, we continue to align with customer demands and shift our product development resources and go to
market focus towards SaaS and subscription based offerings. This shift may create near term revenue headwinds but
will set us up for long-term success. From a macroeconomic perspective, we expect geopolitical uncertainty to
continue, impacting specific territories such as Russia, as well as increased competitive pressures in China.
The impact of foreign currency fluctuations is expected to continue to be a headwind as we move into fiscal 2015. As
we said on our October 5 call, we expect the headwind to be approximately two points to as-reported revenue on a
year-over-year basis.
With that context, we are reaffirming our full year fiscal 2015 non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share range of $3.83
to $4.03. For fiscal Q1 we expect non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $0.89 to $0.93.
From a GAAP perspective, we are reaffirming our full year GAAP diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of
$3.23 to $3.43 and GAAP diluted net earnings per share for fiscal Q1 is expected to be in the range of $0.72 to $0.76.
This GAAP outlook does not include separation charges. On the Q1 2015 earnings call, we are planning to provide
more information about Q1 and full year separation charges.
With that, let's open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kathryn Huberty>: Thanks. First, a question for Cathie, now that you're back to target inventory levels in printer
supplies, how should we think about growth going forward and also your ability to keep the margins at 18% in light of
supplies mix perhaps improving?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So Katy, good question. I think Meg will give maybe a little bit of a view on supplies on a
go-forward basis, but I would say that overall, we expect that the ink supplies will really start to stabilize and maybe
grow a little bit and that toner supplies will begin – or continue stabilizing into 2015 but probably not grow until 2016.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: So Katy, let me give you – let me pull the lens back all the way and talk about our
printing business. As you know, we have really three business; we've got inkjet, laser jet and then our graphics
business. And, the good news is graphics is performing very well, high single digit growth for much of the year, middle
single digit for Q4.
Inkjet is performing largely as expected. While we have experienced some decline in the home computer market, or the
home consumer printer market, basically we are growing SMB and Ink in the Office and a number of our initiatives are
doing quite well in the ink business.
The challenges are the greatest on the laser side of the business. And there's two things going on here. One is we made
the same hardware decision as in ink to place those high value units, which lead to greater attach long term, which I
think is a smart move. On the toner side, I think the declines can be attributed to the clones and the remands attacking
on our aging install base, which we have been fixing over time, but we still have an aging install base.
I think the good news is we are all over this challenge. And we are focusing on our high value MFPs, where we
outperformed the market, we have got a great managed print services business where we are now number two in the
market from number four a couple of years ago. And we are launching a new R series of products with new technology

to combat the clones. So ink good, graphics great and toner is our challenge in laser, but we are all over it.
<Q - Kathryn Huberty>: Thanks for the color.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Specifically around your comment around margins in 2015, very much the same as
margins in 2014, as we are very focused on our cost initiatives and driving the appropriate productivity. We have seen
favorable currency, obviously in 2014 that was very significant. In 2015, that favorable currency position from a yen
weakening does mute a bit because we are anniversarying it, but we do continue to expect to see some incremental
gains from yen in fiscal 2015.
<Q - Kathryn Huberty>: Okay. And then just as a follow-up, Meg, in the press release you mentioned the potential to
accelerate the progress of the turnaround in fiscal 2015 and beyond. Can you just talk about, you know, is that
referencing accelerated revenue performance, accelerated cost performance and how much of that is dependent on
getting the spin done in the second half, versus a foundation that's already been laid? Thank you.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: Yes. So Katy, let me give you a perspective here. We have made a lot of progress over
the last three years on a couple of dimensions. One is we have firmly stabilized the revenue in this business. We were
flat year-over-year, which is not what we aspire to. But from whence we came with high single digit revenue growth,
we are feeling pretty good about that. We have also done a good job on the cost side. You saw that we expanded
margins in every single business in the fourth quarter, which has not happened since May of 2012.
So we need to keep doing what we're doing. We need to continue to accelerate the pockets of the growth that we have.
We need to mitigate the declines in some of our businesses, legacy products, whether it be tape or others. And we need
to continue to double down on the innovation engine. I'm really proud that we increased R&D by 10% year-over-year.
We haven't done that in a very long time.
So I think we're poised to do well in 2015. We expect flat revenue in 2015 in constant currency. If it were not for the
two point currency headwind that Cathie described we'd actually grow a bit, but every major U.S. company is going to
be facing a pretty significant currency headwind and we are no exception to that. And then, we feel good about the
margin expansion. So right where we thought we would be on the turnaround and obviously the point of the separation
is that we will accelerate that going into 2016.
<Q - Kathryn Huberty>: Thank you.
<A - Jim Bergkamp>: Thanks, Katy. Next question please.
Operator
The next question is from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sherri A. Scribner>: Hi, thank you. I just wanted to follow up and ask Cathie if you still feel comfortable with
your cash flow guidance for fiscal 2015 and along with that if you still expect to deliver 50% of that back to
shareholders and as part of that what type of share count should we expect in the first quarter given a lot of buybacks
happened later in the quarter?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So thanks, Sherri. Yes, I still expect that our cash conversion cycle is going to be in the 10
to 12 day range for fiscal 2015 and part of that is the result of things that happened in the fourth quarter that are not
sustainable. For example, we did have a currency benefit to the cash conversion cycle in the fourth quarter that actually
isn't real cash. And I'm sure most of you just said, "What is she talking about?" But what happens is that we actually
hedge our balance sheets around the world. We hedge them at a net monetary asset basis and we book it through OI&E.
We don't hedge accounts receivable separate from accounts payable and so we're getting what looks like an artificial
cash flow impact from DSO.
So really if you really think about the fourth quarter, it's really at about six days. We've got some linearity in there from
purchasing and sales that is not sustainable, going into 2014. I'm sorry, into 2015. And then we also have business mix

impact because, as you guys know, the personal Systems Group generates a very negative cash conversion cycle, which
is great. But as that business becomes a less mix for us, and the EG and the Enterprise Services becomes more, which
has a higher cash conversion cycle, there's upward pressure.
And then finally, I think one of the really important things is that we've done a great job of getting our balance sheet in
good shape and our working capital in great shape and now the opportunity is there for us to take advantage of cash
discounts when it makes economic sense, put inventory on boats when it makes economic sense. And frankly, make
some strategic buys when it makes sense. And that will put upward pressure for all the right reasons on the cash
conversion cycle in 2015.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: And with regard to returning 50% of cash flow to investors in the form of dividends
and share repurchase, that stands. That is our objective for 2015. And given where the share price is, you'll see us
weight that towards share repurchase.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: And therefore you should expect a moderate decline in shares outstanding over the course
of 2015.
<Q - Sherri A. Scribner>: Okay, and just to follow up, you are still comfortable with the $6.5 billion to $7 billion free
cash flow guidance for fiscal 2015?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Yes, we are.
<Q - Sherri A. Scribner>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Jim Bergkamp>: Thanks, Sherri. Next question please.

And the next question is from Toni Sacconaghi with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Yes, thank you. I have one for Cathie and I think one for Meg. Cathie, I just was
wondering if you could help us frame the cost savings opportunity in fiscal 2015, versus fiscal 2014. You know, my
sense is that the gross cost savings opportunity is actually several hundred million dollars bigger in fiscal 2015 than in
fiscal 2014. And I was wondering if you could comment on if fiscal 2014 was, let's say, $1.4 billion in gross savings,
whether you could comment on how much of that you reinvested versus fell to the bottom line, and how we should be
thinking about that on a relative basis for fiscal 2015. How are you thinking about reinvestment versus savings capture
relative to this year?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Sure. So, Toni, let me start with the restructuring update so that everybody is on the same
page. So from a restructuring perspective, we did end fiscal 2014 as we expected. We had about 41,000 employees
leave under the program in fiscal 2014. We took a GAAP-only charge in 2014 of about $1.6 billion, and we had a cash
outflow of $1.5 billion. That generated gross savings in the year of $3.5 billion.
And then if you look at – or you go back to the announcement we made at the beginning of October, we increased the
number of employees impacted from 45,000 to 50,000 and the savings from that, the net savings from that increase, we
are investing back into R&D and go-to-market.
For fiscal 2015, we do expect that we will have the full amount of 55,000 employees leave under the program, that the
GAAP charge will be down significantly to about $600 million, and that the cash flow impact will also be down by
about $500 million and the gross savings will be up to $5.3 billion.
Now, to your point, a fairly large chunk of that gets reinvested back in – frankly in work that gets migrated as we adjust
our global footprint. Some obviously goes back into investing into R&D and sales and some will drop to the bottom
line.

<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: And, Cathie, can you help qualitatively about how we should think about that relative
reinvestment rate for 2015 versus 2014, or is that discretionary depending on how the year goes?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: I think it's a little discretionary, but, you know, we put a significant amount of that back
and when you think about those incremental 10,000 folks and the savings that we are going to get in the year on a net
basis, that is going back into R&D and sales.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Okay. And then Meg, you sound, consistently confident about the stabilization in revenue
and in the opportunity for – or expectation for flattish revenue growth at constant currency in 2015, and I was just
wondering what dynamic you see changing. So I look at 2014, and you had quite easy comparisons on the revenue side
and then in Q4, your comparison was, you know, about minus 3 and revenues grew about minus 3 at constant currency.
When we look to fiscal 2015, your comparison at constant currency is about 0, so it's actually tougher and you are
expecting much better growth than you saw in Q4.
So I was wondering if you can comment on whether you actually think the environment will improve in fiscal 2015,
relative to what we saw in fiscal 2014 or whether there were unique performance challenges in 2014 that you don't
think will repeat or if we just try and think of a more analogous, tougher compare, which is Q4, it doesn't necessarily
follow that, you know, getting to flat revenue growth in a similar spending environment necessarily happen. So maybe
you can help me with your view on what drives that. Thank you.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: Yeah, sure, Toni. So first I would say from a macroeconomic point of view, we don't
expect much change across the globe with the exception of the United States, which does seem to be strengthening in a
way that is different from the last three years.
Second, I would say much of this performance that we expect from a revenue perspective in 2015 is driven by the fact
that we are stronger. Every business is stronger, every market position that we are in is a bit stronger. Our innovation
roadmap is as strong as we have had, really across the board, whether that is our PC lineup, our new range of R series
printers, our next generation of servers, our mission critical x86 servers, all flash array in our Storage business, SDN in
Networking, across the board, you know, we have got two new great products in our IT management suite in software,
so we feel great about that part of the business. Every business is stronger.
ES, we are planning to have a slower decline in revenue in 2015 than we did in 2014 or 2013. So while we still
anticipate ES will shrink in 2015, it will be at a slower rate. And probably the biggest swing factor to growing the
company will be what happens in ES revenue.
And I'm encouraged on two points, one is our new logo performance is the best it's been in a number of years. Our win
rates are up. We are being invited to RFPs and to opportunities much more frequently than we were in the past and we
have a higher win rate. We have to continue to sell our in-year sell-and-build to our existing customers.
So Cathie, I don't know if you would agree with me, but I would say probably ES is the biggest swing factor in terms of
the growth projection that we've put out for 2015.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So I think ES – I also think EG has just an incredible amount of innovation that's coming
to market. We've got our Gen9 ProLiant server that launched in August. We've got our Apollo series platform that's
launched and we have just an incredible lineup for the year that I think is – it gives us some real upside in EG.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: And the Windows Server 2003 refresh.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Exactly. For the server space there too.
<Q - Toni M. Sacconaghi>: Thank you.
<A - Jim Bergkamp>: Thanks, Toni. Next question, please.

The next question is from Ben Reitzes with Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: Hey, thanks a lot. Meg, can you comment on what your appetite for M&A is during the
transition process now that we, I mean, you have been buying back stock the whole quarter, so it looks like your plans
might have changed over the last 90 days. If you could just update us there.
And then also, did you detect any disruption at all in any of your business due to the announced transition and breakup,
particularly in the enterprise group? And how are you managing that and making sure that everything goes smoothly?
Thank you so much.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: Yeah, you're entirely welcome. So with regard to M&A, we still remain interested in
acquiring assets that are the right thing for either what will become Hewlett-Packard, Inc. or HP, Inc., and what will
become Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. But as always, and we've been consistent on this, this is returns based, we remain
disciplined, and we won't do things that are not in the best interest of shareholders. So I wouldn't say that it has changed
dramatically; but, we remain on the same sort of philosophy of M&A.
With regard to disruption, I'm actually happy to report that I don't think we saw any disruption in the fourth quarter, and
we are approaching the separation, I think, in a very good way. First is, we have some of our most talented executives
running the separation and that is what they are doing full-time. And at its peak, that will probably be between 400 and
500 people. The rest of HP, all 275,000 of the rest will be, in fact, focused on running the business. And so I have a lot
of confidence that we'll be able to deliver FY 2015, which is critical, because the most important thing we can do to get
these two companies off on their own is deliver this year while we execute the separation.
This is a big and complicated separation. It is the biggest separation that's ever been done, and it's not a typical spin off
where you've got one big company spinning off a little part of the company. These are two Fortune 50 companies that,
as said at the separation, both have about $57 billion of revenue. So it's big and it's complex, but we've got the right
people on it and I'm really heartened by how we have approached this. This is HP at its best, execution machine on the
separation.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: And the other thing that I would say is that as we were entering into the fourth quarter, we
obviously had some expectations about what we thought revenue would do. And this was before we announced the
separation, and the revenue actually came in a bit better. So top line was better and that's even in an environment in
which currency moved against us to the tune of several hundred million dollars, so continuing to feel very confident
that we can execute in fiscal 2015 while we are separating the company.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: And let me just give you a little color of customers and partners. So we communicated
with 38,000 customers and 69,000 partners in the first 18 hours after the announcement. It's kind of amazing, but we
were in a military-style of communication and then post that, all the senior executives have met with hundreds of
customers and partners. And I would have to say that almost universally they are enthusiastic about this. They think it
is going to be good for them, good for their business, because we'll have two more focused companies that have an
ability to react faster to the marketplace and meet their customer needs more – in a more focused way.
And that, of course, because the customers have reacted well, that has actually sort of encouraged our employees. They
are now kind of excited saying, wow this is going to give us a chance to be more nimble and to win more in the
marketplace. So I think this has gone as well as it could have gone. I'm really pleased with the communications, pleased
with the reaction and pleased with the rallying of our employees across the globe.
<Q - Ben A. Reitzes>: All right, thanks a lot.

<Q - Maynard J. Um>: Hi, thanks. So you have now put senior leadership in place to manage the separation of the
two companies, can you just talk about what the immediate mandates are, what the next steps are and then also whether
you have any thoughts on potential incremental synergies, where that might be coming from and if there's any way,
how we might be able to frame the magnitude today? Thanks.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: Yeah so the immediate mandate, and I'll go into a little bit of detail here, is there is a
corporate separation management office who is tasked with creating three years of historic financials for each of the
different businesses, which, of course, we do not have because we've been together.
Second is the very detailed analysis of tax and legal separation. We have over 786 legal entities at this company, all of
which have to be looked at and rationalized.
Then we have a separation management office for each of the businesses, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and HP Inc., and
their job is to make sure that we've got the right strategy with the right cost structure as we head into being two separate
companies.
And there is also obviously the separation of IT that needs to take place. And that will give us an opportunity to create
an IT infrastructure for each company that isn't based on our legacy IT system and isn't based open a manufacturing
system, which for so many years it has been.
So those are the immediate mandates. And it seems to be going well. We've got deadlines every month on things that
have to be decided, decisions that have to be made and operations that have to be changed.
With regard to incremental synergies, I'll let Cathie take a crack at that. What I will say is this separation was totally the
right thing to do for this company. It will, as I said, make us more customer focused, but it also gives us a chance to
clean sheet two new Fortune 50 companies, and it is remarkable how it focuses the mind around overhead, around do
we need exactly what we have today? Because what we are not doing is separating the company into two pieces exactly
as it is today. We are using this opportunity to really think through how we start – knowing what we know now, and if
you had a chance to restart these two Fortune 50 companies, how would you organize? And that has been a really
interesting and I think going to be really good for both of these companies.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: So I don't have a specific number for you. We're still working through this. We're
working through, frankly, also the costs of the separation, which we will give an update on our earnings call in Q1, but
I'll reiterate something Meg said, maybe a little bit differently. This is an opportunity to do zero-based budgeting, as
close as you can get to zero based budgeting, for two Fortune 50 companies because every line item needs to be
reviewed, every balance sheet item needs to be reviewed in order to do this split. And so it's a huge opportunity for us
to really take a different perspective with our cost structure.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: And the ability to rethink go-to-market, supply chain, customer support, warranty, I
mean we're just going through every single thing. And by the way, we've been doing that for three years. There's a huge
amount more opportunity, which I think is also exciting to people. Because in this day and age, in what I call the new
style of business, your cost structure is an absolutely necessary part of being able to compete in a global environment.

The next question is from Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Thanks. I have a question for Meg and for Cathie both really around the next year's
revenue outlook.
For you, Meg, first of all, going back about two years, you published a slide which talked about sustained growth from
fiscal year 2015 onwards for the business. Obviously a lot's changed in the last two years and I acknowledge that. But
are we at the point whereby – I know you've talked about some moderate level of growth this year, but it doesn't sound

you're that convinced it's going to be sizable. Are we at the point whereby just going forward you are confident this can
be a growth company, even if it's low single digits and what are the key product areas that we should be tracking to
monitor that progress, do you think?
And just for Cathie, one thing you said earlier on in the free cash flow question was that you implied that PSG may
actually decline, or it may go down in the mix. But I thought a few weeks ago at the analyst meeting you implied that
the PC industry may contract but HP's PC business wouldn't contract, because you've gained share. Does that not stand
anymore? Have I misunderstood? I just want some clarification there. Thanks.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: So let me talk about FY 2015. As I said, we would grow this year in my view, if we
didn't have the currency headwinds. But listen, there's puts and takes in every business. I think the revenue will be
about flat in constant currency this year. And, again, we have made a huge amount of progress. There's been
tremendous changes in the marketplace over the last three years, but I feel good about having stabilized the revenue.
Now, I think the question you are asking is do we think two separate companies will grow in 2016? And it is too early
to give you that guidance. As we come closer to the end of this year, we will give a lot more detail about HP, Inc., and
Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. And we will be out with investors much like an IPO roadshow as we get closer to the
separation.
But at the highest level, one of the principles, one of the philosophies behind this separation is both companies will
actually do better separately than they would have combined. And that's because cost structure, focus, real attunement
to customer needs and the marketplace changes. So the thesis very much is to go from year three to year five of this
turnaround, we're going to make more progress as separate companies than would have had we kept this together.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: And, Kulbinder, my comment was really around the long-term sustainability of the cash
conversion cycle at four days. And so we would expect that had we kept together, that over time, the PC business mix
would decline, and that the Enterprise Services and EG mix would increase.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Jim Bergkamp>: Thanks, Kulbinder. Last question, please.

The final question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Yep. Thanks, and good afternoon, guys. A couple of questions. One on the services side, just
want to make sure I heard this right. Did you say book-to-bill was 0.9 this quarter? Because I think it was 1 the quarter
prior. And could you talk about what your operating margin expectation for service is through fiscal 2015, given that
you had pretty good expansion in 2014?
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Sure. Yes, I did say that the book-to-bill was 0.9. We had hoped to exit the year at 1. We
did have a rather large deal slip into next year; if it weren't for that, we would have gotten to 1, but we did end at 0.9.
In terms of the Enterprise Services margins, what we laid out for you, I think it was on the October call, was that the
margins in fiscal 2015 would expand from the 3.6 that we did in 2014, to between 4% and 6%.
<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: With a long-term margin expansion, as we've said for a couple of years between 7%
and 9%.
<A - Catherine A. Lesjak>: Right, with top line growth of 3% to 5% long term.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: Yep. And then if I could just maybe follow-up. A follow-up on China, a couple of weeks ago,
Meg, you made some comments about China being potentially soft, especially on the networking side. Can you just
talk about what are you seeing there? Is it very much isolated in networking or is it a broader issue you're seeing that
it's tougher to do business in China across HP, versus just networking?

<A - Meg Cushing Whitman>: So in China, in the fourth quarter, we saw growth in Enterprise Group, in Services,
and in Printing. But we also saw an increase in a very aggressive pricing, especially in Networking. And overall, in
China, HP was flat year-over-year. And we continue to run China with a single business leader, Bob Mao, who reports
directly to me, and he is driving a really an overall united strategy and go-to-market approach across what will become
Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. So it's a little different than the way we run the rest of the world and I think that's working
for us.
That said, it is a very competitive environment. And it is competitive with Chinese players, as well as other global
players. It is probably our most competitive market in the world. So we have to be on our toes there. And we are very
focused on in China for China. What we've learned and I have learned in my previous career is you've got to have
products that are right for the Chinese market with a distribution model that is right for the Chinese mark. And if you
do not do those two things you will end up not performing as well as you might have in China.
So I think we've got the right approach to China. It is a very competitive market, but I think we're doing as well as any
other major global competitor at the moment in China.
<Q - Amit Daryanani>: All right. Thanks a lot.
Meg Cushing Whitman
