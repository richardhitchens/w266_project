With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marillyn.
Marillyn A. Hewson
Thanks, Jerry. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today, and I hope you've all had a good
start to the new year. Before I begin, I want to say it is a pleasure to be here on my first earnings call, and I look
forward to working with you going forward. I hope you got a chance to review our press release outlining fourth
quarter and full-year results. I am extraordinarily pleased and proud of our Lockheed Martin team. We have continued
to achieve strong program execution and focus in a challenging environment. These efforts enabled the corporation to
achieve exceptional operational and financial results in 2012.
Let me begin with a brief summary of 2012. Strong order bookings in the fourth quarter resulted in our achieving a
record annual level of almost $49 billion in new business awards from domestic and international customers.
Noteworthy awards included $4.4 billion on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program for additional production activities,
$2 billion for two additional spacecraft on the Advanced EHF Military Communications Program for the Air Force, and
$800 million for additional Patriot 3 Missile Defense components for the U.S. government and Taiwan. These new
orders enabled us to finish 2012 with a record backlog of over $82 billion. Our backlog of work provides a solid
foundation for the future and is a direct indicator of the close alignment of our portfolio of products with customers'
strategic priorities and requirements, even in today's demanding fiscal climate.
Other record performance levels for the corporation included growing our earnings per share from continuing
operations to $8.36, the highest EPS level we have ever achieved; increasing our segment operating profit to almost
$5.6 billion, $300 million above the 2011 level; expanding our segment operating margin to a record 11.8%, an
increase of 40 basis points above the 2011 level; and growing our sales to over $47 billion despite a challenging budget
environment. These achievements reflect our commitment to affordability as our team drives toward increased
efficiencies and improved execution for our customers.
We also continue to implement our cash deployment strategy to generate value to shareholders through dividend
payments and share repurchases. In the fourth quarter, we paid $373 million in dividends and repurchased $286 million
in shares. These actions brought our full-year total for cash return to shareholders to $2.4 billion, reflecting dividend
payments of $1.4 billion and share repurchases of $1 billion. In addition to the cash returns in 2012, we generated 20%
total shareholder return, achieved by stock price appreciation and dividend yield. These results reflect the quality of our
workforce, the strength of the corporation, and the focus we all have on delivering value to our customers and
shareholders. Thanks to everyone in the company for their contributions in driving these strong achievements.
In addition to these results, we also continued our strategic acquisitions under our String of Pearls strategy, with the
purchase of two businesses in the quarter. Both of these acquisitions expand our offerings in support of our customers'
increased emphasis on advanced unmanned systems and are consistent with our goal to maintain a portfolio of
technology-advanced options that will generate value for customers and shareholders. The first acquisition was for
Chandler/May, a company that specializes in the design, manufacturing, and support of unmanned aerial systems. The
second acquisition was for CDL Systems, a software engineering firm that specializes in the development and licensing
of vehicle control software for unmanned systems. These purchases, following our acquisition early in 2012 of
Procerus Technologies, and will be part of our Mission Systems and Training business, where they will be integrated
into our growing portfolio of unmanned systems and technologies.
Turning now to operational performance. Our five business areas continue to execute with exceptional skill and focus
in providing critical products and services to customers. While the quarter contained numerous accomplishments across
the enterprise, I'd like to highlight two unprecedented successes in the ballistic missile defense test arena.
First, four of our five business areas provided equipment and support in the first-ever integrated ballistic missile
defense test of the Aegis, Patriot, and THAAD systems. These systems worked together to successfully detect, track,
and destroy multiple ballistic missile and cruise missile targets in a live-fire test. This operational test was conducted by
soldiers, sailors, and airmen from multiple combatant commands and demonstrated the maturity and reliability of these

essential missile defense systems. It also demonstrated the benefits of layered, interoperable missile defense solutions
that can provide protection to the U.S. and allies against the increasing proliferation of ballistic missiles. With the
proven reliability and capabilities of our Aegis, Patriot, and THAAD systems, we look forward to growing domestic
and international customer demand for our missile defense systems.
The second significant ballistic missile defense event was achieved by our Medium Extended Air Defense System, or
MEADS, successfully tracking and intercepting a target in its first-ever intercept flight test. MEADS is a
next-generation air and missile defense system that incorporates full-perimeter, 360-degree defense and provides eight
times the coverage area of current legacy systems while dramatically reducing operational and support cost. With this
intercept demonstrating the maturity, next-generation capabilities, and cost-effectiveness of MEADS, we urge
Congress to provide future funding for the program.
Moving to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, our Aeronautics team continued their momentum in this quarter
through significant advances on the development program and achieving an increasing tempo on production programs.
On the development program, key achievements included accomplishment of test flights for the year that were 18%
ahead of goal, and accomplishment of test points for the year that were 10% ahead of the goal. The aircraft also
surpassed 5,000 flight hours and achieved the first aerial weapons release for CTOL and STOVL aircraft and maximum
high angle of attack flight on CTOL aircraft.
In addition to the test flight's success, I had the pleasure to attend the official delivery ceremony of the first operational
STOVL aircraft to Marine Corps Air Station in Yuma, Arizona, in November. The ceremony marked the handover of
the jets to the service, and with the receipt of these aircraft, the base will start tactical operational training on this
critical asset for the Marine Corps. Also in the area of training, the 33rd Fighter Wing at Eglin Air Force Base
completed the requirements allowing their wing to begin pilot training in 2013. These events in Arizona and Florida
demonstrate the increasing tempo and maturity of the training programs as we work to get these assets to the services.
Turning to production activities, we continue to make progress on our production tempo, with delivery of 13 aircraft in
the fourth quarter. This brought our full-year deliveries to 30 aircraft, more than double the aircraft deliveries achieved
in 2011. Significant contractual progress was also achieved this quarter, with completion of negotiations on the LRIP-5
contract, award of an undefinitized contract action on LRIP-6, and long lead for LRIP-7. These contracts provide
significant stability to the program as we work with our partners to provide these critical aircraft to domestic and
international customers. These latest contract awards bring our F-35 production backlog at year-end to 88 aircraft. Our
maturing production line, operational base stand up, and expanded pilot training are all strong indicators of the F-35
program's positive trajectory.
Beyond the operational program accomplishments, we continue to take additional actions to drive affordability across
the corporation and to increase customer alignment. Along with the previously announced reorganization of our
Electronics Systems business area into two new business areas – Missiles and Fire Control and Mission Systems and
Training, effective December 31, 2012 – we also announced consolidation of several corporate functions at our
headquarters designed to streamline and tighten the corporate staff. These actions will improve collaboration and
coordination across the enterprise, increase efficiency, and achieve greater synergy. It will also focus us on the actions
that best position the company for success and growth in a demanding and dynamic environment.
I'd like to turn now to the status of DoD budgets and the continuing levels of uncertainty for fiscal year 2013 and
beyond funding levels. Currently the DoD is operating under a continuing resolution through at least March 27 for FY
2013, with funding constrained to prior FY 2012 levels. This limitation will cause funds to run short in some accounts
and will continue last year's dated priorities that don't necessarily reflect the new defense strategy. Because of this and
other limitations associated with a full-year CR, we are strongly urging Congress to pass a defense appropriations bill
in March and not extend the CR for the remainder of the year.
The second area of budget uncertainty is associated with the pending threat of sequestration, or automatic budget cuts.
Since our October call, some encouraging action was undertaken by Congress and the White House to avoid
implementation of these across-the-board budget reductions. In early January, the President signed legislation that
deferred implementation of approximately $1.2 trillion in automatic federal budget reductions for two months, until

March 1. However, if sequestration is allowed to happen on March 1, it still would result in cuts of $0.5 trillion each in
defense and non-defense accounts over nine years. For defense, that's an additional $0.5 trillion in cuts beyond the $487
billion already imposed by the Budget Control Act of 2011. While we recognize that both parties are strongly opposed
to allowing sequestration to happen, we remained deeply concerned that sequestration could occur as the default
outcome if negotiations fail to produce an agreement. As the Joint Chief of Staff just explained in a powerful January
14 letter, sequestration not only puts at risk our defense industrial base, it also harms military readiness and would
quickly hollow out our military forces. In the weeks ahead, we'll continue to work with our government leaders to
encourage a more effective solution to our nation's fiscal challenges.
Despite the continuing uncertainty on U.S. defense budgets, it is absolutely clear that there is a growing need for
security solutions in a challenging global landscape. Events this past quarter, such as the successful North Korean
multistage missile launch, coupled with a continued rise in China's military strength, ongoing instability in the Middle
East, and the expansion of terrorist activity in Africa only highlight the complexity and volatility embedded in the
mission of maintaining global security. Our portfolio of products and capabilities remain in direct alignment with this
global security mission. And we look forward to helping domestic and international customers secure solutions to their
most critical defense and security requirements. While no one can precisely predict the impacts of sequestration or
events that will unfold in the global security environment, there is one thing I know for certain: Every one of our
120,000 employees stands ready to take on whatever challenges emerge.
Focusing internally, I want to reiterate the priorities that I have reinforced with the team since assuming my new role as
CEO. These priorities are consistent and unchanged from those that I helped formulate as a member of the executive
office and working with Bob Stevens in my prior role. I thought it useful to outline those priorities on the call today.
My direction to our team is to grow the business, with key drivers being fighter fleet recapitalization from the F-35;
missile defense in Aegis, THAAD, and Patriot; cargo aircraft fleet expansion with C-5M and C-130J, Littoral Combat
Ships fleet expansion; and C4ISR. Achieve higher levels of program performance and execution excellence to satisfy
customer requirements and provide financial returns to shareholders. Pursue a strategy to secure and expand our core
business, and expand into closely aligned adjacent markets, such as cyber security. Grow international revenues to at
least 20% of total corporate sales in the next few years. Continue to return at least 50% of annual free cash to the
shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Invest for growth through innovation, product evolution, and
strategic acquisitions under our String of Pearls strategy. Finally, and importantly, continue our strong focus on talent
development and employee engagement. I believe achievement of these priorities will enable our corporation to
continue to provide superior performance to our customers and shareholders as we move forward.
Before I ask Bruce to give you some color and details on our performance, I want to highlight two organizational
changes approved by our board yesterday.
First, Joanne Maguire, Executive Vice President of our Space Systems business, advised of her plan to retire from our
company after a distinguished career. Since taking over the leadership role at Space Systems in 2006, she has grown
the business while streamlining the cost structure for our customers and expanding returns to shareholders. Under her
leadership and drive for innovation, Space Systems achieved a remarkable track record of mission success and
continues to provide a broad array of advanced technology systems for national security, civil, and commercial
customers.
Effective April 1, Rick Ambrose will assume responsibilities as Executive Vice President of our Space Systems
business, replacing Joanne. Rick brings over 33 years of experience in the aerospace and defense industry and has
currently been serving as Vice President and Deputy for Space Systems, reporting to Joanne. Rick's varied background
within Space Systems, leading our Intelligence business in IS&GS, and his leadership roles in our former Mission
Systems & Sensors business will be extremely valuable experience as he moves the Space business forward for our
customers and employees.
Secondly, Linda Gooden, Executive Vice President of Information Systems & Global Solutions, has also advised of her
plan to retire after more than 32 years with the corporation. Linda assumed the leadership role at IS&GS in 2007 and
has managed over 30,000 professionals who provide integrated information technology solutions, systems, and support

for worldwide missions to civil defense, intelligence, and other government customers. Her customer knowledge and
leadership have been key catalysts enabling IS&GS to maintain its leading position as the largest IT provider to the
U.S. government for the past 18 years.
Effective April 1, Sondra Barbour will assume responsibilities as Executive Vice President of IS&GS, replacing Linda.
Sondra is currently serving as our Senior Vice President, Enterprise Business Services, and Chief Information Officer
for the corporation. As CIO, Sondra is responsible for leading our internal IT operations, including the protection of
ours and our customers' infrastructure and information from cyber threats. She was also instrumental in defining and
launching our new government and commercial cyber-security business. Sondra's knowledge of IT systems, coupled
with 20 years' experience in IS&GS, where she served in program management and as CIO and Vice President of
Operations, demonstrated her strong leadership and track record that have prepared her well for her new role to lead
IS&GS.
Both Joanne and Linda have had exceptional careers and are an exceptional executive in every respect through their
dedication and professionalism, and I really want to thank them for their leadership and service to the corporation over
their careers. These retirements and their succession by proven leaders highlight why we've invested so much energy
and time in our talent management and leadership development programs. Our succession planning process is vitally
important to the future of the corporation and provides the outstanding cadre of highly qualified executives ready to
assume additional responsibilities and take our business forward. Both Rick and Sondra represent the depth and breadth
of talent in our company and bring proven leadership track records. Each has decades of experience gained by working
in diversified assignments. They're leaders who have built superb teams in prior assignments, and I look forward to
their ongoing contributions as they assume their new roles.
I'll now ask Bruce to go through some of the details of our performance, and then we'll open up the line for questions.
Bruce?
Bruce L. Tanner
Thanks, Marillyn, and good afternoon, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along
with the web charts we included with our earnings release today.
Let's start with chart 3 and an overview of the year. We grew sales for the year to $47.2 billion, exceeding the guidance
that we provided in October. I'll discuss sales in greater detail in the next few charts. We increased our segment
operating margin to 11.8% or 40 basis points higher than our 2011 margin. Our earnings per share were $8.36. We
generated $1.6 billion in cash from operations after making $3.6 billion of pension contributions. I'll explain the
reasons for the additional contribution amount in subsequent charts. And our backlog finished very strong at over $82
billion. We had said throughout 2012 that we expected backlog to end the year at about the same level as we began, but
this obviously exceeded our expectations.
Chart 4 shows our sales trend for the past four years. $47.2 billion represents the highest level of sales in our history.
And I'm pleased that we've been able to grow about 8% since 2009, a period with significant economic and budgetary
pressures.
Moving to chart 5 and looking at our new alignment of five business areas. Three of our five business areas grew sales
during the year, including MST, Aeronautics, and Space, while Missiles and Fire Control sales were comparable to
2011. As expected, IS&GS showed a reduction in sales versus 2011, reflecting both the overall decline in the federal IT
budget and the effects of the continuing resolution in the fourth quarter.
Turning to chart 6 and segment operating results, we grew consolidated segment operating profit by over $300 million,
with one-quarter of the growth due to the higher sales volume mentioned previously. The remaining increase results
from the 40 basis point margin improvement to 11.8%, reflecting the strong performance and proactive cost measures
taken during the year.

If you'll turn to chart 7, you each of the business areas' margins in 2012 compared with 2011. Three of our five business
areas improved margins in the year, including Aeronautics, MST, and Missiles and Fire Control. And Space was
comparable to the prior year, reflecting the breadth of our execution and cost improvement actions.
On chart 8, we'll discuss the earnings per share for the year. We grew EPS by more than 6% over the 2011 amount, and
this represents the first time we've exceeded the $8 per share level. Our pension-adjusted EPS grew to just below $10
per share.
On chart 9, we'll reconcile our actual 2012 EPS versus our last guidance range. In October, we gave our EPS guidance
of $8.20 to $8.40, resulting in a midpoint of $8.30 per share. Our fourth quarter results yielded $150 million more in
segment operating profit than was contemplated in EPS midpoint, resulting in a $0.31 improvement. We had other
items that reduced EPS by $0.25, including a non-operational tax item worth $0.18 and special item in the quarter
related to head count reductions in our Aeronautics business that was worth $0.05.
Overall, the fourth quarter changes netted to the $0.06 increase over our October midpoint guidance. The
non-operational tax item was due to our $2.5 billion discretionary pension contribution in the fourth quarter, which
caused our taxable income to be lower than the level planned in the first three quarters of the year. This required a
true-up in the fourth quarter, reducing the manufacturing deduction for the year and lowering EPS by $0.18. Future
years' taxable income will be higher as a result of the accelerated pension contributions into 2012, and we expect to
capture most of the reduced manufacturing deduction over the next two years.
We made the contributions for several reasons. First, with the possibility of corporate tax reform, this contribution
locks in our pension deduction at the current statutory rate of 35%. And should the rate be reduced to 25%, as has been
discussed, this benefit would be worth $250 million. Second, earlier contributions to our pension plans allow the assets
to grow quicker, also lowering future required contributions. Next, we had the cash on hand to make the contributions,
which otherwise would yield minimal interest income. And, finally, the acceleration in the 2012 increases operating
cash in the future, providing a fairly quick payback in a very-low-interest-rate environment.
Chart 10 shows our operating cash results prior to the discretionary pension contribution. Our guidance in October was
that our cash from operations would be greater than or equal to $4 billion. Prior to the pension contribution, our cash
from operations was $4.1 billion, slightly higher than expected.
On chart 11, we'll discuss our backlog trends for the past three years. We've grown our backlog since 2009 by $5
billion, more than our sales growth over the same timeframe. And the $82.3 billion at year-end 2012 represents our
highest-ever backlog level. As you can see, our book-to-bill ratio has exceeded 1.0 in each of the last three years.
Chart 12 provides the assumptions embedded in our 2013 guidance. Importantly, our guidance for the year assumes a
continuing resolution through the current date of March 27, and it does not assume that sequestration reductions are
implemented. Our FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $485 million is based on a 4% discount rate and long-term asset
return of 8%, consistent with our assumptions on October. And our planned contribution level in 2013 is $1.5 billion,
equal to the level of CAS recovery in the year. The expected earnings from the $2.5 billion pension contribution
reduces our 2013 FAS expense by $200 million at the assumed 8% return level. 2013 will include both the 2012 and
2013 benefit of the R&D tax credit legislation passed earlier this year. As a result of that legislation being passed in
January, the 2012 benefit will be recognized entirely in the first quarter, as will one quarter of the 2013 credits. We
expect this benefit to amount to $45 million in the quarter and approximately $75 million for the year. Finally, our
guidance assumes share count remains flat, with share repurchases offsetting the effects of option exercises and new
issuances.
Chart 13 provides our new outlook for 2013. Our sales for the year are consistent with our expectations when we last
spoke in October despite the significant increase in fourth quarter 2012 sales. Segment operating profit and the
resulting margin are both higher than we indicated in October, with the expectation that our strong performance in 2012
will carry over into 2013. EPS from continuing operations is expected to be between $8.80 and $9.10 for the year, and
cash from operation is expected to be greater than or equal to $4 billion.

As for phasing in the year, we would expect sequential growth in our sales during the year, with the first quarter being
markedly lower than the next three quarters and about $1 billion lower than the first quarter of 2012, due primarily to
lower aircraft quantities in our Aeronautics business. In the first quarter, we expect to have 10 fewer F-16s, six fewer
C-130s, no C-5 deliveries, and lower F-22 volume, as there were production deliveries in the first quarter last year and
there are none this year. Margins are expected to be fairly consistent by quarter in the mid-11% range but could
obviously change depending on the timing of risk retirements. Cash should be strong in the first quarter, with the
benefit of the large tax refund as a result of the discretionary pension contribution, and backlog will likely drop in the
first quarter and first half of the year as orders are expected to be more heavily loaded in the second half of the year.
Chart 14 shows the guidance ranges for sales and segment operating profit by our business areas. Note that the
reorganization of our former Electronics System business results in two nearly equally sized business areas, in Missiles
and Fire Control and Mission Systems and Training.
And, finally, we wrap up with our summary on Chart 15. 2012 was a strong year for us, both operationally and
financially. These results reflect the strong performance and proactive steps we've been taking for several years, and
our challenge is to continue that success into the future. Our backlog positions us well and speaks to the alignment of
our portfolio with the needs of our customers, and we're proud of the 20% total return we provided our shareholders in
2012, and we stand ready to perform in 2013.
With that, we're ready for your questions. Karen?
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] In the interest of time, we are limiting you to one question. Please return to the
queue for any follow-up questions. Our first question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Good evening, everyone.
<A - Jerry F. Kircher>: Hi, Jason.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hi, Jason.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Welcome, Marillyn. And, Bruce, I wanted to, if it's okay, target this question to you and talk
a little bit about cash deployment. I think this big pension contribution that you made here during the quarter may have
caught a few of us by surprise. And was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about whether you contemplated
kind of letting us know that this was going to be coming and perhaps why you didn't. And then also maybe just talk a
little bit about long-term capital deployment and what you see on the horizon with regard to the mix. We just now had a
big pension contribution. Does that take that off the table now for a number of years and we get a much more steady
stream of operating cash flow that can be used to deploy either back into the business or back in the shareholders
through repurchases and dividends.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Thanks, Jason. I think you got your money's worth on that question. So, let's see, where do I
start? As for why we did it at the end of the year and why we didn't tell you and did we contemplate telling you, we did
a fairly comprehensive study as far as pension analyses are concerned relative to our funding requirements, the
expectations in the future, the sensitivity of our plans to asset returns, discount rate changes, and the like. You may or
may not be aware, we actually sent out in the fourth quarter an offering to our terminated but vested participants in the
plan, offering to essentially give them lump sum payments in lieu of the pension payments over periods of time when
they retire. We got a fairly good return on that, actually reducing some of the volatility in our liability associated with
those individuals going forward.
We were studying this issue right up until literally the end of the fourth quarter, Jason. And we were studying at the
same time the prospects of what was going on in Washington relative to corporate tax reform. And we were speaking to

the board at that time, saying we think this might be sort of the confluence of a lot of different actions that should result
in us potentially making a larger contribution for the pension plan in 2012 in order to, in my words, lock in the
deduction at 35%. We do feel there's a strong possibility for corporate tax reform going forward. We think that number
could be anywhere from a 25% to 28% rate, as opposed to the current 35%. And we very much wanted to, as I said
earlier, lock in that rate.
I walked through the varied dynamics that I said in the prepared remarks relative to we thinking that this is a very quick
payback and the interest that we're earning on the cash on the balance sheet is probably about 20 basis points as we sit
here today. So the acceleration occurs within a low-interest-rate period of time, and we're getting low interest on the
cash that sits on the balance sheet currently. It did accelerate the tax deduction, as we talked about earlier. And I like
the fact that it also reduces the gap between pension adjusted and reported earnings, as I mentioned earlier as well.
Now, we looked at this, Jason, and I'll just give you some stats here. So taking a look at 2013, one of the reasons we did
the $2.5 billion is we looked at how much cash did we want to have left on the balance sheet, and how much flexibility
did we want to have going into 2013 to enable us to do the sorts of cash deployment activities we've done in the years
past. So in 2013, we're looking at $4 billion of operating cash, we're looking at roughly $1 billion or so of capital
expenditures, so $3 billion of free cash flow. We do have about a $150 million debt retirement that we were going to do
in the year 2013. So think of that as contributing $850 million, sort of unencumbered, of our free cash flow. And we
felt that that $850 million plus the $1.9 billion on the balance sheet, so almost $2.8 billion, was very adequate to
continue to do the kind of cash deployment that we've done in the past.
I think a fair question would be, so you guys have said you're not going to have share count increase. What's that level
of share repurchase that you're counting on there? And at least for our planning purposes, we're expecting about $700
million of share repurchase activity in order to effect that, and that's our estimate of how many options will be
exercised in the year and also how many new issuance of the stock will occur for executive compensation, matching of
our retirement plans, and the like. So collectively, we think, from a cash deployment between the current dividend
contributions that we'll have in 2013 of roughly $1.5 billion, plus the $700 million of share repurchase embedded in our
guidance, that's $2.2 billion. As I said, I think we still have adequate flexibility on the balance sheet and the
unencumbered cash flow to remain opportunistic to do additional share repurchases or mergers – or acquisition
candidates if in fact they looked fine for us to make those acquisitions.
So kind of a long-winded answer. I think the other side of it is we don't see this as a change. And I think Marillyn made
those comments in her prepared remarks relative to our – the longstanding cash deployment practice of contributing at
least 50% or more of free cash flow to our shareholders; that is still our intent. And I think I said earlier, but I'll close
again, the reason for the timing was we literally didn't have this discussion until late in December with our board of
directors before making this contribution. Kind of a long-winded answer, Jason; sorry about that.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Richard Safran from Buckingham Research.
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: Hi, good afternoon.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, Rich.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Good afternoon.
<Q - Richard T. Safran>: Okay. I had a question on IS&GS. You're guiding to 9% margins for the year. Given the
margin pressure in this environment right now, can you discuss a little bit about what gives you the ability and
confidence that you can sustain 9% margins? And also maybe if you could comment if this is being driven by your
cyber and intelligence business?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, thanks, Rich. I'll take that one on as well. So as we look at IS&GS, I think we made a
very conscious decision, and I've discussed this on previous calls. We've tried to differentiate ourselves somewhat in

this market by focusing on what I'll call mission IT, where we're literally sort of providing the embedded capabilities in
large measure for our customers, as opposed to what I'll call commodity IT. And you think of that as sort of back-shop
processing and the like, help desks, those sorts of things, where really we didn't see – we've done that work in the past,
but really we didn't see sort of a discriminator or a differentiator for Lockheed Martin in doing that work. So we focus
much more on the mission part of the IT service. That tends to be a higher-margin part of the service activity in the IT
world. So that's one thing that gives me the confidence that we can continue to do that. And as I look back, Rich, over
the last probably eight or nine quarters, IS&GS has been 9% or the low 9% return on sales consecutively for those eight
or nine quarters. So that gives me confidence again going in 2013 that we can continue to do that.
You asked about the cyber. We're very excited about the cyber activity within IS&GS. We've had some very successful
wins, including taking some business away from some of our competitors within cyber. I believe we're the largest
federal cyber provider in the industry. And that work is very valued. That's very much in line with that mission IT that I
talked about, and that work, as you would suspect, supports that 9% margin as well.
Operator
Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Good afternoon.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hi, Doug.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: I'd like to follow on on Jason's question about cash deployment. If I look at the last few
years, particularly 2010 and 2011, and if you look at what I would call the cash yield to shareholders, sort of the net
repurchase of shares plus dividend, you've been above 10%. And I think a lot of people found that very attractive.
Today, when you're looking forward for this year, we're basically at 5% if you assume no net share repurchases and
about a 5% dividend yield. When you look out to 2014 and 2015, how do you think about that? Do you think about it in
terms of what the yield to shareholders would be? Is this a temporary period where you're handling a pension issue and
then you may go up to, I would call, larger yields to shareholders in the future? How do you look at this?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. Doug, I'll try that one as well. I'll speak for myself, and I think I speak for the board.
We don't go about selecting share repurchase amounts from a – what additives to our dividend levels would get us to a
certain level of return on our shares or a certain level of return on our market cap, if you will. That's just not the way we
think about that. We very much look at this as opportunistic. We've increased, obviously, the share or the dividend
amount considerably over the past few years to where that in and of itself essentially takes care of the 50% or more of
free cash flow without any contribution of share repurchases.
I think if you look at where our pension plan is sitting from a funding perspective, to me, it's fairly obvious that you'd
want to help that pension plan get a higher level of funding. That's definitely a nearer-term use of cash than maybe it
was a few years ago with the rates going down. I'll tell you, that was very much part of the study that I mentioned in the
discussion with Jason as to what is the appropriate amount to contribute to the pension versus the real, live possibility
that interest rates increase and actually get us into an overfunded situation. But we're certainly not abandoning our
share repurchase strategy. We want to remain optimistic. That's the reason I tried to give the color on the fact that we
have lots of flexibility, not just this year but you asked about 2014 and 2015 with growing cash as I expect to happen
over the next two years. I think we'll have even greater flexibility in 2014 and 2015 than we do in 2013.
Operator
Thank you, and our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Sterne Agee.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Yes, good afternoon, everyone. Good afternoon, Marillyn. A question, Bruce, I guess, on the
backlog. What's been impressive over the last few years with the defense pressure has been your ability to kind of grow
the backlog. Can you kind of talk a little bit about how the backlog looks for 2013 and what you need to see in terms of

bookings at this – the second half of this year for international activity to kind of hold these levels, just given what
we're going to see with sequestration kicking in? Thanks.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So let me give you sort of maybe a wide, all-encompassing orders and backlog
response to the question, Peter. So expectation-wise, if I take a look at where we expect the orders for the year to end
and where we are right now from a backlog perspective, I think we'll end the year close to the $80 billion level. We
might not be able to replicate the $82 billion, the highest level we ever have done, but I feel pretty good about being
able to get to the $80 billion or so.
This will be an interesting year. You've seen some of the correspondence that's come out of the acquisition community
relative to delaying some of the near-term awards associated with the continuing resolution and anticipation of
sequestration. So we're definitely expecting to have a significantly more loaded second half of the year than in the first
half. So I would expect each of the first two quarters to be below a 1.0 book-to-bill. I would expect the next two to be
above a 1.0 book-to-bill. And I'll say we have a significant amount of international activity that we're counting on in the
year.
I'll just rattle off a few of the orders that I think that are important, both from a dollar perspective and maybe a strategic
perspective, and I'll ask Marillyn maybe to comment on some of the strategic ones as well. But we've got sort of
near-term – think of these as first half. I hate to give quarters, only because some of the delays that have occurred. But
first half, we've got the two LCS ships for the FY 2013 order. We've got closure for the Lot 6 international aircraft, for
five aircraft. We're hoping and our customer is hoping to definitize the Lot 6 and Lot 7 for F-35 negotiations in the first
half of the year. I think an important one that I think is worth mentioning is we expect to get long-lead funding for Lot
8 of the F-35 program for some 48 aircraft. Just the quantity alone versus the prior year's quantity is worth mentioning.
Think of that as 29 domestic aircraft and 19 international aircraft, including nine FMS, Foreign Military Sales, outside
of the eight initial partners on the countries – or on the buy, excuse me.
Strategically, there are some things to watch that aren't necessary big-dollar events, but they are strategically important
to us. So the Aegis Combat Systems Engineering contract within our MST operation; think of this as next-generation
Aegis development for the capabilities there. The KC-46 training – and the interesting thing about that is we're actually
– the only reason we're able to bid that, frankly, is because of the acquisition of SIM Industries last year that gives us
some capabilities to do that training capability on the 767 aircraft that's the basis of the KC-46. We have the Air and
Missile Defense Radar, which is sort of the next-generation air and missile defense, as the name implies, radar for
surface combatants.
Second half of the year, we have a couple of actually vehicles 5 and 6 for the [ph] SVRS (45:41) contract, some
THAAD UAE follow-on, Production Lot 5 contract for the THAAD order. And there's some big orders we tend to get
on kind of an annual basis, the Fleet Ballistic Missile and the next order of the RERP. Somewhere in that mix
internationally, we've got the C-130 to Saudi as well. We've got an Iraqi F-16 order for another batch of 18 aircraft
we're hopeful for. And scattered throughout that are other, smaller international business. I should point out that in the
year 2012, we did about 17% of sales and about 17% of orders on an international basis, and that's roughly what we're
expecting in 2013, maybe a little bit higher in the orders as far as the total content of our orders in 2013.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: So let me just add to that. We do have a strong focus on international growth and our
growth portfolio. And so as – Bruce has listed off several items, but certainly there's continued strong demand for air
and missile defense in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific, and so we expect to continue to see pull for PAC-3 and the
Aegis. And in addition to that, air mobility, F-16, as Bruce has – he's listed off several of those things that are out there
that we're looking at but, we expect to grow our portfolio on the international side to at least 20% of our revenue in the
next few years.

<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Thanks. Good morning – I'm sorry, good afternoon by now. First one's a clarification. Bruce,
is the $1.5 billion in 2013 discretionary or required, because I would be surprised if it were required, given the
pre-funding.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, that's our plan level, Myles. I think the required amount is less than that.
<Q - Myles A. Walton>: Okay. And you mentioned the Lot 8 quantities, 19 international, I guess nine of those being
[indiscernible] (47:54) Japan or Israel or a combination of the two and then 10 partners. From a partner perspective, it's
obviously good growth overall, but it seems like the partners are certainly slipping out to the right versus where they
would have been 12 months ago in Lot 8. Is there upward mobility to the Lot 8, or is that kind of what the international
partners look like? I guess about 12 months ago I would have thought maybe that number would have been 30; now it
sounds like it's 10. And then what does that bode for the next couple lots thereafter?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, I'm trying to think of the 30, Myles. I can't imagine a scenario that would have gotten
us to 30 aircraft. I think perhaps the number that you were thinking that might have been a little bit higher was the
Turkish aircraft in Lot 8. They're now pushed out to the right. I think if we actually go back a couple years, though, you
would have seen fewer Israeli and fewer Japanese aircraft in their side. It's actually help to mitigate some of those
Turkish aircraft, at least in Lot 8. But that's – you asked about the flexibility. I wouldn't think we would see the orders
bouncing around much if any from that level. I will say this: We have ongoing conversations with our customers, and
they continue to look at the F-35 as we continue to perform. I think that's – the more we can do and demonstrate the
capabilities of the aircraft and show that capability to customers like South Korea, for instance, the more this aircraft
will sell in the future.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: And I think as I talked about earlier in my remarks, we've made great progress on the
program. It's maturing, and the development process as well as the production ramping up. We've got 5,000 hours on
the aircraft. So we're committed to delivering an affordable aircraft, and we're on plan – actually remain ahead of plan
to the 2010 baseline that was put in place.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol from JPMorgan.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks; good afternoon.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hi, Joe.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: This has been a very smooth transition thus far in terms of leadership, Marillyn, but when I
look at the – I have the 2011 Annual Report in front of me, and there are nine folks in the picture. One of them is in his
current seat, and that's the person next to you, Bruce. Everyone else has changed. So my question is, in that context,
you have a very smooth transition, all the plans sound the same, but the combination of all these people here must have
very different ideas on how to do things, including you. So I'm wondering if you could list the top two or three, maybe,
off the top of your head, that – in terms of how we think about the company, what might change?
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Well, we're all connected. This is a very tight team, this leadership team, and that's why
our succession plan has been so smooth and successful, is that we've been operating to the same strategy for a number
of years, and the results demonstrate the strategy's working. We have a very experienced team of folks, and so even the
ones that are moving into the new roles have been with the corporation for a number of years. They're all experienced
executives. And we spent a lot of time working together on making sure everyone does understand our strategy. So we
– in fact, in another week, we'll have the entire leadership team from across the corporation together to talk about our
strategy for the coming year, to build on that.
So we've all worked together for a long time, and we're not in the mode of changing the strategy that we have. But our
board of directors is directly involved in talent development and the succession planning process. In fact, as Joanne and
Linda announced their intent to retire, we took that to the board, we reflected back on our pipeline of talent with them

and there was not even a hesitation on who would move into the next role. So we've been colleagues together with a
tight leadership team for a number of years, and it's a well-planned transition process. And I don't expect there to be
changes. We'll work together and deal with the environment that we're operating in and adapt to it.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Thank you very much. I actually want to follow up a little bit on sort of change in the
environment that you see going forward and how you want to take advantage of that, Marillyn. In one case, you have
Congress doing things like ringfencing MEADS, and in other cases, you have what I call low-cost competitors trying to
unseat a very reliable solution in ULA. How do you deal with those two competitive threats?
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Well, any competitive threats, we take into account the environment that we're operating
in. I think we have a very strong portfolio, and even MEADS, I think, is demonstrating success. The flight test that we
had in November and the flight test we have planned later this year, we're going to operate to. Our technologies and our
innovation that we bring to the marketplace is the hallmark of this corporation. And we are very much proactively
focused on cost efficiencies, and that's a critical discriminator for – as well. So this competition that we're dealing with
is really not new to us at all. We're used to it. It's constant. That's how we operate all the time, is in a competitive
environment, and we'll continue to do so. So I don't find that as something that is a big change for us. We understand
our competition, we understand the markets that we're operating in, and we're going to excel in those markets.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Good afternoon.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, George.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: I'd like you to go through a little bit more detail, some of the moving the parts in
Aeronautics. I mean, like, one of the things that's in the release is that the operating profit's about comparable to 2011
for the F-35 and the F-22. While the F-22 is down considerably from last year, F-35's probably grown. So can you
discuss how much growth we saw in the F-35, where you are, if you changed any of the booking rates on the margins,
et cetera?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: George, are you talking 2012, or are you talking 2013?
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: I was just reading from the release in terms of your analysis of the operating profit for the
December quarter. There's a comment in there that operating profit was comparable to the same period in 2011 for F-35
contracts and the F-22, and sales were comparable as well, which says that the – I would imply the F-35 profit must
have gone up because you were booking lower on the F-35 than you were on the F-22, and we know the F-22 revenues
are way down.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, I think -
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Looking for some more clarity.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: I think in the press release – I don't have that in front of me George – but I think what that's
saying is that F-35 sales and F-35 profit this quarter are comparable to F-35 sales and F-35 profit levels last year.
Whereas F-22 sales and profit are comparable to last year's quarter as well. Not that the two of them are comparable to
each other, if you follow.

<A - Jerry F. Kircher>: Karen, this is Jerry. I know we're coming up on the hour, but because we have a number of
people in the queue, and with our sort of extended comments today, we'd like to go ahead and extend the call at least
another 15 minutes to 4:15 or so to let people ask questions.
Operator
Certainly, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hi, good afternoon. Welcome, Marillyn.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Thank you
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Just wanted to ask quickly about the F-35. The commentary from your customer last quarter
before you signed the contract was that you were pretty far apart on terms, yet you closed that negotiation before the
end of the year. And I wondered if you might comment on how you reached a conclusion there and what the
implications are for the follow-on negotiations from your perspective, as Bruce highlighted that there's several of the
follow-on lot negotiations that are sitting in front of you this year. Any color would be much appreciated.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Sure, Carter. Well, basically, on the F-35 LRIP-5 negotiations, what was important was
for both sides to understand the cost structure of their positions. And so, we had an opportunity to spend time with our
customer and let them share with us how they viewed all the cost elements; we had an opportunity to likewise share
that with them. And I think through that process, we were able to come to a mutual understanding and get to a – close
the negotiation. And we reached a fair and yet challenging agreement. And so, I think it did take a little longer because
we had a lot of time that we had to go through for both sides to really assess it, but it was nothing around the terms and
conditions that drove that. It was really around the cost.
So I think we're in a good posture for Lot 6 and 7. We already have the undefinitized contract action under contract,
and we are in direct discussions right now at the program level on the Lots 6 and 7. And the intent is to negotiate both
of those together and get that done in the first half of the year. And our customers really need us to lean forward and
make sure that we meet the challenges that they put in front of us and that we're taking cost out. So in addition to
getting LRIP-5 negotiated and getting on with LRIP-6 and 7, we're working very hard on taking cost out of our
business and driving toward more affordable product for them in all aspects of our business.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn from Credit Suisse.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Good afternoon.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hey, Rob.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Question for Bruce, and this is building on George's question on Aeronautics, but I would
like to take you up on the 2013 part of that and ask if you could refresh us on the manifest by program, quantities, the
margins you see for the major programs. And in particular if you could talk – just update us on the F-35, on the 36
aircraft, how we should think about which lots those are from and profitability on F-35 in 2013 relative to 2012.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. So, Rob, I'll – you asked the question to me, so I'll answer it. So as we look at 2013 – I
think I said on the October call, we're going to be down probably 10 C-130 aircraft, so think of that. We did, I believe,
34 in 2012, and we'll do 24 or so in 2013. The F-16s, 37 last year, about 13 this year. Think of that as really no change
in aircraft deliveries from the Fort Worth line. All the change we're talking about there was the aircraft that were

delivered off the Turkish line, so you won't see sort of cost fluctuations associated with that, with the aircraft coming
off the line in Fort Worth. C-5, we talked and I don't know if we talked in the October call about the increased volume
there. We ended up delivering four. We actually delivered maybe an extra that we weren't exactly counting on
delivering in 2012, but we ended up with four for the year. We're expecting somewhere around eight, so kind of a
doubling of quantities on the C-5 program next year.
And you talked about the F-35 deliveries; we are looking at probably a 20% increase. We did 30 this year. We're
looking at 36 next year. And you asked what aircrafts those were. I believe – and I may get this a little bit off, but I
believe those are the tail end – we started delivering Lot 4 aircraft at the end of 2012. We'll deliver all remaining Lot 4
aircraft in 2013. And we'll start – and I've lost track exactly, Rob, somewhere in the middle of the year, middle to third
quarter-ish time of the year we'll start on the delivering Lot 5 aircraft. And those will be the aircraft that we deliver all
the way through the end of the year.
Margins on the F-35 program we are expecting to go up in 2013, if for no other reason than the absence of the profit
adjustment we took, I believe in the second quarter, on the SDD contract to lower the expectations on the award key
going forward. But we were also – because we did have success – I'll remind you, we started 2012 with a goal of
delivering 30 aircraft. We had a multiple-month strike at our Fort Worth facility, and we still delivered 30 aircraft. And
so, as you might imagine, that says the efficiencies we're getting in the production line are starting to be self-evident.
And with those efficiencies, we would expect in 2013 to actually have some profit step-ups on the production contracts.
So we would expect the overall rate between the combined SDD contract and the LRIPs in 2013 to be higher than they
were in 2012.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Company.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Thank you very much. I may have missed it, but what did you say about the orders for the
full year 2013? And could you give us a little split between if there's no sequestration – I assume that's your assumption
– and if there is sequestration, which parts of your business – which of your orders, let me put it that way – for 2013, do
you see as at greatest risk?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah, Cai, so 2013, the orders I was talking about were what we – well, I think what I said is
we expect to have orders given our sales level that would essentially get us back to about an $80 billion backlog. So
you can kind of solve for the math on that one. Think of it as, I don't know, somewhere, $40 billion – $45-ish billion or
so. And as far as – we're not assuming the effects of sequestration, as I said in my prepared remarks. And how that
would manifest itself in terms of impacting the orders, we've always described IS&GS at a very short-cycle business
that if you look at the numbers for IS&GS right now, we are expecting a downturn in 2013 over 2012. And to a large
extent that's because the federal IT budget has gone down, frankly, with or without sequestration. I think a fair question
is how much more can you take out of the federal IT budget even under a sequestration environment and still
accomplish the task that you need to from an IT perspective. We don't have a lot of – we'll look at – there's probably
been a shift over the past two years to have more of these IDIQ task orders, so I suspect – and a lot of those, where they
are occurring is in the IS&GS business. So I would expect during sequestration, we would see less exercising of those
IDIQ task orders.
I said earlier in response to an earlier question – I've lost track who asked it – that I think we're seeing some of the sort
of the push-out of orders right now, in part because of Secretary Carter's guidance relative to preparation under the
continuing resolution, and I would argue under the prospects of sequestration that are pushing some of the larger
orders. I believe anything over $0.5 billion has to go to him for approval before it's authorized. So not knowing exactly
how sequestration would be manifested in terms of what I like to call the peanut butter spread versus a targeted spread,
it's hard for me to say how those orders would be impacted, whether they'd be pushed to the right or reduced. And at
this point – I'd frankly be speculating at this point other than to say IS&GS would likely get hit the largest percent,
would be my guess. And the longer-cycle businesses would be hit less severely than IS&GS.

<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: I would just add to that. On the sequestration front, I mean, that's why we have been so
vocal about what a terrible policy that is to have sequestration come into place and why we're encouraged that our
government and Congress is trying to get to a permanent elimination of those across-the-board cuts. Because the fact is
if they're going to take any cuts, and they can do it along the lines of the national security strategy and do it in the areas
that align better with what our administration and our Department of Defense is trying to accomplish, that's the best
outcome. And for us, as we look at it, I mean, I think we have a great portfolio that's aligned with those strategic
priorities of the U.S. government and of our Defense Department. So if we get through sequestration and it doesn't
happen and allows our Defense Department to decide where they take cuts, we think we're actually very well
positioned.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Good afternoon.
<A - Jerry F. Kircher>: Hi, David.
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Hi, David.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Marillyn, a question for you. You guys have gone after your cost structure very aggressively,
best I can tell, both from a square footage perspective and head count, despite the fact that the budget hasn't come down
that much yet and your top line has held up pretty well. How much more room do you have to address head count and
square footage and just your cost structure in its entirety, maybe disproportionately what happens to the budget from
here?
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Well, I tell you, we're a large corporation, and we have – I think we still have more
opportunity, particularly on the footprint side. As we laid out a plan to take cost out, we put it in more aggressively
about three years ago, and so we've been about this proactive approach to taking out cost in our infrastructure and our
processes for a number of years. As you mentioned, we have had some reductions in force, we've taken out some
management layers, we've been collapsing some organizations in order to get some cost out in that regard.
And on the footprint side, we've taken about 1.9 million square feet for the last couple of years, and we are going to
take another 2.9 million between now and the end of 2014. So there is more to go there. I believe there's also
opportunities for us just to continue on an ongoing basis to drive cost out so that we can meet the demands of our
customers. We've been getting out of leased space, for example. We'll continue to look at even providing more
affordable products to our customers, taking weight out, looking at how we can reduce cycle time, all of those things
that would give them a more affordable product as well. So we'll continue to do that. That is something we set targets
on every year to drive costs out of our business, and we want to continue to do that to remain competitive and win more
business.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good afternoon. Bruce, I was wondering if you could walk a little bit through the cash in
2013, just as you get from cash flow from operations of about $1.6 billion to over $4 billion. We know pension is
certainly less of a headwind, but what else is improving? Taxes, interest, advances, working capital – what else are the
drivers there?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Okay, let me see if I can do that off the top of my head, Sam. So $4 billion, as you said, in
2013 versus the $1.6 billion level. The biggest driver, obviously, is the $2.5 billion pension contribution – $3.6 billion,
I guess I should say, versus the $1.5 billion in 2013. We're actually expecting a slight increase in our working capital.

That's something – I'll speak for myself personally – that I've got targeted to try to minimize that amount of working
capital growth. I think some of that might be a little bit of planning conservatism. We tend to plan even, say, some of
our international orders maybe a little bit lighter relative to payment terms than we actually are able to negotiate. That
ends up manifesting itself in the form of higher working capital than maybe what we actually experience. So that's one
I'll be watching.
Income taxes – I'm trying to think what we're planning on income taxes. Let's see. We're actually down, I believe. I
think we're down probably like – well actually [indiscernible] (1:10:30) paying out relative to taxes is fairly close from
what we're booking, and within our earnings, it's down probably about $150-ish million or so. So as you do sort of a
cash walk-down, you see the $150 million from an earnings perspective flowing down to cash. That's probably the
biggest drivers that I'm looking at next year. A little bit of change in depreciation and amortization, but not enough to
talk about, so really just sort of the working capital and slight change in the taxes there.

Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Hi. Good afternoon, Bruce and Jerry, and welcome to the earnings call process, Marillyn.
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Thank you.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Marillyn, I wanted to ask you sort of a follow-up to the question on cost cutting, but a little bit
bigger picture and longer term. One of the big concerns that we still hear from investors on defense companies is with
regard to the sustainability of margins and whether or not there's a shoe to drop there. And in historical cycles, you've
seen margins come down pretty significantly. Lockheed Martin's been able to kind of hum along at this 11.5% segment
operating margin right through everything we've seen thus far. How do you think about where margins go and how
sustainable they are? Is there risk, in your view, that the part of the backlog with more favorable in terms of trade
sunsets and more difficult backlog layers in? Just curious how you think about that given your many experiences
operating the business. And then one quick one for Bruce: Have you done the math on the 2014 FAS/CAS number with
the hypothetical that nothing changes in 2014 versus 2013?
<A - Marillyn A. Hewson>: Thanks for the question. I'll just kick off with the margins. As you looked at our portfolio,
we have a lot of mature products that we have moved down the production lines, things that have been developed and
moved into production, and we're in a position where we can drive higher margins through the process of booking
higher profit rates on those programs moving forward. And then, as I said, we're growing our international sales
component, and through that process, because of the risk-return relationships there on international sales, then we
expect to get higher margins on that.
But a lot of the portfolio, it is transitioning. If you think about where F-35 is, it's still in development, but concurrent to
that, we're moving into production. And with that production over time, and with the volume that we're going to bring
along in a fixed-price incentive environment and then fixed-price environment, that's going allow us to improve our
margins. LCS, with our LCS program, moving along as it ramps up with additional ships coming online, that will allow
us to improve margins. THAAD, a lot of our missile programs are well along in production. So there's fewer
development programs in place. C-5M is coming along strongly, and then typically in our international area, as I've
said, we see higher margins. And I think – Bruce, do you want to take the other part of his question?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yeah. If I remember right, it was have you done the math, I think you said, of FAS/CAS in
2014 under the current assumptions? And we have done that math. Actually, we've done it for 2015 too; I'll give you a
bonus question there. So as we look at 2014, we're probably seeing current course and speed, somewhere about a
$350-ish million improvement over the $485 million we have today. I think the more interesting one, at least as I look
at the 2013, 2014, and 2015, think of the various – the change, I should say, the change in the FAS/CAS between 2013
and 2015 is $1 billion. So we – think of the 2015 number as just about on the opposite end of the zero bar going the
other way. So really, really dramatic swing in FAS/CAS with current assumptions. And, obviously, if the discount rate

Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Bill Loomis from Stifel Nicolaus.
<Q - Bill R. Loomis>: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Bruce, just when you talked about the first quarter being
$1 billion lower, I just want to be clear that that was versus the year ago. And then you talked about lower deliveries in
Aeronautics, but obviously with that group being $3.7 billion in the first quarter 2012, that would be a pretty significant
percentage drop. So is the bulk of it going to be there? And if not, which of the other groups and why do you see that
coming back, if it is coming from the other groups as well?
<A - Bruce L. Tanner>: Yes. So, Bill, you heard rightly, the $1 billion I was talking about was comparing first quarter
of 2013 versus first quarter of 2012. I gave in my prepared remarks the aircraft quantity changes, so very, very
significant within Aeronautics. And the reason we feel good about it turning back the other way is because those
aircraft are higher on a comparative basis to the previous quarter and the next three quarters.
Just as I look at the data, at least as I sit here today, part of the way I would look at sales going forward – again, I
mentioned earlier sequential growth quarter over quarter. So think of the – it's obviously lower, I believe, every single
quarter versus 2012, but it gets lower than 2012 by a smaller percent with each successive quarter. Said differently,
fourth quarter 2013 is not nearly as far off of fourth quarter of 2012 as are the first three quarters of 2013 versus the
first three quarters of 2012.
And the other thing I looked at is we – and maybe it's self-evident in what I just said, but the second half of the year
from a revenue perspective is about $1 billion, for that six months, greater than the first half of the year. So we're
definitely at a level – back-end loaded, in large part because of the aircraft quantities we have there, but just some of
the other shifts within the other business areas as well, forcing it into second half.
Marillyn A. Hewson
So I want to just wrap up here and tell you all thank you for joining us on the call today. And we look forward to
