MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the Gilead Sciences second quarter 2013 earnings
conference call. My name is Phil and I'll be your conference operator today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to
turn the call over to Patrick O'Brien, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Patrick O'Brien
Thank you, Phil. Good afternoon, everyone.
We issued a press release this afternoon providing earnings results for the second quarter which is available on our
website where you can also find detailed slides that support today's call. For our prepared remarks and Q&A, I am
joined by your Chairman and Executive Officer, John Martin; our President and Chief Operating Officer, John
Milligan; our Executive Vice President of Research and Development, Norbert Bischofberger; our Executive Vice
President of Commercial Operations, Kevin Young; and our Chief Financial Officer, Robin Washington.

Before we begin with our formal remarks, we want to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements
including plans and expectation with respect to our product candidates and financial projections, all of which involve
certain assumptions, risks and uncertainties that are beyond our control and could cause our actual results to differ
materially from these statements. A description of these risks can be found our latest SEC disclosure documents and
recent press releases.
In addition, Gilead does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements made during this call.
We will also be using non-GAAP financial measures to help you understand our underlying business performance. The
GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations are provided in our press release as well as on our website.
I will now turn the call over to Robin Washington.
Robin L. Washington
Thank you, Patrick, and thank you all for joining us.
We are very pleased with our strong operating results for the second quarter, delivering product sales of $2.7 billion, an
increase of 14% year-over-year and 11% sequentially, and non-GAAP EPS are $0.50 per share. The U.S. contributed
$1.6 billion to product sales, up 20% year-over-year driven by strong underlying demand across all therapeutic areas
including the continued up-take of Complera and Stribild where combined sales grew 11% over the previous quarter.
The launch of Stribild continues to go well. Strong prescription demand was partially offset by a reduction in
wholesaler inventory levels as Stribild was added to our existing inventory management agreements during the second
quarter.
Atripla, Complera and Stribild were the number one, two and three most-prescribed HIV regimens for treatment-naive
patients in the U.S. Overall, major wholesaler inventory levels remained consistent quarter-over-quarter, while
sub-wholesaler inventories rebounded after a draw-down in the first quarter.
ADAP purchasing was robust in the second quarter, and we are encouraged by the recent communication to states of
their remaining funding allocations for the 2013 ADAP fiscal year. However we anticipate a moderating of ADAP
purchasing during the second half of 2013, given sequestration and strong purchasing during the first half of the year.
Turning to Europe, we executed solidly with product sales of $818 million, up 7% year-over-year excluding the effects
of FX, driven by increased demand and purchasing in advance of the summer holidays. One quarter following the
launch in all Big 5 E.U. markets Eviplera up-take continues to expand and is now the second-most prescribed regimen
for treat-naive patients.
On May 28 the European Commission approved Stribild and we were able to launch in the U.K. and Germany in the
following weeks.
Turning briefly to operating expenses, our combined R&D and SG&A spending were up approximately $70 million
quarter-over-quarter. R&D spending in the first half of the year was driven predominantly by progression of clinical
development activities in liver disease and oncology. We anticipate this level of spending to continue in the second half
of the year. Additionally, we expect a ramp in SG&A expenses in the second half of the year as we prepare for the
anticipated commercial launch of sofosbuvir.
Finally, we are reiterating full year guidance of 2013 as we remain confident in our core business and ability to
continue to execute.
I will now turn the call over to Norbert.

Thank you, Robin.
I am pleased with the rapid progress across all of our R&D programs and the high level of productivity. A large number
of clinical – of development candidates are now being advanced from R&D through Phase I, II and III clinical
development.
First a quick update on HIV. The two Phase III studies evaluating TAF, Gilead's novel [indiscernible] (5:10) tenofovir,
are approximately 50% enrolled. These two studies are identical in design, evaluating Stribild to a single tablet regimen
of elvitegravir, cobi, emtricitabine and TAF in treatment of naïve HIV infected patients. We expect to complete
enrollment of these two studies by the end of this year.
In our cardiovascular clinical development program, a number of data sets from various Phase III clinical trials will
mature over the next 12 months including three studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of ranolazine in type 2
diabetes. A study evaluating the use of ranolazine to decrease the rate of revascularization and hospital readmission
following percutaneous coronary intervention and the AMBITION study, which evaluates the utility of up-front
combination therapy for PAH, with Letairis and Tadalafil compared to monotherapy with Letairis or Tadalafil alone.
We look forward to sharing this data with you as they become available.
I will focus my remaining remarks on our hematology and hepatitis C development activities, starting with hepatitis C.
New drug applications for sofosbuvir have now been filed in the United States, Canada, the European Union,
Switzerland, Turkey and Australia. We received notification from U.S. FDA that the sofosbuvir application has been
assigned priority review with a PDUFA date of December 8. More recently we were also informed that sofosbuvir will
be discussed at the Antiviral Drugs Advisory Committee meeting scheduled for October 25.
Following approximately one year behind the sofosbuvir single agent is the sofosbuvir/ledipasvir fixed dose
combination, which was granted breakthrough designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Phase II results
from the LONESTAR study reported at a press release on May 2, 2013 showed that the fixed dose combination
resulted in 100% and 95% SVRs when used for eight weeks with and without ribavirin respectively. And it resulted in
95% cure rates when dosed for 12 weeks in difficult to treat previous protease inhibitor failure patients, half of whom
had cirrhosis.
The three pivotal studies that will support the marketing authorization applications of the fixed-dose combinations in
Genotype 1 patients, ION-1, ION-2 and ION-3 are now fully enrolled. As a reminder, both ION-1 and ION-2 are
identical in design with four arms comparing 24 weeks of the fixed dose combination two 12 weeks each with and
without ribavirin. ION-1 is conducted in treatment naïve patients and ION-2 in treatment experienced patients. ION-3
is a three arm study in treatment naïve patients comparing 12 weeks of the fixed dose combination to 8 weeks of the
fixed dose combination with and without ribavirin.
The primary efficacy end point in these three studies is SVR12 and the results from ION-2 and ION-3 should be
available in the fourth quarter of this year. The SVR12 data from ION-1 is expected to become available in the first
quarter of 2014 and thus, we are on track to file for regulatory approvals in the second quarter of 2014.
At the last earnings call we provided an update on our Japan sofosbuvir development strategy for genotype 2 patients,
which represent about 25% of the HCV-infected patients in Japan. This registrational program entails a single arm,
12-week interferon-free study of sofosbuvir in combination with ribavirin, and the first patient in this study was dosed
just last week.
We now also have agreement with the Japanese regulatory authority on a strategy in Genotype 1 patients. The pivotal
study would be the two-arm study of the fixed-dose combination with and without ribavirin for 12 weeks, and we plan
to enroll the first patient in this study in the fourth quarter of this year.
We have also recently established our Japan office in Tokyo. Gilead Sciences K.K. would be led by our
newly-appointed president, Mr. Yuji Orihara. Yuji has over 30 years' experience in the Japanese pharmaceutical
industry, previously holding general management positions at Amgen and Teva. We anticipate adding additional staff
over the coming months, especially in the critical development area, as we execute the Phase III studies.

GS-5816, our pan-genotypic NS5A inhibitor is advancing in two Phase II studies. One study evaluates 12 weeks of
treatment of GS-5816 and sofosbuvir in genotype 1 through genotype 6 treatment-naïve patients, and the other study
evaluates 12 weeks of treatment of GS-5816 and sofosbuvir with and without ribavirin in genotype 3
treatment-experienced patients, of whom 50% have cirrhosis. Initial data from these two Phase II studies are anticipated
later this year, and based on those results we will make a decision about moving the fixed-dose combination of
GS-5816 and sofosbuvir into Phase III clinical development.
AASLD will be held on November 1 through 5 in Washington D.C. Close to 60 abstracts were submitted to this
meeting by Gilead or Gilead collaborators. The titles of the abstracts will be published in a few weeks from now on the
AASLD website. These submissions cover clinical, virology, pharmacodynamic, pharmacoeconomic and health
outcomes of sofosbuvir. The sofosbuvir and ledipasvir fixed-dose combination, and GS-5816 as well as updates on
Viread and TAF for hepatitis B. In particular, abstracts of the safety and efficacy of sofosbuvir and ribavirin in pre-liver
transplant, post-liver transplant and HIV co-infected patients are included.
Turning now to oncology, a number of presentations and posters at ASCO further defined the profile of idelalisib in B
cell malignancies. One presentation which was highlighted at an ASCO press briefing, described the efficacy and safety
of idelalisib monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory CLL. In this study, treatment with idelalisib resulted in
deep and durable lymph node responses with a median progression free survival of 17.1 months.
Another presentation was on the combination use of idelalisib and rituximab in elderly treatment naïve CLL, SLL
patients. In this study, the overall response rate was 97%, and the Kaplan-Meier estimate of progression free survival at
24 months was 93%. Importantly, patients with the 17p deletion and those with TP53 mutation all responded. In both
studies Grade 3 or higher treatment emergent adverse events or laboratory abnormalities were diarrhea, pneumonia,
transaminase elevations and neutropenia.
At the International Conference for Malignant Lymphoma meeting in Lugano last month, the results from Study
101-09 in 125 Indolent NHL patients were presented. The patients in this study represent a significant unmet need with
few, if any, treatment options. They were doubly refractory to both rituximab and an alkylating agent. The median
number of prior therapies was 4 and the majority of patients were refractory to the standard regimens and to the last
therapeutic regimen.
Treatment with idelalisib resulted in an overall response rate of 54%, a median duration of response of 11.9 months and
a progression free survival of 11.4 months. Responses of broadly similar magnitude were seen across all subgroups
including follicular lymphoma, small lymphocytic lymphoma, Waldenström macroglobulinemia and marginal zone
lymphoma. The main toxicities were diarrhea and transaminase elevations.
Five Phase III studies of idelalisib in indolent NHL and CLL and are ongoing. One of these studies, study 116
comparing rituximab plus idelalisib to rituximab plus placebo in relapsed CLL is now close to screening. It will be fully
enrolled in August and an event-driven interim analysis is anticipated to be conducted in the fourth quarter of this year.
Based on the very encouraging Phase II data in CLL and indolent NHL, particularly study 101-09 in doubly-refractory
indolent NHL patients, discussions have been initiated with US FDA and a number of European regulatory agencies.
As a result of the feedback received, we intend to file marketing authorization applications for idelalisib as a treatment
for indolent NHL in both the US and European Union in the fourth quarter of 2013. The outcome of the interim
analysis of study 116 will guide our strategy for pursuing near-term filing for CLL also.
In addition to the clinical studies evaluating idelalisib in indolent NHL and CLL, GS-9973, a specific inhibitor of SYK
is being studied for safety and efficacy in patients with relapsed or refractory B cell malignancies by itself, and in
combination with idelalisib. GS-9820, a backup PI3K delta inhibitor, is in Phase I testing in B cell malignancies and
our recently acquired JAK 1/2 inhibitor, momelotinib, has been successfully reformulated and we are currently in
discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the specifics of the myelofibrosis Phase III program.
In summary, as we move into the second half of the year, we're delighted with the progress on all fronts across Gilead.
Our key development programs are making significant progress, marketing authorization application for sofosbuvir has

In addition, we're planning on two additional NDA, MAA filings over the next ten months. One on idelalisib for
indolent NHL in the fourth quarter of this year, and one on sofosbuvir/ledipasvir fixed-dose combination in the second
quarter of next year.
We will now open the call to questions. Operator?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Geoff Meacham from JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<Q - Geoff C. Meacham>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Related on the Japan agreement, does the
agreement for hep C speak to the review speed, or the pace of reimbursement? Then related to that, I notice you guys
are doing a similar study in India. So just checking to see what other regions you expect to do, if you expect other
regions to have a country-specific study. Thanks.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: Yes, so Geoff, your first question has to do with whether the agreement has
anything to do with the review times. Was that the question? The answer is no. We simply got agreement on a Phase III
strategy, as I said the Phase III strategy Genotype 1 is a single arm study of 12 weeks duration, sofosbuvir ribavirin
agreement on Genotype 1, and a two-arm study of the fixed-dose combination both with and without ribavirin for 12
weeks.
We're looking at a number of other geographies that require clinical studies. One of which we are actively enrolling,
that's Russia and the other country we're looking at is China. So those are the only two. In China we have not made the
final decision as to what to do, and, Kevin, you had a question about reimbursements in Japan.
<A - Kevin Young>: Geoff, right now any of the time lines don't include any reference to what we do from a
reimbursement point of view. So all of Norbert's comments were relating to very healthy and positive discussions we've
had with PMDA, and we're now starting to build out our own organization in Japan. Our intention would be to launch
sofosbuvir as Gilead with our own team and not requiring a partnership there.
<Q - Geoff C. Meacham>: Gotcha. Okay, thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Mark Schoenebaum from ISI Group. Please proceed.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe I'll ask Kevin a question I've asked
before if I might, and that is how many patients, and I haven't been able to get an answer yet, which is why I'm
re-asking it. But how much patients in the U.S. and Europe do you estimate, hep C patients, excuse me, are under the
active care of a hepatitis C specialist right now?
And then if I could just ask – if you won't answer that, perhaps I could get comments from Robin or John on your
perspective on use of cash right now. I know your balance sheet continues to improve, post Pharmasset deal, there's a
lot of movement in press reports in the biotech landscape right now on M&A. I think it would be a nice time to get your
updated thoughts on how Gilead plans to use its cash and your view on larger deals. Thank you.
<A - Kevin Young>: Hey, Mark, Kevin. Yeah. We're still essentially fine tuning the number that you're looking for.
We're building a sort of an Ipsos-like HIV database. It's based on a much smaller number of charts than we normally
get per quarter relative to HIV. But we think once we've seen a couple of quarters and it looks solid and it looks
reproducible that we'll be able to share that number.

So I think we're getting there, but we want to have something that is not chopping and changing every quarter. There
wasn't a database there. Don't forget that it's taken us 10 years really to get something as good as what we've got in
HIV. So we wanted to start this in the right way and try to give you a solid number that is going to have credibility. So
later in the year I think and round about the launch of the product I think we'll be able to say that with some conviction.
<A - Robin L. Washington>: Okay. And, Mark, I'll go ahead and answer your second question. As you saw we
reported we're very close on a rounded basis to our 1.5 debt to EBITDA ratio. So as a result of that we will be resuming
during the second half of 2013 our share repurchase program, again focused primarily on dilution. I think regarding our
overall capital strategy, there's really been no change to that. We talked about focusing on debt. We'll continue to invest
in our pipeline, and we'll be selective relative to licensing and M&A opportunities focused on Phase II, Phase III assets
as appropriate. And as mentioned, we'll be returning cash back to shareholders via share buy backs at this point in time.
<Q - Mark J. Schoenebaum>: Thanks for letting me slip in two.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Geoff Porges from Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.
<Q - Geoffrey Porges>: Thanks very much for taking the question. And I suppose I inevitably have to ask have you
seen any LFT elevations in any of the patient experiences with sofosbuvir, given what's happened with what might
have been your looming competitor? And then presuming that the answer to that is no, could I just get a comment on
the – Norbert, what's the real role of 5816 given how quickly and broadly you're going with ledipasvir? Thanks.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: Yeah. Hi, Geoff. I can't say that we have not seen any LFT elevations because as
you know they are part of the hepatitis C disease, but what I can say is that there's no evidence right now that we are
seeing anything that's related to either sofosbuvir or the sofosbuvir/ledipasvir fixed dose combination that could be
ascribed to either an adverse event or a laboratory abnormality.
The second question has 5816, yeah. So, Geoff, we are currently, as you might know, doing this study of the fixed dose
combination that contains 5885 in genotype 3 patients. And we don't really know whether 5885 will not work in
genotype 3, but based on the virology that we have looked at I would expect it should not be optimal. So at the least,
the 5816 compound will be a fixed-dose combination non-ribavirin containing for genotype 3. But our intent is to really
launch it more broadly as just a fixed dose combination for anybody or everybody regardless of genotype.
I'm sure you also know that genotype assay is fairly straightforward to come by, but it's an extra test that, if I remember
correctly, costs $400. So if could get rid of that and simply say you don't have to really worry about which genotype
you are, we have one combination that works for all genotypes, that will be our strategy. And that's what we're going to
do if the Phase II data looks supportive of that.
<Q - Geoffrey Porges>: Thank you very much, Norbert.
Operator
Your next question comes from Mathew Roden from UBS Securities. Please proceed.
<Q - Matthew Roden>: Thanks a lot for taking the question. Congrats on all the recent progress, especially the early
filing in NHL and CLL. The question here, I think maybe it's for Kevin. Last month, the U.S. Preventive Services Task
Force took a more positive stance on screening in hep C with a grade of B in all patients in the birth cohort. Obviously
that's a positive step but the analysis is still based on the current triple therapy standard of care. So is it reasonable to
expect that once the next waves of products come out in hep C that, that analysis will be revisited and improved up to
an A? And if so can you maybe draw on any of your inferences from your experience in HIV as to what the
implications could be in terms of finding the patient's diagnosis rates and over what timeframe would you expect it to
manifest? Thanks.

<A - Kevin Young>: That's a great question, Mat. Thank you very much. I have absolutely no doubt that as our new
treatments come through that we're going to see more and more calls for screening of HCV and treatments of HCV.
Very interesting this week in another part of the world in Germany, we saw one of their leading opinion leaders on
national news talking about how much hepatitis C there was in Germany and the need to be screening patients and
treating, particularly in that baby boomer age bracket. Actually, I think we did quite well to move from the original C
category to B. So I have to say, Matt, I don't think we have an expectation it's going to be raised to an A in the
immediate future.
The good news was I think a lot of opinion leaders mounted a challenge and lobbied that it should go from the C to the
B. We've had some recent advisory boards in this area, and I think they were strongly of the opinion that the hepatitis C
test should get reimbursed, and that's why a B category helps that. So I've no doubt that as we bring sofosbuvir and
eventually all-oral to the market that there is going to be a drive to be screening the older population and potentially
treating hepatitis C.
<Q - Matthew Roden>: Would it be a reach to infer anything from your experience in HIV in terms of the extent to
which this can help capture or identify patients and over what timeframe?
<A - Kevin Young>: I think it tends with a longer timeframe. I think we've done well in hepatitis C, but it's a
progressive, sorry HIV, but it's a progressive thing, Mat. These things all help and they all build up. Obviously we've
got to go and be talking to the payers; we've got to be talking to perhaps some of the companies that are supplying the
hepatitis C tests. It's work that we have good experience from HIV, and I think we'll be launching into that in and
around the launch of sofosbuvir.
<Q - Matthew Roden>: Thanks very much. Congrats.
<A - Kevin Young>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Rachel L. McMinn>: Yeah. Thanks. I wanted to ask about oncology, and you highlighted you're going to be
filing for idelalisib and maybe even in CLL after the initial NHL filing. How do you view the big picture competitive
landscape with ibrutinib filed before you? Obviously, there's very strong clinical data out there. Do you think you need
to have positive SYK combo data for this franchise to really take off, or do you think idelalisib on its own can be
competitive? Thank you.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: Yes, Rachel, I'm actually a little bit surprised that the public doesn't seem to be
appreciating the data that we have on idelalisib as much as they should. So first of all, let me say something about
ibrutinib. It's a very good drug and they have excellent data in mantle cell. But if I look at the data in CLL, the NEJM
paper that was just published, it's not too different from what we get in CLL from the study that Jennifer Brown
presented at ASCO.
And the other thing, let me just point something else out, the other study that Susan O'Brien presented at ASCO, so the
up-front treatment in naïve and elderly with 97% response rate, and a progression free survival estimated at 24 weeks
of 93%. Let me just make a comparison. GA101, which as you know, there was a press release yesterday by Roche,
very nice input efficacy over rituximab, but if you look at their study was GA101 with chlorambucil, ours was
rituximab plus idelalisib. They had a progression free survival – median progression free survival of 23 months. So at
23 months half of the patients had progressed. In our study at 24 months, 93 had not progressed, 93%.
So I think – and in addition, we have now – this is a non-chemotherapy, non-alkylating therapy. This is, I think, huge
progress and I think there's going to be a big role for this compound in the CLL market, even in the treatment naïve
patients. That has to wait, of course, until we have done the Phase III studies. The initial indication will be for relapsed
refractory.

You know, the other – let me make another comment, if I may. The other thing, I don't think in the disease like CLL or
NHL you can look at market share, because patients will live longer and longer with more therapies coming along, and
I think over time the model should more be that all of them will circle through most of the drugs. So it's not so much a
question of a fixed view of, "This is the percent market share," but more as people live longer, that more and more of
these drugs will be used. That's what happened in multiple myeloma, as you know. The survival was two years and
now it's more like ten years and so more and more patients circled through the drugs. So I am sorry for my long-winded
answer, but I had to say this.
<A - Kevin Young>: Rachel, just to say, we are going to be very committed commercially to this launch. We will
build a business unit for oncology. We already have a very nice group of people here at Gilead who have got good
experience in sales and marketing for oncology. We are now running our analysis on the right size of field force. We
want to be ready obviously by the middle of next year. That's about the right time line based on the fourth quarter NHL
submission, and we see this as a strong, long-term commitment to the world of oncology.
<Q - Rachel L. McMinn>: Great. Thank you so much.

Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Werber from Citi. Please proceed.
<Q - Yaron B. Werber>: Yes. Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question. I appreciate it. So if you don't mind, I just
wanted to kind of sneak in a couple of questions. One, both hep C sort of related. One, Norbert, help us understand a
little bit the – increasingly there's a correlation that SVR4 is correlated with SVR12. Is there any chance you can sort of
start a rolling NDA based on SVR4 and maybe file at some point in Q1?
And then, Kevin, a question for you: about a third of the hep C patients are sitting in potentially some kind of a prison.
There's not really good reimbursement right now for those patients. Is there anything that Gilead can to do to help
access these patients?
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: I want to take the first question. I think that thought I don't even want to entertain
because I think the FDA gave the world a big gift when they said, you can file with SVR12s instead of SVR24. That
was a big step forward.
And remember the other thing is that you can't necessarily conclude from one drug to the other. So if you see – if we
see a high correlation of SVR4 with SVR12 with sofosbuvir ribavirin or sofosbuvir, peginterferon, ribavirin you can't
necessarily conclude from that, that the same correlation would hold with our fixed dose combination.
So our regulatory end point is SVR12. That's what we are working towards and we have not even had any
conversations with any regulatory agent who's potentially filing with SVR4. So I think that would be ask for too much.
<A - Kevin Young>: Hey, Yaron, it's Kevin. We've had a lot of conversations advisory boards with payers and
providers, private Medicaid, Medicare, VA, corrections. So we've gone across the board from the point of view of the
opportunities and the need for sofosbuvir. Certainly in the correctional setting, long-term interferon is very, very
difficult just because of the people with multiple other comorbidities and psychological problems. And obviously,
transition potentially from the correctional setting back into society.
So we've had productive discussions. I think we're going to see some uptake. However, I do think it's going to be a little
bit slower. Then obviously we'll see a very healthy uptake we believe in the private commercial market and the other
target really for us, which is the VA setting.
So I think in terms of prioritization we're looking at the opportunity to really run programs with the VA as a higher
priority than the correctional setting. But we have a correctional team. It's something that we're going to be working on.
We've had success with HIV, and it's certainly in our plans.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams from Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.
<Q - Brian C. Abrahams>: Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. I was wondering if you could give us a
little bit more granularity on the idelalisib regulatory discussions in terms of how the views on the bar for a potential
filing and approval on Phase II data may differ if at all between the U.S. and Europe? What kind of initial label you
plan to seek, and then what your feedback's been from clinicians since the delta data were reported in terms of how
they're expecting to use the drug initially? Thanks.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: Yeah. So, Brian, the discussions were actually – so we talked to four European
regulatory agencies and the US FDA and actually to my surprise the feedback was very uniform. All the agencies said
absolutely you have enough data to file for the iNHL indication and the label there would almost certainly read – would
represent the study population, which is doubly refractory to both rituximab and an alkylating agent.
The discussions that we had were – opinions were divided a little bit on CLL. And the challenge there had to do, Brian,
that the study that Susan O'Brien presented at ASCO, the end was 64 but this was also a dose. It was a number of
different doses, and so at the dose, which we're seeking to register, which is 150 milligram BID we actually only had
11 patients on that experience. And just like FDA they felt 11 patients is really not enough, and I have to in a way agree
with them.
But again, the discussion then became – moved to study 116. That's what I said today. There would be an interim
analysis done. That certainly has enough patients, and if that interim analysis turns out positive, then we would use
those data either to file a new NDA in the U.S. or to update the file during the review in Europe. That's the current plan.
And Kevin, was there another question?
<A - Patrick O'Brien>: I think that answered your questions, right Brian?
<Q - Brian C. Abrahams>: Yes. Thanks very much.

Your next question comes from Michael Yee from RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Michael J. Yee>: Hey. Thanks. Okay, sure. Just a philosophical question on how we're thinking about the
commercial launch of 7977 which is obviously somewhat around the corner. You know, a lot of people are looking at
what Vertex and Merck did in their opening quarters, and it was like $500 million combined, or so, per quarter which is
a pretty big annual run rate. Presumably you would do at least that and there's a difference in price and certainly you
have a different efficacy and safety profile. How should we be thinking about that relative to what the competitors were
doing a couple years ago? Is there something that we should be thinking about both positively or negatively there?
<A - Kevin Young>: I think you can take some insights and some kind of proxies from the launch of the protease
inhibitors, but other things you can't. Let's not forget that there was quite a lot of pent-up demand for the PIs, whatever
their profile has turned out to be. There was a lot of pent-up demand over the years until they came out.
You know, clearly I think physicians have, you know, been under-whelmed and have had the challenges with the
protease inhibitors. If you look at the now, sort of annualized treatment rates, it's coming down and we expect it to be
back at the pre-protease inhibitor levels for the launch of sofosbuvir, but there's likely to be some patients waiting. But
it probably isn't at the levels that were waiting at the time of the protease inhibitors because there hasn't been that
cumulative number of years.
Having said that, we have a very, very exciting profile and our expectation is that, over a two to three-year timeframe
that the levels of treatment can go back to, if not exceed, the levels in the heyday of the pegylated interferons which
was a treatment rate of approximately 150,000 patients per year. So I certainly think we can get back to those type of

comparisons with the protease inhibitors.

Your next question comes from Robyn Karnauskas from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Hi, guys. For a while I thought I was Michael Yee for a moment. But, a quick question on
the panel. So what do you think we should really be thinking about as far as the discussion points for the panel? What
do you think the key issues will be that the FDA will ask the panel to vet? Then I just want to make sure, I may have
missed this. What is triggering an interim for 116? At what point would you have the interim analysis? Thanks.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: So Robyn, I'll answer the second question first, because it's very straight-forward.
It's event-driven. As you know, the end point is PFS and once we have the requisite number of either progressions or
deaths, we will do an interim analysis and then look at where the – is it on the placebo arm or on the idelalisib arm, and
if there's a highly statistically significant P-value, then the protocol would call for stopping the study, because we've
answered the question. By the way, this is not dissimilar to what was disclosed yesterday with by Roche with the
GA101 program.
And then the other question you asked is good one, because we had the same question internally. You know, the only
thing I could think of, the unanswered question in the NDA submission was really, what's the optimal treatment for
genotype 3. As you know, we had done this study with 12 and 16-week duration. 12-week was okay. 16-week was
better and so the question becomes, will 24 be even better than 16? Obviously we don't have data in the NDA. The
other question also would genotype 3 be easier treated with the neutrino regimen, which is 12 weeks of pegylated
interferon, ribavirin with sofosbuvir.
And actually, the FDA asked us to answer this question and to do a randomized study, so we're initiating a study, we're
randomizing patients to either sofosbuvir 16 weeks or sofosbuvir, riba – sofosbuvir, ribavirin for 16, sofosbuvir,
ribavirin 24 and sofosbuvir, peginterferon, ribavirin 12. That will answer the question. But again, the panel will have
the challenge of dealing with the existing data that were submitted and make a recommendation as to what should show
up in the label. I think, that is the only thing I can think of that is substantive.
<Q - Robyn Karnauskas>: Great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed.
<Q - M. Ian Somaiya>: Thank you. Just wanted to follow-up on Brian's question on the regulatory sort of view on
Phase II approvals. Would your approval in NHL and potentially Pharmacyclics' approval for ibrutinib in CLL, would
that preclude another company from coming in and filing and potentially getting approval on Phase II data on either of
these indications? Was that even a consideration?
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: Ian, I'm trying to understand what you're getting at. Because no one, and if another
company has another agent that shows efficacy in some unmet need population, I don't think it would preclude them
from getting approval.
<Q - M. Ian Somaiya>: Yeah. No. I guess the question is more specific to a similar patient population. If another
company were to come in and file for the same patient population that you're seeking approval, different drug,
potentially slightly different data, and would the regulatory body be accepting of that application or willing to review
it?

<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: You know, it cannot, the devil is in the detail, Ian. But I would on the one hand, say
yes. On the other hand since there are new agents now going to be available maybe if everything works out, ibrutinib
and idelalisib, those are going to be players and you will probably have to show that those, that the patient population is
refractory to those as well. That's what I would think would happen.
<Q - M. Ian Somaiya>: Okay. And just if I can ask...
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: Ian, the population that we studied, the indolent NHL refractory to rituximab,
refractory to an alkylating agent, refractory to the last regimens, refractory to the most common regimens and they were
60, 40 years old on the average. There is really nothing left for them. I mean normally I would say bone marrow
transplantation but you don't do bone marrow transplantation. There's too much morbidity in that older population. So
there's really nothing, no available currently on the market. So that's the rationale for FDA to accept the file and review
the data and hopefully approve it.
<Q - M. Ian Somaiya>: Okay. And just a housekeeping question, Robin or Kevin, I don't know which one it is more
appropriate for. Just Stribild was a little bit light this quarter. I might have missed some of the early comments you
made related to it. Can you just tell us if there was a one-off event, or one-time event?
<A - Kevin Young>: Hey. This is Kevin. Thanks for the question. Basically, with a new product it tends to float
outside our inventory management agreements, our major wholesalers like to have enough supply. Never quite know
how a drug is being taken up. Same with Complera, as it was with Stribild. It will be the same with sofosbuvir. So
typically after about nine months, we agree that it's time for the drug to go in, within the inventory management
agreements because there is a clear trend and we're able to discuss that with the major wholesaler. And that's what's
happened. So there was a little burn-off of major wholesaler inventory and that's what clicked Stribild down.
I would say, Ian, that we're really pleased with the uptake of Stribild. If you look at some of the prescription volumes
quarter-over-quarter, Q2 grew by 52% over Q1. The actual dollars for Stribild were 50% higher than Complera, the
equivalent quarter post-launch. So we're pretty satisfied that the underlying trend for Stribild is very, very sound. So we
think things are going very well.

Your next question comes from Phil Nadeau from Cowen. Please proceed.
<Q - Phil M. Nadeau>: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Kevin, it's for you. You briefly mentioned
some of the work you're doing in advance of the sofosbuvir launch. Could you provide us more details what work
you're doing with insurance companies and physicians to prepare them for sofosbuvir today? And then also in regards
to the VA, what work are you doing there? That's a market that we've seen to be price sensitive in the past. Is there
some way that you can make them be less price sensitive and stick with sofosbuvir even if lower priced competitors are
launched after you? Thanks.
<A - Kevin Young>: Oh. Great questions, Phil. Let me try and just give you a little bit of color on where we are with
readiness. First thing I'll say, Phil, is that we've hired all our field-based teams. So that's our medical scientists, national
account managers and we've hired our new HCV sales team.
We've sized that team in a very robust way that's for today's treaters, for treaters that have dropped off but we believe
can come back to treat HCV and we've sized it for future HCV treaters. So we believe that we've got the sizing right.
That team of sales representatives are beginning sales training and that'll be a very rigorous and very intensive three
months of sales training.
Our medical scientists and our national account managers are actually currently involved in disease awareness
education and as I said earlier, we've been conducting quite a number of advisory boards across all our customer
segments: physician, nurse practitioner, managed care areas, the VA and corrections.

And the last thing before I talk a little bit about the payer – we have now settled on what will be our supply chain –
what wholesalers and what specialty pharmacies will be involved in the distribution and supply of sofosbuvir.
We've done a lot of work on the payer front. Clear insights that the payer was really quite dissatisfied and upset with
the introduction of the protease inhibitors. I don't think they were expecting the cost and certainly they were not
expecting the poor value in and around the inability for the patient to take the therapy or finish the course of therapy. T
he payer clearly is looking at efficacy as the number one criteria – the SVR rates, but really want products that are very
assured in terms of getting patients through therapy and curing patients, so around value. We certainly expect that the
current prior authorization to the label for HCV treatments will remain in place with sofosbuvir. The good news is that
the offices are very familiar the prior authorization step. They can easily do it via computer or via the phone, so we're
expecting that there will be very good payer coverage and that the profile of sofosbuvir certainly will get very good
support from a payer point of view.
In terms of the VA, we think sofosbuvir, whether it be for the GT-2 or the shorter duration of interferon for GT-1 will
be a nice profile for VA and as we're going in with that profile we think that will be very supportive of a healthy
pricing position. We obviously want to leave as much of the decision around using sofosbuvir in the hands of the
prescriber and on occasions that does require some discounting with selective payers but we'll be ready for that. So I'm
very positive about the possibilities of healthy uptake in the VA setting.
<Q - Phil M. Nadeau>: Great. Thanks for that color.
Operator
Your next question come from the line of Brian Skorney from Robert Baird. Please proceed.
<Q - Brian P. Skorney>: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on a really great quarter. I have two quick ones if I
can. I just want to – assuming that the PI3K SYK Phase 2 combo progresses, wondering if you can just give us an idea
of your general thoughts on how you view pivotal combination development? It strikes me that given the efficacy that
you see with idelalisib as a single agent it could be very difficult to show a benefit by the combination role on
something like PFF or OS when you add the SYK inhibitor particularly in earlier lines of therapy where you could
probably argue that's theoretically where this type of regimen could be most useful. Have you started thinking about
that or discussing with regulators what sort of flexibility they have around the Phase III trial designs or any idea what
we can think about in terms of a pivotal design for the combo?
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: Hi, Brian. No, so we have not had any conversations with regulators and obviously
really depends on what we're seeing in the Phase II studies. But given the SYC/PI3K combination, I don't know if
you're familiar with all the data in vitro, there's synergy, they've actually seen synergy in humans when you look at [ph]
the base of it activation assay (54:17), so it's a really promising combination, which is what you now see in Phase II,
what the combination shows, and based on that we will go into Phase III. But to give you some – one example, for
DLBCL for instance will be something where it seems like our compound, we don't have enough data yet to study it,
but idelalisib may not be completely satisfactory, and as you know, neither is ibrutinib, particularly in the larger
germinal center subset, in the ABC subset that seems to be working. So you know I'm sure there will be an immediate
place for a combination in one of these subsets of B-cell hematoma, hematological malignancies where the single
agents won't work. But again, that will all be guided by Phase II data.
<Q - Brian P. Skorney>: And Norbert, to jump quickly to hep C, as a follow-up to Geoff's question, I know you were
looking at 5885, 7977 in GT-3 patients and in an arm in ELECTRON, have you got data from that yet? You didn't
mention in response to his question about 5885...
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: Brian, those data will probably be at AASLD. I mean assuming the abstract gets
accepted. But to make a long story short, the numbers particularly in genotype 3 were too small to make any definitive
conclusions. And that's why we have now expanded or enrolled another cohort in genotype 3 that's 50 patients. So
those 50 patients will then really give us the answer whether the – the response rate, where the response rate is.

The thing with small numbers – so we had a total of eight genotype 3 patients and the confidence intervals will go
whatever result you get goes from perfect to miserable. So the answer is one of those or something in between. We can
only answer it if we have larger numbers. We should get those data towards – in the fourth quarter of this year.

[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from the line of Howard Liang from Leerink. Please proceed.
<Q - Howard Liang>: Thanks very much. Is your filing for idelalisib for Indolent NHL in the fourth quarter, would
that be for accelerated approval or full approval?
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: So Howard, that has been a debate and the answer is we don't know. You could
make an argument we should get full approval because you know there is no – it's a progression. There's an ORR and a
PFS endpoint and those are not surrogate endpoints so it shouldn't be accelerated approval, it should be full approved.
But that's obviously a review issue and ultimately an FDA decision.

Your next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.
<Q - Terence C. Flynn>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question; two for me, I was just wondering if you could update us
on plans for a TAF protease inhibitor combo and when we might hear about plans to go forward there? And then
anything on the arbitration front with Roche regarding 7977? Thanks a lot.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: Yeah. So Terence, the TAF/darunavir combination is still in Phase II. As you may
remember the response rates that you typically get with protease inhibitors are not as fast as they are with NNRTIs and
they're certainly not as fast as they are with integrase inhibitors, so if you look at [ph] the proportion onset takes (58:13)
over time at week 24, it's not the maximum yet so we really have to go to 48 weeks to ascertain what the real endpoint
is. And we should get those data sometime in the third quarter of this year. John, do you want to...
<A - John F. Milligan>: Yeah, Terence, John Milligan. So the question about the Roche arbitration, there's really
nothing to report. It's going along fairly much as scheduled and we really don't expect anything to happen this year as
we go through the process of discovery and getting, moving along in the process as defined in the contract. So there's
nothing new to report here today.

Your next question comes from the line of Joel Sendek from Stifel. Please proceed.
<Q - Joel D. Sendek>: Hi. Thanks a lot. I know it might be a little bit premature to ask this question but just when you
think about pricing, pretty much all your new drugs, whether it's sofosbuvir or idelalisib, is there any thought to maybe
thinking differently in pricing for cure as opposed to the traditional way of pricing just individually per patient?
Because as it becomes more difficult to get full reimbursement. Thanks.
<A - Kevin Young>: Hey Joel. It's Kevin. I think we look at it all ways. Obviously with something like for example
genotype 1 HCV, you've got – today you've got telaprevir and then you've got varying time periods for your peg, riba.
So you've got the individual PI, you've got the complete therapy and you've got cost per cure. So I think we look at it in
all of those different directions and we're going through all of those deliberations right now for sofosbuvir.

I think ultimately Joel, honestly I'm a bit of a traditionalist, and you can look at all of those ways and often companies
use sort of I would say elaborate ways of pricing because of challenges around the profile of a drug. I think ultimately,
you do come down to a WACC list price and I think that's where we'll be solidly, very clearly when we come to the
launch of sofosbuvir. So I think you will see a very clear and a very straightforward way of pricing sofosbuvir.
<A - Norbert W. Bischofberger>: Joel, I would like to add something. You know, ultimately, as we optimize these –
the treatment modality, particularly fixed dose combination of 5816 that comes behind it, price per cure and price per
treatment should actually be the same because each treatment equals a cure. As I said in the LONESTAR study in
difficult to treat PI failures, half of which were cirrhotic, we had 95% cure rate. So that's – ultimately, I hope it won't be
an issue.

Mr. O'Brien we have time for one more question coming from the line of Jason Kolbert from Maxim. Please proceed.
<Q - Jason H. Kolbert>: Thanks, guys. Just want to ask you the same type of question only about Japan and pricing.
What is the cost for the standard of care in Japan today, and how do the Japanese look at pricing versus how the
Americans look at pricing? So can you give us a feel for where the value of a patient cure is in Japan?
<A - Kevin Young>: Hey, Jason. It's Kevin. Yeah. Actually, it's a very simple question, but actually, it's a quite a
difficult answer because the age of the patients, 43% of Japanese patients are over the age of 65 and you know, the
advanced state of their disease, they've had it for a long time of them. A lot of them are in significant cirrhosis moving
to carcinoma, they just are ineligible to the current standard, so pegylated interferon, ribavirin is extremely difficult,
and that's why the Japanese opinion leaders and the Japanese patients are very much looking forward to, for example,
our entry with GT2 with just having sofosbuvir and ribavirin.
So I think in terms of pricing – in some ways, you kind of wipe the slate clean, and you go in with these new therapies
and the traditional approach is not a great pegging of price. Typically, the Japanese markets do have a discount to the
U.S. market. So I think that will be still applicable with sofosbuvir, but I think we're really starting fresh with these new
treatments and the very high need and the profile that the Japanese patient has.
<Q - Jason H. Kolbert>: Thank you.
