Thanks, Melissa. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us this morning. Before we jump into the details of the
quarterly results, let me take a step back and frame up the big picture for everyone. Hillshire Brands is a focused food
company, one that is committed to delivering growth and profitability through brand building and innovation across our
terrific portfolio of brands. We have a disciplined plan to create value that also includes an intense efficiency mindset.
After half a year I feel very good about the progress we're making against our plan.
Q2 was another strong quarter for Hillshire Brands and we're pleased with our overall performance in the first half of
fiscal 2013. We continued to make strides in growing volume, revenue and adjusted operating income in the first
quarter and the first half. Our brands continue to grow stronger and healthier as we invest in MAP support and
innovation in our core business.
Our profit was meaningfully helped by both lower input costs and our disciplined approach to SG&A spending. Also,
we entered into an agreement to divest our Australian bakery operation. Once that closes we will be able to focus 100%
of our time and energy on driving growth and innovation across our North American Retail and Food Service segment.
We also moved our corporate headquarters from Downers Grove to Chicago without missing a beat, an important step
in our cultural evolution. Based on all of those items as well as our outlook for the balance of the fiscal year we are
raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $1.60 to $1.70 per diluted share.
Now let's dive into the segment results. I'll provide some commentary here on what drove our Retail and Food Service
performance and Maria will provide more insights into the numbers a bit later in the call. We have now achieved four
consecutive quarters of year-over-year volume growth in Retail. Clearly the first half comps were easier than the
second half will be, but we feel good about the progress we're making with our brands.
Over the first half of this fiscal year we've meaningfully increased our investment in MAP to support our brands as you
can see on this slide. And as you know this is a crucial step in our three-year plan to deliver significant value. By
consistently supporting our brands with MAP they will be better positioned in the marketplace and perform more
consistently over time. I think that the Jimmy Dean business exemplifies this well. Jimmy Dean is lapping record high
volumes in Breakfast Sausage Rolls this quarter due to unusually heavy holiday merchandising last year. Despite that
tough comp, the total Jimmy Dean franchise grew overall volume and revenue year-over-year behind strength in
sandwiches and bowls, both of which had very strong MAP support. We were also pleased to see Jimmy Dean's new
biscuit line get off to a strong start. These products are consistent with our strategy to continue to push into snacking
categories.
On Hillshire Farm we were expecting to see lunchmeat begin to respond to our programming and I'm pleased to say
that it did. After a long time of very little MAP support, Hillshire Farm lunchmeat advertising is back in full swing. We
returned to air late Quarter 1 with a new campaign that takes the brand back to its quality heritage. As you all know
well, Hillshire Farm lunchmeat has been struggling for some time now so I'm pleased to say that with the support of
marketing tools, Hillshire Farm lunchmeat returned to volume growth this quarter. And keep in mind that the new
packaging and product improvement that we've talked about before have not hit the marketplace yet. Those will be
rolled out in February and we expect consumers to respond well to these upgrades. To be clear, it's still early days and
we're not declaring victory in any way on the turnaround of Hillshire Farm lunchmeat. However, these are positive
early signs on an important business for us.
Frankly, there are positive signs throughout our consumption data. This slide shows year-over-year growth in IRI's total
volume sales for the full fiscal 2012 and for the year-to-date of fiscal 2013. Now, I won't go through every one of our
brands, but as you can see on this slide we are making solid progress across our Retail portfolio. Even businesses we
don't spend a lot of time typically talking about, for example, State Fair is growing through increased distribution and
the Gallo restage has really taken hold. Additionally, a couple of Sara Lee businesses that had been leaky buckets are
stabilizing.

Now, we don't show our seasonal items here but I want to mention them briefly. These are products like Hillshire Farm
Cocktail Links, Jimmy Dean Breakfast Roll Sausages, certain pies and desserts. We had a much better execution this
year than last year and I'm happy to say that these items delivered quality volume performance and grew revenues in
the quarter.
So net, we've made some real progress strengthening our core across the Retail segment.
We have several great new products that will be hitting the marketplace soon across our portfolio, including the brands
you see here on this slide. We will be at the CAGNY conference in February where we're going to talk about
innovation in quite a bit more detail.
Now turning to Foodservice, this business had a solid quarter with volume, revenue and adjusted operating income
versus the same quarter – up versus the same quarter of fiscal year 2012. The meat side of the business continued to
grow volume and has gained traction with our branded placements, such as Dunkin' Donuts' new breakfast sandwiches
made with Hillshire Farm Smoked Sausage. On the bakery side of the business, we are still seeing declining
consumption trends in the industry, so it's really a share gain there. However, the Tarboro plant changes are now behind
us and we're finalizing the upgrades at our other bakery plant in Traverse City, where we saw almost no disruptions
during the process. Now while these upgrades have been challenging at times, we're now well positioned in
Foodservice bakery, vis-à-vis our competitors.
So to wrap up Foodservice, it was a solid quarter, but we're very clear-eyed that the near-term environment in
Foodservice, as a channel, remains quite challenging.
Now before I turn the call over to Maria, let me summarize my thoughts for you. We've had a strong first half and I am
very pleased with our progress. We have great brands and our plans to revitalize them are moving along nicely.
Additionally, after two years of significant commodity inflation, we benefited from some temporary favorability in the
first half. We will reinvest some of that in the second half to further strengthen our brands and advance our cost
efficiency programs. We do this in anticipation of a return to commodity headwinds as calendar 2013 unfolds.
Overall our philosophy on this is quite straightforward. We have been and will continue to be focused on building the
business for sustained, long-term value creation. That means building stronger brands through consistent MAP and
innovation, as well as a continuous improvement mindset on costs. Our goal is to take the necessary actions to drive the
center line of our profit trends continuously north over time and we believe we're doing just that. Over to you, Maria.
Maria Henry
Thanks, Sean. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us.
As you've seen in our numbers, and just heard from Sean's comments, we posted strong earnings for the quarter and the
first half of the fiscal year. We continue to execute our plan and we are making progress. As in the first quarter, our
second quarter results reflect significant benefit from lower input costs. Consistent with our strategy, we continued to
invest in MAP and innovation in the quarter and I remain pleased with the early results that we are seeing from our
investments in those areas. Also, on December 18, we announced the sale of our Australian bakery business to McCain
and that segment has now been classified as a discontinued operation in our financials.
Now let's take a look at the quarter's financial results. As you can see on this slide, our adjusted operating income of
$127 million was up 26% versus last year, and adjusted diluted EPS was up 29% to $0.62. The key drivers of our
strong adjusted operating profit in the quarter were lower input costs and solid volume growth. Our adjusted net sales
grew 2.5% behind a 2.9% increase in volume. About half of that volume increase was attributed to higher commodity
meat sales. If you exclude those sales our volume grew 1.3%.
On gross margin we had the benefit of deflationary input costs in the quarter. This was the primary driver of our 13%
increase in adjusted gross profit and our 31.4% gross margin rate.

Our MAP spend was 4% of revenue. This is up 43% from last Q2 when we had a MAP spend level of only 2.8% of
sales. The brands that saw the biggest year-over-year increases were Jimmy Dean and Hillshire Farm. We have set our
MAP to further strengthen our brands and to position us to better maintain margins in the face of commodity cost
increases in the future.
Our SG&A, excluding MAP, decreased by 1% in the quarter and by 6% for the first half versus last year. This reflects
the benefit of our savings initiative, some one-time favorable items and the timing of expenses and investments.
Now let's look at the segment. Retail led our overall strong company performance. Segment sales grew 2.2% on
volume growth of 1.1% with growth in Jimmy Dean, Ball Park, Hillshire Farm and Aidells. The 23% increase in Retail
adjusted operating profit was driven by solid sales growth as well as lower input costs, and we were again able to hold
much of our pricing through this deflationary period.
Moving on to Foodservice/Other. Overall, this segment had a solid quarter. Volume grew 6.6%. Excluding sales of
commodity meat, Foodservice volume grew 1.7%. We saw nice growth in Foodservice meats in the quarter, which was
somewhat offset by declines in bakery. Adjusted operating segment income growth of 8.5% benefited from lower input
prices but was negatively impacted by mix with higher commodity turkey sales and lower bakery sales.
Additionally, our manufacturing costs are higher in bakery from the changes we have made to our bakery
manufacturing facilities to comply with the Food Safety Modernization Act. While the changes are behind us, they
have resulted in higher ongoing costs from depreciation on new equipment and higher labor costs. We continue to
believe that over time these changes give us a competitive advantage in the market, but as Sean pointed out, the
Foodservice base overall is challenging right now, so our near-term expectations are modest.
We announced the sale of our Australian bakery business to McCain for $AUD82 million or $USD85 million. We now
expect this deal to close within this quarter. It is subject to customary closing adjustments and we expect to pay
approximately $12 million in taxes on the sale. The sales and earnings for Australian bakery were included in our
original guidance. Our expectation for that business was $136 million in sales and $0.03 of adjusted diluted EPS for
fiscal 2013. The sale of the business has now been incorporated into our updated guidance.
Our balance sheet and cash flow remain strong. Excluding significant items, the business generated $114 million in
cash and $301 million in adjusted EBITDA during the first half. At the end of the quarter, we had $647 million of net
debt, so we remain conservatively leveraged. The proceeds from the sale of the Australian bakery business will provide
additional capital flexibility. We continue to evaluate our alternatives to deploy cash to achieve the highest return for
our shareholders. Our near-term priority remains investing in our business, where we currently have significant
opportunities. We recently added Brian Davison as our Senior Vice President of Strategy and he is working with us to
evaluate our alternatives.
With the first half of the year behind us, we are updating our full-year guidance. We are now expecting our net sales
growth for the year to be up slightly, despite the fact that our second half comps are more challenging. We are raising
our adjusted diluted EPS guidance to $1.60 to $1.70.
This reflects the strong earnings we posted in the first half, some of which we will be reinvesting back into our
business. I said in the last call that if we were tracking to favorability for the year, we will look to dial up the
investment in our business around brand building, innovation and cost-efficiency programs that will strengthen our
position going into what appears to be a more challenging commodity environment in the second half and into our
fiscal 2014. And we are doing exactly that. And in the second half, we will be making investments behind new
products going into the market; in MAP to strengthen our brand equity; and in some external expertise to work with us
on capabilities development and to identify areas of productivity and cost opportunity.
As we've discussed, the first half benefited from significant input cost favorability. We do not expect that favorability
to repeat in the second half. In addition to the loss of input cost favorability, as I discussed earlier we continue to expect
SG&A expenses, including Corporate, to rise through the balance of the year. We expect our SG&A costs to be up in
the second half, and as previously communicated, up for the full-year versus fiscal 2012.

We're making investments in the second half to develop our capability in critical areas and to identify the remaining
specific opportunities behind the $100 million of cost savings we have committed to as part of our three year plan. As
you'll recall, $35 million of that was yet to be identified as we started the year and we're making good progress on what
those programs will be. Additionally I'm happy to report that we are on track for the $40 million of savings that we
expect to deliver in fiscal 2013.
Finally, we have some favorability in Corporate that will stick for the year so we now expect our corporate expenses
for fiscal 2013 to be in the mid-$50 millions.
So let me sum it up: we had very strong earnings in the first half behind good growth and significant input cost
favorability; we are investing some of that favorability back into our business; we do not expect to see net favorability
from price commodities in the second half; and our SG&A costs will be higher in the second half and for the full-year
behind investments and timing of expenses. We now open the call up for your questions. Operator?
Q&A

[Operator Instructions] Our first question or comment comes from Ken Goldman from JPMorgan. Your line is open.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: Hey, good morning.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Morning, Ken.
<A - Maria Henry>: Morning.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: Can you talk about the competitive response, if any, that you've seen to some of your sales
gains both in the, maybe some of the new products that are out there and especially on the Hillshire brand?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Ken, we don't comment a lot on our competitors in general. I think if you look at the
categories we compete in right now, each of these companies have a lot going on in their own right. So it looks to me
like everybody's focused on their own agenda and what they've got to do. We certainly have been doing that because
we've got to get our own house in order and we worry a lot more about that than what our competitors are doing. What
I see overall is generally a pretty reasonable marketplace. We saw in one of our categories there was a little bit of hot
merchandising over the holidays, but really overall I've seen it be a fairly reasonable marketplace thus far this year.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: Thanks. And then can you add a little bit of color on what you're seeing – I know you talked
about it a little bit – but in the hog and the cattle markets, how much of your guidance raise was due, if you can
quantify it, to some of the hogs and pigs report out, that was out there from the USDA, maybe some of the cargo plant
closing news that took cattle prices down? I'm just curious to what extent your confidence in the back half of the year
was extended perhaps by some of those news items that may have come out of the commodity markets?
<A - Maria Henry>: Sure. We – let me just talk about how we think about commodities. We all look at the same
external data, and while we don't comment specifically about our commodity assumptions, last time we spoke to you,
commodities have moved. And so we expect commodities to go against us at the back end of this fiscal year. But in my
comments, I noted that for the second half in total, we aren't expecting any favorability from our price-commodity
relationship.
<Q - Ken B. Goldman>: Okay. Thanks.

<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: Good morning, and congratulations on a good quarter.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Morning, Akshay.
<A - Maria Henry>: Thanks.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: Just along the lines of Ken's question, if you can just help us – I mean in the back half, I
think you're guiding to an EBIT decline of close to $97 million. I know there's been some changes in the numbers, so I
don't know if I have that exactly right. But the magnitude is pretty severe in terms of the year-over-year decline. And in
my opinion, there's two buckets, right, You've got the MAP spending and you've got the commodity costs. So – at least
on the gross profit side, so, those are the two main buckets that I'm looking at. Can you help us there? I mean you're
being very vague about the commodities side and MAP spending in general, but at least help me understand order of
magnitude? What are the main drivers of that decline that you're projecting? I mean at least rank them for us? That
would be great.
<A - Maria Henry>: Sure. Let me give you some color there. We certainly don't mean to be vague, but let's talk about
a number of things. First of all, I think this year really comes out to be a tale of two halves. In the first half of the fiscal
year, we saw significant favorability from input costs. We don't expect to see that in the second half of the year. We
also saw some favorability in terms of our SG&A spend. So the SG&A spend, including Corporate, for the first half of
this year benefited from some favorability. That includes some of the one-time items I talked about on the call after the
first quarter. It also includes kind of the timing of how expenses hit our P&L.
If you think about it we just spun at the end of June so we've had – we're two quarters out, we're getting our new
management team in place, that management team got hired through the first half of the year, that team then hired their
teams underneath them and started the program that we are working on to achieve our mid-term target. So things didn't
really get going right at the beginning of the year, they paced through the first half of the year. Something that I can tell
you for sure, we will not spend money in this company until we're ready and in order, and that we see clear returns on
it. So the timing of the spend around the G&A really ramped through this year and so the SG&A expenses will be up in
the second half versus the first half.
We are investing some of the favorability that we achieved in the first half back into our business in the second half.
This is in the area of MAP, behind getting the new innovations into the market in the second half and also bringing
some external expertise in to work with us on our fundamental capabilities in critical areas and also to help us identify
the exact projects and programs that we'll be executing in order to achieve that additional $35 million of savings that
we've been talking about since June.
So it really is a tale of two halves and that's how we think about it and that's what's driving the various line items on the
P&L.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: Okay. And just one on MAP spending and just overall the effectiveness of your advertising
campaign. You made a comment that your products are responding well. What do you mean by that? I mean is there a
particular return on marketing dollars invested that you're looking at, if you could share that? And perhaps give us a
sense of how you were doing before to get a sense of how much better it's gotten? So can you help me understand the
comment about being more effective in your MAP spending now or your brands responding well? That'd be great.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Okay. Couple of points on that, Akshay, to think about. First of all, as everybody knows
with the old Sara Lee business, the MAP, the absolute level of spend was light. And on top of that, the effectiveness of
it, we deemed there was room for growth there. So we're attacking both of those; we're putting more MAP spend out
there and we've got new agencies in place, we've got new communication strategies. And then what we do is we
allocate that MAP spend against the brands that are most ready for that MAP spend in terms of an ROI outlook. So
what you see out there and what you'll continue to see is us putting the MAP resources primarily against our power
brands, starting with Jimmy Dean. So Jimmy Dean continues to – we've stepped up our MAP investment meaningfully
this year in the first half and it's delivered performance.

The good news is we will continue to do that in the second half, because as can imagine, given our previous MAP
budgets we were the kind of company that was inclined to run out of money on MAP in the first half of the year. So as
we go forward, really, if you look at fiscal 2013 the vast majority of our incremental MAP spend on the year comes in
the second half and it tends to go against the power brands and we see it in volume results, frankly. And that's why I
show you the scanner data in the slides we saw today; you see that overall our programming is driving improved trends.
And on businesses where we have MAP, like Jimmy Dean and beginning really to start putting it against Hillshire Farm
as well as Ball Park, we're seeing very good response.
<Q - Akshay S. Jagdale>: [ph] Thanks a lot (25:45)
Operator
Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from John Baumgartner from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: Thank you. Good morning. Sean, just in looking at some of the Nielsen data here I think
we've seen some relatively broad based reductions in the percent sold on promotion over the past few months. So with
that, just wondering if you have any thoughts here either on your price gaps or maybe even the elasticity points with
consumers going forward? And I guess even in the context of consumer tolerance to higher price points if the category
does have to raise prices with inflation coming through?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Well that point you're raising, John, is central to the way we run the business. Overall we're
looking to drive the centerline of our profitability north over time and for us to do that we need to be able to
sequentially build strength in our brands so that we can hold volumes in an environment where we take price. The way
you do that is by investing in MAP and by competing based on brand equity and based on the benefits that we bring as
opposed to competing on price. So it is clearly our strategy to, as the businesses become ready, compete less on price,
to compete more on innovation, more on brand building.
And it's early, early days for us in that regard. So what we've had in the first half I think is better price points in terms
of gaps to competition in key thresholds than we had say the first half a year ago, but we're just really getting starting in
terms of the MAP and innovation agenda and building the kind of strength that can withstand changes in pricing in the
future. But that is our game plan, that's the way we're going to run the business overall and it is a far better alternative
than competing on price and then having to see your volumes really take a hit when you do price.
<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: Okay. And then just on the Foodservice bakery side, the volume stabilization there, I
think you had mentioned maybe some share gains. Is there anything company specific you're doing in terms of
innovation or new distribution that you're gaining in some of these [indiscernible] (27:53) helping stabilize those
numbers?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: I think with respect to the Foodservice team's go-to-market approach, because the channel is
sluggish right now and people are really tightening their – they're continuing to tighten their belts away from home,
we're not seeing or are we forecasting underlying growth in the industry, which as I mentioned in my comments, means
it's a share game. And if you're going to win share, you've got to have novel and provocative items. So what the team's
doing there on bakery is they're continuing to innovate and we have a number of new things coming in there and we
keep trying. You try it. If it works, you scale it up. If it doesn't work, you pull it quickly, you do something else. So
innovation is the name of the game, particularly on the bakery side of the business where we do in fact have a very
strong bakery capability and we have innovation capabilities there that I think few can match.
<Q - John J. Baumgartner>: Great. Thank you.

<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Hi. Could I ask about the outlook for price and volume going forward? Obviously you've
talked about it being a year of two halves. I think we've seen pricing being pretty muted in the first half with volume
coming through maybe a little bit better than expected. You've talked about wanting to get to positive sales growth for
the full year, are we likely to see a reversal whereby maybe pricing comes through based on commodity pressures in
the second half? Or is it more of the same?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: We want to continue to grow our sales line, there's no question about it. And as we showed
you in the slides, we've got tougher comps in the second half, but we don't expect a decline. And with respect to
pricing, what we can say is, we expect to be pricing as calendar year 2013 unfolds. Clearly we can't get into details on
what that looks like yet for competitive reasons, not to mention it's early. But overall, our goal is to have positive price
recovery in deflationary times, and then to minimize the negative price recovery that we could see in inflationary times.
And the net approach of that is the center line of our profitability moving steadily north over time. That is our
approach. But we're not going to get into pricing specifics now because it's too early, but clearly as we see calendar
year 2013 unfolding now, we expect it to become inflationary and that is likely to prompt pricing moves of some sort or
another.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Okay. And then just as a quick follow up, could I ask Maria about uses of cash? I think
you came into the year thinking that cash – free cash flow was going to be quite tight because of various expenditures
that you had through the year. Clearly the operating performance has come through better than expected. You seem to
be – you have a fair amount of cash and your net debt position is quite low. At what point do you start considering
maybe introducing some share repurchases or are there other things that cash is earmarked for?
<A - Maria Henry>: Sure. We do have a very strong cash balance. That will be further augmented when we close the
sale of the Australian bakery. It's not our intent to sit on a cash balance for long periods of time. We continue to think
about our capital deployment strategy consistent with what we've talked to you about before. Our first priority remains
investing in our business because we see significant areas of opportunity to invest in our business. So that's our first
priority.
We've talked before about dividends and the fact that we started out conservatively there and that we would look to
increase that over time; that remains consistent. And then the next areas of priority are looking at M&A opportunities.
We just hired Brian Davison, who joined us early in January, and he is working with us on exploring those M&A
opportunities and looking to see if there's potential to create real value through opportunities in the M&A market. And
then we balance that with share repurchases.
So clearly we'll deploy our capital to the areas that deliver the highest and the best returns and that's how we think
about it.
<Q - Alexia Jane Howard>: Okay. Thank you very much, I'll pass it on.

Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Tim Ramey from D. A. Davidson. Your line is open.
<Q - Tim S. Ramey>: Good morning. Just an administrative question here. If I looked at your adjusted financial
summary on page five, you don't show any interest expense here and obviously it looked like net interest expense was
about $10 million in the quarter. What am I missing? Are you lumping that in with general corporate expenses and did
you say what your net interest expense forecast was for the full year? I think you might have said $50 million but I
might have missed that.

<A - Maria Henry>: No I think the guidance that we've given on net interest expense for the year is $35 million to $40
million and I still expect that it will be in that range.
<Q - Tim S. Ramey>: And if we're looking at page five, where is the net interest expense that flicks to $0.62?

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Zaslow from Bank of Montreal. Your line is open.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Morning, Ken.
<A - Maria Henry>: Morning.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: When you talk about the guidance increase, can you just talk about how you can rank it in
terms of how much was the increase related to operational improvement, corporate expense reduction and commodity
price favorability?
And then I know, Maria, you said that there was two halves to the year in terms of margin structure, so when we look
forward how do we think about which margin structure, because they're going to be pretty drastically different, which
to build off of? And how do we think about that?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Yeah. Just overall in terms of how we're thinking about guidance on the year, early in the
fiscal year we expected favorability in the first half and stiff headwind in the second half. And since then, Q2 generated
even more favorability and the outlook for H2, while still going in the other direction, has become less bearish. So the
net of that is that instead of using H1 favorability to offset negative price recovery in the second half, we now have the
flexibility to do other things. So we will flow part of that through to higher guidance and part of that going back to the
business and I'm sure as you've anticipated from our previous comments we've intended to do that all along should we
find ourselves in an environment of favorability.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: And then just on the second part of the question, when you think about going forward
obviously the margin structures between the two halves are very different. How do we think about it, to model forward
into 2014 and 2015 and how do we think about where the base margin structure is? Would we use the second half as
more the base to start off with or would you use the mix between the two, and can you just address that?
<A - Maria Henry>: Sure. I think that it's neither the first or the second half and so it's more of a mix, to use your
word. We had the significant favorability in the first half, and in the second half we've got some specific investments
that we're making in the areas that I've talked about. But when you think about our business going forward we are still
tracking to what we've shared with you in terms of our mid-term guidance and targets. So we are still on that trajectory
to achieve those targets. This year in total we'll have favorability, which you know because we raised our guidance, so
there's favorability in this year toward the trajectory of those mid-term targets. But we're still tracking toward what
we've shared with you as our fiscal 2015 goals.
<Q - Kenneth B. Zaslow>: Great. Thank you very much.

Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Rob Moskow from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Hi. Thank you. I noticed that your corporate expense guidance is quite a bit lower than it was
previously. It's now about $55 million; I thought it was going to be $70 million. But Maria I think you also said that
you're hiring some consultants to help you find business building opportunities and also go after the cost savings. So
how can I reconcile those two things? And maybe, Sean, you can give me a little more color on what the external health
is really doing for your business? Thanks.
<A - Maria Henry>: Sure, why don't I start out. On the corporate costs we have some favorability in the corporate
costs that – some of it is one time in nature, some of it is timing related. And so the $55 million that I've talked about
today is roughly where I think we'll land the year. If I back out the timing and the one-time items, the corporate cost
would have landed just south of $70 million, is how that would have shaken out.
A little bit of the color on the things that flow through corporate that we've talked about before, some of the one-time
favorability is in there. I've talked to you before about the fact that our transition services agreement related to
previously divested businesses have gone longer than what we originally anticipated and some of that benefit flows
through the corporate line. So those are some of the dynamics there as well as the timing of just hiring the staff for the
corporate headquarters. So that's what's going on in corporate. On the consultants we are having some external
consultants work with us. The expenses for those consultants actually runs through the operating SG&A.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Yeah. Just a bit more color on that, Rob; you asked for color. Obviously we went into this
year saying we commit to the $100 million in savings, we've got to go identify $35 million of it. Part of what this team
will do is continue to help us lock down that $35 million but in general in terms of what we're looking for, we've got a
lot of different buckets across the P&L so we're looking for margin expansion opportunities and cost efficiency
opportunities. That could be anywhere from the trade line to the indirect expense line. So there are a variety of buckets
that we will look at. As we have more to report to you guys on this we will report it out, but really feel good that we've
got some expertise on this and remain very, very focused on efficiency and margin expansion.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Got it. So they're not there to help you drive top line or marketing ideas or anything like that?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: No. We've got – we've had some outside help as all companies do in terms of innovation,
market consumer insight, things like that, but no, that's not what we're talking about here. This is really about
efficiency, margin expansion, that kind of work.
<Q - Robert Moskow>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Dickerson from Consumer Edge Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Thank you. So again, just a little incremental color. I'm just trying to sum up the entire feel
from this – the two-phase year and the first half versus the second half. But I feel like kind of net-net, the overall
take-away should be you did better. Obviously, you did a lot better than you had originally guided and I'm assuming
than you had originally expected the first half to be. You know, part of this is coming off of volumes, part's coming off
the input cost complex. But then you're also saying because of that first half benefit that even though there're going to
be input cost pressures in the back half, which we all kind of already knew because you've been talking about it for six
months, that you're still then reinvesting back more in the back half, in the business. So kind of despite the input cost it
still seems that – and despite this two-part year – that we see the guidance up, but the guidance is up and you're
investing up.
So I guess sort of what I'm asking is, net-net, despite what we see in Q3 and Q4 it still feels like from a business
perspective, a management perspective that this is still better for the business from an investment perspective. And so
can you just kind of comment on where you are now, how you view the back half of the year in investment and how
that should hopefully flow through into next fiscal year? Thank you.

<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Yeah. I think this is really straightforward. I think what you're seeing here is entirely
consistent with how we've said we intend to run the business all along. It's really our philosophy on running the
business. We are committed to building this business for sustained, long term value creation. When we spun we knew
we had a lot of heavy lifting to do in Year 1 to get the legs under the business and set it up to succeed for the future.
But in general what we're trying to do here is build stronger brands through consistent MAP and innovation as well as a
continuous improvement mindset on cost; things that we haven't had in the past. And that means if we find ourselves in
an environment where input costs move significant, we'll look to strike a smart balance between near-end profitability
and investing to get this business to achieve its full potential for the long term. And that means if we experience
material favorability across any given fiscal year we will look to re-deploy some of that into brand building and
innovation as well as capability building, because that is exactly the right thing to do for the long haul.
Conversely, it also means that if in any given year costs swing against us we won't abandon marketing and innovation
to inflate short term performance. That's the way the business was run in the past and we know what it gets us. Let me
correct that, we know what it doesn't get us.
So our goal is to take the actions necessary to drive the center line of our profit trends continuously north over time.
And as I said before I believe we're doing just that and feel very good that what we're doing in the second half of this
year because of the first half of this year not only helps us with respect to putting the business in a stronger position
F2014, ultimately we're looking at F2015, F2016 and beyond trying to really unlock this portfolio
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Okay. And then just quickly to that point, your original guidance is for the 200 basis point
operating margin expansion by 2015. In Q2 we can see, obviously, with an input cost benefit you can definitively post
a 12% operating margin. So just some color around, I always hate to say, feel, but with respect to where you are now
relative to where you are when you stepped into the job, Sean, do you feel as if there's even more opportunity than you
may have originally thought? Thank you.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Well I would say we're absolutely on track. We're not updating our guidance that we gave
before. We feel very good about the midterm guidance that we've given. Assumptions will change as the world around
us changes, and our job is to navigate through those changes and keep us on track and I feel very good that we're on
track. I'm absolutely thrilled with the first half of the year and the way the brands are responding in early days to the
programming that we've put out there.
<Q - Rob Dickerson>: Okay, perfect. I'll pass it on.

Thank you. Our next question or comment comes from Andrew Lazar from Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Morning, Andrew.
<A - Maria Henry>: Morning.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: First, Sean, I wanted to make sure I understood a little more about a comment you had made on
a couple of questions ago. You had said the fiscal second half now seems less bearish from a pricing input cost
relationship perspective. So I wanted to get a better sense whether that meant, prior, you either felt that input costs were
going to be more onerous in the second half than now; or that you wouldn't be able to take the desired amount of
pricing that you feel like you can take now; or that volume won't be as weak as maybe – it hopefully won't be this time
around with additional pricing? I'm trying to get a sense of what would be less bearish about that relationship than you
thought previously?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Yeah. Let me – I'll take you back to after the first quarter as an example. Some asked why
don't you guys take up your guidance after the first quarter and our position was a quarter doesn't make a year; we want
to see what happens in the back half of the year. Because at the time we thought that the inflation headwinds could be

worse than their manifesting themselves and that we may need to save some of the favorability from the first quarter to
really hold our profitability on the year.
As it turns out, our original view was that the full year would be modestly deflationary and we thought we'd get
favorability in the first half and headwind in the back half. First half favorability is better; in the back half the headwind
is not quite what it was. So really we do expect as we go through the calendar year, Andrew, that we will see inflation
in our input costs. We're not going to get into today when we expect that to hit in terms of which month and what the
pricing implications are for obvious competitive reasons. But it's also early. Things are still moving. But as we get
toward the end of the fiscal year, we expect it to turn inflationary, and we expect that will continue as we move into
fiscal 2014.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Got it. That's helpful, actually. I appreciate that. And then one for Maria. You had mentioned in
the prepared remarks that you thought it was quite positive that you were able to hold pricing through this recent
deflationary period. And I wanted to get a sense of – my sense was you said that obviously as a more positive than
maybe it might have been historically when you had some deflation. And I'm trying to get a sense of is that true? And if
so, what's changed to allow you to hold price? Or is it just that everybody saw that this deflation was going to be kind
of a temporary, and therefore the push to reduce pricing was less severe, because everybody can see inputs rising as the
year goes on?
<A - Maria Henry>: Sure. There's a number of things that affect that. One is the timing of how input costs change, and
how quickly input costs change either up or down; how the competitive landscape responds to those changes; and then
how all of that comes together. On the Retail side of the business, if I look at the first half, we had good pricing on the
Retail side of the business, and we were able to take the benefit of the favorable input costs. As we talked about on
Foodservice, that those relationships are different, because part of our Foodservice business is on contract. And so with
the deflationary costs, we did have some deflation on the price side. When I look at the total business, with the amount
of deflation in input costs that we saw in the first half, and then I look at what we were able to do with pricing overall,
I'm very pleased with that relationship. Sean, you may want to comment more specifically on the retail environment?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Yeah, no, you've asked before, Andrew, is this a pass-through business or is it not a
pass-through business? Should prices go down? And the answer is generally, no. This is – it's not a business anything
like the green bean coffee market. However, it all depends upon what competitors' strategies are at any given time, and
if they're out to gain share, if they're out to take your distribution, or if the market behaves sensibly, reasonably. And as
I mentioned I think on the first question of this call, in general the market has been fairly sensible and reasonable, I
think, thus far this year.
<Q - Andrew Lazar>: Great. Thanks very much.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Thank you.

Thank you. And our last question comes from Ken Perkins from Morningstar. Your line is open.
<Q - Kenneth Perkins>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Morning, Ken.
<Q - Kenneth Perkins>: Just, I appreciate the color on the brand re-investment. I'm just wondering, since you've
outpaced your expectations in the first half if you can give us a sense for what sort of incremental re-investment
opportunities you see over the near term that weren't in your original plans? I know – in the MAP, specifically. Maybe
brands or categories, just what opportunities you're seeing there would be helpful?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: Yeah. A couple of – it's a great question, I think it's important to articulate that. We've got
investments in the second half in MAP, we've got investments to get new products into the marketplace, call it sliding,
getting – we have a very robust slate of new items coming into the marketplace in the second half of the year, one of

the more robust we've got. A lot of it is not new-to-the-world invention, a lot of it is consistent with our strategy of
strengthening our core business, is re-staging what we've got, strengthening our core. So lunchmeat is a good example;
on Hillshire Farm where we're taking the old package and product out, we've got an entirely new package in. So what
we're doing is we're ramping up support behind well-developed businesses like Jimmy Dean where we have very
detailed models in terms of what we call optimal spend analyses that consider ROI. And we are supporting new item
innovation. And we continue to build the innovation pipeline out for F2014 and beyond, because as soon as we're done
with one fiscal year the question becomes what's next. So that's something we hadn't done before, that's something that
we've made a priority, is continuing to replenish that pipeline so this is not a one and done type of deal.
<Q - Kenneth Perkins>: Okay. Great. And then just following up on that, in terms of the lunchmeat category I know
that obviously you have the new packaging, I'm just wondering is there any other innovation-esque efforts in the
pipeline that you could speak to in terms of that brand or expanding in the category?
<A - Sean M. Connolly>: You know, I don't want to tip our hand in terms of what's coming after that, but I think the
simplest way to think about it is it comes down to what's happening with consumer trends. How are they evolving?
What are the key benefits they're looking for? And then a clear-eyed view of are we very good in that area or not? And
if we're not then we'll hustle and we'll improve our offering or we'll create new stuff and we'll meet those needs. And
we've got a full pipeline in terms of what we see over the next couple of years in that area and really, frankly, across the
portfolio in general, and you'll see a bit more if it at CAGNY.
<Q - Kenneth Perkins>: Okay. Great, thank you very much.
