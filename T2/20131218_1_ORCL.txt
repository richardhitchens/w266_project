Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Safra.
Safra Ada Catz
Hey, thanks, Ken. I'm traveling today, so I hope you can hear me all right. I'm going to focus on our non-GAAP results
for Q2. I'll then review guidance for Q3, and then turn the call over to Mark and Larry for their comments. This quarter,
currency was a 2% headwind to new license, and 1% to hardware and total revenue, so my comments today generally
reflect constant dollar growth rates.
Q2 was a solid quarter overall as we exceeded our forecast in all major revenue segments, and we're pleased with the
results. Total software revenues were $6.9 billion, up 5% from last year. Software updates and product support
revenues drove about half of total company revenues at $4.5 billion, up 7% from last year. Attach and renewal rates
remain at their usual high levels as our growing installed base of customers continue to power earnings and cash flow.
New software license revenue was $2.4 billion, up 1%.
As many of you know, we had an absolutely fantastic Q2 last year with new software license growth way above
expectations of 18%. So we're actually very pleased, because that was quite a tough compare, and over the last two
years, we grew 19%. Looking at GAAP results by region, the Americas grew 5% with Latin America showing
excellent growth. EMEA grew 3%, and Asia-Pacific declined 10% with Japan continuing to be challenged.
Currency continues to be a significant headwind in Japan and Australia. Now, while our China business is not large
enough to make a significant difference to our business, we did actually see good growth there this quarter. Within
software, database continues to do well with Exadata software, GoldenGate and TimesTen in-memory software
products, all up more than 20%.
Also strong was human capital management, both on premise and SaaS, as well as our retailing and life science
verticals. The quarter, by the way, wasn't dependent on any one large deal. Overall, the hardware business, including
hardware support, grew 2%, with hardware system product revenue up $714 million.
And not only have our engineered systems continued to show excellent growth, but they've actually become a material
part of our overall hardware business, now accounting for nearly 30% of all hardware product sales. And while it's still
early in the customer adoption cycle, the new M-Series and T-Series servers saw good growth sequentially.
For the company, total revenue for the quarter was $9.3 billion, up 3% from last year. Non-GAAP operating income
was $4.2 billion, up 1% higher over last year. And the operating margin was 46%. We believe we can invest for growth
and make money as we continue to see the leverage of our business model.
The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 22% and non-GAAP EPS was $0.69 in U.S. dollars, growing 9% in
constant currency. The GAAP tax rate was 20% and GAAP EPS for the quarter was $0.56 in U.S. dollars, up 7% in
constant currency.
Free cash flow increased 14% to a record $14.6 billion over the last four quarters. Our consistent growth of free cash
flow over the last three years has resulted in our surpassing IBM, which, as you know has seen declines in the last eight
– in eight quarters of the last 12 quarters. And we now have nearly $37 billion in cash and marketable securities. Net of
debt, our cash position is approximately $13 billion.
As we've said before, we are committed to returning value to our shareholders through earnings growth, stock
repurchases and a dividend. In this quarter, we repurchased 83.4 million shares for a total of $2.8 billion. Over the last
12 months, we've repurchased nearly 323 million shares for a total of $10.7 billion, paid out dividends of nearly $1.9
billion, for a total that is nearly 90% of our free cash flow. And the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of
$0.12 per share for the quarter.
Now to the guidance; new software license and cloud subscription revenue is expected to range from 2% to 12% in
constant currency, and 1% to 11% in reported dollars. Hardware product revenue growth is expected to range from a

negative 1% to a positive 9% in constant dollars, and negative 2% to a positive 8% in reported dollars. As a result, total
revenue growth on both GAAP and non-GAAP basis is expected to range from 3% to 7% in constant dollars, and 2% to
6% in U.S. dollars.
Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be somewhere between $0.68 and $0.72 in constant and reported dollars. GAAP EPS is
expected to be somewhere between $0.54 to $0.58 in constant dollars and in reported dollars. Now, this guidance
assumes a GAAP tax rate of 23% and a non-GAAP tax rate of 24%, and of course, that may end up being different.
With that, I'll turn it over to Mark for his comments.
Mark V. Hurd
Yeah. Thanks, Safra. I'll just add a couple of comments and turn it to Larry. We had solid sales execution and beat
forecasts in all segments. We had good results in Europe and the Americas. Latin America was strong for us. Database
continues to show good performance, due in part to strength in Exadata and database options, and we have not yet
begun to see the coming benefits of 12c, which will help drive license growth.
Exadata and all our engineered systems had booking growth of nearly 35% on top of similar growth last year. All six
engineered systems saw double-digit revenue growth, including the Big Data Appliance and SPARC SuperCluster,
which saw triple-digit growth. Our engineered systems business is now big. It's delivering strong consistent growth in
our hardware business, including support grew 2% in constant currency.
In cloud, we had bookings growth of 35% and saw excellent growth across all major product pillars. Fusion SaaS was
even better with HCM, sales force automation, and ERP, all up triple-digits. We're adding customers at high growth
rates, contract sizes are growing, and hundreds of customers are now live on Fusion SaaS. In HCM, we had excellent
growth in all pillars; core HR, payroll and Talent Cloud.
Let me list out just a few wins; British Telecom, Siemens North America, Carlson Wagonlit, Health Net,
InterContinental Hotels, PPG Industries, Cummins, Government of Rotterdam, Southwest Energy, PDG Realty in
Brazil, CEMEX, Marks & Spencer, Scripps Health. Those are HCM. BT and Siemens are especially noteworthy, as
they'll both be servicing employee bases of more than 60,000 employees.
In customer experience, we saw growth across all four pillars; marketing, sales, service and social cloud. Key wins at
Oshkosh Truck, All Nippon Airways, Live Nation, Tesco, The Washington Post, Procter & Gamble, Perry Homes,
CRH Building Materials, Nikon Europe, Queensland State Government, TomTom, LifeScan Canada. And in ERP,
while it's still early, we saw triple-digit growth in ERP with many of our wins in net new ERP customers to Oracle.
This quarter, we issued new releases in HCM, talent, sales, marketing and social cloud. We also introduced Hyperion
planning and budgeting as a cloud service, and we expanded our data center count to 17 locations globally with
Canada, Germany and Brazil coming online soon.
I spent a little more time on cloud this quarter as I think it's important to understand what we're seeing and that we're
gaining traction. Our cloud and engineered systems business have hyper growth-like characteristics inside, to Safra's
point, the largest cash flow company in enterprise technology. The growth of just our software business is more than
double the revenue of Workday.
Let me, with that, turn it over to Larry.
Lawrence J. Ellison
Thanks, Mark. Oracle enters 2014 with refreshed versions of the key products that are expected to drive growth over
the next calendar year. Oracle's latest database, version 12c was specifically designed for the cloud. Oracle 12c makes
all your Oracle applications multi-tenant applications without you having to make any changes to your applications,
whatsoever. Oracle 12c also dramatically speeds up all your Oracle applications by making them in-memory

applications, without you having to change a single line of your application code.
Oracle's Fusion cloud applications for HCM, CRM and ERP, all have a new simplified user interface, and an integrated
social network that makes our enterprise applications as easy-to-use and familiar as Facebook, while enabling better
collaboration and teamwork among your employees and your customers. All these new application interfaces were
specifically designed for use on modern mobile devices like telephones and tablets.
Bookings for our cloud applications grew strongly this quarter, 35%, reflecting a continuously improving win rate
versus the new generation of SaaS specialists. Our engineered systems bookings also grew rapidly; 34% in this quarter.
We think these three product areas; database, cloud applications and engineered systems will drive Oracle's growth in
calendar year 2014.
Kenneth Bond
Thank you, Larry. Operator, if we could now begin the Q&A portion of the call?
Q&A
Operator
Absolutely. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Rick Sherlund with Nomura
Securities.
<Q - Rick G. Sherlund>: First for Larry; I know it's early for Oracle cloud infrastructure in platform-as-a-service, but
can you update us on where you stand there? We're seeing really good growth out of Amazon. I know your approach is
a bit different, but if you could sort of update us on kind of your strategy and where we stand on that? And Mark, if I
could just get a little clarification from you on the growth rate in the – on the cloud side; I think you said 35% bookings
growth. And the triple-digit for HCM, CRM and ERP; was that revenue growth or bookings growth?
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Rick, why don't we let Larry start, and then I'll [indiscernible] (14:07).
<Q - Rick G. Sherlund>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Okay. Well, Rick, as you know, our strategy is to be a player in all three parts of the
cloud, all three levels of cloud; SaaS, cloud applications, platform, and infrastructure. The – we think we're going to be
especially strong in platform where we – our two platform brands; our database brand is the Oracle Database 12c, and
our programming language brand is this thing called Java.
So we think we have a much stronger platform than any of our SaaS competitors. Let's just start there. If you look at a
Salesforce.com, and Force.com; you look at their platform capabilities versus the Oracle Database and Java, and we
think we have a considerable advantage. And of course, all of our SaaS – all of our applications are built on the Oracle
Database, are built on our platform, our database and our Java server.
Finally, down at the infrastructure level, we intend to be price-competitive with Amazon and Microsoft Azure, and
Rackspace. So we intend to compete aggressively in what I'll call the commodity – commodity not being a bad word,
the commodity infrastructure-as-a-service marketplace. But we're not going to have that alone. It's not going to be just
infrastructure-as-a-service.
Our intention is to sell our customers infrastructure-as-a-service, and the same customer, a highly differentiated
platform-as-a-service, which will let us get better margins, and a highly differentiated suite of enterprise applications
for the cloud. So we're going to be cost-competitive and price-competitive at the infrastructure level, while being highly
differentiated at both the platform level and the application level. Already, we have more enterprise SaaS applications
than any other cloud services provider. We'll continue to expand our footprint and use our size as an advantage.

<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Rick, Mark. I knew I threw a lot of numbers out there quick to you on the SaaS growth, but
what the numbers are is that our aggregate bookings growth in SaaS was 35%, okay, point one. That includes all of our
products. What I was pointing out was that if you looked at Fusion HCM, Fusion Sales Automation, and Fusion ERP;
those three grew in bookings, triple-digits. That's the delineation.
<Q - Rick G. Sherlund>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Okay.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please?
Operator
That will come from Phil Winslow with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Philip A. Winslow>: Congrats on a good quarter. A lot of time on the call was spent on cloud applications and
database, but I want to focus my question on hardware. Obviously, you guys showed some upside to consensus this
quarter and you got it in next quarter for hardware to grow year-over-year. I guess it is for both Mark and Larry, I
wonder if you could give us some more comments on what you're seeing on Exadata, Exalogic, and Exalytics, and then
also compare that to just sort of where we are with the course on business?
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Yeah. I'll start, Larry. And bookings growth in engineered systems, as I mentioned, was 35%.
Now important, Phil, to note, this is a big business now, so we had 35% growth this quarter against a similar growth
rate last year. So this is a compounding effect for us. All six of our engineered systems in the quarter had double-digit
revenue growth. And as I mentioned, it was really encouraging, I think, for us to see SPARC SuperCluster had an
excellent quarter for us in addition to Exadata.
We had big wins at – not actually big wins, I mean we had very important name wins; P&G, Verizon,
AmerisourceBergen, ICICI Bank in China, Televisa. Exalytics was strong in the quarter, Phil. We had Petrobras in –
from an Exalytics perspective; so again, a very broad-base of – set of customers, very consistent across our regions in
terms of performance. And again, very strong bookings growth against a very strong compare. I'll let Larry add
anything he'd like.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Yeah. I think our engineered systems business really has two parts; one is Exadata,
Exalogic, and Exalytics, all which really built their reputation in the marketplace for high performance, and of course,
you can take that high performance in performance or you can take it in lower cost. The other thing we've introduced
recently are lower-cost engineered systems. They go out – go after the mass and price-sensitive parts of the market. So
we've announced an Oracle Virtual Compute Appliance, a bunch of low-cost commodity servers running Linux,
integrated in our case, with InfiniBand – connected with InfiniBand versus the traditional Ethernet.
But our system comes with its own VM, a kind of an industry-standard Xen-based VM, industry-standard Linux,
standard commodity servers with a high-speed networking interface. We have that – again, that's called the Oracle
Virtual Compute Appliance. It's relatively new, and it's very aggressively priced. And we think it's a mass market
product that competes against our friends at Cisco. We also have had for some time, the Oracle Database Appliance,
another low-cost, mass market product. So we expect to sell a lot of engineered systems, not just the well-known,
high-end Exadata machines, but a complete suite of machines that go from extreme high-performance to large scale –
the ability to build large-scale clouds out of the commodity servers.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: You know, Phil, I think just before we leave the point on hardware, a couple of other points to
Larry's point about what we call the ODA, which is the Oracle Database Appliance. We're now the point where we're
roughly at 2,000 of those units. We don't talk about that product much, because to Larry's point, it's a more entry-level
system. But we've had great success with it. And on that sort of core server side, it's going to be interesting for us to see
how much share we gained in the quarter.

Our M-Series and T-Series, the SPARC line if you will, actually grew sequentially. So if you looked at them
quarter-to-quarter, we actually grew sequentially, and our decline in that business was actually quite small
year-on-year. And when you look at that, obviously, compared to our core UNIX competitors; that's going to be a big
gain. When you add that to the engineered systems performance in the quarter, our aggregate hardware business just
gained a lot of market share.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please?
Operator
That will come from Jason Maynard with Wells Fargo.
<Q - Jason A. Maynard>: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. I have a couple of questions, but first, maybe Mark and Safra,
if I look at your performance on a constant currency basis by geo, the U.S. was up 5%, and I think you're now 9%
growth in the first half of this year. EMEA looked better, obviously on a sequential basis in Q2, but APAC was looking
at the one region where there was more trouble that it was down, I think, 10% on a constant currency basis. So can you
maybe talk a little bit about what you see happening, at least from a macro perspective, maybe some of the changes to
the leadership there? And how you think about Asia performing over the second half of the year?
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Why don't I start, Jason, and I'll let Safra chime in afterwards, if she'd like to. I think
you're right in your assessment. I think we had a good quarter in Europe again. And I think when you get the
read-throughs across our industry and even broader than that, our Europe team's performed well. We said before that
our Europe team realigned itself early. There's no question in our mind that our Europe team is taking market share.
They performed well not only this quarter, but frankly, over a consistent period of time. And I think we feel very good
about our position in Europe, and the share that we're gaining.
In U.S., I think you're right as well. I think U.S. had a solid quarter overall, all-in, with what we expected, and as you
know, that was going against a tougher compare from last year. Asia has been rocky for us. It's obviously rocky from a
macro perspective. Safra mentioned; the good news was our performance in China. And our performance in China was
actually quite strong. Most of the issue involved in the quarter was in Australia and New Zealand, which continues to
be a difficult market there.
I do not believe that to be an Oracle issue. I believe that more to be a macro issue. We really feel all around that we've
got a very strong upside opportunity in Asia. We put, to your point, some new energy into Asia, some new excitement
into Asia, and we expect it to pay off. So those would be my comments about Asia. And to your point, if Asia had done
a little better, you can imagine how much, with the performance we already delivered in the quarter, it would have been
even more exciting.
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Yeah. The other part for us, for Asia, what we call Asia-Pacific, is merged together, includes
Japan, which we actually expect to bounce back this quarter, just between comparisons and other things. And there's
nothing – you made a mention to the leadership in Asia-Pac or something like that, and I actually don't know what
you're referring to there, because there's nothing in particular going on in our Asia-Pac. So that's it. So it's Japan and
Australia basically where our weakness was.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Okay. Thank you. Operator, next question, please?
Operator
We'll hear from John DiFucci with JPMorgan.
<Q - John S. DiFucci>: Thank you. I think it was Larry who said that growth is going to come from database, cloud
apps, and engineered systems. I want to focus on the first and third of those. I guess, can you give us any more color on
the database machines, including Exadata and SPARC SuperCluster, I think primarily, and I guess ODA also? But it is

early with 12c, but has there been any impact that 12c could be having on driving growth with engineered systems?
Even maybe, Mark, even in the anecdotes on what customers might be doing with 12c, coupled with Exadata, that
might be different than what they did with 11g?
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Why don't I let Larry start, and I'll add some color after that.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Okay. Let me add one more engineered system, which is our M6 in-memory system. As
you know, there's a lot of interest now in in-memory databases. We announced the Oracle 12c in-memory option, and
you couple the Oracle 12c in-memory option with an M6 with 32 terabytes of main memory; there – that's 99.99% of
all the world's databases can be now kept in main memory, with orders of magnitude improved performance. So we
think that can be a very interesting combination.
So 12c, we think, is interesting to a lot of cloud companies, and companies that are not in the business of reselling
applications that are building private clouds. So the combination of selling it to either the NetSuites of the world and –
that allows them to offer a higher quality service at a lower cost, or big banks and telecommunication companies that
allow them to build an effective private cloud. We've seen more interest in 12c than any database version in recent
memory. The multi-tenant option and the in-memory option, I think, are going to have very rapid uptake in 2014 and
2015.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: I think, John, in addition, we've yet to see the 12c benefit in our results; sort of point one. Point
two; to your point about engineered systems in the database side, clearly, the opportunity for us to now consolidate
Oracle environments in big accounts is extreme. Most of our customers have found tens and tens and tens of ways to
configure the Oracle database.
They have Oracle 8, Oracle 9, Oracle 10, Oracle 11; they have multiple different types of operating systems, multiple
different types of hardware platforms. So the opportunity for us to simplify and standardize those Oracle environments
– and our customers typically spend tens and tens of millions of dollars, in many cases, hundreds of millions of dollars
a year to operate the Oracle database environment, because of that complexity.
Our ability to simplify this and standardize this on Exadata, on our engineered systems with 12c, the formation of what
would be private clouds and database-as-a-service for our customers, gives us a chance to save our customers in some
cases, 30%, 40% out of their total cost to run the Oracle environment. This is an extremely big opportunity for us. And
12c is just one of the added opportunities we have now to consolidate those environments.
<Q - John S. DiFucci>: Mark, do you...?
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Let me – I'm sorry. And I think one part of your question was 12c, and does it drive even
more growth of engineered systems, especially Exadata and SPARC SuperCluster, and the M6 in-memory machine? I
would say, absolutely yes.
<Q - John S. DiFucci>: Yeah. So Larry, the – and my question kind of goes back to something you said earlier,
especially with the multi-tenancy option, because our due diligence in talking to customers anyway was this is
something they were waiting for so that they can put multiple applications on one Exadata and be able to manage those
applications in isolation, in a way that they couldn't before. And it just seems like that brings that step function up in
efficiency, and I was just wondering if anybody's actually done that, at least in their labs yet? Or I mean it just – it
makes a lot of sense, but are you seeing any of it yet?
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Yeah. We've seen a number of customers check it and do it in the laboratory. And of
course, this is actually what Mark was saying. They have lots and lots of Oracle environments, and they want to
consolidate it onto a smaller number of machines and reduce the amount of labor required to manage all of those
machines. Exadata, with all this extreme performance, a lot of people have questioned the size of the Exadata market,
saying well, how many people need that kind of extreme performance?
Well, it's not a matter of one Exadata machine providing extreme performance to one application. It's one Exadata
machine that allows you to get rid of 50 machines or 100 machines, and consolidate those 100 separate applications and
those 100 separate databases on that single Exadata machine, and then manage it as a single environment. And that's

exactly what the multi-tenant option does. So it's what Mark was saying; our customers spend a fortune managing tens,
hundreds, thousands of different Oracle environments, different Oracle versions.
They have to patch them, upgrade them, back them up, do all of those things. We can simplify that, make that a more
reliable process, make that a less expensive process by using the multi-tenant option on top of Exadata. So it's a huge
opportunity for us to sell into our installed base, lower our customers' overall cost of managing the Oracle environment,
and get them a better overall experience in terms of performance, reliability and maintainability.
<Q - John S. DiFucci>: Great. Thank you very much.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Okay. Next question, please?
Operator
We'll hear from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Great. Thank you. Safra, you've built one of the most profitable companies in technology as
measured by operating margins. And I guess I just wanted to ask how we should think about the puts and takes you see
as related to Oracle's non-GAAP operating margin expansion as you look out over the next two years to three years?
<A - Safra Ada Catz>: Well, I think what you can see in our numbers right now is that year-over-year, the difference
is really we've invested in sales capacity right now as compared to last year, and we expect that to pay off. So
remember, the big things that impact our margins are first; our enormous installed base of customers who pay us either
for license updates and product support or for running systems for them. And those numbers are going to continue to
grow.
Simultaneously, as you know, as Mark talked about, and he's going to chime-in in a second; we decided that we were
really going to lean in to the cloud to get market share, and we were going to be able to do it unlike all those cloud
companies. We were actually, still as a company, going to make a large amount of money. And so we've ramped up the
sales organization. We are at full strength. And it takes time for that to pay off.
But at that point, your expenses are at one level, and now the revenues come in. So we think we still have a lot of room
as we expand our installed base, as you know, continue to grow every quarter. And now, we're going to start seeing
expansion in the margins, as the revenues follow – follow-through. Mark, do you want to add to that?
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Sure, sure. I think to add to Safra's point, a lot of that sales resource that we've hired up that's in
our current period expense is driving that 35% bookings growth in cloud. The great news is it's 35% bookings growth
in cloud, and more than – in triple-digits in some of our core Fusion modules. The bad news is it's not license. It shows
up as subscription and becomes a continuous revenue stream for us over time.
So we've hired into that, to Safra's point, put those resources to work, and they are busy building that subscription base.
As that goes through the process of becoming annual subscription, and it becomes recurring revenue, it behaves a bit
more like our – much more like our support business than it would our license business. So we purposely hired up – by
the way, we're really happy now we've had our sales organization in this sales model now for almost a couple of years.
We've had them in the same sales model for a couple of years. We're happy with their progress, and I think this quarter,
and particularly in the cloud, with a number of new logos, the growth in our core Fusion areas, and just the absolute
growth; this is promising. And over a period of time, it will have the effect on operating margins that Safra described.
And remember, when – even when our licenses are flat, and I'm not trying to make that a good number, but even when
they're flat, all that means is we got just as many new subscribers this year as we did last year.
And with our retention rates in support, you know what happens to our operating margins over time. They just continue
to expand. So again, I'll say what I said in my script earlier, I think you got a company here that has fantastic cash flow
with elements of hyper growth inside it. And the cloud is one of them, and we put resources into it to drive that growth.

<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: I better chime in here too, briefly, saying that the mix of our products is changing. And I
know – we get a lot of criticism when we bought Sun, and we've gone through this transition where we had a growing
hardware business, engineered systems, and a shrinking hardware business, commodity systems, as we shied away
from commodity systems and trying to be competitive in that marketplace.
As we more or less completed the transition now, the engineered systems business is now a large business, and has
much higher margins than the commodity business that we've gotten out of over the last couple of years. So the mix has
changed in hardware from low-margin hardware to much higher margin hardware. I'm also including our storage
business in that, by the way. The mix has changed somewhat in our software business, where a larger percentage of our
software business are our annuities, our renewals versus new licenses.
That renewal business is a more profitable business. We think, as our cloud application business gets larger, that's also
one annuity business that promises to be even more profitable than our license business. Time will tell, but we think
we're going through a number of changes in mix to our overall products that we sell, and that's very, very positive for
our margin improvement in the future.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Okay, thank you. Operator, next question, please?
Operator
And that will come from Brent Thill with UBS.
<Q - Brent Thill>: Good afternoon. Larry, on the database side, you mentioned you hadn't seen this level of interest in
a while. And I was just curious, if you could talk through when do you think you'll see the inflection point of 12c
kicking in? Is it a couple of quarters away? Is it a year away? And historically, the database market is considered to be
a single-digit growth market. Anything changed with this release that you think could help accelerate growth beyond
the historical rates that we've seen?
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Well, yeah, I think we will spike beyond the single-digit amount, but given – with the
warning, the caveat that our database business is quite a large business, but I think there will be a spike in that driven
by two things; the multi-tenant option, and I don't want to de-emphasize the in-memory option either. I think you'll see,
I'd mentioned pretty rapid uptake probably starting a little bit in Q3 and then much more in our Q4 in the first half of
the next calendar year.
The in-memory option, I expect people will start playing around with in the second half of the year, but as we get
around this time next year, we'll see good growth being driven by the in-memory option. So again, it's – I have to go all
the way back to 11i in the early days of the Internet when I've seen that much interest in new features in our database.
<Q - Brent Thill>: And a quick follow-up for Mark. Just there's been some ongoing speculation around the sales force
and how they're being structured. I think you just mentioned to Heather's question that there really hasn't been any
change, but I know that question many of us have gotten in the last couple of weeks, and I'm just curious if you could
just comment?
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: I really can't; only in the context of there's just nothing to talk about. There is, at the territory
level, Brent, we don't have any sales people changing territories, changing accounts. We're not re-org'ing anything. If
anything, we're actually very happy with the model we're in, and the continuity of it, and the continuity of the
management, the familiarization of the team with their products; we're driving a lot more training in the sales force.
So one of our real tenets is just continuity; when we say continuity, continuity particularly of the relationship between
the salesperson and the customer; very important for us to have continuity with the customer, and we've made it now so
that territory changes around Oracle are a really big deal. And so that level of discipline is in, and nothing has changed
about it, whatsoever.
<Q - Brent Thill>: Great. Thanks.

<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please?
Operator
That will come from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Hey. Thank you. I want to talk a little bit about the cloud business again. And what do you
see in terms of customer reception? Now you – obviously, you have a very much increasing growth rate here, but how
are you selling that? Is that kind of like an account management control function in terms of you going in and a lot of
deals we are kind of seeing where you just kind of upsell from what you have already? Or are these deals competitive
than what you see in terms of your positioning against the competitors; the pure-play ones? Thank you.
<A - Mark V. Hurd>: Well, I'll take it and let Larry chime in as he sees fit. We go to market by functional area, and
we call on the functional owner of that functional area, particularly in areas like HCM. We'll call on the Chief Human
Resources Officer and talk to them about our solutions. Now, to your point, some of those customers are current
customers of Oracle HR applications, and some of those customers are not. We have, we think, very strong
differentiations in the area of mobility. We think it's a core strength of Oracle HCM. We have social capabilities
integrated into our solutions.
We've got analytics, which is a very big deal, integrated into our application [ph] as opposed to not. (41:03). And we
think these are core differentiations in this case, specifically versus Workday. And so we go directly to the CHRO, and
clearly there's a role of IT in it, but we go at the CHRO, at being we call on the CHRO and then we integrate that sales
process with IT. Now think of us doing that sort of functional area-by-functional area, whether that's with a CMO in
marketing, the Chief Sales Officer in sales automation, et cetera; and we feel very strong about the – Larry made some
comments earlier about our differentiation, the ones I just added. And that's how we go to market.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Perfect. Thank you.
<A - Lawrence J. Ellison>: Yeah. Let me just emphasize, we are organized against our secular competitors. So a while
ago – I mean, Mark has emphasized we haven't made any changes to the sales force in a while, and that's absolutely
true. A while ago though, we decided we had to line up an HCM sales force directly against Workday. That's all they
think about every day is competing against every Workday prospect, and going out there competing against Workday.
We have another team of people that compete against Salesforce in sales force automation. We had another team that
competes against Salesforce in service automation and customer experience. We have another team that focuses on
ERP and SAP. And in so far, it's a cloud ERP, which is a relatively new market, where that team is focused entirely on
Workday. So Workday is really not in cloud ERP yet, but that's an area they would like to get into.
So we watch that very closely. Now, we are organized. We are organized against – by functional area so we can
compete effectively against these new generations of specialists.
<Q - Raimo Lenschow>: Perfect. Thank you.
<A - Kenneth Bond>: Next question, please?
Operator
And that will come from Brad Reback with Stifel, Nicolaus.
<Q - Brad R. Reback>: Thanks a lot. Mark, maybe a quick question back on the sales force and productivity;
obviously, you've hired a lot. It's grown faster than revenue, but maybe you can give us a sense of where we are on the
productivity curve, and you'll reach full productivity this year or is it sometime in next year?

<A - Mark V. Hurd>: No. We would not reach full productivity. Let's again remember what we said a little earlier that
a reasonable amount of our hiring has gone into the cloud. And as a result, many of those resources are selling annual
recurring revenue. And that annual recurring revenue would be 8% of what you would normally have had in the old
license business. So you've got a period of time for those people to get productive in the revenue.
And again, it starts all of what we announced today. It starts with bookings. And then you drive that bookings over –
you drive those bookings over a period of time and you build a subscription base. And normally speaking, you would
think it would take you a couple years to three years to get to that full productivity of the equivalent of a recurring
stream of revenue to what you would've typically seen in license. Now, that said, many – some of our resources have
gone into what you would think of as the traditional license business.
And by the way, you see some of those results in areas like what we have in Europe. So an example; we hired up in
Europe, very early in the process that Larry was just talking about, and it's showing up with our market share gains.
And you see evidence of that across many of our regions. So the best way to answer that is it's sort of a hybrid in tech.
We have more resources; we're seeing the productivity helping us gain share in many of our core markets; and in cloud,
you're in early days.
And as we talked about today, it all starts with bookings. I would say that we've gotten more and more comfortable
with now the size of the distribution pie. And really, our focus now is on their productivity. The engineering of the
sales process; Larry and I've gone through a couple of examples up today, meaning that they're standard sales plays for
our sales force to go execute, training our sales force, and maturing that sales force. So that's really where we are in the
process.
<Q - Brad R. Reback>: Great. Thanks very much.
Kenneth Bond
