MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Accenture fourth quarter fiscal 2014
earnings call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we'll conduct a question-and-answer session.
[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference call will be recorded.
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host and senior facilitator as well as our Managing Director, Head
of Investor Relations, KC McClure. Please go ahead.
KC McClure
Thank you, Steve, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today on our fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2014 earnings
announcement. As Steve just mentioned, I'm KC McClure, Managing Director-Head of Investor Relations. With me
today are Pierre Nanterme, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and David Rowland, our Chief Financial
Officer.
We hope you've had an opportunity to review the news release we issued a short time ago. Let me quickly outline the
agenda for today's call. Pierre will begin with an overview of our results. David will take you through the financial
details, including the income statement and balance sheet, along with some key operational metrics for both the fourth
quarter and the full fiscal year. Pierre will then provide a brief update on our market positioning before David provides
our business outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2015. We will then take your questions before Pierre
provides a wrap-up at the end of the call.
As a reminder, when we discuss revenues during today's call, we're talking about revenues before reimbursements or
net revenues. Some of the matters we'll discuss on this call, including our business outlook, are forward looking, and as
such are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to, risk factors set forth in
today's news release and discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and other
SEC filings. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in this

call.
During our call today, we will reference certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe provide useful
information for investors. As a reminder, our results last year included benefits from final determinations of prior-year
U.S. federal tax liabilities and a reduction in reorganization liabilities. We include reconciliations of non-GAAP
financial measures where appropriate to GAAP in our news release or in the Investor Relations sections of our website
at accenture.com. As always, Accenture assumes no obligation to update the information presented on this conference
call.
Now let me turn the call over to Pierre.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, KC, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.
We are very pleased with our results for both the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year. Starting with the quarter, our
strong revenue growth of 8% was broad-based across the different dimensions of our business and, coming on top of
our strong growth in Q3, enabled us to deliver an excellent second half of the year.
For the full year, we increased market share, generated record revenues and new bookings, grew EPS faster than
revenues, and generated strong cash flow, all while continuing to invest to further differentiate our business and
delivering significant value for our clients and shareholders.
David will provide more detail in a moment, but here are a few highlights for the year. We delivered record new
bookings of $35.9 billion. We grew revenues 5% for the year. We delivered earnings per share of $4.52, a 7% increase.
We expanded operating margin 10 basis points to 14.3%. We generated free cash flow of $3.2 billion. And we continue
to have a very strong balance sheet, ending the year with a cash balance of $4.9 billion. We returned $3.8 billion in
cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. And we just announced our semi-annual cash dividend
of $1.02 per share, which is a 10% increase over our prior dividend.
Our performance in fiscal 2014 clearly demonstrated that we are executing very well against our strategy. And given
our strong growth in the second half of the year, I am pleased with the momentum in our business as we enter the new
fiscal year.
Now let me hand over to David. David, over to you.
David P. Rowland
Thank you, Pierre, and thanks to all of you for joining us on today's call.
Let me start by saying that we were very pleased with our overall results in quarter four, as they continue to reflect
positive momentum in many areas of our business and clearly illustrate the relevance of our growth strategy and the
yield we're getting from important investments we've made over the past two years.
Before I get into the details, I'd like to highlight three aspects of our quarter four results which are particularly
noteworthy. First, the most distinguishing aspect of our results was clearly the strong top line growth of 8%, exceeding
our expectations and landing above the top end of our guided range for the quarter. Our revenue growth is underpinned
by continued improved growth rates in many areas of our business, building further on the improvements we delivered
in quarter three. And overall net revenue growth was at the highest levels we've seen since quarter four of fiscal 2012.
Second, our profitability in quarter four came in as expected, yielding 10 basis points of expansion for the full year. It's
noteworthy that we achieved this result while taking actions to continue to align our head count and labor cost in
certain parts of our business. We are pleased with the progress we're making to better position our profitability going
forward.

Third, we generated strong cash flow of $1.5 billion in the quarter, putting us at the upper end of our previously guided
annual range. And of course, we continued to return significant cash to shareholders while at the same time investing in
our business. So we were very pleased with the quarter, and in fact more broadly with our strong performance in the
second half of the year.
With that said, let's now turn to some of the details, starting with new bookings. New bookings for the quarter were
$8.3 billion, resulting in $35.9 billion in new bookings for the full fiscal year, which was at the very top of the business
outlook range provided in June and represents an all-time high in annual new bookings. Consulting bookings were $3.9
billion, with a book-to-bill of 1.0. Outsourcing bookings were $4.4 billion, with a book-to-bill of 1.2.
Taking a closer look at our new bookings, there are several additional points worth noting. For the fourth consecutive
quarter, consulting bookings landed within our target book-to-bill range and reflected good demand for systems
integration and management consulting. For the year, consulting bookings of $17.1 billion were the highest ever, with
management consulting and systems integration both achieving a strong 1.1 book-to-bill and technology consulting
also delivering a solid year at 1.0.
We continue to be pleased with another quarter of solid outsourcing bookings. Results in technology outsourcing
reflected an uptick compared to quarter three, and BPO bookings continue to reflect healthy demand.
Also, there were a number of record highs with our new bookings results in fiscal 2014 in both consulting and
outsourcing and in outsourcing particularly in BPO, which had a 1.7 book-to-bill. CMT, Financial Services, and H&PS
set record highs as well. And finally, we continued our track record of winning large transformational projects, with
nine clients with bookings in excess of $100 million, bringing the total for the year to 39.
Turning now to revenues, net revenues for the quarter were $7.8 billion, an increase of 10% in U.S. dollars and 8% in
local currency, reflecting a positive 1.5% FX impact, consistent with the assumption provided in June. Consulting
revenues for the quarter were $4.0 billion, up 6% in USD and 4% in local currency. Outsourcing revenues were $3.8
billion, up 15% in USD and 13% in local currency.
Looking broadly at the major drivers of growth in the quarter, outsourcing was a highlight coming in even stronger than
we expected, driven by strength in both BPO and technology outsourcing. In addition, we continue to be pleased with
the strong contribution of our digital-related services to our overall growth.
Turning to the operating groups, the momentum in Communications, Media & Technology continued with 12%
growth, the highest in 10 quarters. Broad-based growth was driven by three notable areas: E&HT, outsourcing, and the
Americas. In products, the 12% growth was broad-based across all industries and in both consulting and outsourcing.
H&PS grew 9% in the quarter coming from both public service and, more notably, health where we continued to
deliver double-digit growth in consulting and outsourcing.
Financial Services grew 8%, up from last quarter led by very strong growth in outsourcing and within our banking and
capital markets industries. Resources was flat in quarter four and while we still have some work to do, we were
encouraged by progress in several areas. We had growth in three of the four industries, while natural resources
continues to be challenged globally.
Moving down the income statement, gross margin for the quarter was 31.7% compared with 33.2% for the same period
last year, down 150 basis points. Sales and marketing expense for the quarter was 11.8% of net revenue compared with
12.6% of net revenues for the fourth quarter last year, down 80 basis points. G&A expense was 6.1% of net revenues
compared with 6.7% of net revenues for the fourth quarter last year, down 60 basis points.
Operating income was $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter reflecting a 13.9% operating margin equal to the operating
margin for the same period last year. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 30.1% compared with 24.6% for the
fourth quarter last year. The higher rate in the fourth quarter was primarily due to lower benefits related to final
determinations of prior-year liabilities and a higher level of reserve additions.

Net income was $760 million for the fourth quarter compared with $727 million for the same quarter last year. Diluted
earnings per share were $1.08 compared with EPS of $1.01 in the fourth quarter last year. This reflects a 7%
year-over-year increase and includes a negative impact of $0.09 from a higher tax rate this quarter.
Turning to DSOs, our days services outstanding continue to be industry-leading. There were 36 days, up from 35 days
last quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.5 billion resulting from cash generated by operating activities of $1.6
billion, net of property and equipment additions of $101 million.
Moving to our level of cash, our cash balance at August 31 was $4.9 billion compared with $5.6 billion at August 31
last year. The current level reflects the cash returned to shareholders through repurchases and dividends as well as the
acquisitions we made in fiscal 2014.
Moving to some other key operational metrics, we hired approximately 80,000 people in fiscal 2014 ending the year
with a global head count of more than 305,000 and we now have over 205,000 people in our Global Delivery Network.
In quarter four, our utilization was 88%, consistent with the last quarter. Attrition, which excludes involuntary
terminations, was 15%, up from both quarter three in the same period last year.
Now turning to our ongoing objective to return cash to shareholders, in the fourth quarter we repurchased or redeemed
approximately 8.2 million shares for $658 million at an average price of $80.36 per share. For the full year, we
repurchased or redeemed 32.6 million shares for $2.6 billion at an average price of $78.52 per share.
Finally, as Pierre mentioned, our board of directors declared a semi-annual cash dividend of $1.02 per share. This
dividend will be paid on November 17 and represents a $0.09 per share or 10% increase over the previous semi-annual
dividend we declared in March.
So before I turn things back over to Pierre, let me just briefly reflect on where we landed for the full year across the key
elements of our business outlook. Again, new bookings were $35.9 billion at the top end of our guided range. Net
revenues grew 5% in local currency for the full year at the top end of our most recent guided range and in the upper end
of the range provided at the beginning of the year.
As a reminder, fiscal 2013 we had two unusual items that impacted certain metrics. The following year-over-year
comparisons exclude those impacts and use fiscal 2013 adjusted results. Operating margin was 14.3%, within the
guided range we provided at the beginning of the year and spot on the guidance we provided most recently. EPS was
$4.52 at the midpoint of our most recent guided range and at the upper end of the range provided at the beginning of the
year and reflects 7% growth over fiscal 2013 consistent with our objective of growing EPS faster than revenue.
Free cash flow was a rounded $3.2 billion at the upper end of our previously guided range and at the low end of the
range provided at the beginning of the year. And then finally, we returned approximately $3.8 billion of cash to
shareholders, more than $100 million above our initial objective, through $2.6 billion in repurchases and $1.3 billion in
dividend payments. In addition, we reduced our weighted average diluted shares outstanding by about 3%.
So reflecting on the business outlook we provided at the beginning of the year, we successfully managed our business
and delivered on each metric, with several of the metrics landing in the upper end of the range. We're pleased with the
overall improvement we saw in our results in the second half of the year, especially the acceleration in growth we
signaled one year ago.
Now let me turn it back over to Pierre.
Pierre Nanterme
Thank you, David. Our performance for the fiscal year, especially our strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter in the
second half of the year, demonstrates that we're executing the right growth strategy. We are providing relevant and
highly differentiated services that are clearly resonating with the needs of our clients and we are gaining market share
in an environment that continues to be very demanding and highly competitive.

In fiscal year 2014, we made significant investments in our business, including $740 million in acquisition, and we
aligned our organization to be even more relevant, differentiated and competitive in the marketplace. We created
Accenture Strategy, a unique capability and the first in the market, to bring together business strategy and technology
strategy equally and at scale.
We created Accenture Digital by combining our market-leading capabilities in Accenture Interactive, Accenture
Analytics and Accenture Mobility. We now have more than 28,000 professionals working in Accenture Digital making
it the world's largest end-to-end digital capability.
We formed Accenture Operations by bringing together our market-leading business process capabilities with our
infrastructure and cloud services to offer our clients an even more compelling value proposition running key operations
as a service and at scale.
In Accenture Technology, we further enhanced our Global Delivery Network recruiting significant talent and investing
to build intelligent tools to increase efficiency and productivity. We continued to harness innovation through our
Technology Labs and to play a leading role in the technology ecosystem.
And we infused even more talent into our five operating groups, which together serve clients in more than 40
industries, further strengthening our management and technology consulting capabilities. Our people in the operating
groups orchestrates and bring together the very best of Accenture across the entire organization to serve our clients,
helping us to continue to build long and enduring relationships with the world's leading companies.
These investments have positioned us very well to capture new growth opportunities as our clients and the industries in
which they operate continue to be transformed and re-invented every day. In this fast-changing environment, we see the
market becoming more and more polarized around two major themes: digitization to create competitive advantage and
drive new sources of value and rationalization to create productivity and efficiency gains. At the same time, we
continue to see demand for large-scale conservation programs, which has always been Accenture's sweet spot.
Let me bring this to life with a few examples that demonstrate our unique position in the marketplace and the value we
deliver to our clients. Today, all of our clients are facing the imperative to transform their businesses to compete in the
digital world and we are partnering with them on this journey.
A great example is our work with a global media and entertaining company where we are leveraging the full range of
Accenture's capabilities, especially mobility, supply chain and analytics to fundamentally transform the customer
experience by implementing a broad set of digital tools. The centerpiece of this technology is a wearable device that
allows customers to access their hotel room and pay for goods and services. Through our work, we are helping our
clients engage millions of customers each year with a truly integrated and personalized experience.
At the same time, our clients are looking to drive more efficiency and to increase productivity in their operations. A
leading commodity trading and mining company, we are providing finance and accounting and procurement services to
help improve business operations. We are leveraging our end-to-end sourcing, procurement and analytics capabilities
together with the full power of the Global Delivery Network to deliver over $500 million in bottom-line savings while
also providing flexibility for future growth.
The acquisition we made last year of Procurian, combined with our own sourcing and procurement capabilities, makes
Accenture the clear market leader in procurement BPO and has been instrumental in positioning us for many recent
wins in the market.
Finally, our clients continue to focus on large-scale conservation programs. With our extensive industry expertise and
broad global footprint as well as our skills in Strategy, Digital, Technology and Operations, we have built an
end-to-end capability that is second to none and as demonstrated by our strong new bookings for the year, including 39
quarterly bookings over $100 million, Accenture remains the partner of choice for our clients.
A key example is our work in Texas where we are leading the state's effort to build a more efficient and effective
Medicaid program. We are leveraging our healthcare expertise as well as our long track record of delivering claims
processing systems to support 3.6 million Texas Medicaid participants and 45,000 healthcare providers while

processing more than 12.5 million claims each month.
Turning to the geographic dimension of our business, we are very pleased with the strong revenue growth we are seeing
in many of the largest countries in which we operate. Taken together, these countries represent a very significant part of
Accenture business.
Let me start with the United States, our largest single market where I'm particularly pleased with our 10% revenue
growth for the fourth quarter and 8% revenue growth for the full year. I am even more pleased with our sustained
performance in the U.S. over the past four years, where we have consistently delivered high single-digit or double-digit
revenue growth, clearly gaining market share in the largest economy in the world.
In Europe, despite an economic environment that continues to be difficult, we are performing very well in many of our
largest countries, including France, Italy, Germany, and the United Kingdom.
And in Asia-Pacific, our growth in Japan has just been outstanding. Japan delivered very strong double-digit growth for
both the fourth quarter and the full year.
So we ended fiscal year 2014 strong and we have clearly benefited from the investments we have made to build and
launch highly differentiated capabilities both organically and through acquisitions; to recruit and develop new talent
with highly specialized skills, including hiring more than 80,000 people; and to further strengthen Accenture's
marketplace positioning and our brand, which is among the top 50 brands in the world.
At the end of the day, the real measure of our success and relevance comes from our clients. And for me, increasing the
number of Diamond Clients, our largest client relationships, is key. I'm delighted that we added 28 new Diamond
Clients during the fiscal year, which brings us to a net total of 141 Diamond Clients, an all-time high. And of course,
we continue to apply rigor and discipline in everything we do at Accenture to increase our efficiency and enhance our
competitiveness so that we can continue to achieve our ultimate goal of delivering sustainable profitable growth over
the long term.
With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide our business outlook for fiscal year 2015. David, over to you.
David P. Rowland
Thank you, Pierre. Let me now turn to our business outlook.
For the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect revenues to be in the range of $7.55 billion to $7.8 billion. This assumes
the impact of FX will be negative 2% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2014. For the full fiscal year 2015, based
upon how the rates have been trending over the last few weeks, we currently assume the impact of FX on our results in
U.S. dollars will be negative 2% compared to fiscal 2014.
For the full fiscal 2015, we expect our net revenue to be in the range of 4% to 7% growth in local currency. For the full
fiscal year 2015, we are targeting new bookings to be in the range of $34 billion to $36 billion. We expect bookings to
be a little lighter in the first quarter and build throughout the year.
For operating margin, we expect fiscal year 2015 to be 14.4% to 14.6%, a 10 to 30 basis point expansion over fiscal
2014 results. We expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 26% to 27%. For earnings per share, we
expect full-year diluted EPS for fiscal 2015 to be in the range of $4.74 to $4.88, or 5% to 8% growth over fiscal 2014
results.
Now turning to cash flow, for the full fiscal 2015, we expect operating cash flow to be in the range of $3.95 billion to
$4.25 billion, property and equipment additions to be approximately $450 million, and free cash flow to be in the range
of $3.5 billion to $3.8 billion.
Finally, we expect to return at least $3.8 billion through dividends and share repurchases and also expect to reduce the
weighted average diluted shares outstanding by approximately 2%, as we remain committed to returning a substantial

portion of our cash to shareholders.
With that, let's open it up so that we can take your questions. KC?
KC McClure
Thanks, David. I would ask that you each keep to one question and a follow-up to allow as many participants as
possible to ask a question. Steve, would you provide instructions for those on the call, please?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Question one will come from Bryan Keane, Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Hi, guys. Good morning. I just want to ask about the acceleration in revenue growth. I think
last quarter was 7% in constant currency, this quarter 8% constant currency and revenue growth. But you're guiding to
4% to 7%, which is a little bit of a modest downtick from the 8%. I just want to get your thoughts on the outlook
compared to where we've been here in the last two quarters.
<A - David P. Rowland>: I think it's important to look at – maybe just to step back – by the way, hello, Bryan. Thanks
for the question by the way. I think it's important to maybe look at that in a broader context and reflect on where we've
been and where we're going let's say over a three-year period. So two years ago in fiscal 2013, we had growth at about
4%. This year, the year we just completed, we had growth at 5%. And while the 4% to 7% reflects what we think is a
full range of reasonable outcomes, as I've always said clearly, we're working hard to be as high in that range as we
possibly can.
So if you take the upper half of the range and assuming that the market conditions and our own efforts allow us to land
in that space, then you start to see the progression of our building business momentum from 2013 to 2014 to 2015 if we
can deliver in the upper end of that range, which is 5.5% to 7%. And while 4% to 7% is our range, it reflects what we
think are possible outcomes depending on what happens with market growth. Everything that we do every day is to
drive profitable growth and to work to be as high in the range as we can. So you're right, but if we deliver, if we
execute at the upper half of the range, then that is indicative of the momentum that I think you got from Pierre's
comments and from my comments.
<Q - Bryan C. Keane>: Okay, and just maybe a breakout between consulting and outsourcing in that outlook. And
then I just wanted to ask on the bookings. They're essentially flattish to slightly down I think on the guidance. I just
want to get a sense of how you guys see the market going forward. Thanks so much and congrats.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Thank you, Bryan. On the bookings, Bryan, really this is the approach we've taken really
since we've been a public company, where we peg our bookings range to our revenue range at our book-to-bill target,
and it's very simply that math. And we're much more focused on year in and year out delivering against our book-to-bill
objective in the year than we are on the year-over-year growth in new bookings because bookings can be lumpy not
only quarter to quarter but they can be lumpy year to year.
And as we pointed out, we just had an exceptional year in fiscal 2014, with roughly $36 billion in bookings. And if we
land in the $34 billion to $36 billion range, as we're guiding to, that would imply that we'll be within our book-to-bill
targets, that supports our revenue ambition for the year and that's a result which we would feel good about based on the
book-to-bill objective. So that's the logic there.
On the revenue growth by type of work, outsourcing, we're thinking in our guidance in the high single-digit to low
double-digit range. And in consulting, probably relatively consistent with this year, could be a click lower but could
also be a click higher so in that kind of general range.

David Grossman, Stifel Financial.
<Q - David M. Grossman>: Hi, thank you. I wonder if we could just go back, David, to some of the commentary
earlier in the year, I guess even on the call about the margin pressure resulting from the need to re-mix some of the
labor content. And while we recognize that's clearly an ongoing process, can you help us better understand when you
would expect to reach a more favorable balance at least based on where you are right now?
<A - David P. Rowland>: As you would expect, we began taking actions on that really as we transitioned into the
second half of the year in both quarter three and quarter four. David, as you mentioned, it is an ongoing process so
we're always focused on tuning the supply side of the equation but within the supply side tuning the payroll efficiency
in our P&L. As I referenced in my comments, we did have actions that were noteworthy, which is why I called them
out in the fourth quarter, reflecting what we're doing on the supply side and payroll efficiency side in the fourth quarter.
And that was accounted for, if you will, in the results that we delivered.
What I would say is that while this is an ongoing process we have seen a number of important areas of improvement in
our profitability as we progressed into the second half of the year. We have seen good progression in payroll efficiency
but yet more work to do. We have seen very good progression in contract profitability, which has gotten, which has
been sequentially better in quarter three as compared to quarter two, and then again in quarter four as compared to
quarter three. We have seen improvements in our business operations cost. And so when you peel back the P&L and
you look at the underpinning, if you will, of our operating expense structure against our revenues, we have had some
good improvement in the second half of the year, which we will build from further as we move into fiscal 2015.
<Q - David M. Grossman>: Thank you for that. And then just on the cash flow, if my math is right it looks like your
fiscal 2015 guidance for free cash flow may actually exceed net income. And again recognizing there are going to be
several moving pieces in any given year, can you help us understand the various puts and takes this year other than the
lower bonus accrual last year?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, David, the free cash flow to net income metric is 1.1. Within the range it's 1.1, which
puts us back in the same territory as where we have been in many years in the past. When you really step back – I mean
at a high level when you really step back and look at our cash flow, there's a number of things that drive it. One is the
efficiency of our cash operating expenses in the year, so our cash operating expense efficiency in relation to the
revenue.
The second thing that would be a driver would be the year-over-year change in DSO and I'll point out that while we're
very pleased with our DSO even with the day increase that we had in the fourth quarter, we have allowed in our free
cash flow guidance the possibility of a continued uptick of a day to day-and-a-half in that range. Certainly, we'll work
hard to try to make sure that doesn't happen but we've allowed for that. So that's a factor.
The other factor would be large cash outflows. You mentioned what we pay out in variable comp is one but another big
swing factor is tax cash payments. Tax cash payments are a significant cash outflow for a company of our size and they
can vary significantly year-to-year and they will be higher next year than they were this year.
<Q - David M. Grossman>: Thank you.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Hopefully that helps.
<Q - David M. Grossman>: No, it does. Thank you very much.
<A - David P. Rowland>: All right, thank you.

<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: Thanks. I just want to talk a little bit about the cash strategy and the capital structure strategy
for a moment because you're in a year now where clearly you're showing some pretty good trends on the key revenue
segments you have. Financials are going, as you guys said, very well, the healthcare segment's growing well again and
you've had some very good growth in constant currency in the quarter relative to the beginning of the year.
When we look at that and we look at your underlying EPS growth it's still less than 10% just given the dynamic of
margin expansion being 10 basis points to 30 basis points. And what I'm trying to figure out here is your cash use. You
said 2% is going to – the share count should come down by about 2%. Can you just give us your thoughts, maybe
Pierre, on how the company thinks about the EPS growth in the framework of the long-term strategy? What kind of
target are you really looking at over the long haul because you definitely have more cash flow that could be put to
work, especially if you think about using your balance sheet.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Let me start and David will give more comments on this. Our capital allocation strategy and
cash allocation strategy has always been very clear and very straightforward as you know. The different buckets where
we're using your cash would be internally to fund our capital expenditure.
The second bucket will be around acquisitions and what we've seen these last three years is we've been ramping up the
acquisition and we will continue to do so as long as we could find the right opportunities. But this is our expectation
that we will continue to deploy capital to acquisition. We set in our mental model something around 15% of the
operating free cash flow, if I'm right.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yes.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: And it might be anything between 15% to 20% because we believe based on our results that
we have demonstrated we can make the right acquisition in order to create new capabilities and boost organic growth
on top of that. And then the rest, our strategy has always been to return a very significant portion of our cash to our
shareholders through share repurchases and dividend. What you've seen from a dividend standpoint, very consistent to
what we said is a kind of, I would say, evolution on the way we are delivering our dividend, with some what I would
qualify solid even robust increase year over year.
And then we continue on our share repurchase strategy to make sure – and this is what we communicated in an IA Day
a couple of years ago that we will continue to make sure there's not going to be any dilution between the shares we are
issuing as well as the share repurchase. So we own that strategy very clearly and it's still the strategy we're planning to
execute moving forward. But maybe, David, you can give more color.
<A - David P. Rowland>: In fact, you summarized it very well. When you look at...
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: I'm applying to be the next CFO...
<A - David P. Rowland>: I think that was a good interview, Pierre. In terms of the 2% which you referenced, that's in
the range of really what we've done on average since we've been a public company. I think that – I haven't looked at the
calculated number lately but I think it's probably like 3% and probably the average. That reflects what we did in the
earlier years of being a public company, but 2% to 3% is the range that we've been in.
When you look at our EPS range this year, which is 5% to 8% growth in USD terms, this is a year where we do have
two headwinds that you don't necessarily have in every year. One is the 2% FX drag and then the other is we do have a
higher expected tax rate. And so you look at the 5% to 8% in the context of covering an FX drag and a, in this
particular year, a higher tax rate and then you can start to extrapolate what you think is possible in years where we don't
have those. And so that kind of gives you maybe a way to think about our EPS.
<Q - Darrin D. Peller>: All right, that's very helpful, just one quick follow-up. Last through the year margins were a
little below what you expected. You're now calling back once again for 10 basis points to 30 basis points of margin
expansion in line with how you guys like to deliver. So I mean is it fair to say that the pricing pressure or the offshoring
questions that we had seen that may have affected that has been steady or potentially abating, now it's getting better?

<A - David P. Rowland>: I would say that the inflection point that we saw in the first half of the year is more stable
but yet the trend continues. I think what we saw in the first half of the year was an inflection point where there was a
period of acceleration, which I pointed out at the time is not unusual. We've had to manage through inflection points
previously and so that's what we're doing now.
On the pricing overall, and if I talk about pricing in the context of the margin quality on the deal, on our bookings, our
pricing I will say now has improved in the second half of the year. I was hesitant to say that in the third quarter because
we don't want to jerk back and forth on pricing. We want to see a trend. But now that I've seen the two quarters strung
together, our pricing is defined as the margin quality of the work we put on the books was better in the second half of
the year than it was in the first half of the year. So in that sense we have seen improved pricing in the second half of the
year.

Operator
Tien-Tsin Huang, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Great. Thanks. Good morning.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Good morning.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Just I wanted to ask – hey, David. Hey, Pierre. I just wanted to ask about the visibility into
the 10 to 30 basis points as well on the operating margin front. Especially curious about gross margin because I heard
the comments on you're taking action on improving profitability. Is that action – it sounded like also work to do. So is
that subject to market conditions in terms of what you're going to do? Is there something that's in flight today? I'm just
trying to get a better appreciation of, again, the visibility into that 10 to 30 basis points.
<A - David P. Rowland>: There's really if you think about it, Tien-Tsin, there's – maybe I'd call out four things that
we're focused on to deliver the 10 basis points to 30 basis points and some of these are things that you'll understand
very well. The first thing at the core of what we're focused on is overall payroll efficiency. And we referenced that in
certain parts of our business as we had this inflection point, there were some payroll inefficiencies that had resulted
from that, which we would address beginning in the second half of the year and we've done just that.
Now that is ongoing but yet what we've done so far has some benefit into next year. But job number one with margin
expansion for us is payroll efficiency. And I think we've proven that if you look at it over a period of time, we're very
good at doing that, but we're certainly not immune to having a quarter or two where business conditions change where
you can't just turn the dial at the moment.
The second thing we're focused on is our overall contract profitability. And that means for each dimension of work we
do, we're working to optimize the profitability in the context of that market, so if you take what we do in digital or
application services or Accenture Strategy as an example. But then the other part of that is that we have a diverse set of
businesses within Accenture now. And so the other dial is making sure that we have the right mix across the different
offerings, businesses that we have so that at the portfolio level we're optimizing the overall contract profitability.
The third thing that we're focused on is business operations efficiency, which is the cost of us just running and
managing our business, which is an ongoing objective. And so maybe I'll just stop there. But those are the three big
things, and we have our sights set on actions around each of those areas. Now it's on us to deliver, but there isn't
anything that happened in this year. Even reflecting on our second quarter call, there's not anything that's happened this
year that has taken our eyes off of our focus on modest margin expansion, which we've defined as 10 to 30 basis points.
<Q - Tien-Tsin Huang>: Okay, that's helpful. So can you just quickly elaborate on – I don't know if you gave it, on
head count growth targets this year? And as my real follow-up, just the acquisition contribution in fiscal 2015, I'm

curious how overall acquisitions are performing. And we've seen some larger acquisitions in the space, and I'm curious
if your appetite to do deals has changed in any way. That's all I had Thanks.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Let me comment first on the inorganic 2014 to 2015, and then maybe Pierre would want to
comment just on our acquisition philosophy and strategy. So, Tien-Tsin, you'll remember that on the last call, I said that
the inorganic contribution would be in the 1.5% to 2% range in 2014, to be clear. I'll just remind everyone that we
measure inorganic on a rolling four-quarter basis. So from the time an acquisition comes on the books for four quarters
we include it in our inorganic number. After that it becomes part of our organic engine, if you will.
So where we landed the year is that the inorganic contribution, which we felt very good about, was closer to 2% than
1.5%. And we do expect next year that part of this is just the timing of our – we had our most significant acquisition
activity in the first half of this year, so the timing is such that the inorganic contribution next year will be closer to the
1% range. And so when you think about organic growth in 2015, that's all in the mix of the 4% to 7% as well. We feel
very good about what we see in our organic business, and hence we've got the range of 4% to 7% even with the lower
contribution of inorganic.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes, on acquisition, what you've seen this last couple of years is all the effort we made and
yielding results now to position our portfolio of businesses for growth in this new environment of mainly digital
computing world. And so we've been working hard on this and we've been using acquisition to accelerate this
repositioning, especially in two areas of our business. One is what we're calling now Accenture Digital and the other
one being Accenture Operations. We have really channeled significantly our investment in these two areas to provide
the right response to the market, which is quite keen to buy on digitalization and, on the other end, on rationalization.
We deployed, if I remember well, around $800 million...
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yes.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: ...in fiscal year 2013, $740 million in fiscal year 2014. So it's giving you a sense about the
level of cash we might deploy in the context of the strategy, which doesn't mean that if we had opportunity we can't do
more. If we believe there is an opportunity, we need to capture that will significantly enhance our capabilities both in
the digital world or in the operations world or in some of our markets around the world, and we will be prepared to step
in.
Again, we're not changing the overarching philosophy. We're making acquisition to grow on top of these acquisitions
and to acquire unique and differentiated capabilities we can grow then organically. And this is exactly what we did with
Procurian, and this is exactly what we did in the past with acquisition with Fjord, avVenta, and Acquity. So this is the
mental model, capabilities deploying in the range of $800 million plus the opportunity to deploy more if this is
necessary, with always the perspective to scale and to scale rapidly to take a market-leading position.

James Friedman, Susquehanna, please go ahead.
<Q - Jamie E. Friedman>: Hi, thank you. Pierre, in the fiscal Q2 conference call, you had suggested that Accenture
Digital, I think the language you used was growing solid double digit. I was wondering if you'd be comfortable giving
us an update as to the growth rate as of the end of the year.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Regarding Digital?
<A - David P. Rowland>: Digital, yes.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: I'm taking this opportunity to – I would like, please, to read – I'm very impressed with the
note you communicated on us, and I liked especially the call to action. A good offense is a good defense, and I think
this is exactly what we do at Accenture. We're always playing offense. And indeed for us playing offense is to take
some very significant steps in Digital because this is the segment of the market which is growing. We anticipated that a
few years ago and we definitely accelerated our growth strategy regarding Digital.

If you will, today and probably for the first time, we're going to communicate this number outside, but we feel very
confident now we can communicate that number of our Digital business because it's extremely analytical-based and the
scope is very precise. Today, what we're doing with Accenture Digital is around 17% of our business, growing in the
double digit, so around $5 billion revenue in fiscal year 2014 at Accenture. And I'm indeed very pleased with that
because this is a business which is growing fast, double digits, which is extremely relevant for our clients and which is
now meaningful in the business of Accenture when you're starting to hit 17%, trending certainly to the 20% of the
business. It is a meaningful business and I'm extraordinarily pleased with the repositioning we've been undertaking.
<Q - Jamie E. Friedman>: I'll need to pay more attention to my titles now that I know you're reading them. I wanted
to ask in that same regard. Do you have any observations, Pierre, about which operating groups it's more prevalent in or
which geographies it's more prevalent in? Those would be my follow-ups. Thank you.
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Sure. What's good, if you will, or impressive with Digital, it's pervasive across the patch. It's
clearly a set of technologies, and I'm talking about, of course, the digital consumer, the digital enterprise, the digital
operations all related to analytics; of course, cloud-enabling technologies usually known as SMAC in the past – social,
mobile, analytics, cloud – is absolutely pervasive across the board.
So we're starting to see good traction, of course, with more the B2C industries, if you will. I'm thinking about retail. I'm
thinking about consumer goods, financial services, telecom. Good appetite for that. Appropriately, we see the second
wave of digital impacting now more the B2C businesses. I could have mentioned healthcare. So healthcare is probably
an hybrid because it's B2C as well as B2B. And then you're moving to more of the manufacturing kind of organization
with what we're calling the famous IoT, the Internet of Things, and we are taking step as well to move from the B2C to
the B2B2C and from the B2B and from the digital consumer to the Internet of Things.
So the early adopters, we're very pleased with them. They are the usual suspect but now we see good traction in other
part of the business and I'm thinking even about resources where we're starting to put digital in what we're calling
digital plant and digital operations. And things we are doing with some of our partners and we have recently created
joint ventures as you might have seen with General Electric around aircraft maintenance as well as Intelligent Pipeline,
which is the new launch we made with General Electric, and on the other side of the spectrum, with Siemens around
the Smart Grid. So I'm extremely pleased to answer that question. I guess you see my excitement playing the offense.
Operator
Lisa Ellis, Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Lisa D. Ellis>: Good morning, guys. I'm happy to be joining these calls. I wanted to ask a couple questions about
the labor market and get your take on how you're seeing trends in the labor market. If I just look at – your attrition
picked up again this quarter. Gross profit has ticked down. It looks like your accrued payroll is down year-on-year. So
you could read into that that you're seeing some labor pressure in service delivery, especially given your GDN mix has
been constant now for 6 or 7 quarters. So just want to see if that's consistent with what you're seeing and in that context
how you see that trending going into next year.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Yeah, I would – maybe let me just pick up on the last thing you said. If your read-through is
that we're seeing it in service delivery – by the way, Lisa, welcome to the call. I'll just go back and point out again that
our contract profitability, which is our service delivery, has actually improved sequentially the last two quarters. So that
is on an upward trend.
Lisa, you also referenced gross margin and there's a lot of things that go into gross margin beyond just the contract
delivery cost. You have, for example, things like training and recruiting, and we typically bring a lot of people on board
in the fourth quarter, and this year that was especially true as our revenue was growing as an example. You have other
things that would impact, for example, I referenced supply side actions that we've taken in those parts of our business
where we're dealing aggressively with fine-tuning the overall payroll efficiency and when we do that, those costs can
go through gross margin.

And then there can be the normal ebb and flow whereas in one quarter we can have a lot of business development
activity, in another quarter just even beyond new hires, you might have a heavy training quarter and the overall payroll
efficiency isn't changing just where people charge their time as. That's why we repeatedly say that to understand our
business, you really have to focus on operating margin and that's really the bottom line.
Lisa, you also referenced the attrition number going up, which I called out. It did go up but at the 15% level that's well
within our range and really frankly well within the norm of services companies like ours. We focus every day on our
people, on market relevant compensation, on employee engagement, which we measure regularly on pulse surveys, et
cetera, and that is a core part of our culture and that will always be taking care of our people and our clients first is
really what we focus on.
<Q - Lisa D. Ellis>: Terrific and then my follow-up is actually in the BPO side, you highlighted that or called that out
as one area of particular strength. Can you just elaborate a little bit on what service lines in particular and is the service
mix in there evolving as you're seeing increased demand on BPO?
<A - Pierre Nanterme>: Yes, absolutely. So BPO, which is now part of what we're calling Accenture Operations,
where we put together our infrastructure services and business process services, if you will, to create what we believe
going to be a unique value proposition in the marketplace in the context of moving more and more BPO, provide more
and more BPO as a service on platforms and all of this cloud-enabled. So all of this – this is the essence of the creation
of Accenture Operations.
And again, I think we are making in the market very significant steps because, as far as I know, we are the only one
who today are proposing this opportunity. So BPO is an excellent answer to what I call before the rationalization
agenda of our clients to get more efficiency and more productivity. Again, BPO is pretty hot across the board when
you're looking at our results and especially around what we're calling the horizontals – finance and accounting, HR
administration, and of course procurement – where we are clearly now the market leader.
We are selling these three capabilities from a BPO standpoint across all industries. I'm thinking about our recent win in
Financial Services with a European bank where we are now driving all their finance and accounting operations.
Of course, from an F&A, we communicated around this big win with this oil and gas company in Europe, a giant as
well. We're doing all the HR administration of one of the largest consumer good company in the world and I can
mention this, and extremely recently in electronic equipment, we've been selected to be clearly their backbone in
running their finance and accounting, their HR, their IT and part of their sourcing operation to support them in one of
the largest scale transformation program today in the industry.
So it is pretty hot and again, I'm coming back at the heart of what I call repositioning or rotating our businesses, if you
will, from what we were and we are still famous for the more classic ERP and technology business. We continue and,
of course, to be competitive in that space that we added two big engines for growth at scale, double-digit extremely
meaningful for Accenture. Accenture Digital, on the one hand, I mentioned this $5 billion business and Accenture
Operations, on the other hand, which is another formidable machine for growth.

<Q - David M. Togut>: Could you quantify – good morning. Could you quantify for us the 2015 average wage
increase and also the average price increase for 2015?
<A - David P. Rowland>: David, I guess the short answer is no. The reason is, is that when we quote a number like
that on the wage side, it potentially creates a lot of confusion within our employee base where it varies so much
country-to-country. And to have an overall average number sometimes just creates confusion. And maybe I'll just stop
there. We really can't comment on either one of those. Sorry about that but...
<Q - David M. Togut>: But for context, David, we see attrition going up for the last two quarters and that would
suggest we're in an environment of rising wages. Can you just bracket for us possible ranges so we can understand the
gross margin question a little better?
<A - David P. Rowland>: I mean what I can say is there is nothing unusual with respect to our wage increases in 2015
and they are – so I guess, I could say there's nothing unusual. Well, there's nothing unusual in response to what you
perceive to be perhaps a building issue. I think that certainly there are markets and skills that are in higher demand and
when we see those, we respond very proactively with what we do with our comp. But there are also a lot of markets
around the world where there's deflation and deflationary trends for compensation. And so what we always do is we're
market relevant. And so if you're trying to understand is there anything unusual that we anticipate in 2015 with respect
to wage increases, the answer to that is no.
<Q - David M. Togut>: Thank you, that's very helpful.
<A - David P. Rowland>: Okay, thank you.

Thank you, everybody, and thanks a lot for all your good questions this morning. Just in closing the call and reflecting
on what might happen moving forward and as we enter fiscal year 2015, I am confident in our ability to drive profitable

combined with the disciplined management of our operations, we are well-positioned to deliver sustainable long-term
profitable growth.
I want to take this opportunity to thank the men and women of Accenture who every day and every way around the
