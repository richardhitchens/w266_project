MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q3 2013 General Dynamics Earnings Conference Call. My name
is Glen and I will be your operator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will
conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Erin Linnihan. Please proceed.
Erin Linnihan
Thank you, Glen and good morning, everyone. Welcome to the General Dynamics third quarter conference call. As
always, any forward-looking statements made today represent our estimates regarding the company's outlook. These
estimates are subject to some risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the
company's 10-K and 10-Q filings.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Phebe Novakovic.
Phebe N. Novakovic
Thank you, Erin, and good morning. I am pleased to report that we had a very good third quarter with revenues of $7.8
billion and net income of $651 million. We reported EPS of $1.84 per diluted share, $0.14 ahead of the year ago

quarter and $0.03 better than the second quarter this year. This was also $0.16 per share better than consensus. So how
do we get there?
Revenue was 1.7% less than the third quarter 2012. Once again, however, revenues for each of our operating groups
was higher than the year ago quarter except for Combat Systems. The same is true for the first nine months of the year.
Revenue for the first nine months is up over 2012 in our Aerospace, Marine Systems and Information Systems and
Technology groups, offset by a significant decline in Combat Systems revenue leading the company down 1.4% for the
first nine months.
The real story in the quarter, however, is the positive operating leverage achieved in the period. While revenue was
down 1.7%, operating earnings were up 5.7% in the quarter, a clear reflection of positive operating leverage. This
resulted in 12.3% overall operating margins. Net earnings and earnings per share were ahead of Q3 2012 by $51
million and 8.2% respectively. The ratio of net earnings to revenue or return on sales was 8.4%.
With respect to cash, we had $364 million of free cash flow from operations in the quarter, about 56% of net income.
We had $1.3 billion for the first three quarters, about 69% of net income.
In Q3, we repurchased slightly under 1.6 million shares for $134 million. Year-to-date, we have purchased over 9
million shares for $718 million. In addition, if we add to that number, the two dividends paid this year – recall that
there was no dividend in Q1 because it was paid in the fourth quarter of last year. We have returned $1.1 billion of the
$1.3 billion or 87% of the free cash flow year-to-date to our shareholders.
Let's turn to segment reporting for the quarter. First, Aerospace. Aerospace had a better than expected quarter with its
highest quarterly revenue to date. Compared to third quarter 2012, operating earnings and margins were up $108
million and 290 basis points respectively, pretty strong.
On a sequential basis, operating earnings and margins were both somewhat lower as had been forecasted. Gulfstream
margins were good and better than expected but lower than last quarter for the reasons I provided during the second
quarter conference call. Once again, we had good contribution from Jet Aviation where they were operating at a loss a
year ago.
Our expectation in the fourth quarter is that revenues will be approximately the same as this quarter but margins will
not be as good. We will deliver two fewer large cabin aircraft and will experience higher research and development
costs with less scheduled launch assistance payments. We also have some program timing impacts at Jet on
completions, all of which will compress margins.
For the year, revenues will be consistent with prior outlook and margins for the group should improve slightly over
prior guidance to the low 17% range.
Combat Systems. Combat, once again, demonstrated a disciplined performance of a good cyclical reporting 16.4%
margins on revenue approximately 30% lower than the year ago quarter. Land Systems and OTS had particularly strong
margins on continuing cost reduction initiatives and strong program performance. ELS helped by returning to
profitability in the quarter despite these revenues. All in all, a really outstanding performance from an operating
perspective.
Compared to the year ago quarter, margins were up 240 basis points. Sequentially, revenue was somewhat lower but
operating margins were up 230 basis points. We do expect significantly higher revenue in the fourth quarter, but a drop
in margins in our domestic business.
For the full year, revenues should be 20% lower than last year and margins should be mid 14%, 10% higher than 2012
on a pro forma before charges basis.
Marine group. Marine group revenues were higher than Q3 2012, but operating earnings and operating margins were
down $16 million and 110 basis points respectively, entirely as a result of the completion on the T-AKE program in Q4
2012. Nevertheless, operating earnings were good and operating margins at 10% were solid with good performance
across each of our businesses. These are industry-leading margins.

In Q4, we expect lower revenue and some very modest margin compression. For the year, Marine group revenues
should be flat compared to the prior year and margins should be in the high 9% range.
IS&T. IS&T remains a good news story from a revenue perspective. Revenues were higher this quarter than in Q3 2012
as well as the prior quarter this year in a very tough market. Operating earnings and margins are up against Q3 2012 by
$15 million and 30 basis points respectively, and up $18 million and 60 basis points sequentially. This operating result
was driven by improved performance at C4 Systems and AIS.
For the fourth quarter, IS&T should see a bit less revenue than we had in the third quarter with a modest decrease in
operating margins. There's still work to be done here but we are seeing steady improvement from an operating
perspective. For the full year, IS&T revenues could be slightly lower than the prior year and margins should be in the
high 7% range, consistent with prior guidance.
Let me turn to our EPS guidance for the remainder of 2013. Last quarter, we increased our guidance to $6.85 to $6.95
of earnings per diluted share. We are again increasing our guidance somewhat to $6.90 to $7, assuming that there is no
residual impact from the shutdown.
We acknowledge that this quarter was better than anticipated and we are further along year-to-date than expected.
However, I think our guidance, which has modestly increased, is not overly cautious and consistent with the current
environment.
In short, we had a great quarter and are hard at work trying to ensure that the full year will be beneficial for our
shareholders, our customers and our employees.

Erin Linnihan
Now, we will hear from our Chief Financial Officer, Hugh Redd. Hugh?
L. Hugh Redd
Thank you, Erin. Thank you, Phebe, and good morning. I'd like to cover the usual miscellaneous financial items before
the question-and-answer period.
First, net interest expense was $22 million for the quarter versus $39 million in the third quarter of 2012. For 2013, we
expect net interest expense of approximately $85 million. At the end of the quarter, our balance sheet reflects $129
million of net cash, and by that I mean cash in excess of debt. This represents an improvement of $1 billion over the net
debt position of a year ago. The effective tax rate was 31.2% for the nine months of 2013, consistent with that
experienced in the same period of 2012. For 2013, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 31.5%.
During the quarter, we contributed approximately $370 million to our pension plans. And through the end of the third
quarter, we funded over $500 million to our plans with less than $100 million left to contribute in 2013.
Erin, that concludes my remarks and I'll turn it back over to you for questions and answers.
Erin Linnihan
Thanks, Hugh. As a quick reminder, we ask participants to ask only one question so that everyone has a chance to
participate. If you have additional questions, please get back into the queue.

Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please
proceed.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, Robert.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Hi, Phebe. I'm out at NBAA and I wanted to focus on Gulfstream this morning. The
Aerospace book-to-bill...
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: By the way, you and everyone else, I think.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Possibly. It actually looks a little quieter this year, but I think some of that's the timing in
the quarter. I wanted to ask you, though, about the order environment. And I think we've been hearing that for your
platforms, order demand is fairly even across the different areas, across different markets but at a lower level. And this
is reflected, I think, in the 0.6 book-to-bill, and we really haven't seen a 1.0 book-to-bill for a while here. So I was
going to ask you if you could talk about the different markets, and we sense that maybe large cabin is softening a little
bit on the order side, but at the same time, mid-cabin may be getting a little stronger. How would you comment on that?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Look, I am pleased with our book-to-bill and I think year-to-date, we have – it's important
to understand that we've got 10% more airplane orders in units than we did last year. But let me give you a little bit of
background here. That said, we are a few orders shy of planes in the quarter as against our plan, and I think this is
interesting. The quarter started out very strongly but closed slower with getting to contract taking longer. And I think,
certainly, the domestic order activity has been impacted by the uncertainty caused by the government shutdown and
debt ceiling deliberations in Congress.
But at the same time, we've seen a year-over-year growth in emerging markets and the rest of the world. So that's
providing us some stability in our order book. And by the way, on the domestic side, we've got a very strong funnel. It's
just taking, I think, longer to get to contract in the environment of considerable amount of uncertainty.
We've talked about in the previous quarters that when thinking about Gulfstream orders, we need to consider the mix,
right? So, again, this quarter, Gulfstream booked orders for each of our aircraft and the 450 and 550 constituted about
70% of those orders. So I always look at the order in terms of mix because I think that, that tells a pretty good story. So
all in all, we've seen a pretty consistent increase in our mid-cabin 280 and across our large cabin. And I don't see
anything that materially changes that in the horizon that we can see.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: So, Phebe, just to close, on the 650, is it fair that because you're so sold out that the order
environment is a little quieter there? And then the last part of the question is, could you update us on the software
development on that platform? It sounds like that is still progressing but not quite where it needs to be.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: 650 continue to take orders. So I consider that quite positive. And the software
development, I think largely what we've had is superb operating performance of that airplane and it's meeting and
exceeding the users' expectations. We've still got some backend in terms of cabin software issues and that's as much as
user interface training and we need to make some changes. And really modest and moderate, so nothing that has been –
things that are a little bit of annoyance, I think, and quite rightly so to our customers but nothing material. We're not
concerned about that. These are normal and frankly far less sort of squawks that we've had in any of our other
airplanes. So I think that said, that 650 is really a game-changer.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Okay. Thank you very much.

And your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please proceed.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Hi. I wanted to continue on Aero and when I think back a little ways, you all had
commented that ultimately you could produce the G650 given basically a much better operational design for costs that
would be even less than the 550? And what I am interested in is when you look at how this is going in terms of cost
performance and production, how do you see that trajectory today? In other words, are you on the path that you had
hoped? Is it more challenging than you thought? Where does it stand?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: All right. Let's talk about that in two parts. First green, green manufacturing. We have, as
you know, a purpose-built facility along with the fact that we design for produceability. So both of those have
improved our learning curve as we have continued to move green aircraft through our facility and through the line. So
we're not at our optimal. You wouldn't expect that. In fact, I don't know where optimal is and we won't know until we
hit it and our experience is that no matter where we are in the maturity of our platforms, we do get better and better and
better.
So with respect to green, we are in line with and even a touch ahead of where we anticipated we might be. But I think
we talked about early on this year that we had yet to – we had a disconnect between green and completions. So we have
largely taken care of what I term the disequilibrium between the two but we haven't gotten to a steady running rate on
green, or on completions and margins on completions. So that's going to take some time and have provided some
upside but it's going to take some time for us to work through that. But all in all, we're very, very pleased with the
manufacturing process on the 650.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: And when you look at completions, what is making that so challenging? Is this more
challenging than perhaps you've seen on earlier programs, say the 550?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Absolutely not in this stage of the development, right now. Now, going back two quarters,
yeah, it was far more challenging because we had built up this backlog of green in anticipation for the flight
certification and then we had an awful lot of fairly expensive rework. But we're past that, we're through that and so our
experience now is frankly it's the completion challenges aren't as great as they were in the early days of the 450s and
550s or the 5s and 4s, but nonetheless, we haven't hit full stride there and we probably have a little bit ways to go
before that happens. That's just normal learning as we come down various learning curves.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Okay, very good. Thank you.

And your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Research (sic) [Shapiro Research] (17:32). Please
proceed.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Hi, good morning, Phebe.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, George.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: I just want to push a little bit on your Gulfstream margin. I mean that would imply like the
fourth quarter has got to be like about 16% substantially below this quarter on similar revenues, which would tell me
there's maybe $25 million of these added expenses that you were talking about. So could you just break out how much
of that you think is R&D and some of the other issues you mentioned?

<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Look, I think some of that's going to be available in our Q to the extent you can parse it
and I don't want to really give you the each of, but let me give you just some general magnitudes. We have pushed
R&D to the right as a normal part of – as we've gotten into our development program. That will hit us in the fourth
quarter. At the same time, launch assistance is an important part of our overall product development, and the launch
assistance comes in lumpiness. So it's a little less in this quarter. So that's a fairly significant part of what's driving the
margins down. In addition, we've got some timing issues at Jet, really fourth quarter, first quarter 2014 kinds of issues
that are also having some margin compression.
So in general, we're looking for margins in the close to 15.7% range in Aerospace for the fourth quarter as I've kind of
articulated. And we're going to have a few fewer large cabin deliveries, which is often what happens in the fourth
quarter as we move around airplane deliveries to suit the needs of our customers. So it is a combination. You can
imagine with a big business like this, there's a lot of moving parts. It's a combination of those items that I've already
articulated.
<A - Erin Linnihan>: Glen, let's take the next question.
Operator
And the next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Please proceed.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Hi. I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about cash flow. It looks like you
contributed a little bit more to the pension plan than, I think, you had planned. But in the past you talked about being
able to get to 90% of net income in free cash and then use more than 100% of that towards buyback and dividend. That
would imply an awfully steep fourth quarter. And is that still on track? And what's going to change between now and
the year end?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah, so before I get into that, let me argue a little bit with the predicate. I don't recall
ever saying that we would contribute more than 100%. That would require going into the balance sheet. And I actually
was very careful not to say that. But I don't want to quarrel on a nit-noid. But I do want to talk a little bit about, and
thanks for asking the question, about cash and cash deployment in several respects.
So first, I think you can see from our schedules in the press release that we have an increase in inventory and work in
process. We are hard working this because I don't like increases in working capital. And frankly, we're having trouble
getting paid in a few instances. So we'll work through that but it's affecting our free cash flow conversion.
Second, we have higher pension contributions that we – and we had planned those at about the $600 million level. We
had expected free cash flow to be below 100% and anticipated around 90% and that was before the government
shutdown and the latest crisis. And third, cash has been coming in late this year. I mean we've been meeting our plan,
but it is coming in far later, usually the last day or two of the quarter. And it's something we had anticipated or
experienced in the first couple of quarters. But I think that this brings me to something that I'd like to share with you.
I'd like to talk to you about the import of the brinksmanship on the debt ceiling and the shutdown at least from my
perspective.
I think we should think about the shutdown in two phases for us. Phase I is DFAS and DCMA civilians were
furloughed, execution on in-process invoice stopped. Phase II, DoD calls DFAS and DCMA back to work, payment
resumed, right? An extended Phase I ultimately challenges liquidity. Simultaneously, this is no news to anybody, the
government took the nation to the edge on the debt ceiling extension. And in my mind, we were forced to gaze into the
abyss where we saw the full faith and credit of our principal customer at risk. That was sobering and suggests that we
need to be cautious with cash as we finish the year and move into next.

And frankly, as I think about it, I think it is premature to assume that the conditions extend in October cannot repeat in
January. It's entirely possible that we find ourselves an extended period of time trapped in Dante's first circle of hell. So
I think all of that suggests that we need prudence and caution as we move into the rest of the year and the beginning of
next year until we can get a more stable plan from the government with respect to both the debt ceiling and funding for
our principal customer.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: But most of that...
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: That's kind of how I'm thinking about cash.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Is that a timing issue though so that if something slips out of this year, or just next year
because of the timing of that cycle? Or is there actually a change in the actual collection?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: No, we're pretty much meeting our plan but I'm mindful that we have seen some timing
issues. They've all cleared largely and within the quarter, but I think we're seeing slowdown in payments certainly by
our government customers and some of the customers for whom we are suppliers. So that just brings some caution in.
There's nothing intrinsically other than those things that I've mentioned that will ultimately affect our cash generation
capabilities. But it's largely a question of timing. Not something that I am alarmed at but something I am watching very
carefully.

And your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please proceed.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes. Thank you very much. So, Phebe, the Gulfstream margin was very significantly better
even though you had this adverse mix shift more towards the 650 and away from the 450 and 550? Can you give us a
little bit more color on some of the issues you laid out? For example, was launch aid was high or how big about and
how big for the year? Was there sequential improvement in the productivity and the profitability of the 650 as well as
the 450,550, ex the supplier price hikes? Was there sequential improvement in Jet versus the second quarter? Thank
you.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: All right. Let me give you a little bit of more detail here. We had higher performance
across all of our lines at all of our new plane production lines at Gulfstream with the exception of the 450 and a little bit
of the 550 because of some of those supplier costs. But ex that clearly productivity increases.
Second, we had one of our best service quarters ever in revenue and margins at Gulfstream. So a very strong service
and margin performance there. And I talked to you a little bit about Jet because that's a good news story compared to
where we've been. Think about Jet in three respects. First, in three lines of business. First is their FBO and service
business. Those have continued since we've owned them to perform very well and exceeding our expectations.
Second is their maintenance business and if you recall in the fourth quarter of last year, we sold or closed a number of
our facilities in Europe, maintenance facilities. So our revenue was lower on maintenance as we anticipated but
margins are up. So I'm very pleased with that.
And then the big muscle movement has been all along with Jet completions. And I've been reporting to you steady
improvement on our operations at Jet. That team has done an excellent job turning around what was a very troubled
line of business and we are at profitability.
Our order book has increased, our funnel has increased but I am very cautious about sales in the completion side
because they're big and they're lumpy and we need to approach that as we do with a fair amount of realism about the art
of the possible good terms and conditions, fairness and ability to meet schedule for our customers. But Jet is a good
news story and that team out there is to be commended. So all of those things – and Jet by the way has been profitable
every quarter this year. All of those elements combined to drive up margins a little bit above where I had anticipated.
But don't get out ahead of me in the fourth quarter because we do have higher R&D. And by the way, you asked a
question about launch assistance in this quarter and third quarter, not material. But in the fourth quarter, it's going to be

less and that's just a question of timing, nothing in specific.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: So when you say launch assistance, is this a payment that you make or a payment that is
made to you?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: In the Aerospace business, suppliers tend to contribute to the development of new
products or refresh. We certainly do when we're supplying to Aerospace clients and on the commercial Aerospace side
and our suppliers do as well. That's nothing new. That's something that we've seen for the last 10, 15 years since we've
been in development.

Your next question comes from the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks. Good morning, Phebe.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, Joe.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: So over in the Combat business, sales have been obviously really kind of trailing off and
we're down 30%. There was a slight uptick in backlog, which was a very good sign. Just wondering if you could revisit
your expectations on bookings, both domestic and international? What you're looking for there and the timing or the
visibility or lack thereof? And even to the extent you're willing to do so looking into next year or the next couple of
years, where you think we're going to start to bottom out?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Okay. Thanks, I appreciate this, so because I think this is an important question. If I go
back and think about it, I explained to you all in January that we're going to work hard to make our order book. But I
was uncomfortable giving you guys guidance around revenue other than the most general particularly in Combat
because while we're going to work hard at revenue, we can't control it. And also you may recall that the guidance I
gave you was without regard to sequestration let alone furloughs and a shutdown, all three of which has happened. So
in a way, it's – I mean frankly, it's no wonder that our revenue is lower. But I think this question deserves a little bit
more clarity and detail. So let me give you that.
Our sales are lower in Combat for three primary reasons and I'll walk through each. First, most of the international
orders we anticipated in the first quarter have not yet materialized and have consistently slip to the right. And clearly
without those, our sales estimates are going to be off. Second, we did not foresee a sharp decline in the military axle
market as a result of the budget uncertainties in the Army and Marine Corps that have impacted both their force
structure and equipment. And while MRAP, the remaining at some level within both of those services, they have been
prioritized in a much lower priority as those services wrestle with the current environment. So we think that as we can
look forward, MRAP reset modernization will occur in the future but not at anywhere close to the level we anticipated.
In my perfect world in a sequestration-free environment, I suspect the outcome might have been otherwise, but that's
not what we're facing.
Finally and third, our U.S. Army customers contracting activity is far slower than anything we had experienced to date
or anything we had anticipated. And I think that's because as they're winding down two wars, rebalancing their budgets
while unable to bring down personnel costs because of sequester rules on top of which they were whipsawed by the
furloughs and shutdowns, their ability to contract has been pressured. So if you combine all of those, it's put a fair
amount of compression on our sales estimates.
That said, as you quite aptly point out, backlog for the quarter was up and our order activity was at the 2012 running
rate of about $1.4 billion and orders were twice the prior quarter. I don't want to get too far into the future because we
are fairly early on in our planning horizon. But I will tell you that for the fourth quarter, we have included some of the
large international orders, which should make up some of the difference reflected in this quarter's volume. But we're
too late in the year to book enough sales to be in the range of our original plan. So sales for 2013 are likely to be about
20% lower at least under our current assumptions. I hope that helps give you a little bit of detail and color to parse

<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: No...
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: ...our sales impact.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: That is helpful. If I might just follow up briefly. Do you expect bookings or where do you
expect bookings to come in, in Q4? And where do you expect to end the year in terms of Combat backlog, if you're
willing to give that?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: I'm not comfortable giving the backlog, but we anticipate several of those international
orders, which have – I think I've been pretty clear and it's been obvious have slipped to the right quarter by quarter. But
the circumstances that we had – the marketing circumstances and the environment that existed in the first quarter are
still here. It's just a question of patience, which is something I'm not particularly good at. But I am nonetheless required
to be patient here, but we continue to see several of those orders coming in, in the fourth quarter.

And your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.
<Q - Myles Walton>: Thanks. Good morning, Phebe, and company.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, Myles.
<Q - Myles Walton>: Can we go back to Gulfstream for a second? Phebe, I think you mentioned in the quarter you
were maybe a couple light or a few light of your plan from an order perspective. And you also mentioned 70% of the
orders, I think, in the quarter were 450/550. Yeah, the question really is can you give us some color on just the 450/550
book-to-bill as you've seen it year-to-date? And would you actually have to see kind of better-than-planned closure of
orders in the rest of the year to keep that production flat?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: I really don't want to get into – no surprise to you but nice try asking into the book-to-bill
by unit because then I'll spend the rest of my time here and execute this on the various lines of airplanes we've got. The
order book and the funnel on the 450/550 have continued and we see an uptick also in the 280. So everything that we
see in our funnel and where we are in that funnel suggest that we just really need on the domestic side some stability
coming from our government with respect to – and the debt ceiling primarily and the shutdown, but primarily the debt
ceiling as we looked at a lot of our domestic customers. And they're a little wary. They're very interested. Interest is up
across all of our lines, airplane lines including the 450 and service revenue is up and continuing to look good so far into
this quarter. So absent some exogenous force like a little contraction in the U.S. economy, we're good to go on
Aerospace.
<Q - Myles Walton>: One quick one if I can squeeze it in. The employees that you're carrying, the 95,700 that you
disclosed in the quarter, you're one of the few, if only, defense companies that actually has grown the employment
certainly in the last couple of years. Is that completely isolated to Gulfstream? And what does that picture look like just
in the defense businesses?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Well, this is actually one of my favorite questions because it's something this management
team and I look at frequently. If you parse this down, it's a tale of two cities. Gulfstream has increased its employees as
you would expect, Marine group somewhat as we begun to gear up and particularly on our research and development
side that are cost plus engineers. IT has continued to increase and based on their order book and their sales. But it is –
so that's a tale of one city. And then everywhere else in some instances, we're down 50% of our sales force.
So this has been extremely painful across some of our businesses. They've done what they've needed to do to respond
to the environment, but I am very mindful of the human impact of all of this. And it's camouflaged by that gross
number. But you can imagine that we work this very, very hard as I see this is a level of our overall productivity, but
there's a lot of specifics embedded there that tell two very different stories.

Your next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Please proceed.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hey. Good morning, Phebe.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, Carter.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Just wanted to go back quickly to the Aerospace margin dynamics you outlined for Q4. And I
wondered if you could help us think about what in that is temporary? I think I heard you say that Q4 and into Q1, you
expect the impact, the timing issue at Jet. But when you look beyond Q4 and into next year, is the R&D or launch
assistance dynamic, does that play a material role in how we should think about the longer-term profitability? Or is
there anything else that we should think isn't sort of temporary from what we're seeing in Q4? I guess the supplier
renegotiation...
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: It's temporary. Well...
<Q - Carter Copeland>: ...for 450/550, anything like that?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah, so it's temporary on R&D and launch assistance which tends to be kind of lumpy
and that we will smooth as we plan for 2014 and I don't want to get too much into 2014. I suspect that the timing issues
on completions at Jet will resolve right away quick. So that's nothing systemic. So when I think about the margin
compression absent what we talked about last quarter on higher supplier cost, there is nothing structural here going into
2014 but as we go through our plating process, I'll have – and on the fourth quarter call, I'll give you an awful lot more
clarity about 2014 and Gulfstream and margins in Aerospace in general. It's pretty typical of our planning process.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: So it really just comes down to the margin performance differential between the legacy large
cabins and the improvement you make on the 650 at this point once you look out there?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: That's right, and that's going to be mix and we'll get – as we plan through next year and
we'll take a look at what our really incremental learning is down each one of those lines. We'll begin to estimate but
that's not where we are yet. Going back to, there's nothing really structural here.

Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Please proceed.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Well, the other surprise was IS&T and in some ways, Phebe, well could – you talked a little
bit about the environment but the business seemed to outperform the environment. Could you provide a little more
granularity and where some of your successes are and where some of your challenges are?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yes. So, look, IS&T has done very, very well and frankly exceeded, I think, everybody's
expectations including mine. This team has worked hard. Without chasing revenue, they've held their own in a tough
environment that's across the board with AIS and GDIT on the revenue side. GDIT has performed very well on revenue
and they're fighting their margins. As you know, that's a very tightly fought environment but they're doing quite well.
C4 has had an outstanding quarter with respect to margins.
So let me give you a little bit of color on this. If you recall, as we entered the year at the end of last year, we had four
separate business units. We've now contracted to three in IS&T because we – for reporting purposes, including GD
U.K. within C4 and C4 margins have been very, very good particularly in light of the drag out of GD U.K. and I think
in the quarter, we had $11 million in charges out of GD U.K. and headwinds for and charges for the entire year-to-date
at about $20 million, so very disappointing out of GD U.K. Very disappointing.

That said, we've got the A team in place there, each one of those programs that we are participating in are strongly
supported by our customer and by the team that we've got in place. So we're meeting the needs of our British customers
to which we're highly attuned and dedicated and have been for many, many years. This is just a prior management team
that took its eye off the ball and so we've got some cleanup. I spent a little time on that so you can understand the
headwinds that that entire group has faced in a difficult market on margins. So I am very, very pleased with where they
are. They've got a pretty good book-to-bill. We've had a steady order intake and we're really on the mend here. GDIT is
quite a powerhouse, disciplined, mature management team and I am very confident where they're all headed. Did that
help you?
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: And I – well, just as a follow-up, I mean, this business in some ways probably has the most
sensitivity to some of the turmoil you described with your major customer.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yes.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: How is it you've been able to do a little bit better? I mean, other than discipline. I mean, is it
– I mean the Army clearly with Combat with its radios and so on, on one hand; you have that market on the other,
there's elements of a withdrawal that clearly should be hurting?. So maybe a little more granularity.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Okay, okay. Yeah, sure. Let me help you and try to parse that a little bit for you. C4 is the
business with the largest exposure to the Army, not exclusive but the largest. The IT business has some exposure, but
we have reorganized in all three of those business units. By the way, don't think that I think reorganization is a panacea
to performance but it's a predicate to improved performance in a down environment. So in IT, we've consolidated a
number of lines of business to take advantage of growth in some businesses in mass. So they are accommodating, they
are somewhat small and offsetting they're somewhat small exposure to the Army. AIS has almost no exposure, in fact,
none to the Army. So that leaves C4.
And I think in that context, let me give you a little bit of color on C4s and maybe this will help you. C4's programs of
record, we've got WIN-T and that network clearly remains the priority. If you think about the Army historically, they've
balanced out force structure with capability and that network allows them to do more with less. So we're fortunate to be
the incumbent on this program of record, and we've been adjusting our business to deliver the capabilities in whatever
deployment schedule the Army is on. So we've had a number of LRIPs approved year-to-date, and we're continuing to
perform on, on that network. And again, we size our business to the demand of the Army.
On the rifle or on the radios, I think it might help you to give a little bit of program color there. As you probably know,
we're the incumbent for both HMS Manpack and the Rifleman radios, which take our network capabilities from the
WIN-T backbone and down to the individual dismounted soldier. And we're currently delivering on both products in
the thousands of units. So I think that that's important in understanding what's driving the underlying demand at C4.
That said, C4 is completely restructuring its business in order to meet the current environment and which will, I believe
going forward, give it significant opportunities to further right size itself and adjust to the demands of its principal
customer. And by the way not exclusive customer, once we get outside the United States. So I am very pleased with the
agility of that particular – all of our businesses, but that business to recognize the environment they're in and take
appropriate actions. So I hope that helps you understand.

And your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Please proceed.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, Jason.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Phebe, I just wanted to ask about the portfolio and whether you feel like this is the right
portfolio or whether there's still some portfolio shaping to do either through divestitures or acquisitions? Just kind of
update us on your view of the portfolio at this point.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Well, let me talk about acquisitions. I think I've been pretty clear in the year that we are
and will be focused on operations. I haven't had any acquisitions on my horizon. I don't now and I'm not looking, so
let's take that off the table. But with respect to the portfolio, my vision hasn't changed. And I've talked to you all about
that balance in our portfolio. With respect to positioning, let's talk about that in a little bit more detail.
In the Platform businesses, it's pretty easy to see that we're the clear market leader with critical mass, right? But in the
IS&T portfolio, it's a bit harder to discern who does what to whom, when, simply because our businesses are each
comprised of thousands of programs. So positioning in IS&T tends to be by line of business, rather than by major
program. So what the IS&T management team and I look at to balance our portfolio pretty much continually is that line
of business positioning, and no real shaping is required now, not of any material issue. We may take some pairing here
and there as we walk through and see what's core and what's not, but so far, steady as she goes.

And your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with Royal Bank of Canada. Please proceed.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Morning.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Phebe, just a quick question for you. In the past, you've given us some idea of what the lead
time is on your Aerospace models in terms of when the next slot becomes available. I think maybe you can give us an
update maybe on the 650, the G450, 550 and the T280 on that basis.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Well, each one of those – well, two of those aircraft are legacy mature programs, right?
And you would expect us to have some significant changes in that environment as we go forward. 650 and 280 are
brand spanking new. So we would think about in the normal course of business, refreshes but I'm – in a several year
time horizon. But I'm not going to get any more specific about that since it seems to be high sport to what we're going
to do, and when we're going to do it. But I can tell you that our planning is very deliberative. It's not reactive, and when
we announce an airplane, it's a real airplane, and not a PowerPoint. So we're on track to do what we've always
anticipated we would do and we'll announce when we're ready.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Does the – the 450, 550 lead time has come down from 18 months, which it used to be, and we
shouldn't be too concerned about that then?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: No. We've got, I think, some availabilities about a year out and we'll continue to work
that. Those are very efficient and highly scalable lines. So we've got enough in our backlog that we're comfortable. So
I'm not particularly concerned about that. If that changes, we'll let you know, but we're looking at the late, late end of
2014, early 2015. So I'm still comfortable that that's a pretty good margin. And then as I said, particularly [ph] there
ahead (51:41), I said particularly in this quarter where we saw a little bit of softening in the domestic environment and I
think that's wholly attributable to the machinations in our government.

Your next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Sterne Agee. Please proceed.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: Yeah, good morning, Phebe.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Morning.
<Q - Peter J. Arment>: A question, I guess on, back on IS&T. I just wanted to dig in a little further. Yeah, you're
consolidating the GD U.K. and I appreciate the color there. When you think about the kind of the business lines, still
50% of the portfolio is on kind of the IT services side. Are there opportunities to kind of restructure or scale that if
needed? I know you've kind of looked at it by lines of business but maybe just some additional color there.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: That management team has, in fact, reorganized to meet the current demand. And so
we've taken our units down from – or the lines of reporting at the macro level from – within IT from four to three,
better streamline, reduce costs. And there, it's a daily fight across thousands of programs in multiple portfolios from
Intel to each one of the services and beyond DoD into non-DoD agencies. So they are doing very well, I think, because
of their reputation and their cost structure in winning more than their fair share of new contract awards. So I'm very
proud of that management team. They're tough, they're mature, they're great businessmen.
<A - Erin Linnihan>: Glen, I think we have time for one more question.

And that question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Good morning, Phebe.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Hi, Ron.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Hope you're doing well. So maybe more of a fuzzy question. We walked through a lot of
details, a lot of the business units. Thank you for all the detail on that. Now that you've been sitting in the role that you
have been for a while, what really has been, from your perspective, maybe some of the biggest challenges that you've
had to deal with in the role as CEO over the last couple of quarters? I mean when you were kind of preparing for the
role and now that you've had it, what has been the biggest challenge?
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Well, I think it's interesting, I don't face these challenges alone. I face them with a
management team. We spend an awful lot of time communicating among each other, as you would expect. And we
have complete goal congruence. We are challenged in some of our markets by an environment but I see that as an
opportunity, frankly. In tough times, that's where you see human beings' character and their mettle and the strength of
an organization. And GD is doing quite well, in my mind, managing what we can control. We're not going to lose a lot
of sleep over those things that we can't control. But to the extent that we can control our operations, we're getting at it
and getting at it hard. So I don't know that there have been any unique challenges. I think we've had a few curve balls
as a country, frankly. I think we got a little bit further down the shutdown and brinkmanship path. And I think any of us
as Americans would be comfortable for but that was an idiosyncratic to General Dynamics, that's just in – at large. So I
think that the challenges have been those that I expected that we were going to see a little tougher environment and
that's the time when you differentiate yourself. So I've been very pleased with the management team and it's about
hanging tough and good leadership across the board.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Yeah, that's it.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: And by that I mean all of us not just me.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Yeah. And then, if I may, just one follow-on, just a quick – one quick detail I don't think we
discussed too much about. In the quarter, the margins in Land Systems were outstanding, right? I mean they were just
about 100 basis points behind...

<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Yeah, Combat, excuse me, yeah, behind Gulfstream. Was there...
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: By the way, they're well aware of that.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: I'm certain they are, right? Was that team catch-ups or I mean how should we think about it?
It was really like...
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: Yeah, recall that, that we are not on team catch-up, okay?
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Okay.
<A - Phebe N. Novakovic>: So look, this was the result of superb operating performance in that group and as they
continue to perform on each one of their programs, they've retired risk and so this was really, a really strong
line-by-line focus on cost reduction. And I think that you've seen – we anticipated this down cycle. We're in a cyclical
business and we anticipated this down cycle and got out ahead of it with a fair amount of restructuring. So that's
coming to fruition. The fourth quarter will see a little bit of margin compression. You haven't asked it, but I'll just give
you a little bit of color.
We've got the remainder of the ATP OTS consolidation costs, which we will cover. It's the right thing to do and will
put us in good position going forward. It's been clear I think from some of the press announcements we've got a bit of a
mix shift at Land Systems as we move from mature programs into the double-V hull and now we're going to pick up
some headwinds on that axle market.
But in general, this is solid performance of a very good management team. And by the way, a lot of these guys lived
through the last downturn post the end of the Cold War. They know what to do and that culture has at both there and
electric both have permeated all of GD. So enough of my proselytizing but that's what happens.
