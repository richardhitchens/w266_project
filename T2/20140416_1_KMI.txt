MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the Kinder Morgan Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on a listen-only mode
until the question-and-answer portion. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is also being recorded. If anyone has
any objections, you may disconnect. [Operator Instructions]
I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Rich Kinder, Chairman and CEO of Kinder Morgan. You may
begin, sir.
Richard D. Kinder
Okay. Thank you, Holly. As usual, we'll be making statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the
Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. We will be referring to Kinder Morgan, Inc. as KMI, to Kinder Morgan Energy
Partners as KMP and to El Paso Pipeline Partners as EPB, and we'll cover all three.
Let me kick it off by saying we had a very good quarter, and we're on track for a very good year. We expect all three of
our entities to meet or exceed the distribution or dividend targets that they have for the full year. I'm going to mention
just a few significant matters before turning the presentation over to Steve Kean, our Chief Operating Officer, who will
talk about specific performance of our business units and also about our backlog, and then to Kim Dang, our Chief
Financial Officer, who will go through the details of the financial results for the first quarter.

Let me start just with a high-level view of our operating performance. Three or four things come to mind. We had
extraordinary gas throughput during the first quarter. We moved what we think is an all-time record for us, 33 Bcf a
day, during the month of January on average, and that's about 33% or about one-third of all the natural gas consumed in
the United States during that month.
In our Refined Products Group, we actually had a pretty nice increase in refined product volumes. We were actually up
5.3% if you count our Parkway project. I think it's fair to strip that out. If you strip that out, we were up 3.7% in
Refined Products volumes, and that's versus an estimate from the EIA of 1.1% across all of the United States.
Over in our CO2 segment, we had another very nice quarter at our SACROC unit where the oil production increased by
4%, lifting the overall oil volumes in our CO2 segment, allowed it to be up by 5% overall, and on a GAAP basis, net to
our share, up 7%. But I think SACROC is a more meaningful number because we did have some improvement in some
of our newer startup projects also.
In our Terminals, we had a very nice increase in our earnings before DD&A, driven by both new projects coming
online and organic growth, as well as the tanker APT acquisition which was closed in January of this year.
On the business development front, we had an outstanding quarter. Steve will discuss the project backlog which
increased by $1.6 billion during the quarter, notwithstanding the fact that we put $800 million out of the backlog into
service during the quarter. So we really generated $2.4 billion worth of new backlog projects, and most of the increase
came in the Natural Gas business segment.
Now as you look across Kinder Morgan, we like to think that there are many opportunities to grow our business across
all of our business segments. But if you look back a couple of years to when we made the El Paso acquisition, that
represented a huge investment on our part based on the future use of natural gas in the United States, not the price of
natural gas, but the supply/demand equation for natural gas. And we felt at that time there was going to be a
tremendous need for capacity to transport natural gas around the country as both the demand and supply side grew, and
it represents an enormous long-term upside for all three of the Kinder Morgan companies.
So I thought I would just spend a little time sketching out for you my view of the national market and the significant
recent impact on our pipelines in terms of new long-term agreements with customers to utilize our system.
Some of you may have seen that Wood Mackenzie just put out its spring 2014 preliminary outlook. In that outlook for
natural gas supply and demand, they estimate that demand this year in the United States will be 71.5 Bcf a day, and
they projected by 2024, in 10 years, that demand will escalate to 94.5 Bcf a day, or an increase of 23 Bcf a day, and we
would view that as a real understatement because the way Wood Mac computes this, they actually have the increase in
Mexico, exports to Mexico as a deduct on the supply side rather than an increase on the demand side. So really, this 23
Bcf a day potential increase in our view is a little bit understated.
That's coming from a number of sources, all of which we've discussed before, but it's LNG exports, additional electric
generation fueled by natural gas, an increase in industrial use and then an increase in exports to Mexico. All of these we
think bode very well for a national pipeline network like us.
Couple of other facts that have come out very recently that I think are also important from a national basis is that you
may have seen the recent article that we now have $70 billion of announced U.S. petrochemical development, almost,
the great bulk of it along the Gulf Coast in Texas and Louisiana where we have a tremendous pipeline network.
You may have also seen, just in the last couple of days, the estimate for May Marcellus/Utica production approaching
15 Bcf for the month of May 2014. The same Wood Mac study that I referred to on the supply side sees that increasing
to 28.5 Bcf in 2024, or a net increase of about 13 Bcf a day. Some of these are pretty much mind-boggling figures.
Another is that INGAA recently commissioned ICF to do a survey of infrastructure needs over the next 20 years. They
projected that that infrastructure needs would require $641 billion of investment between now and 2035, an average of
about $30 billion a year. Now, not all of this is natural gas, it's overall infrastructure, but the relevant thing I think is
that that's versus an 2011 estimate that INGAA had done, which turned out to be $10 billion a year; a tripling of
potential investment.

All of these facts I think are very relevant to saying that we are at the beginning of what we view as a tremendous
upswing in the need for natural gas transportation in the United States. Now you would expect us as the largest
owner/operator of natural gas pipelines to benefit from these nationwide trends, but the real issue that you ought to
consider is, are we benefiting and what specific examples do we have to talk about that show Kinder Morgan's benefit?
Let me give you some numbers.
Since December of 2013, we have executed long-term binding contracts with an average life of approximately 15 years
for about 2.8 Bcf a day. Now these are binding contracts. Over 1.4 Bcf a day is on our Tennessee system and about 800
million a day is on our El Paso Natural Gas system in the West. In addition to that, we have executed a long-term
contract to supply still another Gulf Coast LNG terminal, with volumes estimated at 700 million cubic feet a day,
contingent on final FERC approval of project.
And we had three very successful non-binding open seasons, one on NGPL to move gas from the REX Interconnect in
Illinois with NGPL to the Gulf Coast and two on our Tennessee system for Northeast capacity. All three of these open
seasons were vastly oversubscribed and we're now working to advance those projects. Again, I want to emphasize those
were non-binding open seasons, but the results we received were very encouraging and very positive.
I think two points come home very clear and very important. The first is that Tennessee is now on its way to becoming
a bifurcated system with gas moving from the Marcellus Utica to the Northeast and also from the Marcellus Utica to
the Southeast and the Gulf Coast. And this will only increase as the production in Appalachia increases. Secondly,
EPNG is filling its previously underutilized south line, largely with exports to Mexico, and we'll be expanding the
system later this decade to meet all the demand.
All in all, we see all these events and the national statistics for that matter as a very positive trend that will drive growth
at Kinder Morgan in the years to come.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve.
Steven J. Kean
All right. Thanks, Rich. I'm going to give an update on the backlog and then go through the segments quickly.
So starting with our January investor meeting last year, we've been giving – we rolled out our backlog and have been
updating pretty every quarter since then. As Rich mentioned, we went from $14.8 billion to $16.4 billion across all of
the entities on a combined basis. So we added this $1.6 billion to the backlog, also putting into service over $800
million worth of projects.
So our project additions grew total backlog, while offsetting the projects we put into service. Among the larger projects
we put into service were the $100 million KMP Sweeny Lateral to serve the Phillips 66 refinery unit. Almost $500
million worth of Terminals Group projects went in including phase one of our Edmonton terminal expansion and
expansion in our Pasadena/Galena Park facility and some coal export facility expansions. We also had about $150
million worth of projects come into service in the CO2 segment during the quarter.
Now, a reminder about the backlog; it consists of those projects that we view as highly probable, highly confident that
we will get it done. Not a guarantee, but a very high probability. We actually expect to add to this and do more and
invest more capital than what we have in the backlog, but unless we have a project that's highly probable we don't add
it.
So here's the business unit composition. The Gas Group is up from $2.7 billion to $4.1 billion. That $1.4 billion is by
far the biggest increase across the business units. Here the biggest additions were the $780 million expansion for
Antero to increase southbound TGP capacity out of the Utica and Marcellus. This demonstrates again the strong
demand for additional capacity and comes on the heels of an oversubscribed open season for that same path that we had
in December.

Second, we've got firm contracts supporting a $500 million-plus expansion on the EPNG system. So it's not just
Marcellus and Utica. We're seeing strength and demand for transport and capacity in other parts of the network, too.
The third big contributor to the increase is the expanded scope on our liquefaction project and associated facilities at
Elba Island, bringing the total to our share to $1.2 billion. That's an EPB investment, and overall EPB was up $200
million from quarter to quarter in the backlog.
The Products Group backlog is down from $1.1 billion to $1 billion and that's due primarily to the Sweeny Lateral
going into service, but I want to point out here we have a $300 million-plus project, the UTOPIA, Utica to Antero
pipeline, the NGL line, which we have an LOI on. We view it as pretty probable. Hope to and expect to firm that up
and put into backlog shortly. But it's not currently in the backlog.
The Terminal portion of the backlog is down $300 million, from $2.3 billion to $2 billion. We added about $200
million worth of projects in the terminal sector, but as I mentioned, they had almost $0.5 billion going into service
during the quarter. We continued to see really good growth opportunities in this sector. We're rapidly expanding our
Edmonton position by about 50%, our Houston Ship Channel position by about 26% to just under 40 million barrels of
capacity. We're also in the very early days of growth in demand for midstream infrastructure that we expect will
accompany the massive build-out of new chemical facilities, primarily along the Gulf Coast.
The backlog in our CO2 business is up $600 million. S&T is essentially flat at $1.8 billion, but the enhanced oil
recovery part of our backlog is up to $2.1 billion, a $600 million increase and that's primarily our ROZ or residual oil
zone new development projects. So we continue to see strong demand for CO2 and plenty of places to put it into use,
either in our projects or others. And the biggest project of course, the last one, Kinder Morgan Canada, $5.4 billion
TMX expansion which is unchanged from the last update.
Now in the segment update, I'm just going to focus on how we came out for this quarter versus the same quarter of last
year and Kim will take you through the details on all the numbers.
So for the Gas Group, earnings before DD&A were up $226 million of KMP, 46%. So that's due to the Copano
acquisition, which closed in May of last year and the drop down of the remaining 50% of EPNG and El Paso
Midstream, which closed March 1. But if you strip those out, earnings before DD&A for the segment were still up $62
million.
And as Rich pointed out, we saw strong demand for transport capacity, really across our systems. If you look at the
volumes, on KMP, our transport volumes were up 5.1% on a year-over-year basis. When you factor in the increase,
year-over-year increase in storage withdrawals on the Texas Intrastates, which don't count in those transport numbers,
that increase grows to 6.2%. And on the 2.8 Bcf of signup – new capacity signups that Rich mentioned, it's worthy of
note that a quarter of that was on existing capacity. So we signed up capacity, previously unsigned capacity, but not
really requiring CapEx to get those deals done.
So that just again shows the strength in demand for transport capacity, both new and existing. And actually if you take
just one project, which had a very small amount of capital associated with it, it goes up to about one-third. So very
good signs of increase in transport volumes that we're beginning to see.
On EPB, asset earnings before DD&A were essentially flat, up $2 million. There it's rate case impacts on SNG and
WIC being offset by some positives on TIG and the Elba Express Pipeline. And looking ahead, we're very bullish on
the opportunities presented by natural gas, and see exports, demand from electric generation and industrial uses and the
need to transport and process gas out of the shale plays, I think we're seeing customers really beginning to view again
transport outlets as a value-add.
In CO2, our segment earnings before DD&A were up $26 million or 7%, higher CO2 and oil volumes and higher CO2,
oil and NGL prices. The volume's driven, as Rich mentioned, by SACROC being up almost 4%, also Katz and
Goldsmith. We had record CO2 volumes for the quarter, driven by an 8% increase in Southwest Colorado volumes,
primarily due to Doe Canyon coming online. We continue to pursue several large development projects [indiscernible]

On Products, the segment earnings before DD&A were up $4 million or 2%. Increases in Southeast terminals in
Transmix and Parkway offsetting year-over-year decreases at [ph] SMPP (16:49) and Cochin. Cochin saw lower
volumes at its origin point out of Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta. Also of note, as Rich mentioned, is our Refined Products
volumes are up. That's a good sign. That doesn't take CapEx. You've got Refined Products volumes going up and some
tariff escalations as well. That's an overall positive.
Looking forward, we continue to see really condensate and NGL driven growth in this sector with projects off our
KMCC system in Eagle Ford and additions to our Cochin Reversal Project and UTOPIA.
On Terminals, segment earnings were up 41% – or $41 million or 6% from last year. Now $11 million of that is due to
the acquisitions, both the Jones Act and two smaller acquisitions, but $26 million was organic growth. And that's
expansion projects. But also I think good pricing on our services. We had $7 million improvement attributable to our
Gulf Coast region alone associated with price escalations on our tanks that were on better terms on a renewal.
Other highlights here, we brought on phase one of BOSTCO. In the Houston Ship Channel, we brought on phase one of
our Edmonton terminal expansion as well. Both of those had expansions under contract before we even finished phase
one.
Kinder Morgan Canada, finally, segment earnings before DD&A were down $4 million, primarily result of the weaker
Canadian dollar. But the main story here continues to be the progress on the expansion. We passed another milestone
there. We filed our facilities application in December, and we now have the scheduling order in hand. And long story
short, it's going to be a full, fair, but finite process. We've got a deadline of July 2 of 2015 for the NEB order. And kind
of hot off the presses, we just got our first set of information request and a preliminary statement of conditions. So
things are moving along very well there.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Kim.
Kimberly Allen Dang
Okay. Thanks, Steve.
Turning to the numbers, first on KMP, today we are declaring – the board approved to declare a dividend at KMP of
$1.38. That's a 6% increase over the first quarter of 2013, and this was on the first page of numbers for KMP, which is
on the bottom of the GAAP income statement. On the GAAP income statement, I'll point out that net income is down,
net income attributable to KMP is down $37 million, but it does have all the certain items which we will outline for you
on the next page, the largest one being a $141 million gain on the sale of Express that was a benefit in 2013 and
obviously not recurring in 2014.
So going to the next page and looking at our calculation of distributable cash flow, which is reconciled back to our
GAAP net income. We produced DCF per unit of $1.55 for the quarter, comparing that to the $1.38 for our declared
distribution. That is $76 million in excess coverage in the quarter. As we tell you almost every quarter, we expect to
have excess coverage in the first quarter, in the fourth quarter, and typically we will have negative coverage in the
second quarter and the third quarter, and we will have excess coverage for the full year.
Right now our excess coverage for the full year is nicely above our plan as a result of the new contracts that we've
signed on TGP and EPNG and also as a result of the APT acquisition, which is why you see us guiding to our guidance
which says that we will declare at least $5.58 per unit. On the $1.55 on a total basis DCF is $693 million. That's a $143
million increase or 26% increase over the fourth quarter of 2013.
Looking at what drives a $143 million increase, segment earnings before DD&A, $1.569 billion. That's up $293 million
or 23%. Steve took you through the pieces, but the biggest piece of the $293 million is $226 million increase in the
Natural Gas segment and then CO2 and terminals also contributed nicely to the $293 million. Versus our budget for the
full year, we're expecting that we will exceed our budget for segment earnings before DD&A largely again as a result
of the APT acquisition, the contracts on TGP and EPNG, and then that's being slightly offset by the lower volumes on

KMCC.
Interest in the quarter was $149 million expense. That's $26 million increase versus the first quarter of 2013. Sorry –
that's G&A and that is – G&A is above our budget for the quarter and we expected to be above our budget for the full
year by about 2%. Interest – $228 million expense in the quarter. That's up $41 million versus last year largely on
increases and balance associated with our expansion capital program.
For the quarter, we – our interest is very close to the budget and for the full year we expect it to be close to our budget.
Now you would think that interest would be higher than our budget because we issued incremental debt versus our
budget of $500 million to finance the – about 50% of the APT acquisition. But that higher balance is being offset by
lower rates than what we budgeted and higher capitalized interest.
Sustaining CapEx, a $24 million increase in the quarter. That is, we are right now behind our budget in terms of
spending but that's going to be timing because for the full year we're expecting that sustaining CapEx will be slightly
above our budget, probably about 2% or so, as a result of the APT acquisition and then also some additional
expenditures on the Texas Intrastates.
So $293 million coming from the segments. Increased expenses of $26 million on G&A, $41 million on interest, $24
million increase on the sustaining CapEx, and then you have the GP increase as a result of the increase in the
distribution and the increase of units of $52 million. That gets you to $150 million of the $143 million increase, and
then there's $7 million of small other items.
On the certain items for the quarter, they were $34 million. The largest piece was legal reserves, and that was
associated with two unfavorable decisions that we got, two unfavorable court decisions. You also see there the
insurance deductible and casualty losses, $8 million. That's timing. These are expenses that will be either reimbursed
by customers as we rebuild their assets or largely reimbursed by insurance. And then we have severance of $6 million
and that is an item that will be paid by KMI and not be borne by KMP. So that gives you the main certain items for the
quarter.
Looking at KMP's balance sheet, there is $1.194 billion increase in total assets, and the APT acquisition is the biggest
piece of that at $960 million. We ended the quarter at $20.5 billion in debt and that results in debt-to-EBITDA of about
3.8 times. We still expect that we will end the year at about 3.7 times, which is consistent with our budget.
The $20.5 billion in debt is an increase of just under $1 billion versus the $19.5 billion at the end of last year. It's
actually $996 million. Just looking at the sources and uses that drive that, we have $1.76 billion in acquisitions,
expansion capital and contributions to equity investments. The largest piece of that is $960 million from the APT
acquisition and then we spent a little under $740 million on expansion CapEx.
We raised capital of $803 million through equity offerings and then we had a use of cash, of working capital and other
items of about a little over $40 million, which is primarily accrued interest. It's the timing of when we make our interest
payments. And then we had, obviously, $76 million of coverage is the biggest offset to the use of cash from accrued
interest. So that is KMP's balance sheet.
Turning to EPB, its GAAP income statement, you can see there that we are declaring a cash distribution today of $0.65,
which is an increase of 5% or $0.03 over the first quarter of 2013. Looking at EPB's calculation of distributable cash
flow, which is also reconciled to GAAP net income, DCF per unit is $0.75 for the quarter; comparing that to the $0.65
distribution, we've got coverage of about $21 million in the quarter. Similar story here on coverage; we expect to have
positive coverage in the first quarter and in the fourth quarter, and we expect to have negative coverage in the second
quarter and probably slightly negative coverage in the third quarter, and for the full year we expect to have positive
coverage and be on our budget.
Total DCF of $163 million is down $6 million or 4% versus last year. And just reconciling that $6 million for you,
earnings before DD&A, up $2 million versus last year; Steve took you through the reasons for that. G&A is flat.
Interest expense is actually down, meaning reduced expense versus last year of about $2 million, and that is a result of
a maturing debt being replaced with lower rate debt. Sustaining CapEx is about $1 million increase in expense versus

last year, and then the GP is about a $7 million increase in expense associated with the higher distribution per unit and
more units outstanding. And then you had other items of about $2 million to get you to your total change in DCF of $6
million.
Looking at EPB's balance sheet, EPB ended the quarter at $4.1 billion in debt, which results in debt-to-EBITDA of 3.7
times. And consistent with our budget, we still expect to end the year at about 4 times debt-to-EBITDA at EPB. The
$4.112 billion in debt at the end of March is a decrease of about $66 million from year end. And to reconcile that
decrease for you, we had about $17 million in expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investments. We raised
equity of about $36 million and we had working capital and other items that were a source of capital of about $47
million, the two biggest pieces of that being a source of working capital on accrued interest and then coverage was $21
million in the quarter.
Finally turning to KMI, KMI, we are declaring a dividend today of $0.42. That is $0.04 increase or 11% over the first
quarter of 2013. Cash available per share is $0.55, which is a 12% increase over the first quarter of 2013 and $0.55
versus the $0.42 results in about $138 million of coverage. Similar to KMP and EPB, we expect to have positive
coverage at KMI in the first quarter and the fourth quarter, negative in the second and third and positive coverage for
the full year.
Right now we expect that our coverage will be slightly above our budget and because we will be slightly above our
$1.78 billion in cash available to pay dividends, and thus you see the guidance in the press release to meet or exceed
our cash available to pay dividends. $573 million of cash available to pay dividends in the quarter is about a $60
million increase, or a 12% increase versus the first quarter of last year. And just breaking that down, the cash generated
from KMP and EPB, so our investments in the two MLPs is up about $69 million as a result of the increase in the
distributions at those MLPs and the increase in the unit count.
Cash generated from other assets is down about $11 million as a result of the dropdowns to KMP in the first quarter of
last year. G&A is reduced by about $2 million versus last year. Interest expense is reduced by about $6 million at $160
million of expense, and that's a result of the pay-down in debt from the dropdowns. And then cash taxes are higher by
about $6 million to get you to your $60 million. So we had a nice quarter at KMI. We are slightly ahead of our budget
in terms of cash available to pay dividends, largely as a result of outperformance by NGPL and Citrus, and we expect
most of that to carry through for the full year.
Looking at KMI's balance sheet, KMI ended the quarter with just over $10 billion in debt and we still expect that we
will end the year debt-to-EBITDA at KMI on a fully consolidated basis at about 4.9 times. Debt increased about $181
million in the quarter.
Just going through the sources and uses: share repurchase was a use of cash of $94 million; warrant repurchase was a
use of cash of $55 million; we made a pension contribution for $50 million; we had payments in the legacy El Paso
marketing book and on some environmental expenses of about $30 million; and then cash available versus the cash
actually received, there's a difference there of about $67 million. $22 million on that's the fact that we didn't sell the
KMR units and then the balance is timing on cash distributions we receive out of equity investments. And then we had
a source of working capital of about $117 million from other items. The largest piece of that is the $138 million in
coverage for the quarter.
And so with that, I'll turn it back over to Rich.
Richard D. Kinder
Okay. And Holly, if – we'll take any questions you may have. Holly, if you'll come back on and give them their
instructions, we'll go from there.

Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Bradley Olsen with Tudor Pickering. Your
line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Brad. How are you?
<Q - Brad R. Olsen>: Doing well, Rich. How are you?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good.
<Q - Brad R. Olsen>: Quick question on the Tennessee gas reversals. It seems like you guys have been able to line
one of these major bidirectional or reversal projects up on TGP every few months and it seems like your projects are
generally able to go from planning to realization faster than a lot of the other pipelines in the Northeast. How many
more potential reversals could we see out of TGP and would the reversal or the potential reversal for the NGL Y-grade
pipeline down to the Gulf Coast impact how much of the pipeline could be used in a gas reversal?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yeah. I'll turn that over to Tom Martin who runs our Natural Gas Pipeline Group.
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Yeah. I think we certainly have the opportunity to look at more backhaul or southbound
capacity. And yeah, there is capacity that we are creating for the NGL project that ultimately if that doesn't go, we
could use that for additional gas service as needed. We're also very excited about our, I guess, results of the
non-binding open seasons to take additional Marcellus gas ultimately into New England. Between those two projects,
we could see anywhere from 1 Bcf to 1.2 Bcf a day incremental volumes going into the New England markets. So we
think both from the demand that we're seeing southbound as well as the interest to go – to bring additional volumes into
New England, we're very excited about our growth prospects going forward.
<Q - Brad R. Olsen>: Great. Thanks, Tom. And I guess just to maybe push a little bit harder on that, on the Northeast
reversals, are you – is there a number we can think about in terms of potential additional reversals on TGP? Or is it
difficult to give a precise number?
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Yeah. I mean it all depends on what – what rates the market will ultimately will bear. But I
think all the – relatively speaking, the lower cost expansion projects have been done but I think we're continuing to see
interest even at higher levels. So again it's hard to speculate on volumes but I think we're certainly talking to our
customers every day and there's still interest for more capacity.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yeah. I think that again, Brad, the key thing here is if you just look at these numbers, the
numbers tell the story. Again, we expect to cross 15 Bcf of production this quarter up there. There is not nearly that
much demand, particularly at this time of year in the Northeast. If you look at this ramping up, in fact, Wood
Mackenzie would show it ramping up just in five years to 22.5 Bcf. So a ramp up of seven Bcf just in the next five
years and those volumes have to go someplace. And of course, what we have is we have, essentially it's a little bit of a
simplification, but essentially four big lines that were originally intended to go south to north.
Now, we've – in essence, reversing two of them on what we've done so far. So there is more opportunity, but Tom's
right, the further you get the more expensive it gets and we just have to see whether people are willing to pay the
freight. But obviously, there is a tremendous need for more capacity to get natural gas as well as NGLs out of
Marcellus Utica.
<Q - Brad R. Olsen>: Great. And just one last one for me on the Natural Gas front. It sounds like there is a lot of
growth potential coming out Mexican demand. And I would imagine given the fact that that country continues to
import high-cost LNG that that could be a real growth market. When we think about kind of how big that volume
opportunity could get, are there limitations on the southern side of the border with PEMEX's pipeline system? Or do
you see quite a bit of running room to continue to expand export southbound?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: I think they will continue to expand their infrastructure south of the border. And the real
test of that is when they sign up for long-term contracts on our side of the border. So I think we believe that over the

next 10 years, demand will more than double from the present throughput that goes into Mexico today. And the reason
is very simple. They are converting electric generation and industrial use from oil to natural gas. The opening of the
energy business in Mexico we believe will concentrate primarily on oil, not on natural gas. And the only alternative as
you switch to natural gas is to import LNG which is very expensive, and of course that led to – I don't know all the
details, but essentially the closing of the Altamira plant which I think was a mutually beneficial thing from both the
Mexican importers and Shell that could take that LNG and move it elsewhere.
So the cheapest source of natural gas is clearly from Texas and the rest of the U.S. I think you'll see some Rockies gas
impact going into Mexico. And of course, EPNG is just – again if you think about Tennessee being ideally positioned
in the Marcellus Utica, EPNG is tremendously well situated for the exports to Mexico.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Just one other point there, you know they are building out the infrastructure south of the border.
It's not dependent, though, on PEMEX getting it done. So when CFE is...
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Right.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: ...has these power plant developments that they're putting up, they are having – private
companies are coming in to develop and build out the transportation capacity that's going to be required south of the
border to get it from our line basically to the power plants that are being built.
<Q - Brad R. Olsen>: Great. And when we think about $800 million of demand on EPNG for those new contracts that
you mentioned in the press release, is it fair to assume that most if not all of that volume is coming from demand south
of the border?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. That [indiscernible] (40:15)...
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: A high percentage of it, but there is some [ph] of it (40:17)...
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: [indiscernible] (40:17) there is some of it.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: And in addition to that there we think there will be significant additional opportunities. We
think the $800 million is just kind of a starter.
<Q - Brad R. Olsen>: Great. Thanks so much, everyone.

Our next question comes from Darren Horowitz with Raymond James. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hey, Darren. How you doing?
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Fine, thanks, Rich. Two quick questions for me, the first regarding that March
announcement that you guys made of additional $1 billion of CO2 investments. If I'm just thinking about the $700
million that's going to be focused on drilling wells and building out that fuel gathering infrastructure at St. John's, can
you give us a sense of the average unlevered rate of return across that project set? And I'm trying to think about it with
regard to how that compares to the average unlevered IRRs on that $1.5 billion in EUR backlog CapEx that you
outlined at the Analyst Day over the next five years?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Jim Wuerth.
<A - James P. Wuerth>: Yeah, I think unlevered we're looking in the mid-teens on the pipe and the infrastructure
there. I think that's what we're at is mid-teens.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Okay.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: You know, we'll be building a new pipe from St. John's over to intersect with our Cortez
system just south of Albuquerque.

<A - James P. Wuerth>: That's correct.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: And overall, we think we will be in the mid-to-upper teens on the returns on that $1 billion
investment.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Don't you – do you think, Rich, though that just based on the large upfront capital that
you spent there that your incremental returns theoretically should get better?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, they could; it just depends on exactly how the contracts work out in the end.
<A - James P. Wuerth>: Obviously, if you look at McElmo Dome 30 years ago when Shell and Mobil operated it,
they had to – you know they had to make a decision to put in the Cortez Pipeline. It's very expensive when you put that
first build in and the numbers don't look that great. In today's world it looks like a great opportunity – a great
investment. We've had it now for close to 14 years and the volumes just continue to go up without a lot – not a lot of
infrastructure being added on the pipe.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Okay.
<A - James P. Wuerth>: So it's a – I think that you'll see the same thing within St. John's and the Lobos Pipeline.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Okay. And then last question for me, Steve, back to the Products Pipe segment and that
growth in cash flow that you talked about, as we're thinking about the back end of this year and into the first half of
2015, can you give us an update on KMCC capacity utilization? I know that we talked, last time you said it was about
two-thirds booked, but obviously there is this, this big supply growth of South Texas condensate that's moving east, so
I'm wondering from your perspective how you think about if you do changing the scale or scope of that $1.8 billion of
capital that you're going to spend across the ship channel. So maybe some additional ship docks at [ph] Colina (43:08)
or more interconnects between Galena and Pasadena? It seems like there is a lot of opportunity and you could spend
more money, so I'd love your thoughts there.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. No, you're right. And capacity utilization tends to be – is still running well under
contractual commitment. And so one thing to understand there is that we are getting cash in now in deficiency
payments but we're not able to reflect that in our current results until we get – either they start moving the volumes or
they – their make-up rights expire. And so that's kind of holding back the performance of KMCC a little bit, but again
the cash is coming in the door.
But you're exactly right, the way that system has now been developed, I mean it has gone from a – in a very short
period of time it has gone from kind of a point-to-point system to being a network, a network that we can build off of
and that we can invest, and invest in at very high returns on those incremental capital commitments. So we've got about
$300 million worth of laterals and associated facilities like truck off-loading and tank facilities that are in our backlog
that we haven't yet seen the revenue on. Those are fairly, fairly quick build-outs that we can do and we are doing. And I
mean, I think we're going to continue to find more of that, and Ron, do you have anything to add to that?
<A - Ronald G. McClain>: I just think there is a lot of optionality, and once it gets to the Houston Ship Channel it can
– [indiscernible] (44:37) move to petrochemical plants, [ph] to a lot of our docks (44:41). So I just think there is
tremendous flexibility for shippers, and most of that capacity will go pretty soon.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. Another example of that – so we had one lateral that we were able to get into service
early, but we don't have the pumps and the other facilities that are going to be necessary to achieve the full throughput.
Well, we're unloading trucks into that lateral right now and we'll just ramp that up over the coming year. So again, if
you look at that system, it's now connected to multiple producers, kind of CDPs and also truck off-loading facilities,
connected to multiple producers and we can now take it to multiple markets. It goes to the Phillips 66 Sweeny Refinery
just south of Houston, it goes to the Houston Ship Channel and we're connecting it up with Double Eagle so it can go to
Corpus as well so, just a great network that allows high return projects to be built off of it.

Our next question comes from Brian Zarahn with Barclays. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Brian.
<Q - Brian Zarahn>: Good afternoon. Hi, Rich. I appreciate the project backlog update. What's the status of the
Y-grade line in the Marcellus Utica? Where do we stand?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah, we continue to work on it, but we don't have commitments yet. So we are not putting it
in the backlog. There is some indication from the market that people have been very focused on getting some of their
dry gas outlets taken care of first and then they're going to turn their focus and attention to additional liquids or NGL
outlets. So I would say that the interest in the project continues to grow, so we're – the update for the quarter is people
are interested and more interested than they were the quarter before, but until that turns itself into signatures on
contracts, again, it's not going into the backlog and we're not going to call it done.
As Tom pointed out, we do have the ability to use that line. We're preserving the ability to do both, and that's our
preference. We want to do residue gas outlets on the TGP system. We want to preserve the Y-grade option, assuming
customers are willing to sign up. But if ultimately they're not, then we can put that line in residue gas service and put it
to good use that way. So long story short, we don't have the commitments we need yet, but I think interest from the
customers continues to grow and we'll keep working on it.
<Q - Brian Zarahn>: And then I guess that and the other projects that are not in your backlog, I mean, how should we
think about the potential growth and the inventory now through 2017 if some of these projects are added? You're
currently at $16.4 billion. I mean, can we get to a $20 billion number? Or how should we just think of a range of
potential outcomes?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yeah [indiscernible] (47:26)
<A - Steven J. Kean>: As you know we're being very conservative about that. Different people take different
approaches to how they articulate their backlog. People sometimes put in projects they think ought to get done or have
a good reason to get done, but we tend to put in the ones that are just very high probability. And so, for example,
UTOPIA I think is a project that gets done but we're not quite there yet. We've got to have an open season. We've got to
firm that LOI up into a real firm transport commitment. That's another $300 million-plus project there.
If you remember from Investor Day, Tom articulated about $15 billion worth of projects in the natural gas sector alone.
He was adding onto what we've signed up here recently on EPNG, maybe getting at couple of those Northeast
expansion – both of the Northeast expansion projects that we did the non-binding open season in, those are billion
dollar – multi-billion dollar moves or additions to the backlog. But again, we're going to continue, I think we're going
to maintain the same methodology here. We'll identify some of those things for you, but we're going to keep the
backlog limited to those things that we're highly confident we're going to put in service. [ph] Let's just say we (48:40)
would be highly confident that we're going to put in service.
<Q - Brian Zarahn>: Okay. Turning to Ruby, it looks like GIP is ready to sell its remaining 50% stake. How do you
think about that option?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, we'll just see how that develops. Clearly, as we said, we are going to drop – KMI is
going to drop its half down to EPB this year, and we'll just see how the GIP sale goes and really don't have any
comment on it other than that.
<Q - Brian Zarahn>: Okay. And then on the CO2 business, what impact, if any, is the backwardation having on your
hedging program?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, we maintain the discipline under our hedging program and we hedge whatever the
price is. And obviously, in a backwardated market, that hedge price in the out years is lower than the front end. We
believe that will probably change but we're not in the business under our hedge policy of guessing on that so we stay

within our parameters.
Obviously within those parameters, we try to pick off the days when the out years are a little stronger, but we're
maintaining that. And as we always do we have little more heavily hedged, obviously, in the front end than in the back

Next question comes from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hey, Ted. How are you doing?
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Hey. Doing well. Thanks, Rich. I just wanted to come back to gas here and maybe, again, push a
little bit more on – what's the sort of incremental capital you think you need to put into free-ups say another Bcf a day
of volumes up out of the Marcellus to get to the Gulf Coast?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Tom?
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Yeah, I mean that's a tough one. Again, it really just depends where the source of supply is
and ultimately where we're trying to get to. I mean I think right now the biggest volume opportunity is going to be the
Marcellus supply project into Wright, New York, and then Wright, New York into New England. I think those are
going to be the most cost effective expansions right now. And then we'll look at – we're continuing to look at how we
can get more volumes down to the Gulf Coast, but those are going to be more expensive.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Okay. And then can you give us any more color around whether it's the most recent supply
project, project with Antero or the future ones, how you're thinking about sort of the option value of the capacity you
have? Would you charge max rates? Should we expect negotiated rates that would be higher than what you're sort of
tariff that is on file with the FERC?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yeah, I think you can expect it on all our new projects. These are negotiated rate contracts.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Got it.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: [ph] And that would be (51:48) higher than a non-file tariff because they have to justify the
capital expenditure.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Right. Got it. And then if we're thinking about, and this is a small one, but just the impact of
weather on some of the volumes maybe in the Gas segment or any of the other segments, can you quantify that at all?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: No, the impact of weather was – Steve can take you through the exact increase
year-over-year, but a lot of what we're seeing now is longer-term demand across the whole system, and to me that's
much more important than the weather, but Steve can give you...
<A - Steven J. Kean>: I think that's the key is that you know – and Rich is talking about the 2.8 Bcf of contracts, those
were 15-year average commitment or nearly 15-year average commitment, so that's not about the weather. That's not
about a cold winter. That's obviously – that's about long-term need or long-term demand for the capacity. I think we
saw benefits from the colder weather certainly on the Texas Intrastates, we saw it on NGPL, the NGPL asset. On a lot
of our other assets, interstate assets, we're pretty much looking at demand charge, primarily demand charge based
revenue receipts so it's a little less weather dependent in the short run.

I mean again, everybody got a real wake-up about the need to hold firm transport capacity this winter and I think that
again holds promise for demand for future capacity and maybe for some of the expansions into the Northeast, for
example. But that's not really a short-term phenomenon, that's really just driving long-term demand for transportation.
And as I mentioned, we had record or very high storage withdrawals on the Texas Intrastates and some good sales
opportunities for us there as well.

Next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hey, Greg, how are you doing?
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Good. Thanks, Rich. Good afternoon. Let's stay on the potential growth opportunities. Can you
just update us on the FERC application at Elba – prospects for securing FTA-based export contracts for Gulf LNG and
if you're any more optimistic around non-FTA authorizations now that I think Elba is sixth in line and Gulf LNG is
seventh and Russia is saber rattling?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yeah. [ph] All those segments (54:29). On the FERC application, we had filed the FERC
application for Elba now. And of course remember that that's not contingent – really that's the only contingency left is
getting the FERC approval because it's not contingent on non-FTA approval although we think we'd like to have that.
That would give our customer, Shell, a little more leeway and where it moves the LNG out of Elba. But we filed and
are moving forward on that so that's a go.
On Gulf LNG, we and our partner there, which is primarily GE, have now authorized money on a pre-feed expenditure.
We have a lot of interest there and we think that by the time we complete the pre-feed we will have MoU assigned for
that capacity at Gulf LNG. Now, let me be very clear that MoUs are MoUs and that doesn't mean they're fully binding
on either side because we will certainly want to go beyond the pre-feed to nail down the cost of the project and our
customers will want to nail down the cost – the tariff that's going to be charged them. But I say we've turned more
optimistic on that and we and GE together have decided to go forward with the pre-feed based on the conversations
we've had over the last two or three months.
I think this whole LNG export market has become more interesting. I don't know if they're going to move up the
rapidity of approval on the non-FTA requests given what's happening in Europe. I would think they should, and that as
others have said, they should use FERC as a clearing agency as opposed to DOE making decisions. They should just
approve everybody and let FERC sort it out and let the contract world sort it out. But we will see how that turns out but
we believe that Gulf LNG does have some potential and more to come on that.
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Yeah. I think the only thing I would add is Gulf LNG is the last remaining brownfield kind
of liquefaction opportunity. And I think with our balance sheet I think the customer response and the interest has been
very positive so far.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Great. And if I can get Jim for a second, looks like EOR production fell 1.5% sequentially, but
obviously LTE up year-over-year. Can you provide any color on the progression of production this year? And do you
have any updates you can share about potential CO2 supply sales into California? Yates NGL flooding or ROZ?
<A - James P. Wuerth>: On the volumes, SACROC continues to be strong with month-to-date we're still running
about 32,000 barrels a day. And Yates, it's a slow decline there. We're trying to do what we can to maintain that as best
we can. The other two new ones are both responding pretty well. In the last few days at Katz we've been close to 4,000
barrels a day and at Goldsmith we're over 1,500 barrels a day, so both of those are moving up. So I think the outlook on
the crude side is volumes is still real good.
As far as a potential of a CO2 to California, obviously that's going to be a long-haul project. We do have some –
obviously we have some interest out there from some customers. We've signed some documents there but the proof will

what we're seeing. We're actually out in the phase one area now drilling; where we've started our first couple wells out
there. So hopefully we should have something where we're injecting CO2 by the end of the year.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Okay. And one general question, when you say that CO2 is recycled over many years, each
time it's not the same quantity, right, because you're getting a 30% to 50% each time. So ultimately like when you buy
100 million cubic feet of CO2 to inject, how many times do you think you're going to inject that? Is that twice? Or
three times?
<A - James P. Wuerth>: Well, one of the ways you can kind of look at it is on a normal field you have to purchase
about six Mcf per barrel of oil. What really happens is you have about 11 to 13 times that you inject volumes of CO2 so
a little – about double, a little over double. So basically it says it rolls through at least twice.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Okay. That's very helpful. And last question back to Rich. If Jim does as well as it sounds it's
possible in the ROZ effort and EOR is still looked at as a negative overall for KMP, could you see an argument long
term for why the broader CO2 segment may make more sense to trade separately than say an EPB?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: An EPB? You mean as a separate MLP?
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Well, yeah. People always ask you once in a blue moon, would you ever consolidate EPB?
Obviously that makes some sense over time. The question is, if it's getting no respect and it's weighing down the rest of
the business and there's other natural interested investors in it, why long-term, when we just have a good portion of
CO2 just trade separately?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, we look at all alternatives, certainly. There is a lot of issues on what the tax basis
would be if you spun it out. A lot of issues with doing that separating, and we are very bullish on the CO2 business. I
think right now would not be the appropriate time to do something like that. We saw at the analyst presentation the kind
of uptick in distributable cash flow we expect from those operations. It's a unique entity because everybody right now
is in love with the Permian Basin in terms of E&P activities there.
Well, that's where we are, but the thing that separates us from most other people is we have our own in-house supply of
CO2, which we certainly will and can sell to third parties, but we can also use for our own efforts, which gives us I
think a tremendous leg up on being able to continue to grow things like the ROZ, if that turns out. And certainly
SACROC is just a big field and seems to be getting bigger. We're just really pleased with the way everything is going
there so. And we're very pleased with it. Again, we always consider all kinds of alternatives at Kinder Morgan, but we
think CO2 is a good fit the way it is.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Great. I appreciate the answers.

Our next question comes from Mark Reichman with Simmons. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Mark. How are you?
<Q - Mark L. Reichman>: Good. Good, thanks. With all of the opportunities in the Natural Gas Pipeline segment, I
was wondering if you could provide an update on investments in the partnership's coal terminals and also by Kinder
Morgan Resources. And somewhat related, I think the 2014 budget called for about a 23% increase in coal export
volume due to increased capacity along the Gulf. Is that still your expectation in light of the weak met coal pricing?

<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Sure. John Schlosser who runs our Terminals Group, John?
<A - John W. Schlosser>: We have actually a budget of 27 million tons. As we mentioned at the Analyst Meeting, 25
million tons of that is under a long-term take or pay. We were off slightly on tonnage in this quarter, 1.3 million tons,
but we were actually up $2.3 million over our plan, owing to shortfall payments from our customers there. We did
complete one transaction at Kinder Morgan Resources, our first one. It was Blue Eagle in the Central App. It was
25-million ton acquisition.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: $25 million.
<A - John W. Schlosser>: $25 million, 25 million tons of proven capacity, of proven reserves. It's the first one, it has a
very nice, a high-teen return, and we're looking forward to seeing others as they progress.
<Q - Mark L. Reichman>: Okay. And then also with regard to the BOSTCO, I was wondering if how is the market
for black oils right now, including like bunker fuel? And how have your plans evolved with regard to developing
BOSTCO as you move into considering phase two?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Well, we just commissioned our 49th of 51 tanks last week. It's ramping up nicely. We expect it
to be completely online by the end of the second quarter. And we are looking at a phase three expansion right now.
Phase three can go one of two ways: we could look at more distillate or more black oil there; I personally believe that
we'll be leaning towards the distillate side as we go forward. The market seems to be very strong. We're looking at
expansion -at further expansion at our Pasadena and Galena Park on the gasoline side and strong demand on distillates
as well, specifically on the export side.
<Q - Mark L. Reichman>: Great. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from Faisel Khan with Citigroup. Your line is open.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Thank you.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Faisel. How are you?
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Good. How is it going?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: All right. Just a few questions. On the broad run pipeline expansion and associated sort of
infrastructure investments, what do you guys expect for the revenue contribution from that $782 million investment?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: I mean, we've got a refractive, mid-teens, unlevered rate of return on it. You know, it really
comes into service in two pieces, so we have a fairly low capital portion of it that we'll see in 2014, but there's actually
a fair amount of revenue is associated with that, and then the rest of it comes online in 2017. I don't know if – I don't
think we have the specific separate number representing what that revenue off of that CapEx will be but I think just use
the kind of mid-teens return as your guide.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Fair enough. And then just on the CO2 business, with the expansion project you guys
announced, how much of the 300 million cubic feet a day is for third parties versus yourself?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, we'll see how that turns out, what the exact mix is. We have a lot of demand for it
right now and we're going to see – wait a little bit, see how this ROZ wells turn out before we make a decision on how
much to sell to third parties. But it'll be a mix of sales to third parties and utilization by ourselves and that's one of the
nice positions that we're in is we can kind of make that call as we're drilling up St. John's and building the Lobos
Pipeline.

<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Got it. And then can you give us a sense of sort of how you're thinking about the timing
on making a decision on whether there is a potential combination for EPB into KMP?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: That would be up to the two sets of independent directors, Faisel. At some point, and I've
said this all along, it probably does make sense to put the two together but it's got to be on the terms that both of them
agree. And so we'll just see how that plays out over the remainder of this year. And again, we want to complete the
dropdowns to EPB that we've agreed on and get that done, and then we'll see how the whole thing plays out. But it will
be primarily a decision of the two sets of independent directors.
<Q - Faisel H. Khan>: Okay. Got it. I appreciate the time. Thanks a lot, guys.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Thank you.

And the next question comes from John Edwards with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hey, John. How're you doing?
<Q - John D. Edwards>: Doing well, Rich. Good afternoon. And just a couple of questions, you know you've talked
about the increase to the inventory backlog projects and I know you sort of had an inventory of identified but not put in
the backlog yet at Analyst Day and I think it was something like $24.5 billion or thereabouts, and I'm just wondering
what changes you're seeing there? And if you have – if you can give us kind of a rough idea of where that stands?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. You know we didn't really update that since the investor conference so I think that's as
useful as a guide as anything. I mean I think we have seen stuff particularly in the gas sector I think pop on to the radar
screen, not go into the backlog but pop onto the radar screen, since the conference. And I think one of the things we
showed you in the conference that was more – had never been on the backlog but sort of jumped from not on the
horizon to the backlog was the Magnolia Project, for example, our transport capacity off of Kinder Morgan Louisiana
in support of the Magnolia Project.
But look, I think that the trend in general, we haven't updated that number but the trend generally is that we're seeing
more opportunities and it's driven by the things that Rich was talking about, infrastructure investment in North America
to support all this production and the demand side which we're now just beginning – we're kind of on the front lip of
here on the gas side, has the tendency, the direction on it is to add to that project level.
<Q - John D. Edwards>: Okay. That's helpful. And then just kind of following on Brad's earlier questions on TGP,
what – in terms of say Bcf per day available for reversals, what do you have available at this point? And then – and I
know you negotiate the rates but just broadly speaking, about what kind of rates does it take to ship gas on TGP now
from – on a reversal type project? Broadly, I'm not asking to disclose your confidential rates, but just kind of in broad
terms if you could talk about that?
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Yeah, I mean I guess everything that we're shipping now is under – will be under expansion
projects so it's going to take additional capital to create more capacity. And as I've said earlier, I mean the – all the
low-hanging fruit has been picked so the cost of the next project will be greater than what we had to spend to do the
Antero project, the Broad Run project. I don't think we're done but I think, as I said earlier, I think the most cost
effective next expansion that we would do will actually be the Marcellus Project that ultimately feeds into New
England as opposed to coming back to the Gulf Coast, but we'll certainly look at it and I mean we're seeing rates
generally in the market from projects out in open seasons to be somewhere approaching a dollar now from Marcellus to
the Gulf Coast. So I think in general terms that's probably a number to be thinking about.
<Q - John D. Edwards>: Okay. That's helpful. So just to confirm then when you say the low-hanging fruit is now
gone, at this point there's not really a lot of available capacity because you're having to spend some fairly significant
dollars to do reversals. Is that a correct way to interpret that?

<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Yeah. I mean we've got everything under contract now to support all these expansion
projects and we're fully, fully sold out.
<Q - John D. Edwards>: Okay. Great. And then in terms of, you did mention you bought back both warrants and KMI
stock during the quarter, I think you said $55 million on the warrants and $94 million on the KMI stock during the
quarter. So in terms of weighing those two, how are you looking at that tradeoff between buying those back?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Yeah. The analysis that we do is the same that we've described to you in prior quarters.
During the quarter the repurchases of stock were done first and then we completed that $350 million authorization, and
then you probably saw the 8-K in March where we involved the $100 million authorization and we spent about $55
million of that, and that was all warrant repurchase.
<Q - John D. Edwards>: Okay. Great. Thank you very much. That was all I had.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Thank you.

Thank you. The last question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Christine.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Hello. Can we go over the expectation for the 4 times debt-to-EBITDA number by year-end
2014 at EPB? The Gulf LNG and Ruby assets will be coming with over $1 billion of debt and I think your budget
assumes $600 million of issuances. So taking all of that with the EBITDA that the drops will contribute, partially offset
by lower rates on SNG and WIC, I get a number closer to 4.3 times and I was just wondering if something has changed
or if there is anything I'm missing?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Yeah. Ruby and Gulf LNG are joint ventures and the debt will not be consolidated, we
do not believe. And so the 4 times is without consolidation of those joint ventures.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay. Perfect. And then just following up on the Ruby question that Brian asked, and I know
you've talked about your intent to drop Ruby into EPB, but is the possibility of selling your half on the table at all, kind
of similar to what happens when the other partners have expressed flat holder stakes?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, we look at any reasonable offer, probably, but we are not actively marketing it,
Christine. We're in the process of dropping it down and it's a good, long-term asset with a lot of good contracts that run
out into the next decade. But we wouldn't rule out any possibilities on it.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay. Great. And then can you provide us any update on the TGP abandonment process for the
capacities that you would like to convert for the Y-grade lines?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Well, yeah, I can say it. We have not filed to seek abandonment of it. We would want to see the
commercial part of this mature further, but we believe – we've worked closely with good advisors to articulate a clear
path to get to abandonment, but we're not – other than sort of getting prepared, we're not at the point of filing.
<Q - Christine Cho>: And then, once – if and when you do file, it's about nine months? Is that the process?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Tom do you have a sense?
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: It's probably more like a year.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay.
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: 14 months, something like that.

<Q - Christine Cho>: And then last one for me. This is just a broader question as we try to figure out how gas flows
are going to evolve in the next year or two. With respect to the NGPL reversal, once the gas gets into the system from
REX, would shippers have the option to go north or south?
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: On the secondary basis, but on a firm basis the path would be southbound.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay. Great. Thank you.
Richard D. Kinder
Okay. And that's it, Holly. So we thank you very much for your questions and a good call. We think we had a good
