During the course of today's call, we'll be referring to non-GAAP measures, as defined and reconciled in this morning's
earnings release. These non-GAAP measures, as defined by Charter, may not be comparable to measures with similar
titles used by other companies. Please also note that all 2012 growth rates noted on this call are pro forma for certain
acquisitions and divestitures as if they occurred on January 1, 2011.
Joining me on today's call are Tom Rutledge, President and CEO; and Chris Winfrey, our CFO. The presentation that
accompanies their comments can be found on our website, charter.com, under the Financial Information section of our
Investor & News Center. The press release and trending schedules can be found at the same location.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas M. Rutledge
Thanks, Stefan. Charter's customer growth and recurring revenue growth accelerated in the second quarter. We've made
significant progress in creating a superior product and service offering using our inherent network advantages and
improved our execution on fundamentals. Our total revenue grew by 4.7% year-over-year, and excluding the impact of
advertising revenue, second quarter 2013 revenue grew by 5.7% year-over-year.
Our second quarter residential revenue growth rate was 4.3% versus growth of 2.6% last year. And our first half 2013
Residential revenue growth rate was more than double the 2012 growth rate. Commercial Services continued to
perform very well with over 20% revenue growth in the quarter, and our pipeline for future growth remained strong.
Our total customer and PSU results improved this quarter with year-over-year net add improvements in all Residential
and Commercial categories. Total Residential customer relationships grew by 5,000 during the quarter versus a loss of
17,000 a year ago. We also gained 38,000 residential PSUs during the quarter versus a loss of 31,000 during the same
period last year. And Expanded Basic Video customers grew by 23,000 in the quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA was virtually flat year-over-year and reflects the change in operating practices and upfront
investments we are making to accelerate the growth of our business. So our short-term adjusted EBITDA results reflect
our plan. More important is the operating progress we're making, which positions us to win market share and grow cash
flow to fund path.
Consistent with the strategy we outlined last year, we've made a number of changes; one, two; one, our core product
offering; two, how we go to market with that product; and three, how our business is organized, all to drive deeper
penetration of our products and services. We've actively invested in our two-way interactive high-capacity cable plant
in order to provide a superior offering in the vast majority of our footprint. Over 65% of our Internet customer base
now receive data speeds of 30 megabits or higher.
We're committed to a video product as it remains a critical marketing tool and the financial underpinning to provide all
our services in the home profitably. We now offer over 100 high-definition channels in virtually all of our markets,
versus an average of 75 HD channels per market just over 12 months ago, and with video-on-demand on every outlet.
And ultimately, we'll be all HD once we had gone fully digital.
Digital sale and the new video connection is now 99%, and digital penetration of our existing base of customers is over
90%. The launch of our all-digital product in our Fort Worth, Texas footprint is now complete. Our customers in the
Fort Worth area now have access to over 140 HD channels on a fully-functioning, two-way digital set-top box with
video-on-demand and a fully interactive program guide on every television in the home.
Nearly 30% of the spectrum in our Fort Worth plant is now empty, allowing us to ultimately offer all content in HD,
more video-on-demand and superfast Internet speeds. The all-digital launch went very smoothly in Texas and taught us
what we need to know to take all of our other markets all digital by the end of the year 2014.
Over the last year, we've reorganized all of our sales channels and commission structures. Our direct sales channel is
nearly fully staffed, and we've also completed the reorganization of all of our inbound sales and retention channels. The
progress is beginning to show in our results. Total connect volume was higher this quarter than last year, and we're now

selling more video and customer relationships, and we continue to improve. 55% of our video sales now take
Triple-Play. At the end of the second quarter, 54% of our Residential customers were on our new pricing and
packaging structure, meaning that over half of our customers are receiving a superior product set with far more value
on every outlet and every device in the home.
We also completely reorganized our service operations. Our new regional management structure focuses exclusively on
the physical transactions and outside plant maintenance. And we're investing in previously-deferred plant maintenance
and quality assurance. We've centralized network operations so that we can more quickly implement product changes
across our network and maintain consistent service quality. Call centers have been reorganized to build expertise in
specific locations across our national footprint, and we're increasingly in-sourcing both our field operations and call
center workforce, and we have improved quality.
In turn, our service metrics are showing significant improvement. Trouble call rates fell by 14% year-over-year in the
second quarter while repeat troubles fell by 16%. Ultimately, these improving service metrics will result in lower
churn, and through churn reductions, we'll grow our market share faster.
As I've said before, these goals of these fundamental product selling and service changes are to drive deeper penetration
of our services into the home with a simple, transparent and high-value offer structure; drive higher ARPU per connect,
which will increase over time with built-in price steps; lower our transaction cost per customer; and extend customer
life through lower churn, all designed to grow market share, increase cash flow and drive return on investment.
Looking forward, we have some new products under development. We continue to make progress on developing a
cloud-based user interface that will move key product and service functionality out of the set-top box and into our
network. The objective is to provide a consistent cloud-based interface across all devices and avoid customer disruption
by making existing equipment work without additional capital spend for replacement CPE.
We also gain speed to market with building capabilities internally and working with various vendors as we bring our
concepts out of the lab and into the field. Later this year, we plan to launch our companion remote application, which
will allow for the streaming of linear video inside the home to smartphones and tablets. We also recently re-launched a
$3 per month Wi-Fi service on a standalone router that we'll be able to service remotely.
So overall, I'm pleased with where the operations stand today. There's still a lot of activity taking place to improve our
processes. But a more centralized approach to our operation is now in place to deliver superior customer experience.
Our progress is also already visible in improving PSU and revenue growth, and we expect that to continue with cash
flow to follow.
We're executing well on the plan we laid out over the last year, and we remain focused on our key objectives.
Now, I'll turn it over to Chris to give additional details on the second quarter.
Christopher L. Winfrey
Thanks, Tom. When we implemented our new strategies last year, we articulated a sequence of how we would see
success develop in our metrics. Let me again highlight that sequence in our status: first, under quality of PSU growth,
which we've seen through Expanded Basic Video, Triple-Play and from the penetration growth. Second, through
residential customer ARPU and accelerating year-over-year Residential revenue growth, which started in Q4 and
continued to through the first half of this year. And ultimately, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow where we expect a
meaningful first comparison once we have a full-year of the same strategy and product offering in place.
As a result of our improved product and marketing practices, our Basic losses have improved. Looking at Slide 3, you'll
see that we lost 48,000 video subscribers during the quarter versus 66,000 during the second quarter of last year. But
more important than the overall improvement in Basic Video is the fact that our Expanded Basic Video customers
continue to grow. We grew Expanded Basics by 23,000 during the quarter, and our total Video losses continue to be
driven by Limited Basic. We now have less than 270,000 Limited Basic customers, and our Expanded Basic customers

make up over 93% of our total Video customer base.
We also added 40,000 Internet customers during the quarter versus 29,000 last year. And the clearest indicator of our
Triple-Play progress is the firm net add results where we added 46,000 during the quarter versus 6,000 a year ago. In
line with that offer structure is our Residential revenue per customer relationship growth, which was up 2.5% in the
second quarter versus last year. Net net, the result is our Residential revenue grew by 4.3% year-over-year, which is a
65% improvement in terms of growth versus the second quarter of last year.
As Slide 4 indicates, our Commercial business had another strong quarter, with revenue growth of 21% year-over-year
and over 25% excluding Video. Commercial PSU net adds also improved. We added 16,000 Commercial PSUs this
quarter versus 8,000 a year ago. So Commercial remains a key focus for us. There's a $9.5 billion B2B telecom market
in our footprint and we're only capturing some $800 million of that spend per year. We remain confident in the current
growth trajectory.
Advertising revenue sales fell by 16% in the quarter driven by decline in political; the elimination of some order
revenue, which was offset in OpEx; and a decline in contractual revenue. Core advertising growth excluding these
impacts rose by 1.7% year-over-year. So in total, our revenue grew by 4.7% year-over-year, or 5.7% excluding
advertising. And if you focus exclusively on recurring subscription revenue, which we do, our revenue grew by 6.2%
year-over-year.
As Slide 5 shows, adjusted EBITDA was essentially flat year-over-year. In simple terms, we grew revenue by $88
million relative to the second quarter of last year while our costs grew by $89 million, driven by the following: $46
million in cost increase, or 52% of the total, was in cost to service customers, reflecting the change in our operating
practices to drive higher-quality service. This includes quality control personnel and practices, previously-deferred
plant maintenance, establishing a new regional management structure, and in-sourcing offset by lower contract labor.
Marketing costs grew by $9 million while commercial costs grew by $8 million, which together accounted for 19% of
the total annual cost increase. The marketing expense in Q2 reflects the reorganized sales channels, which by the end of
the quarter were essentially delivering higher Video and Triple Play sales across every channel versus the prior year.
Programming expense grew by $27 million, or 5% year-over-year, and reflects the remaining 30% of the overall cost
increase. That equates to 5.7% per Expanded Basic Video Customer. We expect full-year 2013 programming expense
growth in the mid-to-high single digits on a per Expanded Basic customer basis.
So what's the best way to think about the operating cost structure as we look forward? I'll go in reverse order, the three
buckets I've just described. Clearly, programming is a broader industry issue, but relative to our competition, we remain
well positioned. We have a multi-product Residential and Commercial offer structure, which has underpenetrated
nearly every market. So we can still grow both adjusted EBITDA and marketing across our product set.
Second, marketing and commercial expenses are areas we hope we'll continue to increase with growth. Finally, the
increase in cost to service customers is a bit more nuanced. Our quality control personnel and practices and regional
management structure are now established from an expense perspective. The one-time catch-up of our deferred
maintenance program is complete, and while the program's now more frequent, it should be lower than the second half
of last year. Continued efforts to in-source more of our field operations and call center labor will continue over time.
So the key operating expense point is our year-over-year comparison should be more relevant starting in the third
quarter. An even bigger point is that we're delivering a much higher quality product and service to our customers,
which means you can invest significantly more in quality per transaction but have lower operating costs through lower
service calls, truck rolls, downgrades and churn. As Tom mentioned, we're already beginning to see the benefits from
trouble call rates and repeat truck rolls falling substantially year-over-year.
Turning to Slide 6, we spent $422 million of capital during the second quarter, or 21% of revenue, versus 25% of
revenue during the second quarter of last year.
Now, expect 2013 capital expenditures to be approximately $1.8 million, including the impact of the Bresnan
acquisition, which closed on July 1. Since I mentioned Bresnan in our third quarter results, when we provide those,

we'll include the performance there as well. We intend to provide pro forma data for prior periods, so we're getting
growth rates for both financials and operating metrics.
Looking to the balance sheet, we feel very good about our liquidity, total leverage and the various debt transactions
we've completed so far this year. On our last quarterly call, we highlighted most of our recent debt transactions, so
instead reviewing each individual transaction here, please refer to Slide 8, which provides a comprehensive list,
including the Bresnan acquisition and its associated financing.
Slide 8 also provides an updated maturity profile from Charter pro forma for the Bresnan financing. Our weighted
average borrowing cost is now 5.6%, and over 95% of our debt matures beyond 2016.
And our maturity profile and balance sheet are well positioned to help drive our Triple Play growth strategy. Our target
leverage remains unchanged and we continue to believe that our best ROI approach to the use of our free cash flow is
the right way to allocate capital.
Now, I'll turn it over to Tom for some final remarks.
Thomas M. Rutledge
Thanks, Chris. Before moving on to Q&A, as Chris mentioned, last month, we closed on the acquisition of Bresnan
from Cablevision, and the integration of Bresnan's customers and employees is going well.
On a related note, clearly, we are aware of all the press surrounding M&A speculation and we will not be answering
any questions surrounding that speculation on this call, other than to generally say that we believe in the benefits of
consolidation, including significant opportunities for cost and tax synergies, and more importantly, the ability to grow
assets organically at a faster pace. And while I think these principles could be applied across a number of assets with
very attractive returns, we remain focused on the core opportunity at Charter today and we will continue to be very
disciplined around M&A opportunities when and if they arise.
Operator, we're ready to take questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jeff Wlodarczak of Pivotal Research Group.
<Q - Jeff D. Wlodarczak>: Good morning, guys. It's Jeff Wlodarczak. Part of the Charter EBITDA acceleration story
is leveraging your improved product customer service Triple Play to accelerate your RGUs. That's working very nicely.
The next step seems to be raising price of consumers coming off promotions. Do you feel like the more aggressed
promotions from AT&T in particular as of late have materially affected your ability to re-price consumers coming off
promotional periods? And then I had one follow-up.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, Jeff, this is Tom. We think that our pricing strategy is working, will work, and we
don't see anything that's going to throw us off track with our pricing strategy in the marketplace currently.
<Q - Jeff D. Wlodarczak>: And then how much do you – how much has AT&T expanded their U-verse service in
your footprint? And what are your expectations based on their public commentary about where they're going to get to
in the future? Thanks.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Right. Well, we haven't really seen any evidence of any significance that they have
expanded in our footprint. And so I've read their public comments and they're fairly convoluted, and their current
overlap of our footprint is slightly less than 30%. And we still think that's the right number.
<Q - Jeff D. Wlodarczak>: Great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Jason Bazinet of Citi.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Thanks so much. I just had a question on the cost structure. You guys gave quite a bit
of color commentary. But if you sort of roll it all up and you sort of think about the margin trajectory of the business, is
it still reasonable to assume that the 3Q margins will probably compress a bit, as they always do seasonally, and then
we sort of springboard off of from there? Is that sort of a reasonable expectation? Thank you.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Hi, Jason. This is Chris. Yeah, Q3, you have typically all of the reconnect activity. So
I think one way to think about things as sequentially, and it seems that you were thinking about it that way, the way that
I was articulating the cost structure is really more from a year-over-year comparability. And a lot of the activity,
particularly the deceleration of the deferred plant maintenance, which started in Q3 of last year, has now leveled out.
We're doing it more frequently. But at a minimum, from a – in the short-term perspective, you shouldn't see the same
type of acceleration that we've seen in the past.
Not going to go into margin forecast. We still have a number of changes that are ongoing, including in-sourcing. But all
of these have a positive ROI attached to them, and the goal here is not only to return to margin over time, but to be able
to provide a better service and product quality, such that you can actually lower the amount of transactions, which of
course over time will reduce OpEx to provide those transactions. But you made a very good point about the sequential
increase that always happens in Q3 for most cable operators as it relates to the back-to-school season and the amount of
reconnect activity that takes place there.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John Hodulik of UBS.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Hey. Could you guys comment on the – what kind of subscriber growth and revenue growth
that you're seeing compared to the broader company in those Texas markets that you've done the all-digital
transformation in? And then beyond that, can you give us – I know you've said that you'll be done with the all-digital
strategy by the end of 2014, but can you give us a little bit more color on when some of those new markets come on
line, for instance when's the next group of markets going to be all-digital? Thanks.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: John, this is Tom. The one thing I would say about Texas is that Texas is growing again
in every category of subscriber PSU, and that's the first time Texas has grown in years. So that's a good sign and that's
coming as a result of the superior product that we have on the street now in Fort Worth. Additional markets this year
will be Los Angeles area systems; Saginaw, Michigan; and Greenville, South Carolina. And then we'll go through the
whole company next year.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Craig Moffett of Moffett Research.
<Q - Craig Eder Moffett>: Let me see if I can squeeze in an M&A question without asking you to comment on
anything specific. But do you think you could discuss how you think about smaller transactions rather than larger
transactions going forward? Is there a way that you can address the programming cost issues that you've highlighted in
talking about M&A by doing a series of smaller deals, or do you think it has to be something larger?

<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Craig, when we looked at Bresnan, we looked at an opportunity to grow our market
share, and that is the Charter opportunity. Then it's the opportunity for the whole cable industry to take what I think is a
superior infrastructure and to put products together in that infrastructure that create value for the consumer. And I think
that the cable infrastructure that we have at Charter and the cable infrastructure that was in place at Bresnan before we
purchased it allows us to do that. That's the single-biggest economic driver that we have at our disposal.
Beyond that, if you get to a certain scale, you'll have a different form of leverage in programming negotiations, and you
could argue about where that is and it's not just scale; it's also willingness to use that scale to affect your outcome. And
how much you need or how big you need to be is a difficult question to answer.
<Q - Craig Eder Moffett>: All right. Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick of JPMorgan.
<Q - Phil A. Cusick>: Thanks, guys. I guess two; one, a follow-up. But first, can you give us a little more detail on
your set-top box plans? You talked about the low-end product to sort of bridge, but what about a high-end box? And
then second, to follow up a little bit on Craig, given your comment on programming, is there a sense of urgency to do
deals here, or is this something that really could take some time? It feels like this industry needs to roll up, but it's felt
that way for a long time. Thank you.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, our box strategy is designed to actually make our boxes a thin client, as opposed to
a fat client box. And the idea of using cloud-based user interfaces allows you to take the server-based architecture and
feed existing boxes sophisticated guides that can be changed very inexpensively without changing out the hardware.
And as part of our strategy, we've received a waiver from the FCC to begin employing a new box that uses traditional
conditional access. And at the end of a two-year period, we'll be switching to downloadable security, which allows us
essentially to buy boxes from anywhere and any vendor and not be locked into legacy conditional access or security
systems that currently limit the amount of vendors you can use in a cable system.
That in itself will allow us to buy lower-cost CPE, whether it's high-processing power CPE or low-processing power
CPE. In the long run, with smart televisions and smart tablets, which essentially allow the TV or the tablet to operate as
a set-top box and a TV combined, we think that incremental CPE will become less and less a factor in our overall
capital structure. So we think capital intensity is coming out of CPE and we have a strategy designed to ensure that
happens.
<Q - Phil A. Cusick>: Thanks. And in terms of urgency on M&A?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: You know, I think as I said to Craig, our big opportunity is to take advantage of our
inherent strengths and grow our share. And that's what we're focused on. In terms of timing on M&A, I think Charter
can be extremely successful without it, and potentially with the right deal, be even more successful.
<Q - Phil A. Cusick>: Thanks, Tom.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Ben Swinburne of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Good morning. Tom, just going back to the Dallas, Fort Worth and the Texas markets,
can you talk a little about the ARPU benefits you're seeing? I know there's some FCC rules around how quickly you
can start charging for boxes and whether you're seeing any improvement in like operating expense trends as you've
gotten rid of analog and particularly around truck rolls. And then I have a follow-up for Chris.

<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, I don't want to break out Texas specifically. We are performing better there from a
growth perspective and as a general proposition, Charter operating metrics are improving, service metrics are
improving, including how customers perceive our service. And we expect those to exist in Texas. We do expect that the
overall perception of quality by customers in an all-digital environment will be enhanced, although I don't have any
data specifically to Texas that I want to share with you.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Okay. And then, Chris, just on the ARPU front as we move into Q3, just wondering if
you can remind us of the puts and takes? You have the price increase, which I think has been fully implemented now,
the 2.3% you called out in prior quarters, plus the beginning of the anniversary of last year's promotions. So maybe
what are the other things we should be keeping in mind as we think about the sequencing from Q2 to Q3?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: You have – so you – let me just rehash what you said for the benefit of others. We did
have the annual price increase that was put through in March, so that's now fully baked in inside of Q2. You also have
the fact that we're selling a better product today, which is more bundled. And then you have the anniversary of the first
roll-offs offset by the fact that we were doing roll-offs in the past. We did have promotions in the past. The difference
here is that by having a higher-quality product in the home, and the higher amounts of bundling and a better device and
more of those devices, that the ability to retain net revenue we expect to be higher. And then the only really minor thing
I would highlight is every Q3 is a back-to-school season. So on the margin, your connect volume and the bundle attach
rate tends to reflect a little bit of that as well. But the first points that we're mentioning by far are the most material.
<Q - Benjamin Swinburne>: Okay. Thanks a lot.

Your next question comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Douglas Mitchelson>: I have one for Tom and one Chris. Tom, on the cloud-based user interface, some
engineers have told us there might be scaling issues with rolling out the thin box version of a cloud-based service. Is
that right? And if so, how do you grapple with that? You just roll it out to your customer base over time, or do you
think you can flip a switch and give it to everybody?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Well, we have – we're still experimenting with our strategy, but we do acknowledge that
there are scaling issues. And obviously, you have to overcome those to flip a switch. One of the things we've been
thinking about and which we've had some success with trialing is a hybrid approach where you put some of the guide
infrastructure on the box, and the existing boxes have guides on them, and you use that as a high-volume function
aspect of the guide and put other parts of the guide in the cloud so that there's less total demand on the scale of the
cloud infrastructure.
And we've been experimenting with that and think that that is an alternative to a complete cloud-based system. And so
we'll see which way works best. But we think that we have a way to make it work and be from a customer perspective a
high-value service.
<Q - Douglas Mitchelson>: Is there any kind of timeframe at this point that you could put on when you think you
might be able to get something out into the marketplace broadly?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: We're at this point still in the experimental and testing phase and don't have a launch
date.
<Q - Douglas Mitchelson>: Fair enough. And then, Chris, if Charter issues shares in an acquisition or acquisitions
over time, is there a ceiling above which Charter NOLs would be impacted, or is there no issue since you already have
that first change of control triggered by Liberty?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Well, let me use the change control that took place from a Section 382 tax prospective
already as Liberty. I'd rather not get into scenarios that talk about us issuing additional shares because that's not what's
on the plate today. But I think it's a good case study to take a look at what took place. We had, over a three-year period

since the first ownership change took place when Charter emerged from bankruptcy, we had the second ownership shift
change, which when Liberty invested it's 27% beneficial ownership triggered us for the cumulative ownership change
exceeded 50%.
When that took place, it's happening at a share price value that was above when the first ownership test took place. And
as a result of that, we had an additional 382 limitation. That is offset by the fact that you have a recapture effectively
through higher amounts of realized open gain that occurs very quickly over time. And because Charter is in a net
operating loss position today as we speak, builds up – rebuilds very quickly and can use fully the amount of its NOLs
over the coming years in the same way and fashion that we always were planning to do so.
So as a result, the present value of our NOL and our NOL itself was unimpaired at the end of the day. And I think that's
some color that you could think about different ways where the tax assets remained extremely valuable in the context
that you were discussing. In all forms of different M&A transactions, we think our tax assets are highly valuable.
<Q - Douglas Mitchelson>: Right, because it depends what you do with your balance sheet at the same time. I get it.
Thank you both very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Kraft of Evercore.
<Q - Bryan D. Kraft>: Just had two questions. Chris, following up on the cost comments, is there a percentage of
revenue that you'd expect cost to serve customers to settle in at? And were you trying to say that in the back half of the
year, we should start to see some improvement as a percentage of revenue in that line? And then secondly, just wanted
to follow up on the Limited Basic losses. Do you mean that Limited Basic subs have actually disconnected, or does it
include the Limited Basic subs that upgraded to a full-service package? And maybe there's no difference, but I just
want to see if you could clarify that. Thanks.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: So let me start with second point. So Limited Basic losses includes both disconnects,
as well as customers who have moved into Expanded. And the first point is cost to serve; obviously, we think a lot
about this, but not here today to give the percentage of revenue guidance. What I think we are saying is that we've
actually intentionally and in a very focused way made that percent of revenue higher in the short-term by investing
more cost per transaction so that you can reduce the amount of follow-up transactions and that you can reduce truck
rolls, phone calls, repeat truck rolls and ultimately churn over time. And if you can do that, you can significantly reduce
the cost to serve as a percentage of revenue, not only from an expense standpoint, but the whole model is driven to
drive additional revenue per household. And by virtue of doing that, you almost get there organically, even without
some of the benefits that I was describing.
<Q - Bryan D. Kraft>: Great. Thanks for clarifying this.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Yep.
Operator
You have a question from the line of Frank Louthan of Raymond James.
<Q - Frank G. Louthan>: Can you comment a little bit on the commercial opportunity? You had some – a little bit
better than we were expecting there. Is there anything, in any particular markets you're seeing some economic strength
of just overall execution? And then could you comment a little bit on Comcast's plan to sort of daisy chain some Wi-Fi
hotspots throughout their neighborhood with some new CPE? I would think with your throughput you're putting on
your network, that would be an interesting opportunity for you. Just conceptually, how do you think about that concept
for your customers?

<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Don Detampel is with us, who runs our Commercial business. Do you want to speak to
that, Don?
<A - Donald F. Detampel>: Certainly, Tom. So in the Commercial sector, we just ran our ninth consecutive quarter of
20%-plus growth. And as Tom mentioned, or Chris I guess mentioned earlier, we believe we have about a $9.5 billion
opportunity within our footprint and we're about $800 million penetrated into it. Across all sectors, and we divide the
Commercial business into Small, Medium, Large businesses, then of course, our Carrier segment. We have great
opportunity I think across all segments and have low penetration. So we see good running room ahead and see no
reason why we can't continue to grow at substantial growth rates.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: And with regard to your Wi-Fi question, I do think Comcast is doing the right thing with
creating a dual SSID approach, which is what I think you're talking about where the subscriber has their own and the
company has another one, which can be used for other kinds of services. That is the opportunity of Wi-Fi. I think the
opportunity that cable infrastructure lends itself to is small cell wireless services, which can have very high capacities.
And that can be either unlicensed spectrum, like Wi-Fi, or licensed spectrum. And I think in the long run, there's a
tremendous business opportunity there.
<Q - Frank G. Louthan>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Lance Vitanza of CRT Capital Group.
<Q - Lance W. Vitanza>: Thanks. I just wanted to go back to the Commercial for a second because it is growing so
well and the opportunity seems to be really big there. Can you give us a sense for what a reasonable market share
objective might be? And on what kind of timeframe? And then what the incremental margin would be on the
incremental revenues?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: I think we'd rather not.
<Q - Lance W. Vitanza>: Anything you can say about what your customers tend to look like? I mean, I know that you
break them into different groups, but are you most active in guys that are at single locations or at multiple locations?
Mostly fewer than 20 employees, that type of stuff?
<A - Donald F. Detampel>: This is Don Detampel. There are certain segments where we've done better traditionally.
Certainly, the Small Business segment, those businesses that have less than 20 employees, are very much a sweet spot
for us and we can easily serve those customer requirements with our coax plant.
But we've done very well in the Large Business segment as well in certain sectors, such as education, healthcare,
government, that require more custom fiber networks between locations. Certainly, the Carrier segment has been
strong, fueled a lot by cell tower backhaul. And I would say that the segment that perhaps we have the most
opportunity going forward is the Medium Business segment, those businesses that have between 20 and 200
employees, where we're now kind of fully building out our product set and going after that segment a bit more
aggressively. But we see strong growth opportunity really across all segments.
<Q - Lance W. Vitanza>: Thank you. And then just lastly, does this business tend to be more capital-intensive, then,
as we think about your CapEx plans?
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: I think it is, but there's very few places inside – this is Chris – there's very few places
inside the business that have delivered 20% area growth for the past nine quarters. So it's going to be more capital
hungry along the way. We've also been along the way investing in areas that may not initially reflect itself in the
revenue; a good example of that is cell backhaul, which Don mentioned.
So cell backhaul is about 10% of our revenue inside of Commercial. It's about 20% of our revenue growth inside
Commercial. And it occupies about a third of our capital expenditure. It's a very long contract and we'll be seeing in the

revenue benefits of that for a long time to come. And some of that comes in waves, and so the reality is Commercial is
spending more in capital and they're doing better, and all of that's good. They're all positive ROI projects, irrespective
of the segment which you're looking at.
<Q - Lance W. Vitanza>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Senno with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Michael J. Senno>: Just curious, you've grown non-Video subs quite a bit, and I was wondering what level of
success you've had in converting some of those to Double or Triple Play as you've changed the pricing and packaging
and improved the product?
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: One of the – I think that the thing you should consider is that we're in the mix of a lot of
change in terms of our subscriber base. But incrementally, the customers that we're adding are taking multiple product
sets and greater numbers than they have historically.
And the other interesting thing about our current growth is that our Expanded Basic subscriber growth is actually
accelerating and positive. And what that means is if you think about the multi-channel universe, Expanded Basic is
increasing market share of multi-channel video. The Limited Basic Service is a broadcast-only service and tends to be
part of the historic packages that were put together that were low-value, low-price packages. And we're transitioning
those to high-value, high-quality, relatively high-priced products. And over time as we move our customer base, the
mix of customers taking all of our products we expect to increase.
<A - Stefan Anninger>: Operator, can we move to next question, please?
Operator
Sure. Your next question comes from the line of Tuna Amobi of S&P Capital.
<Q - Tuna N. Amobi>: Thank you so much. So first question is for Chris. With regard to your base that's kind of
migrating to your new structure, I'm just kind of wondering how high do you think that percentage can go. So I think
you say you're now well over 50% and I'm wondering ultimately, do you expect your entire base to be fully migrated,
and over what period? And with regard to that specifically for existing subscribers, what is the trigger event that kind of
triggers the migration of these subscribers to your new structure? And I have a follow-up. Thanks.
<A - Christopher L. Winfrey>: Thanks, Tuna. The reality is that you may never get over to 100% on the new pricing
and package. There will come a point where certain customers are happy with where they're at, and despite the amount
of direct mail that you get to get them to upgrade a product or take an interest in rack-rate pricing in, and then, in effect,
where they're satisfied, you may not get all the way to 100%. So I don't know if there's a terminal target to do so.
And then your question, the second question, was how are customers migrating. It's a combination of really seeing the
offers that we have in the marketplace that provide a lot more value, a lot more product, more boxes, higher speed, so
you get call-in that's taking place there, as well as the retention process that the historical legacy promotion have, in
effect, they've rolled off, to have an opportunity to take a higher amount of ARPU from our perspective but a higher
bill price from their perspective. And in doing so, take a lot more product along the way and achieve the overall price
increase that was originally intended, but for them to get more value along the way. So those are kind of the two key
methods in which people are migrating in.
<Q - Tuna N. Amobi>: That's very helpful. So quick questions for Tom. I did pick up on your comments that your
commitment to Video remains. And I guess I was thinking along the lines of the recent comment by Jim Dolan. And
clearly, I wanted to get your sense in terms of how the industry is evolving as to the potential role that Video might
play over the long-term. I presume your comment was related to the short-term or medium-term. So some clarification

along those lines vis-à-vis how the shift in the industry toward high-speed data potentially as the main product driver?
Thank you.
<A - Thomas M. Rutledge>: Yeah, what I said was specifically, we're committed to a video product. So it doesn't
necessarily have to be the one that we currently have or structured the way it currently is. And I think Jim Dolan's
comments are correct over some period of time, although the long-run is often hard to predict. And how long the
long-run is is hard to predict.
I tell people a story about how in 1980 people were talking about the death of broadcasting and it's still here. And we
all knew that it would go through a major structural change. But 35 years later – 33 years later, yes, there's
retransmission consent. But even that didn't occur until relatively recently. So I think that the Video product will
become an on-demand product over time and that it'll be delivered what looks like a streamed services today on the
Internet. But how that's actually defined and what it – how it's structured from a rights point of view, I think it's open to
interpretation and certainly in the control of content providers.
So we're committed to a Video product. We think that we have the role to play in that world. And we think that we
have a network that allows us to follow the development of television wherever it may go.
<Q - Tuna N. Amobi>: Well, thanks for that clarification.
