Thanks, Jason, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results continue our optimism and momentum in 2014.
Our businesses are well positioned and producing strong financial results. During the third quarter, we grew operating
cash flow by 7% and increased free cash flow to $2.5 billion. And year-to-date, operating cash flow has increased more
than 8%.
There were several significant achievements across the company. In Cable, we generated solid revenue and operating
cash flow growth, each of which was over 5%. Highlights include a notable improvement relative to the prior year in
both broadband and video subscriber results. In fact, our video subscriber result was the best for a third quarter in seven
years, and our 315,000 broadband net adds was the best third quarter result in five years. Additionally, strong growth in
business services allowed us to surpass a $4 billion annualized revenue run rate in that segment. At NBCUniversal,
operating cash flow increased over 13%, thanks to a continued turnaround in Broadcast, the opening of The Wizarding
World of Harry Potter- Diagon Alley in our Orlando theme park, some good successes in film, along with consistently
strong cash flow production from our Cable Networks.
As we look at our key initiatives that will drive future growth, there were a number of exciting developments in this
quarter. Starting with NBCUniversal, our third quarter results are a great example of how the investments we've made
in the businesses are paying off and positioning us well for the future. In Broadcast, NBC continued its momentum
throughout the summer, ending the full 2013/2014 season ranked number 1 among adults 18 to 49, which was the first
full season win we've had in 10 years. Now the new fall season has just begun, and NBC is off to another strong start,
ranked number one in the same demo through the first several weeks of the season. The team has done a great job
making NBC vital and profitable once again.
In film, Lucy was a worldwide success in the third quarter. In fact, while 2014 included a smaller slate at Universal,
we've had some great successes as five films so far this year achieved the number one slot at the domestic box office.
And we continue to invest for an exciting slate in 2015.
With our Cable Networks, ratings have been under pressure industry-wide as the market continues to be very
competitive with more original programming and time-shifted viewing than ever before. However, Cable Networks
continue to contribute very strong cash flow at NBCUniversal, and we have a diverse portfolio of channels with
entertainment, sports, and news. USA was number one cable network in the third quarter and is on track to be the most
watched cable network for the ninth consecutive year in total viewers. Bravo and Syfy are now top 10 networks as well,
and CNBC is the fastest-growing network in primetime among adults 18 to 49 and 25 to 54. As we have said before,
our Cable Networks are generally under-monetized compared to our peers, which gives us a strong relative position for
future growth.
In Parks, as I mentioned, we opened a new Harry Potter attraction in Orlando, which, combined with added hotel
capacity, led to record summer attendance and a record Labor Day. The new attraction is off to an amazing start driving
double-digit per capita growth and a significant lift in premium park-to-park ticket sales. Even more encouraging, our
guest satisfaction has been overwhelmingly positive, with scores well above 90%. Our confidence in the Parks has led
us to a recent announcement in which we agreed to form a partnership in China, where over several years we will be
developing a park in Beijing. Expect more on this in the future. So, Steve Burke and the team at NBCUniversal have
made great progress so far in 2014.
Turning to Cable Communications. Neil Smit and the team once again delivered strong results. In an environment with
plenty of room for distraction, they clearly remained focused and are executing at a very high level. Consumers'
viewing and consumption patterns and the competitive landscape are evolving at a very rapid pace, as evidenced by the
recent announcements over the past week. We understand content companies' attempts to look for new ways to grow
their businesses. We believe we have been a leader in working with content owners with our development of TV
Everywhere, X1, Cloud DVR, light packaging and streaming, amongst other things. With our breadth of content rights
both in and out of the home and on mobile devices, along with our investment in new platforms and user interfaces,
Comcast Cable is uniquely positioned to continue to innovate and lead this evolution.

A good example of this is our new XFINITY On Campus product we launched during the third quarter to six schools,
with several others currently in trials. The service lets college students watch live TV and on-demand content on their
IP-enabled devices, including laptops, tablets, and smartphones while on campus. With this younger generation, more
and more viewing is happening away from the traditional TV set, and we've evolved our products and services to better
engage with them.
At the same time, we continue to aggressively deploy our X1 and Cloud DVR technologies in our broader subscriber
base. We believe our X1 operating platform offers customers an unrivalled experience. We recently surpassed 5 million
X1 boxes deployed, a significant achievement in such a short timeframe. And now we are rapidly rolling out Cloud
DVR which allows customers to stream and download DVR recordings out of the home to any device, as well as
stream live TV to any device in the home.
In Wi-Fi, we continue to extend our reach. The scale of our efforts in Wi-Fi is attracting new partners and further
enhancing this reach and hence the value that we provide to Comcast subscribers. We recently announced an agreement
with Liberty Global where subscribers of the two companies will gain access to each other's Wi-Fi networks. For
Comcast customers, the deal provides access to more than 2.5 million Wi-Fi access points in various countries in
Europe. This is a terrific new benefit that we are excited to provide our customers with additional reach and capabilities
in the years ahead.
Finally, I want to spend a minute on our overall customer experience. Our customers deserve the best experience every
time they interact with us. While we have made progress, we need to do a better job in ensuring consistent excellence
in our interactions, from the moment a customer orders new service, to the installation, to the way we communicate and
respond to any issues.
Over the last few years, we have been incredibly focused on product innovation and delivering great content and
technology experiences. So now it's time to leverage those capabilities to deliver truly exceptional customer service.
The way we interact with our customers on the phone, online, in their homes, is just as important to our success as any
other products that we provide. Put simply, customer service should be our best product. That's why I'm really pleased
with our recent appointment of Charlie Herrin to lead our Customer Experience initiatives. For those who have not had
the opportunity to meet him, Charlie, in his most recent role, led the design team behind the development of X1, and he
spearheaded the company's initiative to deliver a consistent user experience across platforms. Charlie and his team
received a 2011 Emmy Award for outstanding achievement for the XFINITY TV iPad app, a 2013 Emmy Award for
the X1 user interface. We are all excited for Charlie in his new role and are committed to improving in this critical area.
Let me conclude with some brief comments on our pending acquisition of Time Warner Cable. This is an important and
exciting time as we focus on getting regulatory approval for our transaction. We are very encouraged by the recent
shareholder approvals on each side of this transaction as both our and Time Warner Cable's shareholders voted
overwhelmingly in favor of the merger. Shareholders see it the same way we do, that it's an opportunity to give
customers access to higher broadband speeds, a more extensive content lineup, and what we believe is the industry's
best operating platform in X1, and in the process, create more value.
As I mentioned earlier, there is a lot going on with a lot of opportunity for distraction. But our teams on both sides of
the business remain focused and are executing at a very high level, and I believe it's evident in these results.
So let me now pass this to Michael to cover the third quarter results in greater detail.
Michael J. Angelakis
Good morning and thank you, Brian. Let me begin by briefly reviewing our third quarter consolidated financial results
starting on slide four.
Overall, we are very pleased with our third quarter performance which reflects consistent execution and sustainable
profitable growth. For the third quarter, consolidated revenue increased 4% to $16.8 billion, and operating cash flow
increased 7% to $5.7 billion, reflecting healthy organic growth in our Cable business and an exceptional performance at

NBCUniversal. These results include $77 million of Time Warner Cable and Charter transaction related costs during
the third quarter of 2014, which is a similar amount to the $74 million of costs associated with the termination of a
pension plan in the third quarter of last year. Excluding both of these items, operating cash flow growth would remain
at 7%. Year-to-date, consolidated revenue increased 6.9% to $51 billion, and consolidated operating cash flow
increased 8% to $17 billion. However, for comparability purposes, if we exclude $1.1 billion of revenue related to the
Olympics in the first quarter, $138 million of year-to-date transaction related costs, and the pension termination costs in
2013, our consolidated revenue increased 4.6% and our consolidated operating cash flow increased 8.3%.
Earnings per share for the third quarter increased 52.3% to $0.99 per share versus $0.65 per share in the prior year.
However, when you exclude favorable tax adjustments in the transaction related costs I just mentioned, our normalized
EPS increased 12.3% to $0.73 per share. Year-to-date, earnings per share increased 33.7% to $2.46 per share versus
$1.84 per share in the prior year. Again, excluding the tax adjustments, gains on sales, and acquisition related items,
our normalized year-to-date earnings per share increased 19.9% to $2.17.
Free cash flow for the quarter increased 26.7% to $2.5 billion, and free cash flow per share increased 28.4% to $0.95
per share. This growth was primarily driven by increases in consolidated operating cash flow, improvements in
working capital, and lower cash taxes, which were partially offset by increased capital expenditures. For the first nine
months of this year, we generated $6.5 billion of free cash flow, a decrease of 8.2% over the same period in 2013.
Year-to-date, free cash flow per share has declined 6.8% to $2.46 per share.
Now, let's review the results of our businesses in more detail, starting with Cable Communications on slide five. Our
Cable Communications business continues to execute well, delivering solid financial and customer growth in the third
quarter. Cable Communications revenue increased 5.2% to $11 billion, driven by continued strength in high-speed
Internet and business services, as well as higher advertising revenue due to political spending. Total revenue per
customer relationship increased 4.2% to $137 per month, reflecting rate adjustments, a higher contribution from
business services, and increasing number of customers taking multiple products. At the end of the quarter, 69% of our
customers subscribed to two or more products, and 36% subscribed to three products compared to 34% in the third
quarter of last year.
In addition to solid financial growth, we continued to deliver strong customer metrics. We increased total customer
relationships by 82,000 in the third quarter, more than three times the net additions versus last year's third quarter. Our
X1, TV Everywhere, and On Demand platforms are clearly best-in-class. And while X1 is still a relatively small
portion of our overall video base, its contribution is having a positive impact. Our X1 net adds continue to accelerate
and accounted for more than one-third of our video connects in the quarter, and we once again reduced our video
customer losses. In the third quarter, we lost 81,000 video customers, a 36% improvement from last year's third quarter
and the best third quarter customer result for video in the past seven years
High-speed Internet also delivered impressive subscriber results. We added 315,000 new customers during the quarter,
an increase of 6% year-over-year and the best third quarter results in five years as we continue to differentiate our
product with speed enhancements and the fastest in-home Wi-Fi with our advanced wireless gateways. Over 50% of
our high-speed data customers now have one of those new wireless gateways.
We also continued to grow our voice customer base this quarter, albeit at a slower rate than last year, adding 68,000
new customers in the quarter. This slowdown in net additions was a result of a focus on double play during the
back-to-school season as well as X1 availability that was more focused on triple play customers last year, making for a
difficult comparison.
As we review the product categories in more detail, video revenue increased 1%, reflecting modest rate adjustments
and an increasing number of customers taking advanced services, partially offset by a decline in Pay-Per-View revenue
due to the results of events compared to last year's third quarter. High-speed Internet revenue increased 9.6% during the
quarter, making it again the largest contributor to Cable revenue growth, driven by continued growth in our customer
base, rate adjustments, and an increasing number of customers taking higher speed services.

At the end of the quarter, 50% of our residential high-speed customers now receive speeds of 50 megabits or greater as
we continue to increase the speeds included in some of our bundled plans. With regard to voice, revenue decreased
0.5% for the third quarter as the growth in customer base was offset by a modest decline in ARPU.
Moving on to business services, third quarter revenue increased 21% to $1 billion and was again the second largest
contributor to Cable revenue growth in the quarter. This rate of growth is especially impressive given that business
services is now a $4 billion run rate business. The majority of that revenue is generated by small businesses with less
than 20 employees, but the contribution from mid-sized businesses is rapidly increasing and accounted for close to 40%
of business services revenue growth in the quarter.
Cable advertising revenue increased 12.3%, primarily reflecting an increase in political revenue for November's
midterm elections. Excluding the impact of political, our core Cable advertising increased 3.1%. We expect advertising
growth to remain strong in the fourth quarter, again driven by political revenue given the upcoming elections.
Please refer to slide six. Third quarter Cable Communications operating cash flow increased 5.1% to $4.5 billion,
resulting in a stable margin of 40.4% compared to 40.5% in the third quarter of 2013. Included in these results is a legal
settlement that negatively impacted operating cash flow and reduced this growth rate by 40 basis points. This is a
strong financial performance as we effectively manage higher programming costs, an increasing advertising, marketing
and promotion expenses, and absorbed additional expenses to support the deployment of X1, Cloud DVR, and wireless
gateways across our footprint, as well as the continued expansion of business services and XFINITY Home.
Programming expenses increased 7.1% in the third quarter, slightly below our original estimates, but, nonetheless,
reflecting increases in retransmission consent fees, higher sports programming costs, and step-ups related to certain
long-term agreements. We are pleased with the management of these costs year-to-date, and while we expect fourth
quarter programming expense growth to accelerate, we continue to expect our full-year programming expenses to
increase slightly lower than the 9% to 10% we had forecast at the beginning of the year. In addition, advertising,
marketing and promotion expenses increased 9.1% for the third quarter, reflecting higher overall media spend and
continued investment to more effectively target customers and enhance our competitive position in both our residential
and commercial businesses.
We continue to experience modest expense growth in our customer service and technical operations, as we rapidly
deploy X1, Cloud DVR, wireless gateways, and XFINITY Home across our base. And as Brian said earlier, we are not
only focused on offering the best most innovative products, but we want to support them with a superior customer
experience. We are effectively offsetting these increased expenses with improving product mix, as we add more
high-speed data and business services customers and upgrade existing customers to higher levels of services, such as
HD DVRs and faster Internet speeds as well as we implement modest rate adjustments.
Overall, our Cable Group's third quarter and year-to-date results clearly demonstrate that we are executing well and
competing effectively with our innovative products and services that provide a great value to our customers. We are
focused on improving the customer experience, having best-in-class innovative products, and continuing to deliver
strong financial and customer results.
Now let's move on to NBCUniversal's results, which are highlighted on slide seven. NBCUniversal has also executed
very well, delivering double-digit operating cash flow growth in both the third quarter and on a year-to-date basis. In
the third quarter, revenue increased 1.2%, and operating cash flow grew 13.3% driven by strong results at Broadcast
Television and Theme Parks.
Now let's review the individual business segments. For the third quarter, Cable Networks generated revenue of $2.3
billion, an increase of just under 1%, driven by a 5.1% increase in distribution revenue. If we adjust for the closure of
the Style Network, distribution revenue would have increased 7%. This revenue increase was partially offset by a 4.6%
decline in advertising revenue, as increases in price and volume were offset by a decline in ratings. When adjusted for
the closure of Style and the movement of Fandango from Cable Networks to our Film Group, advertising revenue
would have declined 1%.

Cable Networks operating cash flow increased 1.8% to $868 million, reflecting higher revenue and relatively flat
overall expenses, as higher sports programming costs, including our relationship with the Philadelphia Phillies and the
launch of English Premier League on NBC Sports Network were offset by decreases in marketing and other operating
expenses.
With regard to our Broadcast Television segment, third quarter revenue increased 7.7% to $1.8 billion driven by
advertising revenue growth of 4.4%, increased retransmission consent fees, and higher content licensing revenue. The
growth in advertising reflects the ratings success of our primetime summer lineup on NBC as well as our continued
strong performance in late night. As a result, we finished the summer ranked number one, extending our number one
status for the entire year. With the first few weeks of the fall broadcast season now behind us, we are off to a strong
start and optimistic about our 2014 and 2015 schedule.
Broadcast's third quarter operating cash flow increased $108 million to $142 million, reflecting higher revenue and a
slight increase in programming expenses.
Moving to Filmed Entertainment. As expected, third quarter revenue declined $213 million or 15.2% to $1.2 billion,
reflecting a decline in theatrical revenue primarily due to the strong box office performance of Despicable Me 2 in the
third quarter of 2013. This was partially offset by an increase in content licensing revenue due to a larger number of
strong titles compared to the prior year. Third quarter operating cash flow decreased 20% to $151 million as the lower
revenue was partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of film costs and reduced advertising, marketing and
promotion expense due to a smaller film slate.
Our Theme Parks had a remarkable third quarter as revenue grew 18.7% to $786 million, reflecting higher guest
attendance and per capita spending driven by the successful opening of Orlando's Harry Potter – Diagon Alley on July
8. We are off to a strong start with record attendance levels, per capita increases, and a significant lift in park-to-park
ticket sales. In Hollywood, the April opening of the Despicable Me ride continues to drive strong attendance and also
per capita increases. Third quarter operating cash flow increased 16.9% to $402 million, reflecting higher revenue and
an increasing operating cost to support the new attractions.
Let's move to slide eight to review our consolidated and segment capital expenditures. In the third quarter, capital
expenditures continue to track our plan and increased 13% to $2 billion compared to the third quarter of 2013, driven
primarily by increased investments at Cable and a modest increase at NBCUniversal. At Cable Communications, third
quarter capital expenditures increased $212 million or 14.8% to $1.6 billion, equal to 14.9% of Cable revenue versus
13.6% in the third quarter of last year. The increase primarily reflects additional investment as we launch our
cloud-based initiatives, higher spending on CPE as we continue to deploy the X1 platform and Cloud DVR, as well as
our continued investment in network infrastructure to increase our network capacity.
Year-to-date, Cable Communications' capital expenditures have increased 13.7% to $4.3 billion, representing 13% of
Cable revenue. We continue to be very pleased with our X1 rollout. We accelerated our X1 net additions in the third
quarter compared to the second quarter and recently hit the milestone of having 5 million X1 boxes deployed to our
customers. As the deployment expands, the customer benefits have continued. More customers are subscribing to
DVRs and taking additional outlets, there's an increased Video-On-Demand usage and we continue to see reduced
churn levels among these customers.
As originally planned, we anticipate that Cable CapEx spending will accelerate in the fourth quarter and, as a result, we
continue to expect that full year Cable capital intensity will increase to approximately 14% of Cable revenue compared
to 12.9% in 2013. Third quarter capital expenditures at NBCUniversal increased only $11 million to $295 million,
primarily reflecting increased investments in Theme Parks as we continue investing in new attractions, including the
completion of Harry Potter in Orlando and the ongoing development of Harry Potter as well as the Fast & Furious
attraction in Hollywood. Year-to-date, NBCUniversal CapEx has increased $77 million to $884 million. We continue
to expect that NBCUniversal's 2014 capital expenditures remain relatively stable compared to 2013's level.
Please refer to slide nine. As I mentioned earlier, we generated consolidated free cash flow of $2.5 billion in the third
quarter, an increase of 26.7% as growth in consolidated operating cash flow, improvements in working capital, and

lower cash taxes were partially offset by higher capital expenditures. For the first nine months of the year, we generated
$6.5 billion in free cash flow, a decrease of 8.2% over the first nine months of 2013. And year-to-date, free cash flow
per share has decreased 6.8% to $2.46 per share, primarily reflecting increased working capital in the first six months
of the year as we increased our production spending in preparation for a larger 2015 film slate.
We are executing on our 2014 financial plan and, year-to-date, we have increased our return of capital to shareholders
by 33% to $3.9 billion including share repurchases totaling $2.3 billion and dividend payments totaling $1.7 billion.
Now turning to our acquisition of Time Warner Cable and our related transactions with Charter. We received
overwhelming support from our shareholders this month, with more than 99% of the votes cast approving our merger
with Time Warner Cable. We also have strong momentum at the state and local level, having received consents from
more than 90% of the 2,500-plus franchising authorities, covering more than 7,800 franchise areas and communities.
We remain very focused on regulatory approvals as well as the integration planning. We continue to expect the merger
to close in early 2015. As we have mentioned before, we plan to repurchase an additional $2.5 billion of stock before
we close the deal, and we anticipate that the additional share repurchase will be split between the fourth quarter of 2014
and the close of the deal in early 2015.
Overall, we are very pleased with the operational and financial progress we have made during the first nine months of
2014. And we are focused on continuing this momentum. We believe our strong focus on execution will continue to
generate profitable organic growth and continue to yield positive results. We are progressing with the integration
planning of the Time Warner Cable merger and Charter divestitures and remain very excited about the opportunities
these transactions bring to Comcast and the value they create for our customers and shareholders.
Now let me turn the call over to Jason for Q&A.
Jason S. Armstrong
Thanks, Michael. Regina, let's open up the call for Q&A, please.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]
Our first question will come from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: Thank you. Good morning. I have two questions, although they're related. Brian,
there's obviously a lot of focus on Time Warner's announcement last week about an HBO over the top launch, and I
don't know if you want to comment on that specifically. And if not, maybe just broadly philosophically, how do you
and how does Comcast look at the idea of bringing product to market for your consumers that moves the content
distribution model outside of what we historically think of as the TV bundle into a maybe more either Internet-bundled
service or even a direct-to-consumer model? Is that something you think makes sense for the industry for Comcast and
its customers? Do you view that as being a less elegant solution than X1? And then I had sort of a question on the same
lines for Steve around time-shifting and streaming. It seems like we're seeing an acceleration in behavioral shift. Do
you have a sense, Steve, how much leakage in viewership you're seeing in comparing Nielsen ratings to what's actually
happening at the customer level, particularly at your Cable Networks? And how do you fix that problem over time?
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: Okay. Ben, thank you. I think I'll start and maybe give Neil a chance to talk a little bit about
your first question then we'll kick it over to Steve. I'm going to defer to talk about any of the specific announcements,
but as I said earlier, I do think it's – all companies are trying to figure out how to reach all customers, potential
customers, and do what's right for their company in their mind. But I do think our existing business model is very
strong this quarter, last quarter, and probably future quarters will show that many people want these bundles. But we

are experimenting with products like – and rolling out Internet Plus, where we offer one of our best broadband speeds,
along with a smaller television package along with HBO. We have a Campus product that is very exciting, which really
you don't get a box. It's simply a streaming product right from the get-go. So I think our – both our innovation
department, our network, and our existing relationships and our relationship with content companies, you put that all
together, and that puts us in a great position to try to reach many consumers and work with each company to try to find
the best answer with their content. Neil?
<A - Neil Smit>: Yeah. I think clearly there's some shifting in the ecosystem, and we're focused on targeting every
customer segment. As Brian mentioned, we were the first to introduce HBO – or Internet Plus product targeted at the
Millennials together with HBO. We have a great working relationship with them, and I expect that to continue. The X1
product actually is driving more linear viewing, and we think that also targets everyone, not just the Millennial group.
<A - Stephen B. Burke>: So, Ben, at the beginning of your question, you mentioned that the HBO product was an
over the top product. I actually don't think it is, and I don't think the CBS product is over the top either. If you define
over the top sort of coming over the top of the existing distributors and going direct and bypassing existing distributors,
I think both HBO and CBS are trying to add to their existing ecosystem. And if you think about it, HBO probably has
the most elegant, economically attractive sort of business model of anybody who has ever been in the television
business. And it's going to be very interesting and I think challenging for them to go and try to attract new customers
into that ecosystem without cannibalizing the existing customers.
The existing customers that are sold through cable and satellite are extremely high margin. So even if they sell at $15 a
sub, they've got to be very – when they go directly to consumers via the Internet, they've got to be very careful with
cannibalization. It'll be interesting to see how that works. But I don't think they're saying we're going over the top of the
existing ecosystem. I mean, Time Warner was a company that really created TV Everywhere. I think CBS is the same
thing. CBS is not, I don't think, trying to get their existing ecosystem to move over to a new model. They're trying to
reach Millennials or new customers. And I think that's what we're all trying to do.
And that leads into the second part of your question about time-shifting and leakage. I think the fact of the matter is
people have more options to watch quality, professionally-produced video than ever before, and they're using those
options, whether it's DVR, Netflix, Hulu, or a variety of other ways to consume this content. A lot of those options are
not properly measured. Some of those options are not measured at all. And so what you're seeing, I think, is a pressure
on traditional ratings in both Broadcast, which has been going on for a while, but now Cable.
I think some of that is going to get better. I think there will be business models that evolve. Some of that we've
addressed by selling to Hulu and Netflix and Amazon, and we make hundreds of millions of dollars doing that. But I
think it's going to be more and more challenging. There was a great article a few months ago that said that there were
88 new television shows launched during the summer. And this is in a business that 20 years ago, nobody launched a
new television show during the summer. So that competition combined with new technology is making it harder and
harder to deliver the kind of ratings that we've all been used to.
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: Thanks a lot.
<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: Hey, Ben, it's Michael. The only thing I would add is I really want to emphasize the
value of our product. If you really look at the last 12 months, we've lost about 155,000 video customers, and we've been
overbuilt by an additional 2.2 million overbuilt homes. And we've also increased our bundles by over 200 basis points
year-over-year. So the value of our products, we think, are pretty compelling, and I think the numbers are showing that
for us.
<Q - Benjamin D. Swinburne>: Yup. Thank you very much.

Your next question will come from the line of Craig Moffett with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.
<Q - Craig Eder Moffett>: Hi. Thank you. Two questions, I guess both for Neil, probably. Neil, first, you've probably
heard a lot of people now more openly speculating about a Wi-Fi-first retail offering in wireless. Can you just update us
on your thinking about that? And then second, if I could just follow up to the comment that Michael just made about
the over-build and yet the relatively small video losses. Can you expand on that a little bit? Does that imply that you're
actually gaining share in the places where you're just competing against satellite at this point?
<A - Neil Smit>: Sure, Craig. On the Wi-Fi-first front, we continue to extend our Wi-Fi network both in-home and
out-of-home. We have a total of about five million hotspots. The majority of those are in-home. But we think it's a very
powerful asset going forward. We're not – we haven't clearly identified how to best monetize that asset, but the in-home
Wi-Fi usage, about half our HSD customers have our high-end routers with the highest in-home speeds, and they're
hanging more devices off them every day, and I think there are going to be more connected devices coming, and Wi-Fi
will be an important aspect of the subscription value.
With regards to the video business, I think there were a number of good things that happened this quarter. One is we
targeted effectively. What really drove the video number was churn reduction. I think we're getting better customers.
We're screening them better. And I think also we're bundling better. As Michael said, we went out 200 basis points on
double and triple play churn bundles. And so the video business is strong. X1 continues to pull well. It was about 20%
of our triple plays now and about 75% of the triple play net adds this quarter. And all the metrics around X1 seem to be
holding: the churn, voluntary churn reduction is down about 20%; the DVR purchases are up; the transactional VOD is
up 20%. So it continues to perform very well.
<Q - Craig Eder Moffett>: Should we assume that most of your losses at this point are to telco TV or – and net you're
roughly break-even? Or are you better than that against satellite at this point?
<A - Neil Smit>: I think it depends on the market, but we're performing well, we feel, against both the telcos and
satellite players.
<Q - Craig Eder Moffett>: Great. Thank you

Your next question comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Thanks. Also two questions: one NBC, one Cable. On NBCU, I'm hoping Steve
would comment on – there is a big contrast between the Broadcast and Cable advertising growth. Is this all ratings in
your view? You mentioned the measurement issues. When does that actually get resolved, the measurement devices
and non-linear viewing? How much would you attribute to programmatic buying, some of which obviously will come
back into television? And any commentary you can give in terms of share shift within media? Some of the money is
actually going to digital properties. Are you seeing it in your digital properties? So that's the NBC question.
<A - Stephen B. Burke>: That was actually seven questions, but I'll try to answer them all as one. You know, I think
some of it is measurement. Nielsen did the – sort of put in broadband homes into the denominator and appears to be
taking them out now, and there are some sort of pure math measurement. I think there's also sort of a feeling that it's
increasingly difficult to – particularly when you're looking at demo ratings 18 to 49, it's increasingly difficult to get
measurement in upscale young homes. So I think there's always a question about that.
But I think the fact of the matter is the next five or 10 years in basic entertainment cable, as it relates to ratings, are
going to be much more difficult than the last five to 10 years. And there's a side of that that's technology and there's a
side of that that's a lot of new shows and the ability to have your acquired programming, your repeat programming,
which many of these cable networks were built on. When you can get those episodes in other places, I think those are
going to be tougher businesses than they have been. We don't see – the advertising number, as it relates to Cable, was

primarily driven by ratings, not by CPMs. I do think you're seeing kind of a resurgence of the advertising business as
NBC resurges, so that explains some of the change there. But our big cable channels, particularly when sold as a
portfolio, are very attractive and very powerful. I just think it's unreasonable to assume that the ratings for those
businesses are going to grow if you look over a 5-year or 10-year period.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: And the digital shift?
<A - Stephen B. Burke>: There's clearly a shift to digital. You can't talk to a marketer or an advertising agency that
isn't talking about shifting dollars to digital. I do think to the degree the upfront was a little slower for some people, we
actually had a very good upfront. But for some people, it was not so good. And the question is, is it tentativeness on the
part of advertisers, or a shift to digital? I'm in the camp that says it was more tentativeness and keeping flexibility. The
fact of the matter is digital can't deliver the same kind of emotional attitude adjusting advertising that a 30-second
television spot can, and I think a lot of advertisers intellectually want to get the targetability and data-driven side of
digital, but they also realize when they have a big product to get out into the market, that they need television.
So I think clearly there is a shift to digital, but I think the market is likely to be quite strong. And the question we
always get asked is how's scatter? Scatter is just fine. It's steady, and for us because we've had outperformance at NBC
and sell as a portfolio, we're seeing very, very fine attractive steady trends in the scatter market.
<Q - Jessica Jean Reif Cohen>: Great. And then on the Cable question, it's just I guess a follow up on some of the
XFINITY comments. You mentioned five million set-top boxes now. Can you talk about where you might be a year
from now? And, what are you seeing in terms of usage? You said linear viewing is up. What do you think overall
usage? And is there a difference in ARPU? You already said churn is lower, 20% better. But what other statistics are
you finding from XFINITY?
<A - Neil Smit>: What we said publicly is that we will have the X1 boxes to the majority of our customers within three
years, and I think we're right on track. In terms of the performance, X1 customers do have a higher ARPU and they
have a higher ARPU for three reasons. One is the VOD buys are greater, 20% higher. Two is they get almost two times
the number of DVRs than the average customer. And three is they have more additional outlets. They're getting – they
want to use the system more, it's getting more usage. We're seeing more viewing both on linear and On Demand, and I
think that's just because we're making it easier to discover and find the content. I think that we're going to continue to
see good results. We continue to refine the product. And I haven't seen any slowdown in the performance metrics.
<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: The only thing I would add is when you look at the triple play, sort of the customer
lifetime value of an X1 triple play, obviously, given what Neil just said in the reduced churn, we do have a pretty darn
good return on that investment of X1, and we have an improvement in the CLV.
<A - Neil Smit>: And we've opened up the availability from both – from triple play and now double play customers
and in retention. So there's a wider audience who has it available.
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: Just to state the obvious, we're very pleased with how stable it is. We're doing something
that's never been done before. Nobody else is doing this, I don't think anywhere in the world right now, and it's scaling,
we're growing. We have accelerated already, and if we can continue to do things, it's a game changer. And to the extent
that we can speed up in ways, I think it's our goal, but we also want to deliver a great experience with it. And it's a
complicated process to get it into the home working perfectly, but once it's there, it's fantastic.

<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Okay. Thanks, guys. I want to focus a little bit more on the lower video churn. First, is that
being driven by just increased acceleration or penetration of X1, or are there other factors that are driving that down?
And then as you look forward towards the completion of the transactions, move churn has always been a factor in the
sub trends. I mean, how would the better clustering that comes from the deal and the swaps affect that factor? I mean,
can we expect sort of another step-down towards a video churn aside from the X1 issues? And then, Neil, you talked a
little bit about the pull-through effects on DVR, but what about broadband? I mean, as we see better churn and better
video trends, is that going to have a – do you have a higher attachment rate for broadband with X1 that should help
kind of make those trends continue as we've seen recently? Thanks.
<A - Neil Smit>: Okay. You have a number of questions in there.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Yeah.
<A - Neil Smit>: The video churn was driven – the churn reduction, I should say, was driven by a few factors; one is,
X1. It just has a lower churn profile than the business-as-usual boxes. Second is we're bundling more, so we have 68%
in a bundle. And then triple play at 36% reduces the overall churn significantly. And three is I think that some of the
new features we're adding in like electronic sell-through where you own the asset and it reduces churn, it could holds
you into the system, it's very sticky. So I think there are a few reasons there. And I think we've tightened up the credit
policies. We're targeting customers better. We're being more effective in our marketing.
Concerning the X1 and its relation to broadband pull-through, I think, generally speaking, if you've got better products
and you put them together – we've got the best broadband product, the best Wi-Fi product and the best video product –
I think no matter how you mix them, you're going to get greater pull-through. And we've been creatively bundling a
number of different offers, going after different segments, and it's been working.
<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: And I'll just comment on the move churn. Of course, one of the benefits of the
transaction is more territory, which would hopefully reduce move churn in what we call those jump balls. And we've
looked at that, that's simply a benefit of the transaction, ultimately will show up in our revenue synergies, which we are
optimistic on.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Okay.
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: One thing I just want to say maybe kind of relates to the deal in general, but to that point on
what are some of the benefits of the transaction – remember, obviously, there's no overlap, so we're not reducing any
competition as we have made the case. But products like X1, faster broadband, faster Wi-Fi, now Cloud – we haven't
talked about Cloud DVR and streaming in-home, where you don't need a device, like the Campus product, we have
more On Demand. So for those of you in New York or in L.A. on the call, we have been really looking forward to
bringing this suite of products as fast as possible. We're doing a lot of work to try to have an integration plan to hit the
ground as fast as humanly possible.
The business service side being able to have more markets, and Charlie Herrin, one of the first things he's working on
in his new job in customer experience is that move churn question, which is to – when you're on the phone want to take
you all the way to completion for the move so we can reduce the friction in the system for people who are moving. So
we're anxious to bring this, we think, better suite of products to these new markets, along with things like Internet
Essentials and offering the whole array of benefits that we've listed in the transaction. But I think it's the better
products, and we're working hard to have a plan to do that as quickly as possible after close.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Brian, you guys have a – you guys have said that you'll have X1 penetration to the majority
of your sort of Comcast legacy subs in three years. Considering that the platform is already set and it's stable, can you
do better than that in terms of the new markets once the deal is closed?
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: That's the stuff we're working on right now. And everybody we – I'm not ready to answer
that question right this minute, but Neil has set a very high bar for the team internally to say that's the game changer.
How fast can we get this suite of products to all the markets that are Time Warner Cable, but let's just – you're in New
York, you know, in New York. And that's – we have to learn a lot about how it operates in New York. We're doing that

Your next question comes from the line of Phil Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Hi, guys. Thanks. Neil, speaking of drawing more customers into the video ecosystem, can
you talk about the success of your On Campus efforts and the big mix shift this quarter to double play from triple play?
Is that a back-to-school issue, or do you think there's some secular sign of a down shift in voice penetration rate?
Thanks.
<A - Neil Smit>: No. I'll answer them in reverse. The double play was more a result of – the double play focus was
more a result of the back-to-school, which is such a big part of our third quarter net adds, the students are less focused
on the fixed line phone and go with a wireless alternative. The other thing that happened last year in the third quarter,
we launched X1, and it was available only to triple play customers, so that drove a lot of phone units during that
quarter. So the comp was difficult. Concerning the – repeat your other question.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: I'm just trying to think about drawing more customers to the ecosystem. As you think about
back-to-school, you've been putting in some skinnier video packages. Is that starting to draw more people in who might
otherwise have just gone to broadband?
<A - Neil Smit>: The skinnier packages – we look at the audiences that we want to target and that aren't responding to
certain offers. And we're always testing offers to find out which package draws them out the best. The XFINITY
Campus product that you mentioned, what was great about that is we went to the campuses, and in many of those
campuses we offer business services too, whether it's Ethernet or whatever. And students wanted to watch television,
but they wanted to watch it in their dorms on their laptops. So we came up with this streaming solution where we plug
into the university network. It's not seasonal, because it's a bulk deal. And, we're getting standing ovations at these
universities. We've got six universities we're currently providing the service to and a number of others in rollout mode
now. So I think it's a great new product. It's a way of targeting an audience and getting Millennials used to watching all
the great content that's being produced right now in a way that's convenient to them.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: That's great. Thanks, Neil.

Your next question comes from the line of Vijay Jayant with ISI Group. Please go ahead.
<Q - Vijay Jayant>: Thank you. I just want to follow up on the prior question, Neil. You know, it seems that the
skinny video packages are having some traction, but I understand that there's some limitations on how pervasive that
can be given your contracts with the widely-distributed content providers. So, can you talk about where you are on that
lifecycle and how much flexibility you still have? And, once you do hit that, what can you do next just to keep those
customers within the ecosystem? Thanks.
<A - Neil Smit>: Well, we don't disclose our programming contracts and the penetration requirements, but we manage
within the realm of those contracts and the offers, and we manage that and control that very closely. What was
interesting is, this Q3, if you take Internet Plus and Blast Plus, which were the two lean products we had last year, and

you were to compare Internet Plus and Blast Plus to this third quarter, we actually sold fewer Internet Plus and Blast
Plus net adds this quarter than last year. So the mix was a little bit different. And our ARPU was, and revenue were a
little bit soft in video because we took fewer rate increases this year than the year before.
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: So let me just say that when you're talking about confidentiality of the programming
contracts, Neil, let me just use that as a moment to just clarify what I believe happened yesterday with the FCC. It's that
issue of confidentiality of programming agreements that the FCC and the programmers are debating, and so there's a
procedural issue on how to go forward, and that's between them. And I don't believe and we don't believe that has any –
the stoppage to respond to that doesn't reflect any substantive concerns with our transaction. So we're not particularly
concerned about that development because we believe the FCC is still doing, continuing with the staff that's working on
the substantive review, and even if the clock stopped – and this has happened in other transactions as well – but this
particular dispute over programming contracts is kind of new.
So we continue to believe that the review will get completed as we previously said and hopefully close sometime early
2015.

Your next question comes from the line of Brett Feldman with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brett, your line may
be on mute.
<Q - Brett Joseph Feldman>: Thank you. Sorry about that. Thanks for taking the question. A point of clarification:
you mentioned the pacing of the additional share repurchase program. I'm just curious, is that at all sensitive to the
actual pace of the approval process, for example, does it matter that the FCC has paused their shot clock? And then I
want to go back to talk about churn. All the things you highlighted, whether it's X1 or increased triple play, those things
seem like they're going to continue. And so it would seem that churn is likely to continue to migrate lower going
forward. Do you think it's reasonable for us to anticipate that as a result of that, your video trends will continue to
improve on a year-over-year basis, or is there an offsetting factor we need to be taking into account?
<A - Michael J. Angelakis>: Okay. I'll take the buyback one obviously. Our view on buyback is really simple. It's not
necessarily correlated to the shot clock or pacing. Our intention is to do the $2.5 billion of additional buyback that we
had always mentioned and split it evenly $1.25 billion in the fourth quarter of this year and $1.25 billion in the early
parts of the first quarter of 2015. So we are putting a finer point on that.
With regards to churn, and I'll let Neil take it, but I think the goal has always been just to continue to improve. And I
think we've improved 14 quarters of the last 16 quarters with regards to video.
<A - Neil Smit>: I think that's right. It's been a pretty steady trend, and we think it's because we're putting out better
product, and I think we're always managing the balance between units and rate and trying to balance out that equation
and looking for new segments and bringing new products to market and opening up new channels such as the campus
channel.

either to be at the last mile or at the interconnect? And then secondly, for Steve, were you surprised by the HBO or the
CBS announcements, or is this something that you either had a feeling was coming or they gave you a heads up for?
Thanks.
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: I think in terms of the D.C. question – this is Brian – we have been pretty consistent and
we're still in the same place, which is that we think that broadband innovation and investment are critical to not just our
company but to the nation's infrastructure, and that the best way to have a strong and robust investment cycle as well as
real protections for consumers is through Section 706, that there's a real consensus among all the Internet service
providers and I think the Internet community in general that strong rules, having an open and free Internet are important
and we support that initiative. But we don't want to have a rule set that creates uncertainty and lingering doubt, which
we believe Title II does. So that's our position. I think that's the position of a number of companies. And we have been
hopeful that that's how it will resolve itself.
<A - Stephen B. Burke>: Regarding HBO and CBS selling directly, I was surprised. I was surprised by both of them
for different reasons. CBS, I was surprised because they've been such a defender of retransmission consent in the
traditional ecosystem and been so successful in the Broadcast business, and HBO because I think it's going to be such a
challenge for them to not cannibalize what is already a really, really good business. That having been said, we're so
early on in the transition to more Internet television that I think you're going to see a lot of surprising things. And it's
surprising to me that we're making hundreds of millions of dollars from Hulu and Netflix and Amazon, businesses that
we didn't even think about five years ago.
So I think we all ought to be prepared to be surprised every once in a while but also put everything in perspective and
really look at what people's real motivations are and the challenges. I don't think distributing directly to consumers via
the Internet is an easy thing to do, and I think it's a voyage that, if you're successful like Netflix, can be a way to create
a lot of value. But it's not an easy thing to do.
<A - Brian L. Roberts>: One other thing, I guess, just to add back on the regulatory is the interconnection question, if
there is one, is being looked at separately by the FCC, and we think that we've supported that and welcomed that
review. We're very hopeful that that will show that it's our motivation and our practice is to be completely transparent
and have great products for consumers and for companies who want to reach those consumers.
<Q - Marci L. Ryvicker>: Thank you.
<A - Jason S. Armstrong>: Thanks, Marci. Regina, just given the time, we'll take one last question, please.
Operator
Our final question will come from the line of Jason Bazinet with Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason Boisvert Bazinet>: Thanks. I just had a question for Mr. Burke. Given the changes that are going on in the
video ecosystem and some of the trends you alluded to going forward for Cable Networks, what adjustments, if any, do
you think investors should anticipate regarding your Cable Net portfolio? Thanks.
<A - Stephen B. Burke>: Well, I think we're always making adjustments and trying to look at new things. If you take
USA, for example, we're going to be investing more in original programming. We're not going to put a number on that
because a lot of it is show dependent. But investing in original programming, we're going to try to make that – we're
changing the lens on that programming. If you went back five years or so, USA was in the business of creating Blue
Sky procedurals, and we're much more interested in serialized, slightly edgier content. I think you could see us taking
some of our existing sports that are on other channels and putting them on USA. So there'll be a whole variety of
changes and hopefully those changes result in a hit and our ability to outperform the rest of the sector.
I do think that the point that we're trying to make is that the sector is unlikely to have ratings performance over the next
five years or 10 years that's as good as it was over the last five years or 10 years simply because it's more competitive
and there's more technological change out there.

So let me just end the call by saying thanks, as always, for the good questions and interest in the company. I think we
had a really strong third quarter. I think it reflects the quality of the underlying businesses. The teams are executing
well. They're staying focused, which is, as we talked about, really at a very complicated time. A lot of momentum at
NBCUniversal, and in Cable, we talked a lot about the innovation and what that's doing to our results. So I'm pretty –
really pleased with the team there and what's happening in the trends. And the positioning of X1 and the ability to take
it in-the-home on other devices, out-of-the-home with TV Everywhere, Cloud DVR now working, Wi-Fi getting faster
and better, bringing that to the Time Warner markets, the transaction review. We've now submitted everything that's
been required. A lot of the local franchises have been approved. It's an exciting time for the company and an exciting
time for the industry. So, good quarter, everybody. Thank you.
