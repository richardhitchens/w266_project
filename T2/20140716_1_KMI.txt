MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to the Quarterly Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded. If you have
any objections you may disconnect at this time.
And I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Rich Kinder, Chairman and CEO of Kinder Morgan. Sir, you may
begin.
Richard D. Kinder
Okay. Thank you, Anna. As usual welcome to the Kinder Morgan Second Quarter Investor Call. As usual we'll be
making statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Overall it was another strong quarter for the Kinder Morgan companies. Looking at the full year, now that we're half
way through it, we expect all three companies, KMI, KMP and EPB to meet or exceed their distribution targets for the
full year, 2014. Let me cover just a few significant matters and then I'll turn the call over to Steve Kean, our Chief
Operating Officer, who will talk in more detail about our operating performance and the growth that our backlog of
new projects and then we'll turn it over to Kim Dang, our CFO, who will go through the detailed financial numbers for
the quarter and year-to-date.
On the operating performance side, we had continued very strong performance from our largest segment, our Natural
Gas Pipelines segment, primarily as a result of very good performance at Tennessee Pipeline, the El Paso Natural Gas,
and also positive results from the Copano acquisition, which was made a little over a year ago.

In our Products Pipeline segment, refined product volumes were up again this quarter, up 6.5%. That seems like a very
strong number but this is a little misleading because it includes the volumes on our new Parkway Pipeline project. If
you strip that out and go to what I would call a same-store basis, it's – our volumes for refined products are up 4.4%.
That's still about double the EIA number for the second quarter, which was 2.3%.
Also in that segment are new Cochin Reversal project began service on July 1, on time and on budget.
In our CO2 segment, we recorded record CO2 production in our source fields in Southwest Colorado and we had
growing oil production lead by 7% increase at our SACROC unit in the Permian Basin.
In our Terminals segment, we had solid growth in earnings before DD&A, about 60% of that was organic, with the
balance coming from primarily from our APT tanker acquisition, which we closed in January of this year.
Now on the business development front we had another very productive quarter. Steve will discuss the project backlog,
which increased to $17 billion. That's a net increase of $600 million from the first quarter, even after removing from
the backlog $700 million in projects that went into service during the quarter, which means that we added about $1.3
billion to the backlog in the second quarter. The bulk of that came in our Natural Gas Pipelines business.
Now in the first quarter call, I talked about the tremendous increase in demand for natural gas transportation. Given the
increase in demand and the disconnect between where that demand is located, primarily the Gulf Coast, and where
much of the new supply is being developed, primarily the Northeast, Marcellus/Utica, that leads to great opportunities
we believe at Kinder Morgan where we move about one-third of all the natural gas consumed in the United States
through our 70,000 miles of gas pipelines.
I'm a huge believer, as some of you know in anecdotal evidence and there were two interesting pieces of anecdotal
evidence to surface this week. The EIA said on Monday that Marcellus production will be at 15.5 billion Bcf per day in
August and they projected it will surpass Qatar's gas production in September. Now Qatar is the world's third largest
producer of natural gas. I think that gives you an idea of the extent of the production ramp up that's occurring in the
Marcellus.
In another matter, another estimate of CapEx of – estimated to be needed to transport all of this rapidly increasing
natural gas production came from the INGAA Foundation this week and they estimated that there would need to be
$114 billion spent on gas infrastructure between now and 2020. Again, two more in this year that support the idea we're
talking about, which is this tremendous opportunity to build additional natural gas infrastructure to move this gas
around the country from the place it's produced to the place it's really needed.
Now putting that into perspective at the Kinder Morgan Company's, we talked about some of this back in the first
quarter call, but if you look across the KMP, KMI, and EPB gas pipelines, you go back to the beginning of December
2013 until now, we've secured commitments of slightly in excess of 3.5 Bcf a day. These are long-term firm
commitments to natural gas transportation capacity.
Third, we have now another approximately 1.7 Bcf a day of pending transactions. The majority of this 1.7 Bcf a day is
related to third-party LNG facilities, all of which are credible LNG export projects. Now these LNG commitments
together with another approximately 300 million of other per day, of other pending commitments would bring the total
long-term capacity signed up across Kinder Morgan's gas pipelines to approximately 5.3 Bcf per day since the
beginning of December. Now, to put that in context for you, that represents over 7% of the current daily U.S. natural
gas demand. So, it's a very significant, very important number.
Now, among the many projects in the planning stage, but not in the backlog, is our Northeast Energy Direct Project,
where we are targeting execution of proceeding agreements during the third quarter. This is a very significant project
and it could move Bcf a day or more from the Marcellus supply area across New York and New England to Dracut,
Massachusetts. Again, we expect to have precedent agreements, preceding agreements, by the end of this quarter. Now
the horse is not in the corral yet but we wanted to make you aware of the potential of that very large project.
And we've detailed the status and progress on numerous other expansion projects and some acquisitions in our earnings
releases including our own LNG projects, additional infrastructure of NGL including condensate transportation, and the

development of additional CO2 supply for the booming Permian Basin. I won't go into all detail on all of these but
we're confident that our expansion opportunities will be real growth drivers for years to come at the Kinder Morgan
companies.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve.
Steven J. Kean
All right. Thanks, Rich. I'm going to start with the backlog. We've been providing quarterly updates to the backlog of
our high probability expansion projects for a couple of years now. In this quarter's update we increased the backlog
from $16.4 billion to $17 billion. And that number is combined across KMP, EPB, and KMI. So we added $600 million
to the backlog, but we were putting in service over the quarter, $700 million of projects, so our project additions of
about $1.3 billion grew the backlog while we rolled some of those offsetting projects into service.
Other projects that went into service the bigger ones were, the Terminals Group's $250 million BOSTCO project in the
Houston Ship Channel, 51 tanks where we completed construction of those in the quarter; the Gas Group put into
service about $200 million worth of projects, including the first phase of our expansion of southbound capacity on the
TGP system. We also had about $150 million worth of projects come into service in CO2 segment. So overall, the Gas
Group and the Terminals Group led the way. On a net basis, Gas added about $500 million to the backlog, again at
KMP and EPB, and Terminals had a net addition of about $200 million.
We also added – we keep track of how we're doing in filling in kind of the middle years of the backlog. We added
about $500 million to the backlog for the years 2015 and 2016. Generally we have a backlog that's front-end loaded for
the projects we're working on in the near term and then back-end loaded for our big projects, Trans Mountain and
EPB's liquefaction related projects at Elba. As we proceed we expect to keep adding to those middle years, and if you
look back a year ago to the second quarter of 2014, from then till now, we've added $2 billion worth of projects to 2015
and 2016 along the way. So again, continuing to show that as we work our way through time, we continue to add to
those middle years.
So the bottom line is we're continuing to find new opportunities and they're more than offsetting the projects that we're
putting into service. Backlog is growing, and that's a result of great opportunities we're seeing really across the North
American natural gas, oil and condensate network.
Now, I'm going to go through the segments individually, and here I'll compare really year-over-year, so second quarter
of 2013 to second quarter of 2014. I'll talk about it on a segment earnings before DD&A basis and then cover some of
the key developments. Starting with Gas, KMP earnings before DD&A was up $76 million or 13% year-over-year.
That's driven by the year-over-year impact of Copano. We had a May 2013 close on that asset. Also strong
performance at TGP, about $41 million associated with TGP itself. And those two factors were offsetting declines at
Eagle Hawk Gathering and in KM Treating in our Midstream business.
At EPB, the earnings before DD&A was up $22 million. Now that's adding back joint venture DD&A to get that
year-over-year change. And here the rate case impacts on SNG and WIC, plus some weaker renewal rates on the WIC
system were more than offset by the benefits of the drop-downs of Ruby and Gulf LNG from KMI to EPB. The key
development here as Rich mentioned, is the demand for long-term firm transport capacity. And really, essentially all
the trends that we've been watching and talking about for years, whether that's LNG exports or the growing shale
production or exports to Mexico, all of those things that we've been watching materialize and grow over these years,
are now turning into firm long-term commitments. So those trends have ripened enough that people are now putting ink
on paper and signing up to multi-year agreements for significant amounts of capacity.
And that has a couple effects; if you look at the 5.3 Bcf Kinder Morgan-wide that Rich pointed out, over 700 million of
that is existing system capacity that was previously unsold. And a significant part of the expansion projects make use of
the existing system as well. So what that means is these things, this trend, this capacity sign-up is driving not only
investment opportunities for us, it's also driving values on our existing system.

And we're not through yet, we think. If you look at – I talked about the trends that have really manifested themselves
and turned into firm transport contracts, there are other trends that we're all aware of that have not fully translated into
firm transport agreements yet. So they haven't fully played out. For example, growth in natural gas-fired power
demand, increasing conversions from coal to natural gas, et cetera on the power demand side, also, industrial demand
and PetChem demand.
We are starting to see in our Midstream Group customers in the industrial side signing up for some slightly longer-term
commitments as they see demand for capacity in the future increasing, but there are – you can read these estimates,
some of them are mind boggling, but $100 billion of investment in Louisiana alone, tens of billions of dollars in Texas;
well over $100 billion across the Gulf Coast. And we're just on the front edge of that, so I think there's more to come in
terms of what our network will be called upon to do.
The other big thing is that I think some of these trends, particularly power demand but also LNG, they're going to
become consumers of storage. And storage values have been depressed and I think we're at the beginning of seeing
some of that turn around as well.
Now, it's not all good news. There are difficult basis spreads in some parts of the country still, particularly in the
Rockies region, but overall the trend is very good and the performance year-over-year is very strong.
Turning to CO2, earnings before DD&A is up $9 million or 3% on a year-over-year basis. There the growth is driven
by higher CO2 and oil volumes. We also had higher CO2 and NGL prices. On the oil price side we had higher oil
prices, but we sell at Midland and the Midland-to-Cushing spread really completely offset that for us, but we did
experience higher CO2 and NGL prices. And on the volume side, really good growth. SACROC continues to perform
extremely well, above its plan and up 7% on a year-over-year basis. Adding to that improved volumes on a
year-over-year basis at Katz and the addition of the Goldsmith Unit; and those more than offset somewhat lower
volumes at Yates. Looking forward, we continue to work on several large development projects to bring more CO2 to
our fields and to the market as well.
Turning to products, earnings before DD&A up $30 million or 17% on a year-over-year basis. The year-over-year
improvements were a transmix, KMCC, and SFPP and those were offsetting a decline at Cochin. Cochin, in the second
quarter we were really in the thick of physically turning the system around from being a NGL and propane, north to
south flowing facility to a condensate south to north flowing facility, which we started taking initial receipts in on July
1 on that conversion.
Key developments here, improved refined products volumes year-over-year as Rich mentioned, and ramp-up of KMCC
volumes year-over-year, but also especially in the latter part of the second quarter. We covered refined volumes, but we
also saw biofuel volumes go up 7% year-over-year and increased our share, if you combine what we handle in the
Products group with what we handle in Terminals, to 33% of the ethanol handled nationwide.
Looking forward, we continue to advance the growth projects we have, primarily building off of KMCC system in the
Eagle Ford shale and our Cochin Reversal project, and we continue work on the UTOPIA and UMTP prospects as well,
although neither of those are in our backlog at this point.
In the Terminals business unit earnings before DD&A is up $36 million or 18%. That's split about 60/40 between
organic growth and acquisitions. On the acquisition front, the main impact is about $12 million year-over-year
attributable to the APT Jones Act vessel acquisition. On the organic side, we had some big expansions coming online
and the year-over-year uptick from that at Edmonton and BOSTCO and the Houston Ship Channel. Overall,
year-over-year liquids throughput was up 8.3% primarily crude and biofuels there. And if you look at where we stand
now compared to last year, we have added capacity to the tune of 16%. We are up to 72 million barrels of liquids
capacity, but our utilization has stayed essentially flat at 95%. So, we're putting that capacity on and it's getting fully
utilized.
On the bulk side, we saw improvement in petcoke. That's our BP Whiting expansion. Also on steel volumes, offset
somewhat by higher labor and utility costs and we had weak coal volumes. It didn't really have an impact on the
year-over-year financial results because we have take-or-pay contracts, but overall volumes were weak in the coal

markets and we had expansions that came online over that period. But netting it all out, total bulk volumes were up
about 2% year-over-year.
During the quarter, we also added a newbuild Jones Act vessel to the fleet. We'll be taking delivery in 2017. It's already
under long-term charter with a major shipper. And looking forward here, as you can tell by the utilization numbers
going hand-in-hand with those capacity increases or in spite of, if you will, those capacity increases, we continue to see
very strong demand for liquids storage and handling, particularly in Houston and Edmonton. That bodes well for
expansion but also for our renewal rates going forward. And some of those expansions are kind of the traditional banks
and terminaling facilities but also seeing expansions in crude by rail opportunities. And again the hub of those things is
in Edmonton and the Houston Ship Channel – for us, Edmonton and the Houston Ship Channel.
Kinder Morgan Canada, as usual, the big story here continues to be our Trans Mountain expansion where we're
expanding our existing system from 300,000 barrels a day to 890,000 barrels we've got under long-term contract. Those
contract structure and the economics are all approved. We're working our way through the NEB process and our key
objectives here are complete our work, meet the NEB standards, consult with the First Nations, accommodate
provincial and local authorities, et cetera.
We do have one recent update here. We yesterday got a revised schedule order from the NEB and essentially the issue
here that is being addressed is the last about five kilometers of build from Burnaby Mountain, which is where our tank
farm is down to the dock. It's a heavy urban build. We've looked at multiple routes to accommodate local concerns and
the NEB has set aside a separate kind of six-month process to evaluate which of those routes on that last piece of the
build is the most optimal; and they have allowed an extra six months for that process, a little over six months. And they
extended the deadline and the procedural schedule by that same six-and-a-half or six months and three weeks from
what was going to be a July of 2015 date to a January of 2016 date.
So that will have an impact on the schedule. It will have a delay. It will cause a delay in the schedule. But we don't
know what the magnitude of it is just yet. There are a lot of hands to be played here in terms of looking at how we're
going to approach construction, the staging of the construction, et cetera, what we might ask for on the procedural front
to try to move things along a little more quickly. We're in the early days – this just happened yesterday – in the early
days of evaluating it. But so where we were on a very tight schedule for the very end of 2017, we feel like we are going
to get pushed into 2018 with this order. It's just a question of how far, and we'll be evaluating the best way to handle
that from here.
All right. That's the segment update. With that, I'll turn it over to Kim for the rest of the numbers.
Kimberly Allen Dang
Okay, all right. So looking at the financials on KMP, on the first page, the financials, which is the GAAP income
statement. Today, the KMP board approved a distribution per unit of $1.39, which is a $0.07 increase or 5% increase
over the second quarter in 2013. That results in a year-to-date distribution per unit of $2.77, which is $0.15 or a 6%
increase over the first six months of 2013.
On the GAAP income statement, there's not a lot to focus on here from my perspective. I'll just point out one thing: you
can see that net income attributable to KMP is down $339 million in the three months. That's largely effect – that is the
effect of certain items, with the largest of those being the $558 million revaluation gain that we had in the second
quarter of 2013 when we had to revalue the second half of our Eagle – or the first half of our Eagle Ford investment at
the same – valued at the same price we paid for the second half that we bought in the Copano transaction. Those certain
items is really why we focus your attention on the second page, which is our calculation of distributable cash flow, and
obviously we reconciled this, our distributable cash flow, back to our GAAP numbers.
But DCF per unit in the quarter was $1.23, up from $1.22 in 2013, so about a 1% increase; year-to-date, $2.77, so up
$0.10 or 4% from the first six months of 2013. The $1.23 versus the $1.39 of our declared distribution means that we
have negative coverage in the quarter of about $75 million and as we tell you every quarter, we expect to have negative

coverage in the second quarter and the third quarter, positive coverage in the first and the fourth and excess coverage
for the full year. Year-to-date, we are right on top of the declared distribution. We've generated $2.77 and declared
$2.77, so flat coverage year-to-date.
Total DCF is $561 million in the quarter. That's up $56 million or 11% versus the second quarter of 2013. Year-to-date,
we generated $1.254 billion in distributable cash flow which is up $199 million or 19% versus the first six months of
2013.
I'm going to reconcile for you guys where the $56 million increase comes from for the three months and where the
$199 million comes for the six months. So if you look up at the total segment earnings before DD&A, $1.478 billion in
the quarter, that's up $141 million. As Steve took you through, $76 million of that is coming from natural gas so about
50% of the $141 million is coming out of the Natural Gas segment; and then Products is delivering about $30 million
of the $141 million and Terminals $36 million of the $141 million.
If you look year-to-date, segment earnings before DD&A is at $3.047 billion, is up $434 million or 17%. Natural Gas is
up $302 million, so it comprises about 70% of the $434 million in growth. And then you also have nice increases
coming from CO2, Products and Terminals.
Year-to-date from total segment earnings before DD&A, we are right on top of our budget. For the full year we expect
to exceed our budget by about 1% on total segment earnings before DD&A. And let me take you through a couple of
the segments.
Natural Gas, as we say in the press release, we expect to exceed our budget for the year, primarily based on
outperformance of TGP and EPNG based on new transport contracts. CO2, we expect to be very close to its budget – to
meet its budget. And there we are – we have a benefit from a higher WTI price, but a lot of that benefit is being offset
by the negative Midland/Cushing differential that Steve mentioned earlier.
On Products, we expect to come in slightly below its budget, primarily due to lower volumes than we anticipated on
KMCC. And Terminals, we expect to exceed its budget, largely a function of the APT transaction. Without APT,
Terminals would come in below its budget, primarily due to weaker coal volumes and some slight delays that we've
had on expansion projects, some higher OpEx, and some negative FX.
G&A in the quarter was $136 million of expense versus $134 million in the second quarter of 2013, so about $2 million
in incremental G&A in the quarter. Year-to-date, G&A is increased expense of about $28 million, and that is actually
above – year-to-date versus our budget. We are exceeding budget, so G&A expense is higher than our budget
year-to-date, and we expect that it'll be a little bit higher, maybe 1% higher than our budget for the full year. So, we do
have some timing between the year-to-date and the full year.
On interest, $233 million in the quarter. That's up. That's increased expense of $16 million in the quarter. We have an
increase in interest expense of $57 million year-to-date. Almost all of that year-to-date is on balance; and in the quarter,
it is primarily balance, but we do have a little bit of benefit from lower rate in the quarter. Year-to-date versus our
budget, interest expense is slightly positive and we expect to be slightly positive for the full year at this point in time.
And then the last big component to get to your $56 million increase in distributable cash flow and the $199 million for
the year, last big piece other than the GP is the sustaining CapEx, up $29 million in the quarter, up $53 million in the
year-to-date, but we are actually running behind our budget in terms of expenditure. So, we're running a positive
variance, but that's all going to be timing. For the full year, we think that we will be slightly ahead of our budget or
spend slightly more on sustaining CapEx than we budgeted, largely because of the APT acquisition which was not in
our budget.
And then the GP incentive in the quarter is up $48 million, and in the year-to-date is up $100 million, and that gets you
roughly, those numbers – if you take the $141 million for the quarter increase in earnings before DD&A, you take out
$18 million of incremental expense on G&A and interest, $29 million on sustaining CapEx, and $48 million on the GP
that gets you to roughly $56 million increase in the quarter. Now our budget for the full year and DCF per unit, you
know, right now we expect that we would exceed our DCF per unit budget at KMP. So that's it for the DCF at KMP.

Looking at KMP's balance sheet, KMP's total assets increased by about $1.8 billion, and that's largely a function of
acquisitions and its expansion program. We ended the quarter at $20.7 billion in debt; that's about 3.7 times
debt-to-EBITDA which is down slightly from the 3.8 times that we ended at the end of last year and where we ended
the first quarter. And we expect that we will end 2014 at about 3.7 times, which is consistent with our budget.
Debt in the quarter increased $178 million. For the full year or for the year-to-date, it's increased $1.17 billion, so
almost $1.2 billion. Let me reconcile those numbers for you. The $178 million in the quarter, we spent a little over
$800 million, about $814 million, between acquisitions, expansion CapEx, and contributions to equity investment with
almost all of that being expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investments. We raised about $592 million in
equity and then we had about $44 million in working capital and other items, largely associated with a working capital
source on accrued interest.
Year-to-date the $1.2 billion increase in debt or $1.17 billion are acquisitions and expansion CapEx. We spent almost
$2.6 billion. It was $2.572 billion of spending. We had about $993 million year-to-date in acquisitions with the balance
of the $2.57 billion being expansion CapEx and contributions to equity investments. We raised just under $1.4 billion,
so simple numbers; we spent $2.6 billion, we raised $1.4 billion, the actual number is $1.395 billion was raised in
equity. And then we had a very small amount of working capital and other items to get you to the $1.17 billion change
in debt year-to-date.
Turning to EPB, and the first page of the EPB numbers, the Board today approved a cash distribution per unit of $0.65.
That's up 3% from the second quarter of 2013. Year-to-date that translates into $1.30 of distribution per unit, versus
$1.25 in the first six months of 2013, or a 4% increase.
On the second page of EPB's numbers, where we go through our distributable cash flow. EPB generated distributable
cash flow per unit of $0.62 in the quarter. If you compare that to the $0.65 distribution, so that had negative coverage of
about $6 million, it's similar to KMP, and what we tell you every quarter, and we expect that EPB will have negative
coverage in the second quarter and the third quarter, positive coverage in the first and the fourth, and positive coverage
for the full year.
For the year-to-date the DCF per unit is $1.37 per unit compared to the declared distribution of $1.30. So year-to-date,
EPB had positive coverage of about $15 million. The total DCF in the quarter was $141 million, that's up $12 million
or 9% versus the second quarter 2013. For the six months, DCF was $304 million, up $6 million or 2%. And so now
I'm going to reconcile for you the $12 million increase in the quarter and the $6 million increase year-to-date.
If you look up on the top line, earnings before DD&A increased $1 million, but as Steve mentioned earlier, that doesn't
tell the whole story, because for our investments, we add back, down below in our calculation of DCF, JV DD&A, we
subtract out JV sustaining CapEx. The reason we do this is to more closely reflect in our DCF calculation, what we
receive in cash distributions. So when you add back the JV DD&A down below, that's $21 million, then there's a $4
million adjustment that is negative for some deferred revenues, basically to get our DCF closer to cash. So, there's
about an $18 million increase coming from the assets.
Likewise, on a year-to-date basis, earnings before DD&A of $605 million, that's up $3 million. That doesn't tell the
whole story. If you add back the JV DD&A and subtract the other adjustments to DCF of $6 million, that also gets you
to an $18 million increase year-to-date, and that's largely driven, as Steve mentioned, by the drops that we did in May,
somewhat offset by the rate case impact on WIC and SNG, and the lower contractual renewals on WIC.
G&A for the quarter was a $19 million expense. That is actually down from the second quarter of 2013. Year-to-date,
it's an expense of $39 million which is also down from last year about $2 million.
Interest is flat in the quarter versus last year, and it's down about $2 million, and that's a result of maturities being
replaced with lower rate debt somewhat offset by the issuance that we did for the drop-downs in May. And then
sustaining CapEx is flat in the quarter versus last year. It's about a $1 million increase in sustaining CapEx year-to-date.
So, $18 million plus the $2 million benefit on G&A or lower G&A gets you to $20 million in the quarter. The GP
interest increased by $8 million as a result of the higher distribution to get you to $12 million increase at EPB.

Likewise on the year-to-date, $18 million coming from the assets, benefit of $4 million between G&A and interest;
deduct $1 million on the increased sustaining CapEx gets you to $21 million, less $15 million for the increased GP
incentive to get you to the $6 million.
As we said in the earnings release, we expect EPB to meet its distribution per unit for the year of $2.65. Right now,
EPB in terms of DCF per unit is running slightly ahead of its budget.
On EPB's balance sheet there's one unusual thing that I would point out here which is total assets increased by $1.6
billion. And you think about the drop-downs and the spending that I'll go through, that's only about $1 billion. And so
the reason, you can see in the investment lines increased by $1.7 billion, those assets went on the books at KMI's
carrying value. And then the difference between what EPB paid and where we're putting them on the books, i.e., KMI's
carrying value, is considered an equity contribution by the GP, which you can see occurring in other partners' capital.
We ended the quarter with $4.7 billion of debt. That's 4.2 times debt-to-EBITDA. That's higher than where we ended
last year and higher than where we ended the first quarter, but that's because you only have two months of the drop
earnings, but you have all the debt on your balance sheet. We still expect to end the year at about four times, maybe
slightly better; and that would be consistent with our budget.
The debt increased in the quarter $629 million. It increased year-to-date $563 million. Looking at the uses of capital,
we spent about $989 million in the quarter between acquisitions, expansions and contributions to equity investments,
with the largest component of that being the $972 million drop. We raised $387 million in equity, and then we had a
use of working capital and other items of about $27 million, largely associated with accrued interest and a use of capital
associated with AP and AR.
Year-to-date, $563 million increase in debt. We spent a little over $1 billion, again with the largest component of that
being the drop at $972 million. We raised about $422 million in equity, and then we had a source of working capital
and other items of about $20 million. The primary driver of that was accrued taxes.
Now turning to KMI. At KMI, we are declaring a dividend today of $0.43. That results year-to-date in a declared
dividend of $0.85. Cash available per share in the quarter was $0.32. That translates into negative coverage in the
quarter of $113 million. The same thing here as I say on KMP and EPB, we had negative coverage at KMI in the
second and the third quarter, positive in the first and the fourth, and we expect to end the year at about one times.
We've generated cash available to pay dividends, $332 million in the quarter. That's up $38 million or 13%. And just
looking at the drivers of that 13%, the cash generated by the MLPs was up $65 million and then that's offset a little bit
by the cash generated from the other assets, because we dropped down these assets, we no longer have that cash flow
coming from those assets, although there is some offset coming back from the MLPs. So that's about $47 million net of
the cash generated from the other assets. You get about a $4 million reduction in – between G&A and interest expense,
and then you tax affect that to get to the $38 million.
Year-to-date, the increase in cash available to pay dividends is $98 million or 12%, and very similar circumstances
here. You've got $134 million or 11% increase coming from the cash generated by the MLPs, offset by a reduction in
cash from the other assets of about $29 million. You've got a benefit in interest and G&A. You have primarily lower
G&A expense. You tax affect that, and that gets you to the $98 million. Right now, on cash available to pay dividends,
we're running slightly ahead of our budget and therefore, our guidance that we expect to declare at least $1.72.
At KMI, on its balance sheet, we ended the quarter at $9.28 billion in debt; that's about 4.9 times debt-to-EBITDA.
That's down from the 5 times where we ended the year; 4.9 times is consistent with where we expect to end 2014, and
also consistent with where our budget expected us to end 2014.
Debt in the quarter down $728 million, year-to-date down $547 million, with the primary driver of the reduction in debt
being the drop-down proceeds, but I'll take you through a little bit more of the detail. Drop-down proceeds were $875
million, that's the $972 million that EPB paid, KMI took back 10% equity, and so that's how you get $875 million of
cash proceeds. We repurchased warrants of about $43 million. We had negative coverage of $113 million, and then we
had a whole host of other items that were about $9 million.

Year-to-date, $547 million reduction in debt; $875 million in drop-down proceeds; $98 million in warrant repurchase;
$94 million in share repurchase; $50 million in a pension contribution; $25 million positive coverage year-to-date, and
then a use of capital of $111 million on a whole host of items, which include the fact that KMR is not – we chose not to
monetize the KMR shares that we received as a distribution. The cash taxes that we pay actually are lower than what
we reflect in the metric, so that's a benefit. We had some one-time items associated with marketing payments from the
legacy – marketing and environmental payments associated with the legacy El Paso asset. And then we had some
timing on the distributions that we received versus what's reflected in the metric of about $59 million, and then some
other smaller items. So, that's KMR.
Richard D. Kinder
Okay. And before we open it for questions, let me just clarify one thing; when Kim talked about KMCC, Kinder
Morgan Crude and Condensate, obviously the volumes there dramatically improved from the second quarter of 2013,
but she said we were below plan. And the reason for that is we have one shipper that has a take-or-pay contract that is
not meeting those take-or-pay minimums. We're getting the cash, but because of the period that, that shipper has for
make-up rights, we can't book all of that at this time. So that's the difference or the main part of the difference in
KMCC not being on its plan.
And for those of you anticipating the question on the warrants, Kim usually mentions that. Kim, our final warrant count
is?
Kimberly Allen Dang
We have about 298 million warrants outstanding.
Richard D. Kinder
Okay. And with that, Anna, we will open the floor to questions.
Q&A
Operator
Okay. Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And it looks like we
have first question from Darren Horowitz from Raymond James. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hey, Darren, how are you?
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Hey, fine, thanks, Rich. How are you?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Got two quick questions. The first, and I'm sure you've gotten this question a lot with
regard to condensate, and the Commerce Department's commentary on stabilized condensate exports. I'd just like your
view on how you think that changes the balance between supply and demand for Eagle Ford condensate? Obviously
production trends and its impact on price, but more importantly infrastructure development, whether you think we need
incremental splitting capacity beyond what's been announced either for the export of like naphtha or gas oil, or if you
think there could be a bigger infrastructure opportunity for you to add fuel level stabilizer capacity and possibly
leverage your ability, either dock access on the Ship Channel or at Galena Park or even to move product on Double
Eagle down to Corpus?

<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yeah, it's a very good question, Darren, and it cuts a lot of ways. There's a big
disagreement in the industry, or I think, on how big this condensate move really is, and whether people are going to
have to apply for permits or just ride on the decision of the department on those two requests. We think they probably
will only get comfort if they actually file for their own permit.
With regard – let me start with the easy question on the splitters. Clearly, we have 100,000 barrels per day splitter that
we are building on the Houston Ship Channel. That's fully contracted with BP for a long period of time, so it really
doesn't impact that. I think as far as future splitters are concerned, it's going to make the potential people who utilize
those splitters probably think carefully about whether they want to proceed. The benefit to us though is that our KMCC
line is a batch line and we can move that kind of condensate through the line with the Houston Ship Channel, and we
have a lot of dock capacity at the Ship Channel, and we're building considerably more. So, we could take that
condensate and then ship it out at our facilities at Pasadena and Galena Park.
The other thing that's very interesting to us is that the stabilizers that are apparently necessary to qualify the condensate
for export, that's right down our sweet spot in our Kinder Morgan Treating. And in fact, one of the two that got their
permit is using one of our stabilizers. So, we know our stabilizers fit the bill as far as qualifying condensate for export.
So we see that as an upside for our stabilizer business.
I think, overall, with regard to the Eagle Ford, there's clearly a lot of condensates. You hear all kinds of numbers being
bandied about. 800,000 barrels a day was one number I saw. But clearly, I think, the condensate will move. This will be
a positive for it in that sense, and we hope to handle as much as we can through our pipelines and across our dock, and
we will continue to complete this splitter. And obviously, we'd not have built anymore anyway unless we have
customers who are willing and want to stand behind, taking or utilizing the capacity of those splitters. Steve, anything
else?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: No, I just think, as you said at the beginning, there's a lot of development to be played out here
yet. I think, it's generally positive for us and positive for our infrastructure, and positive for the Eagle Ford overall. Just
how quickly it materializes is I think the big question. But we've got several ways to play it.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Yeah. And, Steve, if I could, just one follow-up question to that. When you think about
what you can move, and Cochin is a great example of this, but what you can move up to Canada as a diluent for Oil
Sands production, you think about what's going to be going to the Gulf Coast to be split and then you try and balance
that with the aggregate amount of Eagle Ford light sweet condensate production growth over the next few years, how
much incremental demand for stabilization capacity do you think KM Treating could benefit from? Do you have a
rough sense of either the scale or the associated CapEx?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: I don't have a rough sense of it. Tom, do you have any...
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Yeah, it's still early to know.
<A - Steven J. Kean>: It's early to know. I mean, there's a lot of stabilization that's already taking place. I mean,
people have facilities in place already. We're receiving stabilized condensate already at our facilities. So, some of that
is already in place. And we're in the early days of exploring this, but I think Rich mentioned this; the one opportunity
for us is to take available space in KMCC. We've got plenty of truck off-loading facilities that are attached to that
system, which is now kind of a network going to multiple markets and moving it up to the Ship Channel and utilizing
some tanks in the Terminals groups and some dock – and a dock line, and getting it offshore. How much more
incremental stabilization will need to be done as that production grows is just hard to get a handle on, I think. But it
should be good.
<Q - Darren C. Horowitz>: Okay. That's all I had. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Okay, Darren.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Brad Olsen from Tudor Pickering. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hey, Brad. How're you doing?
<Q - Brad R. Olsen>: Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. My first question is actually for Rich. And as you might
imagine, if you read our note this morning, it's kind of a follow-up on that. You guys are now sitting at a point where
you've done billions of dollars of accretive deals over the last few years, and yet KMI remains at a discount to peers
that I would imagine is pretty frustrating from your perspective. So as you sit and kind of look at where you're trading
versus some of your peer companies right now, do you have any thoughts on that current discount and whether or not
you'd be willing to consider a transaction to reduce Kinder Morgan's cost of capital?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Let me just say that we're always exploring operational and strategic opportunities to
enhance the value for our investors, including myself, and that includes among other things evaluating a potential
combination of the Kinder Morgan companies. But as I've stated in the past, any such transaction or combination would
have to be on terms negotiated between the companies and mutually agreed upon.
<Q - Brad R. Olsen>: Now that would involve just kind of the standard conflict committee process that these arm's
length transactions go through?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: That's correct.
<Q - Brad R. Olsen>: Got it. Are there any deals within the companies that are categorically kind of unworkable due
to tax liabilities or just the overall corporate structure from your opinion?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Again, we are looking at any possible alternatives, and some certainly would seem more
doable than others.
<Q - Brad R. Olsen>: Got it. All right. Great. I have a follow-up on the UMTP project out of the Northeast. It seems
as though NGL oversupply is kind of just around the corner and production from processing plants in the Marcellus and
the Utica is increasing rapidly, and yet it seems difficult for not just your project, but also for some of the other projects
that have been proposed, we're yet to see a contracted committed project go forward to take NGLs out of the Northeast.
What has been kind of the remaining sticking point on that project? It seems like a no-brainer from a strategic
perspective for your producer customers out there. What is it then that has made it so easy for you guys, or not easy, but
it's been a lot easier to fill up gas pipelines and maybe a little bit more challenging to fill up NGL pipelines out of the
Northeast?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Steve?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Sure. Well, let's start with the last part of that. You know, Matt, remember this is an existing
TGP line that we're talking about converting to a new service and reversing. And if for some reason we're not able to
get contractual commitments on UMTP, we would look for projects to use that capacity for gas service. So we're in a
good position in that regard. But to your real question about what is it with producers and not getting things signed up, I
mean I think there are important differences in the market structure between natural gas and natural gas liquids. And
natural gas, if you can get the transport capacity on one of Tom's pipelines to one of several dozen market hubs in the
United States, you're all done. And that's an easy thing to get your head around commercially. It's a little harder on the
NGL side. You have to look further downstream and think about what it's going to do when it – where is it going to get
fractionated, where is the product going to go, are you going to sell it or are you going to sell it up in the field, are you
going to sell it down in Mont Belvieu? The contractual or commercial commitments are just a little bit more difficult.
I don't think anybody doubts that the production is there, and I think that what we're beginning to see in the market is
that people are also realizing that the sort of incrementalist solutions that people have been using for the last couple
years are going to run out, and people can see the wall that you're talking about, but there's still been some gap between
that realization and commercial commitments that are required for us to underwrite and make this investment.
Now we have had one important development, it's mentioned in the release that we have a potential shipper, who is
interested in a substantial amount of capacity on the system and is so interested that they're helping us with the

development costs here through the end of August. But we've kind of been out there in the market commercially talking
to our other shippers or potential shippers, as well as this shipper about we've got to make a decision, go or no go, kind
of by the end of this summer. And so we're hopeful that will help catalyze some of the plans into signatures and some
of the realizations that other outlets are needed again into contractual commitments to this project. But again, there's no
guarantee of that. We don't have them in the backlog but we've had a positive development and we continue to work it.
Ron, anything else?
<A - Ronald G. McClain>: No, I think that's very accurate. And still adjusting, talking to shippers and hope to have a
successful open season at some point soon.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Okay?
<Q - Brad R. Olsen>: And just one last one, it's a quick one, as far as the Jones Act tankers that you guys are
acquiring, there's 10 boats in all. Sounds like you have a pretty good understanding of the type of product that the
condensate treating plants are going to be spitting out. Are those Jones Act tankers generally capable of moving that
type of lightly refined condensate around in their shipments?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yes.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yes, they are. And again, as we've said so many times, all of these boats are under
long-term contracts. So, it will really be up to our lessees to determine what they want to move in it. But they would
certainly be capable of doing that, as obviously, as well as ordinary crude oil and refined products can all be moved in
that.
<Q - Brad R. Olsen>: Great. Thanks a lot, everyone.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Thank you, Brad.
Operator
Thank you. And our next question comes from Ted Durbin from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hello, Ted. How are you?
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Hey, Rich. I'm well, thanks. I want to kick off here with the, I guess, we're calling it the
Northeast Energy Direct pipeline now into Boston. The CapEx number looks like it went up a lot, $6 billion. I'm
wondering if you can just give us a little bit more detail there. I think at the Analyst Day you were talking more about
more like in the [ph] low $2 billion (57:05). Is the [indiscernible] (57:07) to the route changed? What's the story there?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well I think, and I'll let Tom Martin jump in here, but what's really changed is this is really
now two projects. One is from the Marcellus to Wright, New York, and that's mostly a supply push project. And then
the second project is from Wright across a little bit of New York and Massachusetts to Dracut. And again, the cost of
that depends obviously on what the shipment actually is. And the $5 billion to $6 billion would be at the fully utilized
percentages. Tom, do you want to comment on that?
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Yeah. No, I think that's exactly right. It's a scalable project. What we're seeing on the
customer side, it could potentially be up to 2.2 Bcf a day. We think it's more likely in the 800 Mcf to 1.2 Bcf a day
range. The supply side would be, I guess, supply project, that's included in that $6 billion number, the – more in the
[indiscernible] (58:23). Potentially bigger, but that's kind of how we're seeing it right now. And a good mix of customer
interest on the market side, a healthy mix of LDC customers, also some Canadian customer interest, some LNG export
customers, and ultimately, we believe there'll be a [ph] significant power (58:45) generation customers that
[indiscernible] (58:50) project as well.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Got it. And so, is it fair to say then that the market side of the project is probably the bigger
portion of the CapEx and the capacity and whatnot?

<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Yeah, that's exactly right.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Yeah. Okay. And then maybe just elaborate a little bit more on the Trans Mountain decision
here to push this back. I guess the fear of course is that this is a precursor to maybe some longer delays. Do you feel
like you've sort of nailed everything down beyond the last five kilometers there? Or what else should we be looking for
there? And then can you talk about if your customers themselves have any off ramps, if there are further delays from a
contracting standpoint?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: I think the issue that specifically is getting addressed here is that build that's through the really
urban part of the route, and there had been fairly substantial public opposition to building on that route. And we were
basically going to follow at least in part our existing right-of-way. We had multiple alternative routes getting to
Burnaby Mountain but basically once we came down the hill to the dock we were going to go along the same existing
routes. And so, we have now kind of backed up and decided to look at some different alternatives and I think the board
wants to give that a full vetting. And I think there's a – there's sort of a good side to this in that I think this is a
reasonable way to try to get this issue resolved and fully and finally resolved. And it is probably the most contentious
piece of the route to us.
So from that perspective, I think it's a sign that the NEB just wants to get to the right answer on the route and we do,
too. So look, we're disappointed with the timing and the – and all of that, but I think in general if you look at what
change or impact does it have on the long-term prospects of the project getting the permit that we desire to get, I think
there's a case to be made that it's actually slightly improved it. And so I think from that perspective, it's – you can
choose to take it as a – or I'll choose to take it as a positive.
In terms of the overall desire and demand for the project, that is still very strong. Our customers want this project done,
have been very supportive through this whole process. I'm not aware of any off ramps certainly that would have any –
that this decision would have any bearing on. So, I think it's a delay but it's still all systems go.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Okay. Thanks very much.

<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hey, [ph] John (01:01:48).
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: Hi, [ph] John (01:01:49).
<Q>: Given the favorable procedural changes around non-FTA approval for LNG exports, can you talk a little bit about
the progress and efforts to get contracts for the Gulf LNG facility please?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Sure. Tom, do you want to do that?
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Yeah, absolutely. We've been talking to quite a few customers on the LNG project here at
[indiscernible] (1:02:15) and I think the discussions are gaining momentum. We had one MOU sign with a customer
for two million tons a year, again, not a whole lot of stock in that right now because it's really not binding at this point.
But I think kind of where we are shaking out at this particular point is for now through the end of the year, maybe early
next year, we are really shaking through the binding agreement discussions with these potential shippers and I think
we'll know, by the end of the year, maybe into early next year as to whether this project will go or not.
But I think, as far as the regulatory change, I think probably overall, neutral to favorable to us. I think the fact that we're
a great balance sheet, brownfield project, have good connectivity in the area, a favorable local and state regulatory
environment, which we are working on the project, and I think a very good relationship with FERC. I think that's where

ultimately, the project is going to be a go, no-go, obviously as we get customer firm commitments and ultimately, our
opinion, I think is the DOE process will follow what the FERC does.
<Q>: Okay. So, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but is it – if I summarize what you were saying, if I
understand you correctly, do you feel as though – you feel pretty confident that you should eventually be able to
commercialize Gulf LNG, and obviously you guys aren't going to build something like that without long term stable
contracts, or is it too early in the process to...
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: I think we're more favorable than we've been so far, but I think the next three months to six
months are going to be critical. There's been a lot of favorable discussions with customers, but I mean it really boils
down to getting terms, committed terms that are favorable to both parties and turning these into firm commitments and
we'd like to see a mix of both tooling and FOB service ultimately crystallize here into two trends and so we'll know
more over the next three months to six months.
<Q>: Okay. And then on the – that's helpful. And on a separate topic, if M&A has seems to have picked up in the MLP
sector, and it's been a successful part of the company strategy in the past. Is it tough right now for you all to be
involved in that with KMP's current cost to capital where it is, or do you think it's possible for the economics and the
math to work? How are you thinking about that part of the strategy in general right now, please?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Well, I think certainly cost of capital plays a role in any M&A activity. And we aim to be
as competitive as possible in that and certainly are looking at all ways of lowering our cost of capital. But I agree with
you that I think M&A is going to be active over the next months and next couple of years, and we certainly want to be a
player in that and more to come.
<Q>: Got it. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Zarahn from Barclays. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Brian. How you doing?
<Q - Brian Zarahn>: Good, Rich and you?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Good.
<Q - Brian Zarahn>: On condensate, appreciate the color on the Eagle Ford opportunity. How do you view potential
opportunities to transport Permian condensate?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: I think it's – oh, I'm sorry, Permian condensate. Yeah, I'm sorry. We don't have anything really
in the works on that right now. I mean it's something that we can continue to look at but it's not something that we've
got like either in the backlog or really on the horizon right at the moment.
<Q - Brian Zarahn>: What about other crude infrastructure in the Permian? Any opportunities there?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: From time to time, we do revisit the Freedom Pipeline project, but that is not anything that is
anywhere near imminent, it's just a function of if prices and – well, flow patterns on oil settle into a position where a lot
of the West Coast refiners want to use Permian crude as part of their refining slate then maybe discussions emerge
again there. But the uses for – the other side of that story is the uses for the El Paso Natural Gas system have just
continued to escalate, which makes thinking about conversion of it more challenging, not impossible just do with the
additional costs to make sure that we can continue to serve our gas customers at the level that we are serving them and
expect to serve them going forward. Again, it's not something that's particularly on the horizon.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Now, the other thing is that we obviously over in our CO2 segment, our Wink pipeline
moves over 130,000 barrels a day of crude to a refiner in El Paso. And we are looking at ways of modifying that in
conjunction with our customer to enable us to move crude and I suppose potentially condensate in the opposite

direction there. And if we get the right contracts there, that will be an opportunity for us and in fact, we just discussed
that at some length at our most recent review with the CO2 group. So that's a potential that we're working on. It could
come fairly soon. Now it's not a huge project, but would get us in that game somewhat.
<Q - Brian Zarahn>: Okay. And then shifting gears to the UMTP NGL pipe, did you say that you would expect a
go/no-go decision by the end of the summer?
<A - Steven J. Kean>: Yeah. That's what we have set out is we need to see commitments by the end of the summer.
<Q - Brian Zarahn>: Okay. And then you mentioned potential anchor shipper. Would that contracted capacity be
enough to move the project forward? Or you would probably need some others to sign up?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: That would be enough to move the project forward.
<Q - Brian Zarahn>: Okay. So stay tuned on that. Last one for me. On the warrant buyback, are you expecting new
authorization?
<A - Kimberly Allen Dang>: The board did not authorize any incremental today. There's around $2 million remaining
on the prior authorization.
<Q - Brian Zarahn>: Okay. Thanks Kim.
Operator
Okay, thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Campbell from the Tuohy Brothers Investment Research. Your
line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Jeffrey.
<Q - Jeffrey Campbell>: Good afternoon. I'm calling for Craig Shere who couldn't be on the call today. A lot of my
questions have been answered, but let me ask, do we have any updates on Yates NGL flooding potential?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: I'll turn it over to Jim Wuerth, our CO2 segment head.
<A - James P. Wuerth>: Yeah. We're in the middle of process of testing that right now. The good and the bad of it, I
guess the good part is, is [indiscernible] (01:09:49) testing, trying to get a baseline off the shelf that we've found there.
We're producing about 500 barrels a day out of the well, so it's kind of hard to get a baseline when you're producing
that much. That makes us look at do we just go find additional shelves and open the perfs up in those areas and put a
plug in and open the perfs there? And we've identified probably about 20 of those. So more to come, whether we can
drain that fast enough to even get a baseline to put the NGLs in, the plan is to try and put it in August. So we'll see what
kind of a baseline we can get, but everything's positive right now. We haven't done a thing other than put a plug in and
clean it out, put perfs in up at the higher level and we're getting really good volumes out of there already.
<Q - Jeffrey Campbell>: Okay. Thanks. And my other question is with regard to ROZ, will proving out the ROZ
economics be a 2015 event? And if it works out as well as it's hoped...?
<A - James P. Wuerth>: Yeah, I think so...
<Q - Jeffrey Campbell>: What would be the main...
<A - James P. Wuerth>: Yeah, we're planning on the Phase 1 that we've got going on right now. We should be
injecting CO2 by November or December. This is on small acre spacing. It's on 10-acre spacing. The injectivity rates
we've seen are upwards of 25%. So we should see real good production within just a few months after injection and we
would expect even peak production out of that nine patterns area within a year or year-and-a-half. So yes, we will know
by 2015 on a full go-forward plan.
<Q - Jeffrey Campbell>: Okay. Great. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from John Edwards from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hey, John. How are you?
<Q - John D. Edwards>: Doing well, Rich. Just a couple of quick questions. Actually I just had one quick question.
At the Analyst Day you talked about sort of the non-backlog, backlog if you will and I'm just wondering where that
stands now and you've indicated the backlogs has risen about $600 million this quarter. I'm just curious how that [ph]
other coal (01:12:07) is looking?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Martin, head of our Gas Pipelines Group came into the full board meeting without any
prompting on my or Steve's point and said that his non-backlog as you call it, John, was now $18 billion up from $15
billion the last time he met with the board. And when somebody comes in and volunteers something like that you take
it you know. So I think the short answer is we're seeing enormous opportunities in this natural gas province. We could
go on and sign up all kinds of anecdotal evidence to it, but just a lot of potential. Now the key is getting the horses in
the corral and getting the saddle on. Tom anything you want to add to that?
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: No. I think that's exactly right. I think we continue to see more and more traction on
opportunities and we've seen evidence of projects that weren't even on the potential backlog listed, to all the way to the
finish line and then to execution phase. So it is a very target rich environment right now.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: And I think overall, on our Products Pipeline side, there's things like KMCC, and it
depends on how you count, what you include in the basket or not, but correct me if I'm wrong, Ron, we basically have
either spent or committed to spend under long term contracts around $1 billion on that system now. We started out
spending $220 million in the first go around. We now have commitments that when we're fully built out will be over
two-thirds of the way there to fulfilling the 300,000 barrel a day capacity. Frankly we have some additional capacity we
could add on a relatively economic basis to that which we will continue to look at. And when you add everything we
are seeing down there to this potential per additional condensate that just looks like very good. So a lot of opportunities
elsewhere in the company too, but clearly, the opportunity for natural gas long line transportation is very strong right
now.
<Q - John D. Edwards>: Okay. And that's where you're seeing the majority of the increase in opportunities is natural
gas?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: That $15 billion to $18 billion, the $15 billion going to $18 billion was just Tom Martin's
Natural Gas Pipeline Group.
<Q - John D. Edwards>: Okay. And then are you seeing any significant increase on the Terminals side?
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: You mean increases in the non-backlog, backlog. Is that...
<Q - John D. Edwards>: Yeah. Kind of opportunity, evaluation opportunities, exactly.
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: I think, not a calculated number John. So I don't have a calculated number for you there,
but I think just generally, as I said before, on the handling of liquids, crude and refined products and biofuels. And on
crude-by-rail projects the opportunities continue to increase. I mean I think it bodes well for that sector as well, for that
segment.
<Q - John D. Edwards>: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.

<Q>: Hi. Good afternoon, guys. A couple of clarifications from me; the 2 Bcf per day from transportation capacity
contracts that you mentioned you're in the process of negotiating, if you were to get those contracts finalized, would it
necessitate additional project announcement from your side? Or they just kind of help you fill up the projects that have
already been announced so far?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Yeah, as we complete those projects we will make announcements on them as we complete
all the commercial arrangements for those projects, absolutely.
<Q>: Okay. And then just on the clarification on one of your previous comments with regard to the UMTP project, so
the potential anchor ship that you have for that project that provides you enough capacity to go ahead with the project,
or you are trying to layer on additional contracts so as to get a better scope of the project? Is that kind of a fair
statement?
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Yes. We're still pursuing other shippers as well, beyond...
<Q>: But you...
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Beyond the potential anchor shipper, we are pursuing other shippers.
<Q>: Okay. Very helpful. Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Cheng from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Hi, Rich.
<Q - Rich Cheng>: Hi. My question has already been answered actually. Thank you.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Okay. All right.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from [indiscernible] (01:17:04).
<Q>: Hey. Thank you for taking my question. I think most of my questions have been answered, just one thing; on
NGPL you guys conducted an open season recently and wanted to see if you had any updates on that?
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Sure. Tom?
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Yeah, we – I think we had some pretty good customer interest on our expansion, Gulf
Coast expansion project down from the REX interconnect. We see that central project to be somewhere in the 0.5 Bcf
to maybe 750,000 a day level, largely sponsored by producers but also other potential export customers down in the
Gulf Coast. So we expect to move through the PA process here in the third quarter and see if we can get enough
commitments.
<Q>: Got it. What sort of rates do you get on those, on that gas that you're flowing down there?
<A - Thomas A. Martin>: Yeah. I mean, I don't – we can't really get into specific rates. But I mean, I think we're, by
evidence of the interest in the project, I think we're very competitive with what other alternatives are on the market.
<Q>: Got it. Thank you very much.
<A - Richard D. Kinder>: Okay.
