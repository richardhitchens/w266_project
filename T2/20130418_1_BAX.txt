Now, I would like to turn the call over to Bob Parkinson.
Robert L. Parkinson
Thanks, Mary Kay. Good morning, everybody. Thank you for calling in.
As you saw in the press release that was issued earlier this morning, Baxter's first quarter financial results were in line
with our expectations and we have also confirmed guidance for the full year for 2013. In the first quarter, adjusted
earnings per diluted share increased 4% to $1.05 per diluted share and worldwide sales increased 2%. And our financial
outlook for the full year includes sales growth of approximately 10%, which reflects the impact of the Gambro
acquisition and adjusted earnings per diluted share of $4.60 to $4.70.
Even in the face of a very challenging macro environment, Baxter continued to make investments to support
geographic expansion initiatives and new product introductions, while advancing a number of programs that improve
the quality of care and address key high potential areas of unmet medical need.
A few recent achievements include the advancement of our home hemodialysis device, Vivia. As you know, last year
we completed the first clinical trial in the U.S. evaluating the performance and the safety of this new device and we
have initiated a second in center nocturnal hemodialysis trial in Canada. We remain on track to complete this trial in the
second quarter, which will be used to support CE marking in Europe later this year.
Within our leading hemophilia franchise, we have achieved a number of milestones including the initiation of a global
Phase III clinical trial of BAX 817, a recombinant factor VII-VIII therapy for hemophilia A patients with inhibitors and
we also announced results from a pivotal Phase III study, evaluating routine prophylaxis of FEIBA compared to on
demand treatment in patients with hemophilia A or B and inhibitors. The presence of an inhibitor, as you know, makes
response to treatment more challenging and patients with inhibitors have an increased risk of developing complications
such as joint damage.
Top line results from the study showed a 72.5% reduction in the median annual bleed rate with prophylaxis treatment.
This Phase III study supported the filing of a biologics license application with the FDA during first quarter and earlier
this week, Baxter was granted orphan drug designation for the prophylaxis indication.
Also within the hemophilia franchise, Baxter began dosing the first patients in the Phase III trial of BAX 855, a longer
acting PEGylated factor VIII therapy, based on the full length ADVATE molecule with an increased half-life. With
efficacy and safety as the primary goals for selecting the therapy, BAX 855 retains the underlying attributes of
ADVATE, potentially offering an alternative treatment regimen, resulting in fewer infusions.
In the biotherapeutics franchise, Baxter and our partner Halozyme Therapeutics announced a positive opinion in
Europe for the use of HyQvia, a replacement therapy for adult patients with primary and secondary immunodeficiency.
HyQvia is a combination of human normal immunoglobulin and recombinant human hyaluronidase, which facilitates
the dispersion and absorption of the therapy. Upon receiving marketing authorization from the European Commission,
Baxter plans to launch HyQvia in select European markets later this year.
We also continue to advance development of GAMMAGARD LIQUID as a possible treatment for Alzheimer's disease.
As you know, we completed first phase 3 study for Alzheimer's in December, recently locked the database and expect
to release top line results during the second quarter. A second Phase III trial was initiated in the first quarter of 2012
and we have now randomized more than 200 of the estimated 400 patients and we expect to complete this study in
2015.
On the business development front, we acquired the investigational hemophilia compound OBI-1 from Inspiration
BioPharmaceuticals and related assets including manufacturing operations from Ipsen Pharma. OBI-1 is a recombinant
porcine factor VIII currently in Phase III clinical studies for the treatment of bleeding in people with acquired
hemophilia, a rare, potentially life-threatening bleeding disorder which unlike congenital hemophilia, typically effects
older adults, and occurs equally in both males and females. OBI-1 received orphan drug designation in the United

States and Europe and was recently granted fast track designation by the FDA for this indication. OBI-1 has the
potential to address existing unmet needs for hemophilia patients, and over time, represents a $200 million opportunity
for the company.
And finally, we received US regulatory clearance for our proposed acquisition of Gambro AB, a global innovator in
hemodialysis and acute renal technologies. This acquisition enhances Baxter's competitive position by creating a global
renal therapies business with a comprehensive product offering for both chronic and acute dialysis patients and
positions the company to capitalize on the significant opportunity presented by the large and growing global dialysis
products market. Pending additional regulatory approvals, we continue to expect the transaction to close at the end of
the second quarter.
In closing, Baxter's portfolio remains strong, and we continue to benefit from our focus on life saving therapies. In
2013 and beyond, we'll focus on the four growth vectors that support our strategic objectives and enable us to serve the
interest of patients, providers and other key stakeholders. These four vectors include enhancing growth by optimizing
our core business portfolio, advancing the company's new product pipeline, capitalizing on the opportunity to develop
new product models which include public and private partnerships, and pursuing business development initiatives that
deliver enhanced returns in the near and long term. With this in mind, Baxter will fulfill our mission of improving
quality and access to care as we save and sustain lives globally. And as always, I'd be happy to address any questions
that you might have on these or other topics during the Q&A.
So with, that I would like to ask Bob to review our financial results for the quarter and also guidance for 2013. Bob, if
you would.
Robert J. Hombach
Thanks, Bob and, good morning, everyone.
As Bob mentioned, earnings per diluted share in the first quarter excluding special items increased 4% to $1.05 per
diluted share, which was at the higher end of our guidance range of $1.03 to $1.05 per diluted share. As we mentioned
in the press release, GAAP results include after-tax special items of $29 million or $0.05 per diluted share. The special
items in the quarter were primarily associated with deal-related costs for the planned acquisition of Gambro AB.
Now, let me briefly walk you through the P&L by line item for the quarter before turning to our financial outlook for
full year 2013. Starting with sales, worldwide sales of more than $3.4 billion in the first quarter increased 2% on both a
reported and constant currency basis. Growth was driven primarily by acceleration in emerging markets, particularly
BRIC countries and solid performance in several key franchises within BioScience which offset softness in the US
medical products business.
In terms of individual business performance, global BioScience sales of $1.5 billion advanced 5% on both a reported
and constant currency basis in the first quarter. Within the product categories, hemophilia sales of $765 million
increased 3% on both a reported and constant currency basis. US sales growth was strong, as sales advanced 7% driven
by double digit growth of ADVATE and FEIBA. This more than offset the impact of European austerity measures and
international tenders. We continue to be pleased with the benefits associated with our differentiated label of ADVATE
as we continue to drive conversion from plasma derived therapies and competitive offerings and enhance penetration of
prophylactic treatment.
In biotherapeutics, sales of $509 million increased 2% on both a reported and constant currency basis. As expected,
sales growth of GAMMAGARD LIQUID and albumin was in low single digits driven by improved pricing as we
remain capacity constrained while sales of alpha-1 treatments continued strong growth.
In the first quarter, sales in biosurgery of $172 million increased 12%. After adjusting for foreign currency, sales rose
11%, driven by growth of TISSEEL and a benefit from the Synovis acquisition of approximately $10 million.

Finally vaccine revenues totaled $84 million in the quarter and increased 25%. Excluding foreign currency, sales
increased 28% driven primarily by strong demand for the FSME vaccine and incremental milestone payments totaling
approximately $10 million related to our ongoing collaborations on the development of influenza vaccines.
In medical products, global sales in the first quarter exceeded $1.9 billion and were comparable to the prior year.
Excluding foreign currencies, sales declined 1%. Within the product categories, renal sales totaled $590 million and
were flat to the prior year, while on a constant currency basis, sales were up 1%. Sales in this category were impacted
by austerity measures implemented in China, the timing of tenders and lower HD sales, which offset the contribution
from patient gains in the US and emerging markets.
Sales in the fluid system category of $740 million increased 3% on a constant currency – and on a constant currency
basis, sales increased 2%. Performance continues to be driven by solid demand for IV solutions and price
improvements for certain injectable drugs, like cyclophosphamide, which collectively offset lower sales of infusion
pumps and access sets as planned.
Specialty pharmaceuticals, which includes our inhaled anesthetics and nutritional therapies, posted sales of $363
million, reflecting a decline of 1% on a reported basis and a 2% decline on a constant currency basis. Double digit
growth of anesthetics across international markets was driven by increased penetration in new markets which was more
than offset by lower sales in the US, attributed to softness in surgical procedures and fluctuations in the purchasing
patterns of U.S. wholesalers.
Finally, sales in BioPharma Solutions, which is our pharma partnering business, totaled $225 million, representing a
10% decline on a reported basis, and 11% decline on a constant currency basis. This was due to temporary constraints
which resulted in delayed shipments to customers which have been resolved and shipments have resumed.
Turning to the rest of the P&L, gross margin in the quarter of 51.0% reflects margin expansion of 20 basis points,
versus the prior year margin of 50.8%. This was a result of underlying operational expansion driven primarily by the
benefit of positive mix, which offset a number of headwinds including incremental pension expense, the medical device
tax, government austerity measures and approximately $20 million of accelerated costs.
SG&A totaled $778 million and increased 5%. Driven by the impact of incremental pension expense, investments we
are making in promotional and marketing initiatives and within international markets to enhance our global presence.
In total, these items more than offset the benefit from tight management of discretionary spending and operational
efficiencies derived from our process reengineering efforts.
R&D spending in the quarter increased 4%, and totaled $246 million reflecting the progress we are making in
advancing a number of programs in our pipeline, including those in our leading hemophilia franchise, Alzheimer's and
other key programs. The operating margin in the quarter was 21.3%. Interest expense was $25 million compared to $18
million last year. This increase is due to incremental expense associated with the debt issuance last year and lower
interest income.
Other income totaled $30 million in the quarter and is primarily attributable to the favorable foreign exchange impact
on balance sheet positions and a gain of $10 million associated with the sale of intangible assets. The tax rate was
21.3% for the quarter, in line with expectations and includes a modest benefit from the 2012 R&D tax credit. And as
previously mentioned, adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.05 increased 4%.
Turning to cash flow, cash flow from operations in the first quarter totaled $386 million, and capital expenditures
totaled $292 million, both in line with our expectations. DSO ended the quarter at 53.6 days reflecting a four-day
improvement versus the same period last year due to a significant reduction in DSOs in certain international markets.
Inventory turns of 2.2 turns are modestly lower than the first quarter last year. As you know, we continued to increase
inventory levels to support growing demand, particularly for plasma proteins, as we remain on track to benefit from
enhanced capacity in the second half of the year.
Lastly, in the quarter, we repurchased approximately 8 million shares for $534 million or on a net basis, 4 million
shares for $351 million in line with our full year objective.

Finally, let me conclude my comments by providing our financial outlook for the full year 2013. As you saw in the
press release, we confirmed guidance and continue to expect earnings of $4.60 to $4.70 per diluted share. This includes
the impact of the Gambro acquisition, which is projected to close at the end of the second quarter, with estimated
dilution of $0.10 to $0.15 per diluted share. This dilution is primarily related to non-cash amortization of intangible
assets which will be finalized upon closing.
By line item of the P&L and starting with sales we expect sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency of
approximately 10% and this includes a half year sales contribution from Gambro of approximately $830 million.
Excluding Gambro, we continue to expect sales growth on a constant currency basis of approximately 4% and at
current foreign exchange rates we expect a modest negative impact on sales for the year.
For the full year, given current foreign exchange rates we now expect gross margins for the company to be
approximately 50.5% for the full year. While year-over-year we expect margin expansion of approximately 100 basis
points in the base Baxter business, this will be more than offset by intangible asset amortization related to Gambro,
incremental pension expense, government austerity measures, including the medical device tax and a negative impact
from foreign currencies.
In terms of expense, we expect SG&A to increase approximately 10% and R&D to grow in mid-single digits with both
line items reflecting leverage in the Baxter business – Baxter expense base along with the addition of Gambro. We
continue to expect interest expense to total approximately $170 million, which reflects the impact of the debt issuance
associated with the Gambro acquisition. In addition, we now expect other income to total approximately $10 million
for the full year. We expect a tax rate of approximately 22%, and we expect a full year average share count of
approximately 550 million shares, which assumes approximately $300 million to $400 million in net share repurchases.
From a cash flow perspective, our plan remains to generate cash flow from operations of approximately $3.3 billion,
with capital expenditures totaling approximately 1.7 billion, which includes Gambro and the investments we are
making to enhance our plasma manufacturing footprint in Covington, Georgia.
Let me move to sales and expand our assumptions for the two businesses and the major product categories. Beginning
with Medical Products on a constant currency basis, including the half year contribution related to Gambro, we expect
sales growth in the low teens. Excluding Gambro, we expect sales for Medical Products to grow 3% to 4%.
Specifically, we expect Baxter renal sales to grow in low single digits which will be augmented by a half-year sales
contribution from Gambro totaling approximately $830 million. We continue to expect Fluid Systems sales, which
includes IV solutions, infusion pumps and access sets, to grow in mid-single digits. We expect specialty pharmaceutical
sales, which includes our nutritional therapies and inhaled anesthetics to grow in low single digits and we expect our
BioPharma Solutions business to have comparable sales to 2012 of approximately $1 billion.
For BioScience we continue to project sales growth excluding foreign currency in the 4% to 5% range. Our outlook
includes low to mid-single digit growth in our hemophilia franchise which includes recombinant, and plasma derived
factor VIII and factor IX therapies and FEIBA, an inhibitor treatment. We expect mid to high single digit growth in
biotherapeutics, driven primarily by strong demand for immunoglobulin therapies, including GAMMAGARD LIQUID
and sub-q therapies, as well as growth in albumin and our treatments for alpha-1 deficiency. In biosurgery, we expect
high single digit growth. And finally, we expect our vaccine franchise to grow in the mid-single digits.
As mentioned in our press release, for the second quarter we expect earnings per diluted of $1.12 to $1.14, and sales
growth excluding the impact of foreign currency, of approximately 4%. At current foreign exchange rates foreign
currency may have a modest negative impact on sales growth in the quarter. Thanks and now let me open up the call
for Q&A.

[Operator instructions] We would like to remind participants that this call is being recorded and a digital replay will be
available on the Baxter International website for 30 days at www.baxter.com.
Our first question comes from David Lewis of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Good morning.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Maybe a couple of quick questions on the model and then more of a strategic question. I guess
a couple of quick hits on the model. In Spec Pharm, you talked about a slight change in guidance for the year. I
wondered, does that reflect more just the utilization environment you are seeing here in the first quarter or any change
to what you are thinking about the timing of generics in the back half of the year?
And the second financial question was non-op guidance is roughly equivalent to what you guided for a few quarters –
or sorry, a few months ago but a very strong non-op quarter this particular quarter. Maybe you could walk through
some of those dynamics, and then one follow-up.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yeah, I think, David, your comments about softer surgical procedures are really what
drove it. There's no change in our expectation about the potential for generic competition later this year in this space, so
no change there.
And, you know, as it relates to the non-op items, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, two real drivers there. One,
foreign exchange and the other one sale of an intangible asset and so the FX item really related to some volatility
around the euro in the first quarter. As you know the euro traded anywhere from $1.37 to $1.27 during the course of the
quarter and given our balance sheet positions and the quarters and the months in which it was most volatile, we had a
pretty significant outcome there.
As I mentioned in my prepared comments we also took some costs into margin that we hadn't expected for this quarter,
we expected later in the year of approximately $20 million. And so, you know, as I look at the overall picture, you
know, those two kind of offset.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Okay. Then maybe two strategic questions for Bob. I guess, interesting competitive chatter at
some recent conferences, Bob, I wonder if you could comment. First is surrounding Glendale and the progress. There's
some discussion that perhaps Baxter is behind in their process at Glendale and the refurbishment. Maybe help us
understand where you think you are as it relates to Glendale and capacity in the back half of the year.
And then on hemophilia competition, which is obviously coming next year, another strong hemophilia quarter for
Baxter this particular quarter. Maybe talk just a little about what you are seeing on the strength of PK dosing and the
larger 4,000 unit dose and how you expect that to trend this year. Thank you.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: Sure. In terms of old LA, we are back in operation, consistent with the timetable that we
set up. Actually a little bit ahead of schedule. So we're very pleased with, you know, getting that back into production
for reasons that we all understand. So no concerns on that issue.
Relative to the core hemophilia franchise, we continue to see momentum in the US in response to the PK dosing and
prophylaxis use and so on, continue to be encouraged by that.
As it relates to the momentum in that business, particularly in the US and in view of new competitive entrants down the
road, fundamentally, David, I would say no change in our position in that regard from what we discussed with you
previously. I don't know, Mary Kay, if you want to add anything to that that?
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: I was just going to say, David, we have started conformance lots in old LA and as Bob
mentioned we remain on track for clearance and to start shipping product in the third quarter, so change in expectations
there.

And I would also point out that the strong recombinant sales driven really by ADVATE in the US. We are expecting to
take out some inventory as we move throughout the year. So we aren't expecting in our guidance to continue to see as
strong performance going forward.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Okay. Very helpful. Thank you very much.
Operator
Matt Miksic of Piper Jaffray is on the line with a question. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Matt S. Miksic>: Thanks, just a follow-up on hemophilia. You mentioned in your prepared remarks there was
sort of a contribution from competitive gains. There's a contribution from increased penetration of prophylaxis, and sort
of utilization on the ADVATE side. Could you maybe talk about what kind of share you are starting to see here
competitively, how much interest there is in this sort of flexible dosing model that you have?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: Yeah, I don't know, Matt, that we can add a lot more to my comments in response to
David Lewis' question. We are not going to get into specific market share changes and quote market shares and so on.
You know, again, as I said before, we get a good market response, continue to get a good market response to the PK
dosing and prophylaxis use and so on, which we're very encouraged by and it's consistent with what we expected from
the outset.
Beyond that, I'm not sure there's a lot more we can say or we want to say at this stage.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yeah, I would just add that the good news here is we have multiple avenues to drive
accelerated growth going forward, converting plasma derived even within our own patient base, converting on demand
to prophylaxis, and then certainly for those patients that they are looking for the opportunity to do less infusions on an
annual basis, moving towards PK dosing. Again, we are pursuing all of those avenues and I think the 4,000 IU
presentation is going to allow us to continue to drive the PK dosing going forward. It's still somewhat early days,
because it was the third quarter of last year that we really started launching that, but we are seeing progress on all three
fronts.
<Q - Matt S. Miksic>: Okay. That's understandable. On the Alzheimer's program you mentioned wrapping up the trial
in 2015. You know, just maybe walk us through if you could. You have made some decent progress. This is the second
trial and about halfway through enrollment, currently. Can you walk through why it's expected to take until 2015 to
complete that?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: Mary Kay, why don't you handle that?
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: Sure. Matt, as we mentioned in the prepared comments we have already enrolled about 200
of the 400 patients and we are expecting to complete enrollment by then of this year. As you recall, the trial design for
the second Phase III is exactly similar to the first Phase III. So it's an 18 month follow-up, which would mean that we
wouldn't complete the trial until mid-2015.
<Q - Matt S. Miksic>: Great and then finally just on the Fluid Systems in the quarter. I didn't catch the color on why
exactly the weakness there, at least relative to our estimates. It sounded like from your perspective, the growth was in
line or sort of, you know, solid growth in the quarter but I guess...
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: It was in line with our expectations, but I think it's important to remember, given the pace
of activity in 2012 as we finalized the swap out of colleagues and placed a lot of Spectrums in the marketplace, you
know, we expected going into 2013 that pump sales would be lower than 2012, again because of the elevated level of
activity and as we looked at results, they were, again, in line with our expectations and so I – no issues there.
<Q - Matt S. Miksic>: Thanks so much.

Larry Keusch of Raymond James is on the line with a question. Please go ahead with your question. One moment.
Your line is open, Larry.
<Q - Lawrence S. Keusch>: Can you hear me?
Operator
We can hear you.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: We can hear you now, Larry, go ahead.
<Q - Lawrence S. Keusch>: I guess for Bob Hombach, the 2013 guidance, when you take the first quarter, and the
guidance for the 2Q implies that you drive greater EPS in the back half of the year. Could you just remind us, what are
the drivers of the increased profitability in the second half of the year?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Sure, sure, multiple impacts here. First off, we do expect to have enhanced flexibility on
capacity and supply to the market in the plasma business as we move into the third quarter. As we mentioned, we are
producing now and we expect to be able to start shipping product in the third quarter on the plasma front. And just the
way tenders have worked out this year, you know, if I step back and look at sales calendarization for 2013 for the
company, Q1, given some year-over-year comp issues around timing of tenders, as well as this selling day issue, you
know, we have one less day in Q1, we'll have one more in Q3, Q2 and Q4, I would characterize as normal. And then in
Q3, in particular, some significant emerging market related tenders are scheduled this year versus prior years being in
different quarters. So we do expect accelerated top line growth related to that as well.
The benefits of our business optimization efforts that we announced at the end of the fourth quarter this year, we'll start
to, you know, see enhanced benefits from that as we move throughout the course of the year. So those are just some of
the key drivers.
<Q - Lawrence S. Keusch>: Okay.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: And I would just add, just so everybody knows, gross margin we do expect to be lower in
the second half as we bring the Gambro business into the mix. So just so you have that, it will be lower than the first
half.
<Q - Lawrence S. Keusch>: Okay. Thanks for that color and then just two other quick ones. Can you just help us
understand the implications of the warning letter on the Spectrum pump and how that folds into your guidance for this
year? And then separately, on the Phase III Alzheimer's, the first trial where you are expecting the top line results in
2Q, is that actually tied to a scientific meeting or is that sort of a press release as you finalize that data analysis?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: Okay, I will address the question on the warning letter. Mary Kay, why don't you respond
on the Alzheimer's question?
So the warning letter that was communicated earlier this week really has to do with the clearance status on some
modifications that have been made to the SIGMA Spectrum pump over the years since the initial approval, the initial
510(K) a number of years ago. So the agency's requested additional information and documentation from us on those
changes. That was largely the basis of the warning letter.
The implications going forward is, in response to your question, Larry, yes, there will be some impact on that, on sales
for the rest of the year, largely having to do with our focus and actually per our discussions and agreement with the
FDA, we are going to continue to support, service and place devices in our existing accounts. The majority of our sales
of Sigma are into our existing account base, however, until we get these issues resolved, submit the data, get it
reviewed, which we would hope to get completed this fall, and typically there would be about a 90 day review period,
we are not going to place Sigma devices in what I will call new accounts or competitive accounts.

And so there is some sales and margin loss as a result of that action, obviously it didn't impact our overall sales
guidance. So does that answer your question?
<Q - Lawrence S. Keusch>: Yeah and I take it you don't want to quantify how much you think you may lose?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: I don't know, Bob?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: I think I can at least frame for you what our expectation was.
In our original 2013 guidance we assumed approximately $80 million in sales related to Spectrum in the US. And so
obviously we have one quarter under our belt and sales were approximately $20 million and then, as Bob mentioned, a
little bit more than half of our sales were targeted to go towards existing customers as well. I think as you peel off the
pieces and you think about the last nine months of the year and how much sales we had in our original expectation and
the fact that, a fair amount of that was targeted towards existing customers, we think this is manageable within the
context of the Med Products guidance as well as the overall company sales and EPS guidance.
<Q - Lawrence S. Keusch>: Okay, got it.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: Mary Kay, Alzheimer's, go ahead.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: And, Larry, the update on Alzheimer's. As mentioned we did lock the database recently and
we are in the process of analyzing the data. So we do expect to issue a press release during the second quarter with the
top line results. I think as we mentioned last quarter, we do plan to have the full data set available at an upcoming
medical confidence which is in July.

Our next question comes from Mike Weinstein of JPMorgan. Please state your question.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Thank you, good morning. A couple of cleanup questions here. The issue you cited in
the BioPharma Solutions, the partnering business this quarter, that sounds like it's been resolved. Will there be a
catch-up in the second quarter such that the business that you lost this quarter, you get in the second quarter?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: It won't all be in the second quarter but most of it will be caught up, Mike, in the
remainder of the year.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Okay. Thank you. On HyQvia, the preclinical work that you were doing for the FDA,
could you update us on where you are? Have you done the interim analysis of that and can you give us some insights
into when that will be presented to the agency?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: Mary Kay?
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: Yeah, Mike, we have the interim data and we do plan on meeting with the FDA in the
second quarter as we had articulated at the last conference call.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Okay. Is that anything that we will see, that data?
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: No. But we'll be able to give you an update probably at the second quarter call on where we
are with HyQ after the meeting with the FDA.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Okay, and just one more. In the process here with Gambro, have you been able to gain
any additional insights into their business or anything that might change your views on integration or on the
opportunity for the acquisition, either short or longer term?

<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: Nope. No major changes.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Okay. And lastly then just on the performance of the renal side of the business this
quarter, you cited some austerity measures in China, can you maybe just call out what those were and anything else
that...?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: They were largely price reductions. Bob, why don't you comment?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: We characterize austerity overall as impacting top line and margin, frankly, by
approximately $90 million for the full year. China is about a third of that, not all of it related to the renal business but a
good chunk of it is related to the renal business. This is something that has been discussed for the last several years and
they have finally implemented a rebasing of the reimbursement level there and so we continue to have strong growth
from a patient perspective, working very closely with the government in China. We see great opportunities to continue
to expand our footprint there, but we are encountering a price reduction here in 2013 that's going to impact growth
rates.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Okay, perfect. That's all I have. Thanks, guys.

Matt Dodds of Citigroup is on the line with a question. Please state your question.
<Q - Matthew J. Dodds>: Good morning, let me switch here. Can you hear me better?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: Yeah, go ahead, Matt, we can hear you now. Go ahead.
<Q - Matthew J. Dodds>: A couple quick questions. On Gambro, do you have an update on where the EU regulatory
authorities are for antitrust?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: No, I don't think it's appropriate for us to comment at this point in time. We continue to
work closely with them and that's all we can say at this point.
<Q - Matthew J. Dodds>: Okay. And then for albumin, up 2% similar to IG, is that also entirely due to constraints on
the supply or is albumin more of the new growth rate you are seeing?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: No, no, I mean we are continuing to sell all the albumin we can make and so we do have
some seasonality to availability of supply, given normal year-end shutdowns we do at most of our facilities and so on.
We do expect strong albumin growth throughout the course of the rest of the year. So I think it's really just a Q1
phenomenon here.
<Q - Matthew J. Dodds>: Okay. So most of the tenders you commented on in Q1, it sounds like that was plasma
factor VIII.

David Roman of Goldman Sachs is on the line with a question. Please state your question.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Good morning, everyone. I just wanted to follow up a little bit more on the IVIg and albumin
dynamics. I understand there are some factors influencing your growth rate right now but as we look through the

balance of the year and beyond that, what do you think it's going to take for you to get back to growing at or above
market rates and I think most would say that IVIg is still growing in the high single digit range and albumin probably
tracking surgical volumes globally. What's the path to getting your business back towards kind of sort of that market
growth rate in either of those franchises?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: Our capacity. Go ahead, Bob.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yeah, I mean, I think this really is – we continue to see very strong demand for our
product. As you know, because of the constraints, we've had to be very selective about which markets outside the US
we even participate in, as an example. And so, we do continue to see strong demand for IG's globally and so we expect
as we bring meaningful capacity online here, and get old LA back into a mode where we can sell the product
commercially, that we are going to be able to participate at least at market growth rates going forward.
And as it relates to albumin, while I would say your characterization around – in most countries this tracking with
surgical volumes and so on is probably pretty good with the exception of China, which I think continues to be in a
situation where because of decisions they have taken locally about shutting down collection and so on, they are going
to continue to import a significant amount of albumin going forward and that's one, I think, that offers an opportunity
for us to continue to grow as we have more capacity come online.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: And that looks to be a long-term opportunity.
<Q - David H. Roman>: And then some of the decisions that you have taken in Europe, obviously makes sense given
the capacity constraints and the relative pricing environment, but do you think that has any impact on your ability to
launch HyQ there and gain traction? Is there something that has to happen from a tender perspective for you to get that
product to the market or is there enough of a sort of high end segment of the market that would be able to adopt it at
reasonable ASPs pretty quickly?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yeah, I think a couple of factors. Number one, we are very excited about the opportunity,
both in Europe and the US for HyQ. We think this is a significant improvement for patients from a convenience
standpoint while offering all the safety and efficacy that we see in our base product. And so over the long term, we
think HyQ is a great opportunity, but as we hopefully get approval here and can launch in the back half of 2013 in
Europe, it's going to be a controlled launch. You know, we have the issue of capacity to consider here as well, but we
are still in a number of important markets in Western Europe, as an example, and so I think there's plenty of
opportunity within the markets we're a major participant in today to initially launch HyQ.
We are going to launch at a premium because we do think the product, given its characteristics and convenience that it
offers, is worthy of a meaningful premium and so, again, we are going to do a controlled launch and ensure patients and
treaters are aware of the process for the enhanced therapy and that it gets off to a very good start because we do want to
make sure this is successful over the long term.
So, you know, in the near term, I don't see this being an issue in terms of market participation in Europe, because the
key markets we would likely launch HyQ in anyway, we are already in still with IGs.
<Q - David H. Roman>: And maybe one financial question. As I look at the SG&A number this quarter as a
percentage of revenue, I think that's the highest it's been in quite some time, and you did cite some promotional activity
and investments that you are making, but how should we think about the opportunity for leverage on discretionary line
items going forward? Are you entering more of an investment period to drive top line growth in areas like emerging
markets, or is there something sort of more one off in the first quarter whereby that line item should start to look a little
bit more like it has in the past going forward?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yes. I think a couple of dynamics. For the full year, for sure as I mentioned in my
prepared comments, we expect in the base Baxter expense base, we are going to drive leverage relative to sales for the
full year. Q1 has some interesting dynamics. Obviously, given the issues in our pharma partnering business, we came in
a little bit lower on the top line in the quarter. As it relates to things like pension expense, that accounted for about a
percentage and a half of growth in the quarter. Given that impact for the full year, and as I mentioned our business

optimization efforts will provide increasing benefits as we move throughout the course of the year.
We have been and will continue to make the right investments to ensure we can enhance our position in emerging and
developing markets. So no change there. We do have some additional spending in advance of some of the key product
launches like we have discussed today around HyQ and also home HD which we have made good progress on the trials
as Bob mentioned in his comments and look for CE mark here in Europe. I think it's a balance of targeted investment
for the growth opportunities we have and leveraging our existing base through process reengineering.

Kristen Stewart of Deutsche is on the line with a question. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Hi, thanks. I just wanted to clarify. In the other income line that you had said that that did
include $10 million of a gain related to the sale of an intangible. Any color on that?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yeah, no. It's an arrangement we had in a country. So, you know, I don't think it's
something we want to get into a lot of detail around. It's a one off, but, you know as I mentioned the other driver there
was FX and other income.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: It's not something we planned or expect to incur again.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay, gotcha. And then just walking through the gross margin sounds like that was more
moderated. Is that simply all foreign currency or is that any other thing impacting your expectations on the gross
margin line?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yeah, it definitely is currency related.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. And any update on the recombinant Von Willebrand product, in terms of the trial or
expected launch or approval for filing?
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: Yes, Kristen, I think we had mentioned that we had completed enrollment in the end of the
fourth quarter and we actually have now completed the dosing of the last patient.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. And then when might you be in the position to, I guess, file with the FDA on that?
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: Well, there's a 12-month follow-up. So we will complete the trial probably beginning of
next year and file next year.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay, all right. And then just lastly, Mary Kay, I think you had mentioned on ADVATE
that you were planning on taking down inventory for the balance of the year. Can you just maybe explain why that is?
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yeah, you know, Kristen, I think we talked throughout the course of a few quarters last
year. You know, there's been some shakeout in the US amongst the SPPs from a market share standpoint and as a
result, one of our key customers has gotten into a situation where they have lost some share and we are working with
them to – to right size their inventory levels, given that new share situation. And so I think over the next several
quarters, you know, we are talking in the range of approximately $15 million that we'll be working off from a US
recombinant standpoint.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much.

Bob Hopkins of Bank of America is on the line with a question. Please state your question.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: Great, thanks. Can you hear me okay?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: We can Bob. Go ahead.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: Great, good morning. Just a couple of quick things. First, just given the visibility of the
Alzheimer's program, I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more of a direct sense on timing within the
second quarter? Should we expect that's more of a first half disclosure or a second half disclosure and have you – just
give us a little update on exactly what you will be presenting within those headline results and the press release.
Thanks.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: Go ahead, Mary Kay.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: Yeah, you know what, we – we can't be more specific, as we mentioned we locked the
database and we are working diligently with our partner on this, ADCS, and so, you know, we are certainly as
motivated as everyone to get the results compiled and be able to release those. As we mentioned earlier, it will be in the
form initially of a press release for the top line results of the two primary endpoints and some subgroup analysis related
to mild versus moderate and APOE4 and non-APOE4, those are the stratifications that we will be able to provide
initially and as Mary Kay mentioned then, the full data set at a conference likely in July.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: All right, great, thank you. The other question I had was just I was wondering if you could
give us an update on the 855 program just in terms of milestones and timelines that we should expect for the rest of this
year and going forward given that obviously that's a pretty important program from a competitive perspective, thanks.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: Thanks, Bob. BAX 855, we started the Phase III trial and we began dosing patients during
the first quarter. This trial includes over 100 patients and we expect to complete enrollment by the end of this year and
we are remaining on track to file sometime next year.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: All right, great. And then just last pipeline question for me, I realize this is a bit of a softball
question, but can you just give me a sense of what's the best case scenario on HyQ in the US? You know, if things go
as well as you hope they could possibly go, what would that mean from a timing perspective, thanks?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: Yeah, I don't think we are going to speculate on that. Obviously we have our meeting
with the FDA which we've described. We are encouraged by the progress we've made in Europe. Hopefully that will be
helpful with our discussions here in the US. But I think, Bob, to speculate beyond that, we don't want to do that. So...
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: Bob, just recall, though, that we aren't going to complete the preclinical trials until the end
of this year. So obviously we will have more information once we meet with the FDA on the interim results.
<Q - Bob A. Hopkins>: Thank you.

Okay. Our next question comes from Glenn Novarro with RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Hi, good morning. I'm curious, Bob, if you can give us your interpretation of what's
occurring in the US with respect to utilization. We've seen hospitals now, you know, preannounce disappointing
results, some lab companies as well. Do you think, you know, we're seeing heightened seasonality in the fourth quarter
and that's pulling sales from the first quarter? Just any color you can provide.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: I think the market is soft. It's going to continue to remain soft, I think, is our view. I think
as it relates to our products given the nature, the medically necessary nature, of our products, the impact will be modest,
but I think to suggest that you are going to see a turnaround, Glenn, from the softness we've seen over the last quarter

or so would probably be a little too optimistic. I just think the market conditions are going to continue to be very
challenging.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Okay, then just as a follow-up, a lot of investors asked me about 2014 with respect to
healthcare reform. Should we anticipate a volume bump? What are your thoughts on that?
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: I wouldn't. I don't anticipate to see any meaningful, you know, incremental impact on our
business due to evolving healthcare reform implementation and so on. So whether it's 2014, Glenn, or out over the long
range plan, frankly, our views going forward haven't changed from our investor conference last fall on this.
So we all know what the general dynamics are globally, even outside the US, which is a difficult economic
environment. Healthcare costs continue to rise at a rate that's beyond any government's ability to control, and there are
going to continue to be impacts that we characterize as quote/unquote austerity measures on healthcare spending that, I
think, are going to continue to impact all multinational companies whether it's in the US or outside the US. Again – and
I would not suggest that we are impervious to those kinds of impacts but they will be evolutionary in nature. They are
not going to be major step function impacts and again as I said earlier, I'd emphasize, given the medically necessary
nature of our products, we think we are going to be able to withstand this, certainly reasonably well and where the
focus really is, as it always has been in this industry, is innovation.
And with our emerging pipeline, not to mention the expanding capacity position over time on plasma proteins and
continued robust demand for those products, you know, that's where our focus is and we can certainly, I think,
withstand the general macro dynamics that we discussed.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Okay, great. Thanks for the color, Bob.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: And, John, we have time for one last question.
Operator
All right. Our final question comes from Rick Wise with Stifel Nicolaus. Please state your question.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Good morning, everybody. Hi, Bob. If I could ask a little more color on the home hemo program.
It seems to be clearly on track as you have suggested in the past. Maybe just remind us again when the trial wraps up,
what the filing and approval timing process is. And I keep thinking, just given the current market dynamics, that this is
a more promising program than ever. Any thoughts, again, about the potential penetration or the opportunity here?
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: Well, I will take the first half of the question, Rick, and then Bob can take the market
opportunity part of your question. But in terms of the trial, the Canadian trial is going to be wrapping up here in the
second quarter and then we'll be wrapping up the submission and we expect the CE marking by the end of this year. As
you recall, in the US, we're still in discussions with the FDA as to whether or not they will require one or two trials
here in the US, but we are still planning for a nocturnal indication filing in 2014.
<A - Robert L. Parkinson>: So Rick, Bob Parkinson here maybe just to wrap up on the higher level question. We
continue to be enthusiastic about the opportunity associated with our home hemodialysis product, which we think has a
number of dimensions or characteristics that can differentiate it from the home hemo products that are on the market
today, not to mention to leverage our global position as really the leading dialysis provider in the home setting, which
has real value here. I think when you take a step back and look at this, this is the kind of product that's responsive to, I
think, the new – the new realities of the – of the global economic environment and healthcare environment.
The opportunity to enhance clinical outcomes, we think, meaningfully, particularly with home nocturnal hemo, to
provide, as a result, increased convenience for the patient to deliver therapy in their home and to do it in a way that
fundamentally lowers the cost versus conventional in center hemodialysis is really the kinds of products going forward
that we think there's going to be a great response in the marketplace to.

The only caveat I would say is the nature of this requires a motivated patient. That doesn't describe 100% of the patient
population, so in no way do I want to suggest that traditional home and center hemo is going to continue to be both a
growth vehicle and the primary therapy to address end stage renal disease, hence our excitement about the Gambro
acquisition.
I appreciate your question because I think as we go forward and get this product launched in Europe and expand
beyond that, this is a product opportunity that's very significant for the company going forward.
<Q - Rick A. Wise>: Just last quick one on China. I wanted to make sure I understood what, Bob Hombach, you were
talking about in your Med product comments. China austerity, I just wanted to make sure I understood what you were
talking about and I hope I didn't miss it, but did you talk about the timing of ADVATE reimbursement? I don't think
you've gotten it yet. When are you expecting that? And when are you expecting that Chinese launch? Thank you.
<A - Robert J. Hombach>: My comments about reimbursements adjustment down relate specifically to the renal
business. We have gotten – the launch of ADVATE in China is going to be, you know, take a long time to play out.
The treatment rates today in China for hemophiliacs are very low, even on plasma-derived, so we've got a long way to
go to develop that market, but that's one that could be prime for some of our approaches here around public/private
partnerships but we are a long way from anything there.
<A - Mary Kay Ladone>: Yes, Rick, we are awaiting reimbursement approval. You may recall, we did get approval
for the product last year, but we can't launch until we have the reimbursement approved, which we expect in the second
half of this year.
