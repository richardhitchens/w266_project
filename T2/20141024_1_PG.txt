Today's discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&G's most recent 10-K,
10-Q and 8k reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ
materially from these projections.
As required by Regulation G, P&G needs to make you aware that during the call, the company will make a number of
references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Management believes these measures provide investors valuable
information on the underlying growth trends of the business.
Organic refers to reported results excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, where
applicable.
Free cash flow represents operating cash flow, less capital expenditures.
Adjusted free cash flow productivity is the ratio of free cash flow to net earnings adjusted for impairment charges.
Any measure described as core refers to the equivalent GAAP measure adjusted for certain items.

Jon R. Moeller
Good morning.
July to September was a challenging quarter from a macro standpoint with slowing market growth in both developed
and developing regions, strong foreign exchange headwinds, market level challenges in the Ukraine, Russia, the Middle
East, Venezuela, Argentina and Hong Kong, and increased consumption taxes in several large markets including Japan
and Mexico. Despite this, we were able to deliver top and bottom line results for the July-September quarter, which
were in line with our going in expectations.
Organic sales grew 2%, and were in line or ahead of year ago in all reporting segments. Organic volume was in line
with the prior year, pricing added more than a point to sales growth, and sales mix was positive.
All in sales were roughly equal to prior year, including more than a point of headwind from foreign exchange and the
impact of brand divestitures. Core earnings per share were $1.07, up 2% versus the prior year. Excluding FX, core
earnings per share grew 9%. Core gross margin was up 20 basis points. Cost savings of approximately 140 basis points
and benefits from pricing were partially offset by foreign exchange, higher commodity costs, innovation and capacity
investments and negative margin mix.
Core SG&A costs as a percentage of sales increased 30 basis points, 70 basis points of overhead savings and 50 basis
points of marketing savings were more than offset by foreign exchange impacts and investments in R&D and selling
capabilities. Total productivity savings and cost of goods sold and SG&A were 260 basis points.
Core operating margin was down 20 basis points, versus the prior year. The effective tax rate on core earnings was
about 23%, nearly two points higher than the fiscal year guidance of about 21%. September quarter all in GAAP
earnings per share were $0.69, which includes approximately $0.03 per share of non-core restructuring charges, $0.04
per share of charges related to a change in the exchange rate at which certain historical Venezuelan receivables will be
paid, and a penny per share benefit from earnings of the discontinued pet care operations.
Also included is the $0.32 per share non-core, non-cash charge to write down goodwill and certain intangibles of our
battery business. Duracell is a strong brand equity and personal power and attractive business, but we are writing the
asset down to be more reflective of the value we will receive in the recently announced sale of our interest in the Nanfu
battery joint venture.
We generated $3.6 billion in operating cash flow, and $2.8 billion in free cash flow with 96% adjusted free cash flow
productivity, reflecting our focus on balanced growth and value creation. This quarter is the best first quarter cash
performance in the past five years, improved results on payables, including good progress on our supply chain
financing program, were the main driver of the strong cash performance.
We returned $4.2 billion of cash to shareholders including $1.8 billion in dividends and $2.4 billion in share
repurchase.
In summary, first quarter sales and core earnings growth were in line with going in expectations and we continue to
build on our strong track record of cash productivity and cash returned to shareholders.
We expect the headwinds facing our industry to continue. We are consequently continuing to sharpen our strategies,
accelerate and increase productivity savings and strengthen our execution. As we announced last quarter, we are taking
an important strategic step forward to streamline, simplify and strengthen the company's business and brand portfolio.

We will become a simpler, more focused company of 70 to 80 category-leading, competitively advantaged brands,
organized into about a dozen business units and four industry based sectors. We will compete in businesses that are
structurally attractive and play to P&G's strengths, where we can achieve sustainable advantage. Every brand we plan
to keep is strategic, with the potential to grow and create value. The core 70 to 80 brands are leaders in their industries,
categories or segments. They are brands shoppers buy, consumers use and customers support. They are leaders in brand
equity, awareness, trial, purchase and loyalty. They are leaders in product performance and product innovation and
leaders in growth and value creation.
Over the next 18 to 24 months we will create a faster growing, more profitable company that is far simpler to operate.
In the September quarter, we completed the exit of the pet care business. We closed the divestiture of the Americas pet
business to Mars in July. Mars then executed their option to purchase the business in Asia and last month we signed an
agreement to divest the European pet business to Spectrum Brands. All remaining elements of these transactions should
close in calendar year 2015, pending regulatory approval.
We generated very good value in this three-stage transaction, earning more than a 20x EBITDA multiple on past three
year average results. The pet care exit transitions seven brands to new owners. In total over the last five quarters we've
divested, discontinued or made decisions to consolidate about 25 brands. Today we are announcing the exit of the
personal power or battery business. Our goals in this process are to maximize value to P&G's shareholders and
minimize earnings per share dilution.
There are two steps to this plan; in late August we finalized an agreement to sell our interest in a China-based battery
joint venture in a cash transaction. The second step is the exit of the Duracell business. Although no decision has been
made on the form of exit, our preference is currently a split off of the Duracell business into a standalone company.
Duracell is a global battery market leader with attractive operating profit margins. It's the brand equity and product
innovation leader in the category, with a history of strong cash generation. It will receive greater priority and attention
as its own company.
If we choose to pursue a split off transaction, P&G shareholders would be given the option of exchanging some, none,
or all of their shares, or P&G shares for shares in the newly formed Duracell company. P&G's outstanding share count
would be reduced by the number of P&G shares exchanged. The exact exchange ratio will be set just prior to the
completion of the transaction, which we expect will occur in the second half of calendar 2015.
While a split off is our preference, any alternative exit scenario that generates equal or better value will be fully
considered. We are developing incremental savings plans to offset stranded overheads that remain in our core cost
structure to minimize the dilutive impact of exiting the Duracell business. For the time being, Duracell will continue to
be reported in our core results.
As we continue to strengthen our category and brand portfolio, we will strengthen and focus our brand building and
product innovation efforts and investments against our biggest opportunities. We are committed to be the brand and
product innovation leader in the categories in which we compete. Year after year, decade after decade, successful brand
building, supported by product innovation, has built our businesses, transformed our categories and created entirely
new businesses. Innovation combats commoditization, stimulates category growth and builds the cumulative advantage
of our brands over time.
With branding and product innovation, we have built leading positions in laundry in many markets. In the US, we have
nearly a 60% share of the U.S. laundry market sales and earn about 85% of the profit and cash generated in the
category. We have launched our North American fabric care brand and product innovation bundle about eight months
ago: an upgraded Tide Plus lineup that make our best liquid detergents even better; Gain Flings that accelerate
consumer conversion to new premium unit dose detergents; Tide Simply Clean & Fresh that provides value to our
consumers, a new and better option from a brand they aspire to use; new sizes and scents of Downy Unstopables and
Gain Fireworks; and the addition of Bounce Bursts to the scent bead portfolio.
Innovations like these build on the consumer and competitive advantages our brands have created over decades.
Innovations like these enable us to earn a leading share of market sales and an even greater share of market profit and

value creation. Innovations like these stimulate market growth. They spark new consumer interest in a category and
grow market baskets. They trade consumers up to higher performing products. Tide PODS and Gain Flings are priced
at more than double the average price per load in the detergent category and are still very affordable for the vast
majority of consumer households.
Over the last 30 years, the price of a load of laundry has lagged the price of cheese or eggs, and is a much better value
than a cup of coffee or a bottle of soda. The U.S. category's two biggest laundry brands, Tide and Gain, have each
grown market share over the past four, thirteen, twenty-six, and fifty-two week periods. Tide value share was up 2
points for the quarter. Tide Simply Clean & Fresh is nearly a three share with cannibalization results better than
expected. Distribution of Simply Clean & Fresh continues to grow, with a top U.S. retailer expanding to full national
distribution earlier this month.
P&G's unit dose business across Tide and Gain is a 9% share of the total U.S. detergent market. We have over 75%
share of the unit dose form. We are continuing to leverage our consumer preferred unit dose form with Tide Free &
Gentle PODS, which started shipping in July.
Just over a year ago, we introduced a broad range of Baby Care product innovation in North America. Nearly every
diaper across all sizes and price tiers was improved to deliver better absorbency, comfort or design. Our premium
mom-preferred diaper design, Swaddlers, was extended into sizes 4 and 5, and subsequently size 6. P&G's U.S. market
leading diaper share is now nearly 44%, up more than three points versus a year ago.
On a global basis, P&G has about 35% of the global diaper value share and earns about half the profit in the category.
We have built this leading baby diaper business despite the absence of a consumer preferred pant style diaper offering.
We are now launching Pampers Premium Care Pants beginning in Russia. Pampers Pants provides exceptional skin
comfort and dryness benefits in an underwear-like design. This should add to the cumulative product and equity
advantage we've established with Pampers.
Gillette has a long history of innovations, blades and razors that reset the performance standards in the industry. Over
time, we've earned nearly a 70% share of blades and razor sales globally, and a 90% share of value and profit.
ProGlide FlexBall, our newest innovation, is the first razor designed to respond to the contours of a man's face,
maintaining maximum contact and delivering a closer, more complete and comfortable shave. Every man has a
different shaped face. One Gillette FlexBall razor and cartridge delivers a uniquely better, closer, more comfortable
shave for everyone. Pre-launch testing indicated men preferred FlexBall 2-to-1, versus the best-selling razor in the
world, our own Fusion ProGlide. Post launch, men who have used FlexBall indicate closer to a 90% preference rate.
Trial has come from across the category with an encouraging 25% from disposable users.
In the four months since launch, we've seen an improvement in U.S. blades and razors market growth, including more
than a 25% market spike in razor sales, and have seen sequential improvement in our razor shares over the past 12, 6
and three month periods. Gillette earned nearly 80% of male razor sales and nearly 90% of male cartridge sales in the
U.S. last quarter. We'll begin the global expansion of ProGlide FlexBall early next calendar year.
Also next year, we will extend our breakthrough FlexBall technology to women, with our market leading Venus brand.
FlexBall offers clear benefits to women, helping them to easily manage tricky spots, such as knees and ankles. Women
who have tried the new razor love it, preferring it 3-to-1 over the current global best-selling women's razor, Venus
Embrace.
We believe we can grow the adult incontinence category with innovation, transform the desired consumer experience
and increase consumer, customer, and shareholder value. This is currently an attractive $7 billion global category,
growing at an annual rate of 7%. Women aren't satisfied with current product offerings. One in three women over 18
years old suffers from incontinence, but only one in 9 uses an adult incontinence product of any kind. That spells
consumer dissatisfaction, which spells opportunity for P&G. We are entering the category with superior pad and pant
sale products that deliver better fit and protection from Always, a brand that women trust and prefer.

We began shipments of Always Discreet in the U.K. in July, where market growth has accelerated by 20% since our
launch. We have quickly grown to over 9% value share. We started shipping Always Discreet in North America and
France in August. In less than two full months on the market, the U.S. adult incontinence market growth rate has
accelerated to 10% and we've grown to over a 7% value share.
Last month, we launched Crest Sensi-Stop Strips, providing unprecedented tooth sensitivity relief. Unlike toothpaste
that takes several weeks to reduce sensitivity, and need to be used twice per. One Sensi-Stop Strip applied for ten
minutes provides immediate relief and up to one month of protection from sensitivity pain for some consumers.
This is another significant market growth opportunity. Nearly 60% of Americans suffer from sensitive teeth, but only
four in ten are satisfied with their available sensitivity product solutions. Our focus now is on driving awareness and
trial of this revolutionary new treatment for tooth sensitivity sufferers.
In July, we introduced QlearQuil, a product innovation that extends Vick's into allergy treatments. This innovation
leverages the very strong and trusted Vick's brand equity across a variety of products, including Nighttime, Daytime
and 24-hour treatments. QlearQuil is a great product for the numerous occasional sinus and allergy sufferers who only
want relief when they need it and don't want or need every day preventative dosing.
In September, we launched a new bundle of product innovations on the Metamucil brand. This includes a base brand
restage of Metamucil fiber with a new satiety benefit that helps you feel less hungry between meals. In addition to its
current heart health, blood sugar and digestive health benefits. Meta bars are a new fiber bar form that fit with
consumers' lifestyles and capitalize on the rapid growth of the health bar meal supplement and snack category.
MetaBiotic is a new probiotic that puts Meta into the fast growing immunity benefit space. As I said earlier, we are
committed to be the brand and product innovation leader in our categories and we are increasing investment behind it.
The best companies in any industry find a way to lead brand, product and business model innovation and productivity.
We are turning productivity into a core strength at P&G, making it a systemic and enduring value creation pillar
alongside innovation.
We have significantly accelerated and will significantly exceed the $10 billion cost savings goal we set two and a half
years ago. We are driving cost of goods savings well above the original target run rate of $1.2 billion per year. We will
be above target again this year for the third consecutive year with strong savings across materials, manufacturing
expense and logistics.
We expect to improve manufacturing productivity by at least 6% again this year, reducing staffing even as we add
capacity and start up new production modules. We have begun work on what is probably the biggest supply chain
redesign in the company's history, moving from primarily single category production sites to fewer, multi-category
production plants. The supply chains will be informed – excuse me. The supply chain plans will be informed by
portfolio decisions that we have made. We will build the supply chain around the future portfolio, not the one we have
today.
We are taking the opportunity to simplify, standardize and upgrade manufacturing platforms, for faster innovation,
qualification and expansion and improved product quality.
We are transforming our distribution network in the United States, consolidating customer shipments into fewer
distribution centers. These centers are strategically located closer to key customers and key population centers enabling
80% of the business to be within one day of the store shelf and the shopper.
We now have two of our new U.S. distribution centers up and running and will open the other four in early 2015.
Earlier this month, we announced steps to streamline our distribution network in France, consolidating to fewer, larger
distribution centers. The distribution network projects allow both P&G and our retail partners to optimize inventory
levels, while still improving service and on shelf availability and reducing in-store out of stocks.
We have now established a $1 billion to $2 billion value creation target for our global supply chain reinvention effort.
We've double the associated cost of goods savings target from this global effort, from $200 million to $300 million, up

to $400 million to $600 million, in annual savings, building to this target level over the next three to five years. These
savings are incremental to the $6 billion cost of goods savings we originally communicated and are on track to exceed.
We expect additional top and bottom line benefits from improved service levels.
We have reduced non-manufacturing enrollment by 16% in three years enabled by several important organization
design choices. We have organized around four industry-based sectors. We are streamlining and de-duplicating the
work of business units and selling operations. We have consolidated four brand building functions into one. Each of
these changes reduces complexity, and each creates clearer accountability for performance and results. A more focused
portfolio of brands and businesses will enable further changes.
In the first quarter we again reduced enrollment versus the prior quarter, despite the addition of many of this year's new
hires to our enrollment ranks. We have additional opportunity to improve marketing efficiency in both media and
non-media areas while increasing overall marketing effectiveness and the strength of our programs. We continue to
drive marketing productivity through an optimized mix, driven by new, more efficient digital, mobile, and social
media.
We are making targeted reinvestments to support strong innovation. We increased marketing support behind the Tide
brand in the U.S. by 60 basis last year and increased Pampers marketing in the U.S. by 230 basis points. As we
generate efficiencies, we will look for good opportunities to put some of those savings back to work to improve top line
growth.
The final priority that I'll touch on this morning is execution, the only strategy our consumers and customers actually
see. We are bringing renewed focus to brands, building leadership brands with iconic equities that become the
prototype in their categories. Consistent expression of the brand promise with ideas that attract consumers to the
brand's superior benefit, create trial, ongoing preference and lasting loyalty.
Building trial with targeted advertising and sampling is a significant opportunity for many our brands. For example,
thousands of recent male high school graduates will receive ProGlide FlexBall razors. The babies of 80% to 90% of
new moms in the U.S. will try Pampers while they're in the hospital. Many buyers of new dishwashers or clothes
washing machines will have the opportunity to try our best Cascade and Tide product innovations.
We are focusing selling resources to improve coverage, expertise and execution in the key retail channels, wholesalers
and distributors that make a difference. This should lead to improved distribution, shelving, merchandising and pricing
execution to consistently win at the first moment of truth.
We are and will continue to increase the amount of sector and category dedication of our sales force to improve
category expertise and tenure, and increase channel coverage. Improving our branding and selling execution will be
significantly enabled by the business and brand portfolio focus we have embarked on.
The strategic strengthening of our portfolio, innovation investment in core categories, strengthened and accelerated and
productivity efforts and stronger marketing and selling execution should enhance our results. We are operating, though,
in an extremely different macro environment with an increasing number of issues in Russia, the Ukraine, the Middle
East, Argentina and Venezuela, with a dollar that continues to strengthen, with markets that continue to decelerate and
with increasing commodity costs despite lower crude oil prices.
We are making targeted investments in our value equations and are increasing the level of investment in our brands and
product innovation. With all of this considered, we are maintaining previous organic sales and core earnings per share
guidance ranges while we work to try to offset the macro headwinds with more productivity savings, pricing for FX
and market accretive, innovation enabled topline growth.
Our forecast for organic sales growth remains in a range of low to mid-single digits. We now expect foreign exchange
to be a negative 2 point impact on sales growth, and a 5 to 6 point headwind on core earnings per share growth. This is
roughly double the impact we had estimated last quarter.
We are maintaining our core earnings per share growth guidance range of mid-single-digits while FX currently skews
us towards the lower end of this range, we will do our best to try to offset these impacts with productivity savings and

pricing, without compromising increased investments in brand equities, value equations, innovation and selling
capability. This is what we were able to successfully do last year.
Excluding FX, we are now forecasting double digit core earnings per share growth for the fiscal year. On an all in
GAAP basis we expect earnings per share to be down 2% to 5% versus the prior fiscal year, including approximately
$0.55 per share of non-core items mainly $0.20 per share of non-core restructuring costs and the $0.32 impairment
charge. We are targeting to deliver about 90% free cash flow productivity. We plan to offset additional capital
investments with continued working capital improvements.
We plan to return this cash to shareowners through dividend payments of about $7 billion and share repurchase in the
range of $5 billion to $7 billion. Our guidance is based on mid-October foreign exchange spot rates. Further significant
currency weakness, including Venezuela, is not anticipated within our guidance range.
Our outlook is based on current market growth rates, which we are monitoring closely. We also continue to monitor
unrest in several markets in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, and we continue to closely monitor markets like
Venezuela and Argentina, where pricing controls, import restrictions and access to dollars present risk. The guidance
does not assume any impact from major portfolio moves, including the sale of the Nanfu battery joint venture. We will
update guidance for Nanfu once it closes and will update for other transactions as they are decided and completed.
There are a few things you should keep in mind as you construct your models for the remainder of the year. Our top
line comps are more difficult in the second quarter versus the back half of the year. Benefits from new pricing to offset
foreign exchange impacts in Venezuela and other markets will build throughout the year. We expect significant top and
bottom line headwinds from foreign exchange in the October-December quarter. At current FX rates, we will annualize
a portion of the FX headwinds in the back half, and productivity savings will build as the year progresses.
We look forward to talking with you more about our strategies, plans and progress and engaging with you on your
questions at our analyst meeting here in Cincinnati on November 12th and 13th.
That concludes our prepared remarks for this morning. As a reminder, business segment information is provided in our

Now I would be happy to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Olivia Tong from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Olivia Tong>: Thank you. Good morning, Jon. You walked through a lot of new innovation in your prepared
remarks. That's notable considering that this is the first time in a few years that mix has actually contributed to top line
growth. But meanwhile, volume continues to be flattish again. So perhaps can you talk through how you think about
the contributors to top line growth going forward?
And then following on that, can you tell us what the breakout was in U.S. growth versus emerging markets and given
slowing macros, can you talk about how growth progressed through the quarter? Thank you very much.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: I will try to remember all of that, Olivia. In terms of the contributors of top line growth, as you
said, volume was relatively flat and mix was uncharacteristically positive. We expect going forward to resume volume
growth. We will have some benefit from pricing. I would expect mix to be neutral to negative, as it has typically been
and as we have said it will be, though there will be some volatility by quarter. And clearly innovation will be a
significant driver of our growth, but as importantly, base brand execution and brand building where we have significant
opportunities, also represent some opportunities for growth.
So that's kind of, without getting really specific, how we are thinking about driving growth forward, and I think it's
important, you know, that we just step back a minute in the midst of some of the macro difficulties and reflect on

opportunities for growth. Developing markets are still growing mid to high single digits depending on the market. So
while growth rates in our view are 1 to 2 points lower than they were a year ago, there's still a lot of opportunity there.
And there are significant opportunities in developed markets. It's very early, but we are starting to see a little bit of
uptick in the market growth rates in North America, presumably driven by lower unemployment, wage rates just
beginning to increase, and lower gasoline prices and hopefully that continues. But even if that doesn't, there are still
significant opportunities for growth in developed markets.
Just one example, think about the aging demographic: there are 10,000 Americans every day crossing the 65 years old
line. And we talked in our prepared remarks about the adult incontinence opportunity, the tooth sensitivity opportunity
with Crest Sensi-Stop Strips also should benefit from that demographic shift and even things like Tide PODS, which
are more convenient from a carrying and handling standpoint for older bodies and hands, will help us benefit from that
demographic change, so we continue to be very aware of the challenges we face but very hopeful about the
opportunities that are in front of us.
In terms of the split between developed and developing. Both North America and the developed markets in total were
essentially flat on the quarter in terms of organic sales growth with developing up 4%.

And your next question comes from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Dara W. Mohsenian>: Hey, good morning. Gross margin performance clearly improved in the quarter. It was up
for the first time in a year and a half, year-over-year, and I'm guessing it was probably better or ahead of what you guys
expected. Can you discuss the key drivers behind that in terms of the sequential gross margin improvement and if you
think that's sustainable going forward?
And then also I just wanted to get an update on the drag you are experiencing from emerging markets growth in terms
of gross margin mix and the progress you expect to make in emerging markets over the next couple of years on gross
margins with more localized manufacturing.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: The biggest driver, as you would expect, of the gross margin improvement was the productivity
savings, which were about 140 basis points. There was also less difference, if you will, between developing markets
growth rates and developed market growth rates. So part of the answer going forward depends on that dynamic. And
there was also an offset from foreign exchange. So the dynamics going forward also depend on that dynamic.
We continue to focus on improving the profitability in the developing markets so that growth there becomes less of a
gross margin drag. If you look at the last two years and then what we are projecting this year, two years ago, we grew
constant currency profits in developing markets two times faster than sales. Last year we grew them four times faster
than sales. This year we are forecasting again to be about double the rate of sales growth. So we are very intentional
and very deliberate in our efforts to improve developing market margins to a point where they are not as much of a drag
on mix.
But we are very happy with the gross margin performance we delivered. I think on a fiscal year basis, while it will
continue to be volatile by quarter, we should continue to see progress.

<Q - Wendy C. Nicholson>: Hi. When you announced in August that you were going through this portfolio

the divestiture or the spin of Duracell. My question is: does the target for the 10% number of sales that you are going to
be exiting now go up to kind of 12% to 13% when you include Duracell or has there been some change in how you

build up to that 10%? Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: You are right, Wendy, in referring to the Pareto of brands that we talked about that we would
be divesting and we said there were many that were much smaller than there were those that were bigger but we didn't
say that there wouldn't be any large ones, or if we did, that was a misstatement.
But in terms of taking the number up, no, this is part of the plan, and as I said, we are about 25% of the way through the
plan, through the end of the quarter. This is additive to that. So we continue to make progress against that originally
articulated plan. There will be some larger businesses, but the majority will be small, and I apologize if we
miscommunicated that previously.

Your next question comes from the line of Michael Steib with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Michael Steib>: Good morning. Just following-on on Duracell, why, even though you have taken a decision to
exit this business now, is it still included in the ongoing operations? And then, you know, related to that, at what point
are you going to sort of tell us, you know, what level of operating profit you are essentially losing by exiting that
business? And then secondly, are there significant stranded overhead costs that are you are expecting in that disposal
process?
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: U.S. GAAP accounting requirements require that we account for something in a split off
context in continuing operations until the split off is executed. And that's why it remains in continuing operations. But
as we execute the split off, or as we were to sign any other agreement, the business would move into discontinued
operations at that time.
In terms of stranded overhead, there is some overhead that this business is absorbing. As we talked in the last quarter,
we are going to do our best to offset that, to help minimize dilution. And in terms of what the dilution will ultimately
be, it's really too early to give you helpful guidance on that, because a lot of that is going to depend on what form the
transaction ultimately takes. It will depend on the amount of shares that are exchanged and that exchange ratio, which
won't be set until closer to the transaction itself.
So we'll try to keep you updated as we have information, but right now, it would be a pretty wide range. But, again, I
think the takeaway is that we are committed, both through the form of the transaction and through our efforts to reduce
stranded overhead, to minimize that dilution number.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Chappell with SunTrust.
<Q - William B. Chappell>: Good morning, thank you. Jon, can you talk a little bit more about kind of the commodity
basket and what you see over the next remainder of fiscal 2015? And, clearly, with oil coming down, diesel, freight,
other things should be a tailwind, but you kind of alluded to there were some other headwinds. So just trying to see
what you are seeing, and maybe the net inflation will be this year.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Yeah, we are certainly hopeful that this becomes a tailwind over time. But it takes a while for,
for instance, crude reductions to work their way through the refineries. And there's a bit of a bottleneck right now in
refining capacity in parts of the world, which is why we are not seeing the immediate flow through into our commodity
cost base.
So our commodities currently are about a 2 to 3 point headwind versus last year, and we are seeing some moderation
and a small decline, for instance, in diesel prices, and hopefully that continues. But we still have resins and
polypropylenes, due to the dynamic I mentioned earlier, up fairly significantly versus a year ago. So hopefully that 2 to
3 point headwind is a worse case number, and hopefully we get some help as things continue to evolve.

Your next question comes from the line of John Faucher with JPMorgan.
<Q - John A. Faucher>: Yes, thanks. Two quick questions. Well, one quick, one probably a little bit longer.
First off, can you talk a little bit about the sustainability, the working capital improvement that you saw this quarter?
There was a nice benefit year-over-year.
And then, the second question relates to the mix from a margin standpoint. Obviously, it was better this quarter because
emerging markets got worse, let's say. But can you talk about some of the margin improvements you can make outside
the U.S. and outside of developed markets that will create a little less margin pressure, particularly on the operating
profit line as we look out over the next couple of years? Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Thanks, John.
On the sustainability of working capital improvements, I view them as very sustainable. Cash is one of our clear focus
areas and we have some strong plans there to continue to make progress. The progress that we made in the quarter that
we just reported was driven primarily by the supply chain financing program, which has future benefits associated with
it. We are not all of our way through that yet, and those benefits are sustainable going forward.
On top of that, as we execute our portfolio focusing program, there's a significant opportunity that we're committed to
go after. Once we have rationalized the category and brand portfolio at the SKU level and that also represents a
significant inventory and working capital opportunity. You know, the bottom 5% of our SKUs in terms of movement,
not surprisingly account for a much greater percentage of our inventory. So as we get after that, there should be a
benefit.
And third, as I mentioned in our supply chain redesign efforts, we are hopeful we can take significant levels of
inventory out of the total system. And at the same time, decrease shelf out of stocks, improve customer service. So
there are a number of big drivers that we should have available to us to continue to make progress in that area, which
we are committed to do in part to offset the impact of some of the capital spending that we are doing in the supply
chain redesign on a global basis.
In terms of what can we do in developing markets to reduce the margin mix impact, as I mentioned in an answer to a
prior question, we are making significant progress in this area, on a constant currency basis, 2X the rate of organic sales
growth two years ago, 4X last year, and at least 2X again this year.
Also, some of the developing market investments that we made, for instance, the oral care investments, they are
beginning to accrete and that should be the source of help going forward. The productivity savings are not simply a
developed market dynamic. They are equally a developing market dynamic on items like TDC, items like marketing,
even in the non-manufacturing overhead arena.
And then, as you know, we are also increasingly localizing our production. We will be bringing some of the same
redesign to parts of the developing world that we're doing in the developed world today, at least from a distribution
center standpoint. And so, I see no reason why longer term, developing markets margins should be a significant drag on
earnings, though they will continue to be a negative drag in the near term.

in general, U.S. skincare in China. And then, I guess maybe elaborate on the Prestige comments you made in the press
release. That would be great.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: So if you look at beauty, parts of that business are doing fairly well. We grew antiperspirants
and deodorants mid-single digits. Cosmetics grew organic sales mid-single digits in the quarter, with Max Factor
growing shipments on a double digit basis globally. Safeguard was growing mid-single digits globally with double digit
growth in parts of the developing world, and we had a pretty strong quarter on Hugo Boss, which is our largest Prestige
fragrance.
Hair care grew about 2% in the quarter. We were very encouraged by the developments that you point out on Pantene
in the U.S., where volume was up 11% on the quarter. As I have cautioned before, this will not be a straight line, and
competitive intensity in this category is significant. But still, forward progress is encouraging.
Olay remains a work in progress. We are making some good progress in addressing some of the consumer benefits
segments that we had neglected and that are important in the category, with items like Luminous, with items like Fresh
Effects. But we still have work to do, both in North America and in China.
But sequentially, quarter-on-quarter, better results in beauty from a top line standpoint and we are hopeful we can
continue that.

Your next question comes from the line of Bill Schmitz with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Bill G. Schmitz>: Hi, good morning. A couple of questions, just to sort of drill down more in the U.S.
Can you just talk about some of the price interventions you discussed last quarter, if they are done yet and kind of
where they happened?
And then, some of the personnel changes in the U.S. and your views on the sustainability of the U.S. recovery? I know
it's very nascent, but I'm curious why you think things are improving and maybe how long you think it will last?
And then, lastly, just urgency on some of the share losses in China and if you saw any material distributor destocking in
any of the major emerging markets? Sorry for the long question.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Obviously, pricing is a sensitive topic, so I don't want to get into really granular specifics. But
we did mention that we had made value equation interventions in both the laundry and the paper products businesses,
specifically tissue, towel, and toilet paper. And those appear to have been going pretty well. You know, as I mentioned
in the prepared remarks, we've built share on almost any period of time you can look at in the last 52 weeks in both
Gain and Tide, Tide was up 2 points in the quarter. And so we'll continue – we need to be competitive on pricing. We
will continue to be competitive, but I think we are pretty much where we need to be. I don't see – of course, this
changes on a daily basis, but as we sit here today, I don't see any additional significant moves that need to be made.
In terms of personnel, look, we are just taking advantage of normal retirement and normal attrition to design the
organization that's going to lead this more focused, more strategically oriented company for balanced growth and value
creation. And that's what's – that's what we are doing. We are pretty – we are going to have a management team that's
going to manage this company that will be the same size as the team that existed in 2000 managing a company that's
2X – actually, more than 2X the size of the company in 2000. And that's the design intent.
In terms of China, China continues to be an attractive market in our view. It's a market where we have grown over 50%
in the last four years. Market growth continues, the last quarter based on our look at our categories, market growth was
at about 6%. Our inventories are pretty much in line throughout the trade chain. So we really have not – I would view
those destocking dynamics as company specific rather than systemic.

Your next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with UBS.
<Q - Steve R. Powers>: Hey, Jon, good morning. Thanks.
I was hoping maybe to just step back and put this quarter in the broader context of all of the improvement efforts that
you're doing. Clearly, there's lots of things that you have done internally over the last 12 months that you've
summarized and that can be viewed as positive. There is the reorg, the supply chain restructuring, overall productivity
focus you built, the brand refocusing initiative, et cetera. I think all that is good. But despite that and despite the
innovation successes and the brand strength that you ran through, organic growth is still only rounding up to 2%. Only
two of the divisions grew this quarter, and I get that improved focus over time and easier compares going forward
should help, but even many of the core brands you intend to retain remain pretty sluggish and have been so for some
time.
So I guess in that context, what are you planning to do to change that paradigm? Is it truly all about the better execution
that you mentioned or are there things that consumers currently want from P&G in certain areas that you are not
delivering? Because I'm trying to discern how much you can do to reaccelerate growth on your own, versus how much
such improvement is just more dependent on macro improvement. Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: There's a lot that we can do on our own and that's why I talked about the whole brand building
and selling execution opportunity. That's completely within our control, and I mentioned the sampling opportunities.
We have opportunities to continue to improve the quality and clarity of our communication with consumers. We have
significant opportunities, which the supply chain redesign will help us address at the first moment of truth, just in terms
of out of stocks. And, generally, while market growth have slowed, consumers continue to be very responsive to
innovation that increases the value of the product that they are purchasing.
If we look at the segments of our business that are growing the fastest, I talked about some of them in the opening
remarks, but many of those are premium priced items but come with product superiority and consumer benefit, that
more than justifies that price. And, you know, put simply, we believe that the antidote to relatively slow overall market
sales or market growth is threefold. It's innovation, it's productivity and it's execution.
And I would be remiss if I didn't mention in this context that – to the point of the prior question, we still have work to
do on our beauty business and a couple of other pockets of the business, and that should also, as we improve that, make
a significant difference in our ability to grow, not just at but slightly ahead of market growth rates.

Your next question comes from the line of Lauren Lieberman with Barclays Capital.
<Q - Lauren Rae Lieberman>: Thanks, good morning. Let me just follow up on that a bit, and let's maybe focus on
grooming because when you talked about some of the sampling opportunities, some of them sounded familiar, like
things you have always done, the babies in the hospital get Pampers, you've got incredible reach there; sending razors
to boys when they turn 18; that dynamic. That's not necessarily new, so we focus a bit on grooming. That's the trial
opportunity. You had a massive innovation with FlexBall. You gave some really positive statistics on the impact on the
market, yet the organic sales growth of the business was flat and it was all pricing and volume was down. So just
maybe focus on a particular business. What was missing if FlexBall has been so successful thus far, what is missing
that these numbers are still so weak? Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Well, I think there and it's very early and you can imagine that most men have an inventory of
blades at home that they have to work through before the real driver of growth in that market, which is cartridge
consumption, takes place but we are beginning to see an increase now in cartridge market share. We were up about 1.4
points in the quarter.

We are also beginning to see a reduction in the rate of market decline in the grooming segment. It was down as much as
6% to 7% previously. It's down about 3% on a more recent basis and as low as past 1% in a couple – or down 1% in a
couple of the recent months.
And remember, as well, that the FlexBall innovation is not only new to market, it's only in one country serving one
gender. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we will begin globalizing this over the balance of the – starting in calendar
year 2015, we will bring the truly superior benefit of this product to women, as well. And so we're, you know, early
days in that whole dynamic.
Also remember that, you know when we sell an initiative which we did with FlexBall in the last quarter, there's an
inherent acceleration of sales into the quarter as we work to stock the shelves and fill the supply chain. So grooming
organic growth last quarter was 7%. If you look at it on a two quarter average basis, which I think is a more
representative way to look at it given the initiative dynamics, you know, it's in pretty good shape.

Your next question comes from the line of Connie Maneaty with BMO Capital
<Q - Constance M. Maneaty>: Good morning. How many more businesses are there in your portfolio like the one in
China that led to an almost $1 billion non-cash impairment charge?
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: As you can imagine, we do impairment testing on a routine basis. We disclosed in our last K
that there was some risk on the Duracell valuation that we had very little cushion and then the selling price that we
generated and the impacts of a decision to sell, which frankly changed some of the impairment testing criteria led to
that impairment. You will notice in our disclosures that there are no other businesses that we're disclosing a similar risk
on. That doesn't mean there will never be one, but as we sit here today, I see that as very low risk.

Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Nik H. Modi>: Yes, thanks, guys. So, Jon, I just wanted to tack on to Bill Schmitz's question regarding the
personnel changes. If you could just talk about this along two vectors, one is near term disruption and how we should
be thinking about that as you have new folks kind of getting into new roles and getting up the learning curve.
And then the second question is as you streamline P&G's decision makers and operating model, have you thought about
changing incentive structures in any way, shape, or form, just to get people focused on the right behaviors and the right
geographies and the right product categories? Thanks.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: So I'm not terribly concerned about near term disruption. I think it is a fair question, Nik, but
there are many more people continuing to do their jobs than people changing jobs. And the people that are changing
jobs are veteran, experienced pros in almost every – well, in every case. So it's something that we need to stay
deliberate and intentional on, not dropping any balls, but I'm not really that concerned about that.
Again, it's meant in no way to dismiss the question. I think it's a very fair question, but I think we are in good shape.
In terms of rewards and incentives, that's something that we are always looking at. That's something that the
Compensation Committee of the board is always looking at. I don't have a specific change to announce today. But it's
something that continues to receive the appropriate levels of attention.

<Q - Jason M. English>: Hey, good morning, folks. I would like to circle back on an earlier question on beauty,
specifically, Prestige. I don't think I heard you discuss the drivers of weakness of there and I was hopeful you could
elaborate.
And then more broadly, based on your 10-K disclosures, this has been a business with pretty inconsistent performance
in the past. And, obviously, it serves a non-core retail customer for you, so in that context, can you walk us through the
rationale or maybe the puts and takes of why it either should or shouldn't be considered in your portfolio rationalization
initiatives?
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Thanks for re-asking the question on the trends in the quarter, Jason. I appreciate that. Bill
asked such a long question, I had forgotten that part. And that's not a dig on you, Bill.
The biggest driver, frankly, is a base period dynamic, where we had a strong innovation on both Gucci and Lacoste in
the year ago quarter and there was less of that this quarter.
As you can understand, maybe not appreciate, I really don't want to spend a lot of time talking about specific
businesses and their role in the portfolio as we are going through all the changes that we are going through. We will
announce moves and decisions as they occur and we will try to be very clear as to what the rationale is. And I will

Your next question comes from the line of Javier Escalante with Consumer Edge Research
<Q - Javier Escalante>: Good morning, everyone. Jon, a question on the savings and your decision of having double
digit earnings growth in this environment, okay, currency neutral. Could you tell us how much savings you extracted
this quarter and remind us, what is the target for the year? And to what extent there is reinvestment allocated in this
double digit earnings growth target at this stage of the turnaround as my peers have been – are alluding to the very low
top line growth, the 2%, okay? Thank you.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Thank you, Javier.
In the quarter, there were about 250 basis points of savings across cost of goods and SG&A and a not insignificant
portion of that was reinvested. I talked about the investment levels that we have increased behind Tide. When we have
a strong innovation, we're going to invest behind it. We did the same on Pampers and have continued spending to drive
that business, increase consumer awareness, increase household penetration.
I also mentioned and I didn't give it a lot of time, so I understand how people could have glossed over it, but we are
being very intentional and reinvesting in two areas. One – in the SRA area. One is in R&D to bring even more
innovation to market, that's more relevant for consumers and improves their lives in an even stronger way.
And in our selling execution, ensuring that we've got sufficient channel coverage in the channels that are growing and
that matter, and ensuring that we have an appropriate level of category knowledge, and dedication. So we are not driven
– we will reinvest when there are good opportunities on which we feel we can drive a strong return.

Are you holding to category growth rate of 2% to 3% for fiscal 2015 and has there been any change in your outlook for
category growth rate in the U.S., versus emerging regions for this year? Thank you.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: Okay, so overall category growth rate was about 2.5% and that's kind of what we are expecting,
as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're basing our guidance on the current market growth rates we see which are
those.
I also mentioned that we are – I'm sorry, I might not have mentioned but we are seeing a slight uptick in growth rates in
North America, which is encouraging. We are talking here fairly modest, and as I've said on other calls, this has tended
to be choppy in the past. So it's up one quarter and down the next. We'll see, but that's a reason to have a degree of hope
there.
And in terms of, you know, where we are gaining and losing share, it – generally, we are doing about flat in North
America. We are about – we are up a little bit in Europe. We are down a little bit in a couple of the developing markets

in the quarter and yet you did very, very well in the U.S. in baby. So that would be helpful, thank you.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: First of all, the channels that you mentioned are very relevant channels and they are growing
very quickly and we have, as you can imagine, deliberate efforts to participate in that growth. Also, e-commerce is
growing very, very quickly in China. It's about 40% of the growth in the market and we are very well represented there
as well.
In terms of the difference between baby share development in the U.S. and China, first of all, we remain, by a wide
margin, the market leader in baby care in China. The competitive sets are different between China and the U.S. and as a
result, you would expect some different dynamics. But we continue to be very encouraged about the business in both
areas, and, you know, that's really what I would have to say.

Your next question comes from the line of Ali Dibadj with Bernstein.
<Q - Ali Dibadj>: Hey, guys, thanks. I wanted to get a better understanding of where you think you are versus plan in
the turnaround since A.G. came back. I think about it along dimensions at least, one is productivity, and I guess I'm
reacting a little bit to about a fifth of your productivity coming from advertising spend, basis point basis, advertising
spend this quarter. So one is advertising spend, two is the pace of divestitures. So Duracell happening here, very shortly
after you said you are going to do something. Should we expect as fast or a fast pace for larger divestitures like this?
And then third is something folks have referred to a little bit, which is, you know two, of your five segments are really
driving your growth. I want to understand within that, how much of that is kind of less sensitivity of those particular
segments to the macro environment, and how much of that is actually, you know, execution and actually innovation
and actually things you are doing? That's the core question.
I just have two follow-up clarity questions on some other things. One is: what would your growth have been in beauty
without the volumes in Prestige being an issue, and what would the growth have been without Duracell and the fabric
segment? Thank you.
<A - Jon R. Moeller>: In terms of where we are in innings, if you will, in the execution of the plan, I think we are in
some of the early innings. I think there's a significant – I know that there's a significant productivity opportunity that
still stands in front of us. We've talked about the redesign of the supply chains, we've talked about the portfolio focus
which will give us more opportunity to get even more efficient in our overhead approach. So I – you know, I think
there is – we will accelerate and will exceed the $10 billion and we won't stop there. I see this being characteristic of
our opportunities and the environment that we are operating in for the foreseeable future.
In terms of the advertising question within that, as we have tried to say many times, most of the reduction that's
occurring is in non-media spending. You know, the 50 basis points that we referenced in our prepared remarks, 40 basis
points of that was non-advertising marketing spending. So it's lower production costs, it's lower talent costs, it's more
efficient operation. It's not less advertising and reaching consumers, or in any way less effective advertising and
reaching consumers. Our objective here is to continue to strengthen the impact of our marketing and advertising efforts
while reducing costs that don't matter to consumers.
In terms of the pace of divestitures, as we said-as A.G. said in the call last quarter, and as I mentioned today, we will do
this over an 18 to 24-month period. Quite frankly, we are not going to be time driven. We are going to be value driven.
And so, it's hard for me to sit here and today and say, exactly how long it will take. But we will continue to pursue it at
pace. We'd obviously like to get there as soon as is practical, but don't want to compromise value by focusing overly on
timing versus quality of execution.
And, honestly, relative to the last part of the question, I think it's very hard to look at one quarter's of results and come
to a big conclusion about what's driving anything. So I would encourage us to kind of take those segment results over a
period of three or four quarters to get a better feel for what's going on.
