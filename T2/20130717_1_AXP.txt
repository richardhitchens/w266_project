at ir.americanexpress.com. We encourage you to review that information in conjunction with today's discussion.
Today's discussion will begin with Dan Henry, Executive Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer, who will review
some key points related to the quarter's earnings through the series of slides included with the earning documents
distributed and provide some brief summary comments.
Before I turn the discussion over to Dan, I did want to acknowledge that this will be Dan's last earnings call as our
CFO. He'll be leaving AmEx after a distinguished 23-year career, including the past six years as CFO, where he's
played an important role in building relationships with the investment community. On behalf of all of my colleagues
throughout the finance organization, I want to sincerely thank Dan for his many contributions and to wish him the best
of luck on his retirement.
I also wanted to recognize that Jeff Campbell is joining us on the call today. Jeff joined AmEx from McKesson
Corporation where he was Executive Vice President and CFO of the largest healthcare services company in the U.S.
Jeff will be assuming CFO duties in early August after we file our second quarter financial results, and we are excited
to have him as part of American Express.
With that, let me turn the discussion over to Dan.
Daniel T. Henry
Okay. Thanks, Rick. So we'll start on slide 2, the second quarter 2013 summary financial performance slide. Total
revenues came in at $8.2 billion. That's 4% higher than a year ago. On an FX adjusted basis, it's also 4%. In the four –
first quarter, the growth rates were 4% on a reported basis and 5% on an FX adjusted basis. I will speak about the
impact of cardmember reimbursements on revenue growth a little later. Net income came in at $1.4 billion, 5% higher.
EPS is $1.27, 10% higher as you can see the benefit of our share buyback program. And on the last line, you can see
that shares outstanding are declining. Return on average equity was 24% in the second quarter, without the three
adjustments in the fourth quarter of 2012 as this is a 12-month rolling calculation. ROE in the second quarter of 2013
would be 27%.
Moving to slide 3, our metric performance, billed business came in at $237 billion. That's 7% higher or 8% higher on
an FX adjusted basis. That compares to the first quarter when we grew at 6% reported and 7% FX adjusted. So this
quarter is about a 100 basis points better growth rate than the first quarter. Total cards-in-force are 104 million, that's a
growth of 4%. Proprietary cards grew 2%, which is comparable to what we've seen in recent quarters. Average basic
cardmember spending is $4,097 in the quarter. That's up about 4% and reflects the continued strong cardmember
engagement that we're seeing. Cardmember loans are $63 billion. That's an increase of 3%, 4% on an FX adjusted
basis, and reflects continued modest growth in loans.
Moving to slide 4, this is billed business growth by segment on an FX adjusted basis. So total billed business, the red
line, you can see the growth rate increased from 7% in the first quarter to 8% in the second quarter. Both ICS, which is
International Consumer, the light blue line, and GCS, Global Corporate Services, the green line, increased by about a
100 basis points. GNS, the yellow line, increased from 12% in the first quarter growth rate to 17% growth in the second
quarter, driven by continued strong growth in Japan and accelerated growth in China and Korea due to new partners
and product launches. Markets like China have high growth and are strategically important.
Moving to slide 5, so this is billed business growth by region. So the U.S., the dark blue line, growth of 7% consistent
with the first quarter. EMEA, the light blue line and LACC, the yellow line, both have increased their growth rate
compared to the first quarter. EMEA is growing at 6% and LACC at 10%. JAPA, the green line, increased from 9%
growth to 13% growth, driven by Japan, China, and Korea.
So before I leave this regional section, let me just comment on the EC draft proposal that has been in the news today.
We put out a press release earlier today based on how the preliminary report has been characterized to us, and we made
a number of points. First, the publication of the formal proposal by the commission will start a lengthy legislative
process and review period. We expect these proposals to prompt extensive debate among many market participants.

The proposals focus primarily on and cap the interchange fees charged by four-party payment systems, such as Visa
and MasterCard. The discount rate that American Express charges to merchants would not be regulated. Our
Proprietary Consumer and Corporate Card businesses are not covered by the pricing caps.
Three-party systems, such as American Express, would only be covered when they license other institutions to issue
cards, as in our Global Network Services business. GNS represents a relatively small percentage of our European
business. The provisions that focus on separating the payment network and processing functions do not appear to
impact proprietary networks like ours. Given the potential impact on consumers and competition within the European
payment sector, American Express has been in touch with senior policy makers at the commission and will continue to
represent its positions vigorously throughout the process.
Now, let me be more specific what we mean by GNS represents a relatively small percentage of our European business.
EMEA represents about a $100 billion of billed business in 2012. GNS billed business in European Union markets are
less than 15% of total EMEA billed business.
On page 110 in our annual report in footnote number 25, EMEA pre-tax income for 2012 was $505 million. GNS
European Union pre-tax income was approximately 12% of EMEA pre-tax income in 2012. So I just wanted to
dimensionalize that further for you. There are many aspects to the EC draft proposal. They will play out over time.
Some will impact us directly. Some will impact us indirectly. We are accustomed to changing business environments
and reacting to them in an appropriate manner and we will do the same in this situation.
So let me go to slide 6. So this is U.S. consumer card loans. So the bar represents U.S. Cardmember loans and they
totaled $54.6 billion in the second quarter of this year. We have a growth rate of 4% and that's the same as the past two
quarters. As I mentioned before, worldwide loans grew 3% and 4% on an FX-adjusted basis. The 4% loan growth is
driven by growth in billed business. Loan growth is about half the rate of growth in billings on our lending products.
Net interest yield, which is at the bottom of this chart, is up 10 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2012. It
is down sequentially from the first quarter of 2013, which included a reserve reversal for cardmember reimbursements
that had been set up in prior periods. As you'll see in a minute, our credit performance continues to be excellent.
But let me comment on interest rates, which have been the focus area in the industry before I move to the next slide. As
disclosed in our 10-K, a 100 basis point immediate increase in all interest rates would reduce the company's net interest
income by approximately $220 million over a one-year period. Historically, an increase in long-term rates generally has
a minimal impact on our business. However, movements in short-term rates impact earnings. The impact is primarily
driven by the fact that we fund a portion of Charge Card receivables and transacting loan balances which do not have
interest rate revenue streams with variable rate debt. However, historically in rising interest rate environments has also
coincided with strong billings and revenue growth.
So let me move to slide 7, revenue performance. But before I go do a review of the individual P&L line items, I wanted
to touch on cardmember reimbursements, which is driven by our continuing commitment to proactively review card
practices, identify any issue and remediate them quickly. In both the second quarter of 2013 and second quarter of
2012, these efforts resulted in costs that impacted year-over-year variances on some of our P&L lines. The overall cost
related to this work was similar in both the – this quarter and the second quarter of 2012. However, in the current
quarter, most of the reimbursements were recorded in revenue, reducing revenue. Therefore, the revenue growth rate in
the second quarter of this year, which was 4% on both a reported and FX adjusted basis, would have been 5% on an FX
adjusted basis excluding the impacts of the cardmember reimbursements, same as the first quarter of 2013.
A year ago, most of the costs were recorded in operating expense. The operating expense growth rate in the second
quarter this year is lower due to the reimbursement costs incurred in the prior year and I will provide more detail on
adjusted operating expense on slide 13. We've also included a reconciliation of the adjustments in Annex 9. We
continue to place a premium on self-identifying and resolving any customer-related issue and we clearly believe that
this is the right thing to do for our customers.
Now, let me go through the specific line items on slide 7. Discount revenue increased 6% reflecting 7% growth in
billed business, partially offset by a decrease in discount rate and faster growth in GNS billings than the overall

company billings growth rate. The discount rate is 2.52% in the second quarter of this year, down 2 basis points from
the second quarter of 2012, and flat with the first quarter of 2013. Net card fees increased 5% as we had higher average
fees per card due to fee increases, also due to the increase in the number of proprietary cards-in-force and a greater mix
of premium products.
Travel commission and fees decreased 5% driven by a 1% decrease in worldwide travel sales and slower – lower
supplier revenues due to the timing of certain contracts. Other commissions and fees are up 5% due to slightly higher
late fees and foreign currency conversion revenue. Other revenue is lower by 13% due to cardmember reimbursements
in the second quarter of this year, which I discussed a minute ago, as well as a benefit in the second quarter of 2012
related to a revised estimate of the liability for uncashed Travelers Cheques. The second quarter of 2013 includes a gain
of $36 million related to the sale of ICBC shares. The second quarter of 2012 had a gain of $30 million related to the
sale of ICBC shares. Net interest income increased 7% compared to the second quarter of 2012, reflecting a 3%
increase in average cardmember loans, lower funding costs on the Charge Card portfolio, and an increase in the
worldwide net interest yield to 9.1% from 9% a year ago. In the second quarter of 2013, our International Consumer
segment included the impact of some cardmember reimbursements.
Moving to slide 8, provision for losses. The Charge Card provision is $38 million or 23% higher than the second
quarter of 2012, and this reflects the fact that we have higher receivables, up about 6% year-over-year, slightly higher
write-offs, and a slightly lower reserve release which was $24 million this year compared to $32 million last year.
Cardmember loan provision increased $78 million or 31% reflecting lower reserve releases. This year, it was $25
million, and last year it was $133 million. So this is the primary driver of the higher provision expense. That was
somewhat offset by lower write-offs in the second quarter of this year, which were $348 million, and that compares to
the second quarter of 2012 when write-offs were $370 million. So provision is increasing while credit metrics remain
stable or improve slightly as we'll see on the next slide.
So slide 9 are our lending credit metrics. On the left side of the chart, you can see that we continue to have excellent
write-off rate at historically low levels of 2%. On the right side is the 30-day past due, which is also stable or slightly
improving. And again, these are historically low numbers. As I say each quarter, our objective is not to have the lowest
possible write-off rate, but to achieve the best economic gain when we invest.
Moving to slide 10, so these are our lending reserve coverage metrics and you can see that reserves as a percentage of
loans and principal months coverage are lower in the second quarter of this year compared to the first quarter of 2013
and the second quarter of 2012, as our credit metrics continue to either be stable or improving. Reserves as a percentage
of past due are slightly higher than the first quarter as delinquency rate has improved this quarter compared to the first
quarter. Our reserves in these metrics are appropriate for the risk in our portfolio.
So I'll move to slide 11, which is expense performance. So total expenses improved, or grew, rather, 1%
year-over-year. Marketing and promotion increased 2% compared to last year and represents 9.5% of revenues and I'll
cover this in more detail on the following slide. Cardmember rewards reflect higher spending volumes on co-brand and
membership reward products. The membership reward ultimate redemption rate is 94%, and that's comparable to the
ultimate redemption rate that we had in the first quarter. Cardmember services reflect enhanced benefits on our
premium card products. Total operating expense decreased 4% reflecting strong expense control, as well as
cardmember reimbursement costs in Q2 [ph] of (20:02) 2012, and I'll cover this on another slide as well. Our effective
tax rate for the second quarter of 2013 was 29.6% reflecting the resolution of certain prior-year tax items. While
discrete tax items lowered the tax rate in both the second quarter of 2013 and 2012 to be below 30%, over the past three
quarters, our tax rate has been 32% or 33% in each of those quarters.
So I'll move to slide 12, so this is marketing and promotion expense as a percentage of managed revenues. So
marketing expense in the second quarter of this year was $786 million compared to $773 million in the second quarter
of 2012. As you can see on the right side of the chart, the second quarter was 5. – 9.5% of revenues and on track to
achieve 9% growth for the year or potentially slightly higher. We continue to invest in our business despite the slow
growth economy.

Moving to slide 13, so this is operating percent – expense performance. So total operating expense is 4% lower
year-over-year. Salaries and benefit is flat year-over-year and this reflects some of the benefits from the restructuring
that we announced in January. Employee count is 1,300 lower than in the second quarter of 2012. Employee count in
the first quarter decreased 1,100 compared to year end 2012, but ticked up slightly by 200 in the second quarter. We
estimate employee count at year-end 2013 will be 4% to 6% lower than at year-end 2012. Professional services
increased reflecting higher technology development, and other net decreased 48% reflecting $89 million more in
cardmember reimbursements in the second quarter of 2012 compared to the second quarter of 2013, and you can see
this on Annex 9. The second quarter of 2012 also included an asset impairment. The second quarter of this year
includes a Canadian value-added tax benefit that lowered other net expenses.
So moving to slide 14, so this chart shows the adjusted operating expense growth over the past three years. In 2013 and
2012, our target is to grow operating expense at less than 3% each year. You can see the first quarter grew at 1%, and
while the second quarter decreased 4%, after adjusting for the cardmember reimbursements I just discussed, the second
quarter of 2013 would have been a reduction in year-over-year expense of 1%. So we were on track to achieve our
target of less than 3% annual growth in operating expense for this year.
Moving to slide 15, so this is adjusted expense as a percentage of managed revenue, and this excludes credit provision.
In 2012, we committed to migrate this ratio over time back towards historical levels in two ways. First, through revenue
growth; and second, controlling operating expense while continuing to invest in the business. In 2012 and the fourth
quarter of 2012, in those bars the dotted line is excluding the restructuring charge and cardmember reimbursements that
we had in the fourth quarter of 2012. As you can see on the chart, we are making substantial progress in reducing
adjusted expense as a percentage of managed revenue. While both the first quarter and the second quarter of 2013
round to 69%, the second quarter's ratio is actually slightly lower than the first quarter if you carry it out one more
decimal point.
Slide 16, so these are our capital ratios. In the second quarter of 2013, our Tier 1 common ratio is 12.5%. In the quarter,
we generated $1.7 billion of capital, $1.4 billion from net income, and $300 million from employee plans. We also
distributed $1.7 billion in capital, $1.4 billion through share buybacks, and $300 million in dividends. Risk weighted
assets increased slightly due to higher receivables. The Basel III implementation from Basel I would have reduced Tier
1 common by 30 basis points, but I would remind you that we have not yet implemented Basel III advanced approach.
So there has been much conversation about the new supplemental leverage calculation. So the leverage calculation,
Tier 1 leverage calculation, for us as you can see on the chart is 10.5%. If we did the calculation in the second quarter
on a leverage supplementary level basis, it would be 8.8%, well above the required level of 3%. So our Tier 1 common
ratio and leverage ratio provides the company with a strong capital position.
So moving to slide 17, so this is our payout ratio, so our share repurchases are governed by our performance and our
CCAR submission in January 2013. Our plan for 2013 is to repurchase $4 billion. The $1.4 billion in repurchases in the
second quarter is consistent with our CCAR submission in January.
Moving to slide 18, so this is our U.S. retail deposit balances. So the U.S. retail deposit activity in the quarter, you can
see, decreased slightly. Our overall funding strategy is to utilize unsecured securitizations and deposits. In the second
quarter, we issued $2 billion of unsecured debt. Therefore, we did not need to increase deposits. Therefore, our – we
decreased deposits slightly. However, within deposits, we continued to grow direct deposits by $1.2 billion to $23.1
billion while third-party CDs and sweeps decreased slightly. On the liquidity front, we continue to hold excess cash and
marketable securities to meet our next 12 months of funding maturities. As of June 30, we had $15.4 billion in excess
cash compared to funding maturities of $14.4 billion over the next 12 months, thereby meeting our objective.
So with that, let me conclude with a few final comments. We continue to feel positive about our performance,
especially given the relatively slow growth in the economic environment. In the quarter, our spending growth continued
to be healthy and was relatively consistent with the past several quarters. In addition, we did see some improvement in
our growth rate internationally. We also saw our average loans continue to grow modestly year-over-year and outpace
the industry. Loan growth and slightly lower funding costs led to a 7% increase in net interest income. At the same
time, lending losses – loss rates remain near all-time lows. Revenue growth was 4%. We continued to consistently

grow revenues despite the slow growth environment, and in this quarter, the negative impact of cardmember
reimbursements. In the quarter, operating expense decreased by 4% versus prior year, reflecting strong expense control,
as well as higher cardmember reimbursement costs in the prior year.
We are clearly off to an excellent start with our aim of having operating expense growth at an annual rate of less than
3% over the next two years. We are also continuing to invest in the business as marketing and promotion and
technology development spending both increased versus prior years. These investments are driving higher average
spend and growth in our cardmember base, while continuing to build capabilities for the future.
Second quarter EPS of $1.27 represents an all-time high, but did benefit from a lower tax rate than recent quarters. EPS
growth rate of 10% outpaced revenue growth reflecting the progress we have made on improving operating leverage
and our strong capital position. We continued to return significant capital to shareholders in the quarter through
dividends and buybacks while maintaining strong capital ratios. We recognized that our business is not immune to the
economic environment, but we continue to believe that the flexibility of our business model enables us to deliver
significant value to our shareholders even in a slow growth environment.
So with that, let me turn it over to Jeff Campbell for a few remarks.
Jeffrey C. Campbell
Well, thank you, Dan, and good afternoon, everyone.
I am excited to have joined American Express this week and I'll look forward in the coming months to spending time
with many of you on the call and to continuing the strong legacy of performance that Dan's leadership has helped create
here at American Express.
So with that, Rick?
Richard Petrino
Thanks, Jeff.
Okay. So we're going to start the Q&A. Just before we kick it off, I do want to ask everybody as a courtesy to all those
who do want to ask a question that we strongly encourage you to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, so
we can get as many folks on the call as possible. And with that, let's open up the lines for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Okay, certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Craig Maurer of CLSA. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Craig J. Maurer>: Yeah. Good afternoon. Dan, first let me congratulate you on your ride off into the sunset. It's
been a pleasure.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Okay. Thank you.
<Q - Craig J. Maurer>: A question regarding the GNS business in Europe and the 12% of the $505 million you
discussed. I'm not sure – I don't think any of us know, in terms of the breakdown of GNS revenue, is there any
component of that that would be susceptible to the cap that they're placing on interchange? Or is that strictly network
and acquiring fees? Or is there some level of interchange split with the issuer? And as a follow-up, is there any
guidance going forward on cardmember reimbursements that we can think about in terms of suppression of revenue or

help on expenses? Thanks.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: So the draft is not even out yet, so getting very specific in terms of answering all of the
elements of your question is really not possible. I think the main point that we wanted to make is that the cap relates to
four-party systems and from our understanding does not relate to three-party systems, which is our system. Therefore,
our proprietary business, the Proprietary Consumer business and Corporate Card business is not impacted. However, in
our GNS business, we think the cap will apply. As a result of that, we'll have an impact directly on that business.
Exactly how it's going to play out will depend on exactly what the draft says and the debate that will take place
between now and the time that the final rules are issued, which will be several quarters in the future. So it's hard to be
more specific at this point. And it is our intent once we have a chance to read the draft to touch on this topic at the
Financial Community Meeting which will take place on August, the 8th.
In terms of cardmember reimbursements, as we identify items, we look for root causes and if there's a need for us to
modify our procedures going forward, we do that. And if it's appropriate to have reimbursements to customers, we do
that as well. As I said in the second quarter of last year and this year, the numbers at similar level. It has varied from
quarter to quarter in terms of how much it is. Forecasting what might happen in the future is difficult, because certainly
anything we know about, we have addressed at this juncture. But certainly in the course of our work of reviewing our
policies and our practices, it's potential we could identify other items. And if they do, we will remediate those and if
appropriate, have reimbursements but there's really no way to forecast what that might be.
Operator
Okay. And the next question is from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Please go ahead.
<Q - Sanjay Sakhrani>: Thank you. Good evening and congrats, Dan. Two questions, one on Europe. I was just
hoping if you could just talk about how you would deal with the competitive pressure of lower rates from Visa and
MasterCard when domestic interchange rates go down and kind of how you would offset any potential impacts to the
extent that you had to take your pricing down. And also I just wanted to get a sense of how much of your volume is
commercial as well. And then just second, that Canadian VAT benefit you mentioned, I just want to know how much
that was. Thank you.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Okay. So certainly as I said, there's going to be a direct impact as it relates to GNS and the
business we do with GNS partners. And then there'll be an indirect impact, but that's something again that will be very
dependent on what the final rules actually say and how we need to react in the marketplace. Certainly, we have faced
these types of challenges in other markets and I think we have reacted in a way that's been beneficial in terms of our
overall business. But it's hard to really specifically say what's going to happen because we don't even know what the
draft rules are exactly nor what the final rules what will be, or what will take place in the marketplace. This is
something that I think will play out honestly not only over a couple quarters but likely over a couple of years but we
will be very thoughtful about how we approach that.
In terms of the commercial piece of the European business, that's not a disclosure that we've historically made at this
juncture. I thought the most useful information was to actually share what percentage the GNS billings were of the total
billings in Europe. So hopefully that was helpful. Canadian benefit kind of falls in this category of an amount we felt
was large enough that we should mention but not large enough to give the dollar amount, which has kind of been our
practice on a fair number of items like this, but to let you know that there is something in there that is affecting the line
item and therefore the growth rate.

<Q - William Carcache>: Thanks. Good evening and, Dan, I'll also add my congratulations and it's been a pleasure
working with you. I had a follow-up question on the comments that you made. You made it clear that the proprietary
business is not covered by the proposed caps. Does that suggest that you will be able to generate premium economics
and be able to offer greater rewards and therefore greater value for your customers? And I guess the logical thought
process then, does that put you in a position where you can experience similar results to what you saw in Australia?
And I have a follow-up.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Yeah. So I mean currently we have a premium position, right, and that's what enables us to
provide the value in our products that we provide to our customers. And certainly initially, the gap between what our
discount rates are and the cap will probably widen that gap somewhat, but realistically we'll have to react to a [ph]
second place (38:07) in the marketplace. I don't want to analogize this exactly to Australia, because every market is
different, but what we did in Australia, I think, demonstrates the fact that we are – have a flexible business model and
are thoughtful in terms of how we do react when the environment changes.
<Q - William Carcache>: Okay. And to address some of the concerns that are out there around regulators focusing on
the three-party system, can you just talk – your comments today were very helpful in the release and what you've said
so far in the call, but can you just give us, I guess, more broadly perspective on whether you've ever heard of any
regulator – you've had any experience with any regulator anywhere around the world really talk about bifurcating the
negotiated merchant discount rate in your proprietary business with the goal of regulating it? I think that's kind of
where some people were going and it just seems – I remember from past meetings that we've had with your head of
Global Merchant Services that it seemed pretty clear that regulators around the world kind of get that your model's
different because your rates are negotiated. I wonder if that's still a fair or reasonable way of thinking about it, if you
can just comment on that. Thank you.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: So as you said, we negotiate our rates with the merchants around the world. Certainly, in
Australia that regulation didn't address our rates specifically. It dealt with four party systems. And our understanding of
this draft as it's characterized to us, we don't believe addresses three party systems such as ours. So that seems to be the
course of action. It happens historically and our understanding of what's taking place, what may happen elsewhere,
only time will tell but that has been the focus historically when it's come to a change in regulation.
Operator
Okay. The next question comes from the line of Brian Foran of Autonomous. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brian D Foran>: And I guess maybe switching gears to capital, if Basel III rules firm up, two things. One, is
there any reason to think that the advanced approach would be a meaningful change from the 12.2% Basel III, you kind
of implied by the 30 basis point hit? And is there any reason to think the liquidity coverage ratio is a hurdle that would
be an issue in terms of the way you manage the excess liquidity?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: So capital – the 30 basis points is when we go from Basel I over to Basel III, kind of skipping
the Basel II piece, right? It's hard for me to say what the impact will be until we actually complete the work on the
advanced Basel III methodology. It requires the gathering of an enormous amount of information that we have to
process from systems. That work is actually underway currently. We actually have scheduled [ph] to enter parallel on
(41:23) in the beginning of 2014. At that juncture, we'll have a better sense of what the impact would be on capital
ratios. So I don't have an estimate for you at this juncture.
In terms of the liquidity rules, I guess, we don't have final liquidity rules at this point; although, from what we
understand so far, we think we have a strong liquidity position and don't – at this moment based on our understanding
think that the new ratios that will phase in over time would have a substantial impact on us. So therefore, I would say
wouldn't necessarily have an impact on kind of how we think about liquidity at the moment.
<Q - Brian D Foran>: One follow-up, I guess, on the other expense, all the dimensions you gave are very helpful, but
if I just think about it simplistically, I mean is the $219 million kind of a good run rate for that number, or is it better to

think about since the Visa and MasterCard benefit rolled off and excluding the quarters where you've had the big
reimbursements, it's tended to be more in the kind of $260 million to $270 million range?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Well, it's – the $219 million, as I said, includes the Canadian item. So I don't know that I'd use
that number. In the third quarter – so in the first quarter of this year, we didn't have any items that were spiked out and
it was $246 million.

Okay. And next question comes from the line of Rick Shane of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Richard B. Shane>: Hey, thank you, guys, for taking my questions and, Dan, I will miss these conversations and
wish you all the best.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Thank you.
<Q - Richard B. Shane>: I'd love to talk a little bit about the nuance of your conversations with the regulators. We're
in a situation now where it appears that the press have seen the documents and what you guys have indicated is you've
had conversations. It doesn't sound, per se, like you've actually seen the draft at this point. You guys are very deliberate
in your communications, you're very cautious and you come out with a strong interpretation of how this is going to play
out for you guys. I'd love to understand what the dialogue was like when it started and make sure that we understand
the subtlety of this because it is pretty significant as you can see from how the stock traded around all this today.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Yep. I understand that. And we're not necessarily intimating that the conversations of the
people who have characterized this to us are the regulators, right? So it is based on our understanding previously to this
leak of this draft where we would come out and based on the characterizations of those people who have seen the draft
and discussed it with us, our sense is that it's not notably different than what we had been thinking about before.
However, when we – yeah, when we actually see the draft and get a chance to read it and digest it, then we'll all even
be in a better position. But as you indicated, there was certainly notable discussion in the press and activity in our stock,
and so we wanted a press release that shared our understanding of where we are, even though we haven't read the
complete document. So that's the state of play at the moment. After it's issued on the 24th, we'll read it, and if there's
anything, any refinements we can make, we'll do that at the Financial Community Meeting on August the 8th.
<Q - Richard B. Shane>: Great. I guess we'll look forward to reading it at the same time you guys do. Thanks, guys.

<Q - Kenneth Bruce>: Thank you. Good evening, gentlemen. And, Dan, I wish you good fortune in your retirement.
So thank you very much for the help over the years. My question, I'll steer around Europe for the moment. Yeah,
looking at the average cardmember spend, that has been decelerating really for the last several quarters, and that has
always been one of the metrics that you all have really focused on in terms of the health of the business, and obviously
there's been a change in strategy or at least there's been some additional products that may be impacting these numbers.
But I guess what I'd like to understand is or get some response from you is how you are seeing the deceleration in the
average cardmember spend growth? What the – what ultimately will turn that, as if it's just purely the weak economy
strengthening? Or if there's something specifically within your strategy set that will drive that? Or if you expect that to
be less going forward just given the nature of where you're adding new cards and the like?

<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Yeah. So I think historically, our growth in billed business has come from both a combination
of a growth in cards-in-force as well as a growth in average spend. The growth in average spend comes from really two
things in recent history. That is just greater engagement on the part of our current customers who are spending at higher
levels, but it's also coming from our premium strategy. So we're bringing on higher spending customers compared to
what we were doing several years ago and I think that shift to a more premium mix is influencing as well. However,
let's face it, the broad economy has an impact here as well and certainly just consumer confidence is a factor in terms of
how much people spend. Now, that's been shifting a little bit recently. Certainly things like housing prices firming, the
stock market doing better are all things that can influence that.
But as we've talked about a fair number of times, there's a pretty good correlation between billed business for us and
GDP. And I think the average cardmember spend numbers we see now are being impacted by the fact that GDP is
below the average rate that we've seen over the last 10 years. And if history is any barometer, if GDP picks up, you
would think it would have a positive impact on average spend. But it's obviously also totally contingent on us having
the best value propositions in the marketplace and providing the best service, and that's what we're focused on. So it's
hard to spike out exactly how each of those things impact average spend, but certainly the general slow growth in the
economy, I think, is a factor here.
<Q - Kenneth Bruce>: Okay. Thank you. And just on a clarification or maybe just if you could provide some sense as
to what the differences are in the cardmember reimbursements that will either determine whether it's a revenue item or
an expense, can you give us some examples as to what caused that change, please?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Yeah. So we think it's each item – so it's not one item in each quarter. It's a number of items in
each quarter. So it's – and each item is unique. So each quarter we evaluate the items that are in front of us and make a
judgment based on our view at that quarter of how it should be categorized. So you can have different types of items in
different quarters. That's really the thing that is the primary driver.
<Q - Kenneth Bruce>: Okay. Thank you and best of luck.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Thank you.
Operator
Okay. And the next question is from the line of Ryan Nash of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Hey, thanks. Just as a follow-up on Ken's question related to spend growth, outside of the
acceleration we saw in GNS from new business wins, do you think particularly here in the U.S., do you think the
current run rates are a good proxy for what we should see for spend over the next few quarters? Should we expect it to
remain stable? Or just given the fact that we are seeing improvement from the wealth effect, whether it's higher home
prices and higher markets, should we start seeing that manifesting into higher spend?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: So as you know me, I don't want to forecast here. I guess, one of the factors is the grow overs
later in the year are a little – are not as steep as they were early in the year. But clearly I think where the economy goes
and consumer confidence will also be significant factors about whether it accelerates from here or not.
<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Okay. And then just a question on expenses, so you're at 69% as a percentage of managed
revenues and I know you talked about migrating towards 67% over time. So I guess should we expect to stay at these
levels in the near term? And if revenue growth does start to accelerate, then we could see a pickup in expenses from
here?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Right. So I – we say we want to migrate back towards historical levels, okay? We happen to
have 2007 on there which is 67% but we want to migrate back to historical levels. If we are successful and it's our plan
to be successful of growing operating expense at less than 3%, that's going to create leverage and should enable us to
continue to improve that number over the next 18 months.

<Q - Ryan M. Nash>: Great. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Next question, it's from the line of Don Fandetti of Citigroup. Please go ahead
<Q - Donald Fandetti>: Hi, Dan. Just a conceptual question. I was looking back at your merchant discount rate. It's
down a couple basis points over the last two and a half years, and you just had very strong GNS growth, which I would
think would naturally bring that down more. And so I guess my question is do you really have any sort of core change
in your merchant discount rate? And should we think about that as more flattish going forward ex a mix?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Okay. So first, GNS is not in the discount rate calculation. It's really a calculation based on
our proprietary business. So that's not in there. So we have said is in the absence of increasing price anywhere, because
of our strategy to drive further into every day spend categories, in the normal course we would expect the discount rate
to drop by two or three basis points a year. We, in fact, have not seen that over the last several years as there have been
opportunities where we are bringing greater value to merchants and have actually been able to increase price in certain
situations so that the drop in discount rate has been probably more in the 1% or 2% level over the past several years. So
if we can drive sufficient volume by moving into new categories and driving volumes up, then you would – I would
expect to see some drop in discount rate as we go forward. But that's very much on strategy for what we want to
accomplish over the long-term.
<Q - Donald Fandetti>: Okay. And then quickly, any updates on Bluebird in terms of transactions or fees?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: So I think we're going to do some updates of the data that we shared at the FCM in February –
at the August FCM, so we'll update that information on August, the 8th.
<Q - Donald Fandetti>: Okay. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of James Friedman of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.
<Q - James Friedman>: Hi, thanks and let me echo the congratulations. Wanted to ask about cards-in-force, Dan. It
was one of the faster growing numbers in the past year, up $1.2 million. I guess a question in two parts. One is, should
that continue to be the emphasis going forward in terms of driving billed business? And two, it looked like about
$700,000 of that $1.2 million came from GNS. Should we anticipate going forward that GNS will be the driver of
cards-in-force? It sounded like in your introductory comments it suggests that some of that growth may have come
from China. Is that a correct interpretation?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: So cards-in-force number, which is 4%, was 2% on proprietary cards, so that's pretty
consistent. We've kind of been at the 2%, 3% growth rate over the last five or six quarters. So the growth rate there is
very consistent with the last few quarters. The growth rate in GNS cards, at 7%, is somewhat lower than what we've
seen over the last several quarters. It had been kind of in the low-single digits, right? So the lower growth rate is driven
by fewer GNS cards being out there. So the growth in our business is going to come, as I said before, from both higher
average spend as well as higher number of cards, and the fact that cards are growing at 2% or 3% compared to maybe
proprietary cards compared to higher levels historically is due to the change in strategy when we're focused on
premium cards as opposed to just bringing cards in.
In terms of, is new cards in China part of what drove the strong performance in GNS and in JAPA? The answer to that
is, yes, right? So both in China and Korea, we've had some new partners signed and some new product launches in
those countries both by new partners and existing partners. So that is part of what's driving the GNS and JAPA growth
rates that we see.

<Q - James Friedman>: Hi. And just as a follow-up, housekeeping, so Bluebird's not included in that cards-in-force
number I presume, I imagine that's a pretty big number? But ...
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: It's not included in cards-in-force, no.
<Q - James Friedman>: Okay. Okay. And at some point, will you start to decompose the cards-in-force at that level?
Thank you.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: So I mean currently we share information in terms of what the GNS piece is. I think we can
do some geographic splits for you. No? Sorry. So even though I don't know whether we're going to give more detail on
that, it wasn't in our thinking. But certainly as we move forward, we'll provide information as it relates to new products
like Bluebird where we think it's appropriate.
Operator
Okay. Thank you. And the next question is from the line of Mark DeVries of Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mark C. DeVries>: Yeah, thanks. Dan, I was hoping you could provide a little more color on what we can expect
on that GNS growth in Asia you referenced? Is it realistic to think that at least for the next three quarters, you've got
some fairly positive year-over-year comp on that? Should we continue to expect to see that kind of robust mid-high
teens billed business growth from Asia?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: So I don't want to forecast, but in China, it's an important market for us and we're focused on
the partners that we have and the product launches that will take place. So my sense is that'll be a good growth market,
but I don't want to forecast exactly where GNS growth is going to be over the next couple quarters. And also
potentially it will be impacted by the economy in China. But right now, our growth rates are being driven there by new
partner signings and new product launches.
<Q - Mark C. DeVries>: Okay, got it. And then just a follow-up, with marketing and promotion expense kind of
leveling off here on a year-over-year basis, is it reasonable to expect to continue to see kind of the 4% to 5%
cards-in-force growth that you've had over the last year or so?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Well, we have come up with this 9% number out there, and I don't want it to be a target or a
guideline. But I think it's recognition of the fact that on an annual basis – we have fluctuations from quarter to quarter.
On an annual basis, we need to increase investments at the rate that we're growing the business if we're going to
continue to have the type of business momentum that we want. So my view is we are very committed to investing in
the growth of the business. You have seen us do that historically and we will continue to do that. So our view is we
want to make sure that there are sufficient investment dollars to sustain the business momentum as we go forward.
Certainly, the whole focus on reengineering that we announced in the – in January is designed to grow operating
expense at a slower rate so that it provides additional resources for investment in the growth of the business.
<Q - Mark C. DeVries>: Got it. Thanks. Best of luck to you, Dan.

<Q - Chris C. Brendler>: Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. A quick follow-up on the cards-in-force. It's my understanding
that you had some minor annual fee increases in some of your proprietary products this year and so you sort of see that
in the net cards-in-force. Is there any price sensitivity across your portfolio? I guess [indiscernible] (59:46) but is it
significant? Is that a contributing factor? And is that something you continue to squeeze higher over the years given the

strength of your products and the consumers' attraction and loyalty to your products?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: As you said, it was selected price increases on certain products. We never try to squeeze out
higher fees. We don't want to increase fees without improving the value proposition for customers. So our practice has
been where we increase fees to also have elements that increase the value proposition to our customers and we've been
very successful at that. And when we have had fee increases, we have not seen notable attrition as a result of that. But
it's all tied into. We're delivering value, we've increased the value, part of the increase in the fee invariably a portion
goes to the bottom line but a portion goes back into increasing the value to cardmembers. That has been our strategy
and I think it will be our strategy going forward.
<Q - Chris C. Brendler>: Okay, great. And then my follow-up question, enterprise growth and initiatives there, the $3
billion target, I guess, is it possible with your Bluebird update for the community meeting in early August? We also
need an update there. I'm just curious as to the investments you've made over the last several years, Serve, in particular,
are we starting to see any meaningful contribution from those new initiatives yet? Any color there would be helpful.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Yeah, so we set a $3 billion target a couple of years ago to exit 2014 at that rate. Certainly
when we set that target, we didn't necessarily contemplate the economy being as slow as it has been over that period.
That number as we disclosed last year was $1.5 billion, so we have a lot of work to do between now and then but we
continue to think that it's an appropriate target for us to aim for. I don't anticipate us updating that other than to the
update that I just gave now.
<Q - Chris C. Brendler>: What about Serve?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: So I think one of the topics – the top – one of the topics at the meeting will be Dan Schulman,
and he'll talk about what's taking place both in Serve as well as Bluebird in particular.
<Q - Chris C. Brendler>: Excellent. Congratulations, Dan. Thanks a lot.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Okay. So we'll just take one more question.
Operator
Okay. And our final question then comes from the line of Brad Ball of Evercore. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brad G. Ball>: Thanks and congratulations, Dan, and good luck in your future endeavors.
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: Thank you.
<Q - Brad G. Ball>: I wonder if you can give us a sense for the progression of billings over the course of the quarter
month-to-month. Was it stronger late in the quarter, and would you give us an update for July to date?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: So the earnings growth over the month-by-month was relatively consistent. There was no
sharp upward trend or downward trend. I would say it's relatively consistent. And we don't really plan to give an update
about what has taken place in July. When you tend to give – a quarter is a short period of time. We try to do it for a
couple weeks. We've found it's not necessarily indicative of what's going to happen for the quarter. But within the
quarter month-by-month, it was relatively consistent.
<Q - Brad G. Ball>: Okay. Fair enough. And then one follow-up on the EC proposal. You said in your press release
earlier today that separating the payment network and processing functions did not appear to impact proprietary
networks like AmEx's. Could you explain what you mean by that? And what's the basis for making that statement?
<A - Daniel T. Henry>: So I'm not going to say I'm an expert here. But I think there are – is some language in there
about whether you need to split the merchant processor and the merchant acquirer, I guess, that – and the network. In
that case – in our case, we do all those functions. So it doesn't appear to us that that would be applicable in our
situation. But again, once we get a chance to read the draft, we can address that more specifically.
