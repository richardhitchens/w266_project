Frederick Wallace Smith
Thank you, Mickey. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our discussion of operating and financial results for the
first quarter of fiscal 2014. FedEx had a good quarter despite higher fuel costs and one fewer operating day. Growth in
overall customer demand for our wide range of global transportation solutions drove improved earnings.
FedEx Ground reported another outstanding quarter, as average daily volume grew 11%. FedEx Express is skillfully
executing its profit improvement plans. As part of this, earlier this month, FedEx Express took delivery of its first new
Boeing 767-300 freighter, which uses about 30% less fuel and offers at least a 20% operating cost over the MD-10 it
replaces. We're reaffirming our forecast for full year's earnings per share growth of 7% to 13% over FY 2013's adjusted
results. We believe FedEx is well-positioned for continued growth and success as customers around the world realize
the full value of our portfolio of solutions.
Now I'll turn the call over to Mike Glenn for his views on the economy and then to Alan Graf for details on the
financial results. Mike?
T. Michael Glenn
Thank you, Fred. The FedEx economic forecast calls for continued moderate growth in the global economy. Our U.S.
GDP growth forecast is 1.6% for calendar year 2013, which is down four tenths of a point versus last quarter and 2.5%
for calendar 2014, which represents no change versus the last quarter. For industrial production, we expect growth of
2.4% in calendar 2013, again down four tenths of a point versus last quarter, and 3.4% in calendar 2014, which is down
one tenth of a point versus last quarter. It's important to note that historical data revisions account for most of the
reduction in the calendar year 2013 growth rates.

Policy risk remained high, but there're signs of improvement in Europe and China. Our global GDP growth forecast is
2% for calendar 2013, down three tenths of a point versus last quarter and 2.9% for calendar 2014, down one tenth of a
point versus last quarter.
Turning to yield per package in the domestic Express segment, excluding the impact of fuel, year-over-year package
yield increased 2.7%. The increase was primarily driven by rate and discount improvements, followed by increased
weight per package and product mix.
The Ground package yield increased 2.2%, excluding the impact of fuel. The year-over-year increase was driven by
rate and discount improvements, an increase in extra services charges and product mix.
In the international Express segment export, excluding fuel, international export Express package yield declined 2.1%
year-over-year due to changes to rate and discount and weight.
And finally in the Freight segment, or the LTL segment, excluding the impact of fuel, yield per hundredweight
increased 1.1% year-over-year. The increase was primarily driven by rate and discount changes and shipment class.
Now I'll turn it over to Alan Graf.
Alan B. Graf
Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. We had a good quarter. Revenues and earnings increased, driven by
the solid performances in all of our transportation segments. Operating income grew 7% year-over-year, primarily from
improved profitability at Express, higher volumes and increased yields at Ground, and improved performance at
Freight. Our margin improved 30 basis points versus last year to 7.2%, despite significant headwinds from the fuel
surcharge timing lag, as well as one fewer operating day.
Offsetting those headwinds for the quarter were benefits from lower aircraft maintenance and salaries and wages
expense. For Express, quarter one operating income grew 14% and operating margin improved 50 basis points
year-over-year, despite the significant negative impact of net fuel and one fewer operating day. The improvement was
driven by stronger U.S.-based business performance, lower pension expense and the continued modernization of the
company's aircraft fleet, which helped to drive maintenance costs lower. These were partially offset by higher related
depreciation expense.
Turning to Ground, operating income grew 5% year-over-year despite the negative impact of fuel. Higher network
expansion costs were also incurred as we continue to invest heavily in the growing Ground and SmartPost businesses at
very high ROIC. The improvement in Ground was driven by higher volumes despite one fewer operating day and
higher revenue per package.
Freight's operating income increased slightly, despite one fewer operating day year-over-year. Higher weight per
shipment, LTL yields and average daily LTL shipments improved income at Freight. Freight continued to optimize the
line-haul network by increasing utilization of lower cost rail over the quarter, now at 17% of total line-haul miles.
As for the outlook, based on the economic conditions that Mike talked about, we reaffirm our FY 2014 earnings per
share growth of 7% to 13% from the FY 2013 adjusted results. Our outlook depends on stable fuel prices. Fuel price
volatility impacts the timing of our fuel surcharge levels in relation to fuel expense and ultimately demand for our
services.
As part of our profit improvement program, we are continuing to evaluate further cost reduction actions to continue to
improve our results at Express and to ensure that we achieve our $1.6 billion profit improvement goal at Express by the
end of FY 2016.
With regard to the voluntary buyout program, as of August 31, approximately 45% of the 3,600 employees that
accepted the voluntary buyout have vacated their positions. The additional 55% will depart throughout the remainder of
FY 2014 with approximately 25% remaining until May 31, 2014. Total SG&A savings from our profit improvement

Now we'll open up the call for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we we'll take our first question from Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Hey. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask about the capacity side in the international
Express business. Obviously, margins are a lot better than expected on the Express side this quarter and I know that's
due to a lot of what you've got going on the domestic side as well. But I wanted to dig in and see how the progress has
been going in terms of the third-party line haul initiative and where you guys are at in terms of frequencies on export
flights out of Asia.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Thanks, Justin. This is Dave Bronczek. You're right. We adjusted for the second quarter in
a row now, last quarter in April and this quarter in July. We reduced some of our global capacity coming out of Asia,
which you saw in some of our numbers in terms of fuel usage and fuel in general. That being said, our International
Economy volume continues to grow at a rapid rate. It was up 15%. I think it's been in the teens now for several quarters
in a row, so we're actually putting those packages in that network into the right system form now that is actually
benefiting us across the world. Thank you for the question.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Dave Ross with Stifel Investments.
<Q - Bruce Chan>: Hi. Good morning, gentlemen. It's actually Bruce Chan on for David Ross. I'm just curious on the
Trade Network side, we've heard from some of the other forwarders out there that trans-Pac volumes have been kind of
blah with soft summer volumes and limited optimism for 2014. I'm wondering if your outlook is the same or if you're
expecting something a little bit rosier? And if rosier, is that because you're taking share whether price related or product
offering related? Thank you.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Thank you very much. This is Dave again. We're toggling our traffic back and forth
between Express and FTN, so FTN is performing very well. I think the volumes are slightly higher, the yields a little bit
weaker. I think that's the case across the world, but it's performing exactly like we had planned it to. So, our FTN
organization is doing a terrific job, a great service and moving the lower yielding International Economy into their
network.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Hartford from Baird.
<Q - Benjamin John Hartford>: Good morning. I guess if we could just tie that all together, could you give us a
sense, Dave, maybe where you believe the network is in relation to needing to divert lower-yielding Freight off of your
aircraft into third-party capacity? Do you feel like that you've gotten out in front of this trade-down phenomenon that's
been discussed a lot? Do you still feel like that there's incremental progress to be made in terms of putting the
lower-yielding packages on to the appropriate modes? Can you provide some perspective there?
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Yeah, it's a great question. We feel very good about where we are. We have not affected
service whatsoever. We have the world-class service around the globe. We've adjusted the capacity moving the right
traffic in the right network. We have more upside opportunity to keep growing our International Economy more

financially favorably now, whereas in the past we used to cap that traffic. So we have a great network now for
International Priority all around the world. We have more upside there. We have more upside at International Economy
as well. It's been a terrific shift for us to match what's happening in the global economy.
Operator
Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Christian Wetherbee with Citi.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Good morning. [ph] I'm standing in for (14:15) Chris. My question pertains to Ground
margins. I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of some of the individual headwinds that you faced during the
quarter, the higher network expansion costs, fuel surcharge and one less operating day and what those effects were on
margin.
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Yeah, hi. This is Henry Maier. Virtually all of the year-over-year change in margin was due to
fuel, and as Alan pointed out, op income was impacted by fuel and one less operating day. Network expansion costs at
this point in time are really for capacity and part of our anticipation of peak build-up.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey. Thanks. Morning, guys. So, Alan, a question for you on the SG&A, I think you
mentioned you're now expecting $600 million of savings. I just want to make sure I'm understanding it right, but is that
comparable with the $500 million you initially laid out at the Analyst Day over a year ago? And then can we get some
color on when we should expect to see that. Just when I look at labor savings this quarter and I back out pension, we
don't really see any signs of the head count reductions and is that a timing issue or are there any offsets there we should
think about? Thank you.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: All right, Scott. You asked several questions in there. So let me do my best. First on the tactical
one. We made acquisitions last year that are year-over-year and so you're seeing some of that – on your last question
that's what you're seeing there. Yes, the $600 million is comparable to the $500 million. We are actually well ahead of
our cost goals that we outlined 11 months ago, and I feel very comfortable about where we are on the cost side and
we'll continue to work that hard. We have great productivity improvement programs going on in other places as well,
aside from labor, notably AOD productivity, and you're seeing that in our maintenance expense at Express. We have
some additional opportunities in strategic sourcing that we're going to be tackling that I think are going to help us reach
our goal.
Now having said that, to your strategic question, the world looks a lot different today than it did 11 months ago when
we gave you the very specific five buckets about how we were going to improve at Express. So, after you listen to what
Mike said about 2013 and 2014's economic outlook, I think that we're going to have a little bit more pressure on base
erosion at Express that we got to, as Dave talked, match lift to load, if you will. So, we're aggressively doing that. That
may mean that we may have to get to the $1.6 billion a little bit differently than what we described to you, and it may
mean that we will be more back-end loaded towards the second half of 2015 and 2016 as we start really driving the
leverage of the things that we're doing. But we're committed to the $1.6 billion and we'll have that by the end of FY
2016, and I feel comfortable by saying that in today's environment.
Operator
Thank you. We'll now take our next question from Ken Hoexter with Bank of America.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Great. Good morning. Just following on the International side, I just wanted to understand
on the trade-down effect, are you taking further steps and to Alan's point there, are you now looking at to get some of

those cost savings internationally? I think you talked originally maybe moving some of these cost programs into the
International bucket and have you started to look at that on the cost side?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Well, Ken, I thank you for the question because, again, I want to stress that, as a strategy from
FedEx Corporation, we are embracing International Economy and we like these growth rates, and we believe very
strongly that we can make the shift that the customers are making, while still growing the premium service at IP. It'll
just be at a slower growth rate than we had anticipated 11 months ago, but the IE network is coming into place very
nicely and we're going to continue to work on that, and I feel pretty comfortable that we'll make this strategic change.
I'll let Dave give you some more detail.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Yeah. That's right, Alan. You saw in the numbers our flight hours were down significantly
and our fuel usage was down significantly and that's on our own backbone network. And as we expand our
International Economy traffic into other networks, that's actually a very positive thing for us on both sides of the
financial equation for Express. So, we are embracing the Economy service. In those traffic cohorts, there's a lot more
upside there. We've capped it in the past.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take our next question from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Yeah, good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my question. I guess I want to
focus for a third question here on costs. So for the first time we actually saw Express quarterly costs ex-fuel come
down, although slightly. Should we expect that to accelerate throughout fiscal 2014 and into 2015? And Alan, are those
cost cuts just becoming a little bit more challenging to derive, is that why you're saying it might be a little bit more
back-end loaded to achieve that 75% of $1.6 billion next year?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Well, again, I'll start. Again, acquisitions that are now fully in our P&L are kind of masking what
we're doing in terms of bending our costs down and I think I also mentioned to you about, we still have over half the
people that were still working here through the first quarter from our voluntary buyout program, which a year from now
will be – they'll all be – have left and we will be able to see a much bigger number at Express directly and from the
chargeback that Express gets from services. So, I think that's the macro answer to your question. Dave has a lot of
specific productivity things going on; I'll turn it over to him.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Yeah, we've hardened all of our expense programs. They're all working exactly what we
would like them to work, how'd we like them to work. It's what we've told you. In fact, I guess it was the question
before, it's actually all around the world on our expense targets and performance there. So, with the exception of
acquisitions that have added a layer of expense, and revenue quite frankly, and without the impact of fuel this quarter
that was significant for Express, our margins, our operating profit improving 14%, is right in line with what we've
planned to achieve and are achieving.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Tom Kim>: Good morning. Thanks very much. We noticed that the cash flows continue to build up nicely and
you're now looking at about $5 billion in the quarter. Could you give us a little bit of guidance as to how we should be
thinking about capital allocation with regard to perhaps your longer-term plan for CapEx? And as we think about
modeling, do we want to be thinking about modeling CapEx as some sort of ratio, as a percentage of fixed assets or
revenue? And then within that component, what percent do you think is more for replacement, as opposed to the
growth side of the CapEx? Thanks very much.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Our CapEx strategy has changed over time, as we are now focused on replacement and the
modernization of the aircraft fleet at Express, which is driving, and you're already seeing it, you noticed the last two

fiscal years, in the fourth quarter, we've significantly reduced – we retired a number of planes, we've shortened the
depreciable lives, which of course is – which is a headwind for Dave's segment, but it's for replacement capital, which
is much more efficient, and with fuel prices where they are, jet's at $3. It's absolutely mandatory that we continue to do
that if we're going to hit our $1.6 billion goal. We want to put as much money as we possibly can into Ground because
it's going to continue to grow. It's very high ROIC. Ground's margins are going to stay in the 17% to 19% range, and
we're going to continue to take market share.
As Freight, they've done a great job of continuing to tweak their operating model a lot more on rail. We expect Freight
to grow and so we'll invest there as well. As to capital allocation, we continue to talk about that at the strategic level all
the time, and we don't have anything to say about capital allocation today, and we'll keep you posted.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take our next question from Kelly Dougherty with Macquarie. Your line is now open. If the line is
muted, please unmute your phone line.
<Q - Kelly A. Dougherty>: Can you hear me? Hello.
Operator
Yes. Please proceed.
<Q - Kelly A. Dougherty>: Oh. Apologies about that. Sorry. I guess, Alan, maybe if you could give us some more
color on the different buckets outside of the SG&A, how you get to that $1.6 billion number? I know things have
changed around a little bit. But could you give us any more sense on what the size of the other buckets look like? That
would be really helpful.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Well, we're only one quarter into a 12-quarter program. I was just trying to point out that we have
to manage the business as well, and things change, and we're doing that. So whereas we were looking at a different
revenue outlook for International Express 11 months ago, components have changed. They'll be much more IE in the
future than we had anticipated and probably less IP, although it will continue to grow. So we have to change our cost
structure more than we thought. So you might see a little bit more on the cost side of the equation and a little bit less on
the revenue benefit side of the equation.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Yeah, Kelly, these are the buckets that we've gone over before, but just so you can put them
down, domestic transformation, or domestic cost network if you will, international profit improvement across the
world, fleet modernization, efficiency of staff functions and the process therein, of course, targeting profitable yields
and revenue growth.
Operator
Thank you. We we'll take our next question from Scott Schneeberger with Oppenheimer.
<Q - Scott A. Schneeberger>: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. In Ground, you've spoken about building out
capacity and spending a bit more in CapEx this year. Could you give us a progress report, an update on what's going
there? You mentioned some build out for the holidays. Also is there any work there to strategically capitalize on e-tailer
strategies, expanding distribution networks? Thanks.
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Well, this is Henry Maier. Okay, there were a lot of questions there, so I hope I get them all.
First of all, 90% of the capital expense is to expand our capacity for growth and the large elements of these
expenditures are new hubs, building expansions and relocations, material handling and rolling stock. So, we are very
disciplined, as I've said, in the past here about adding capital. We try to handle peaks in volume with operating expense

instead of capital, and we generally put together a five to seven year plan based on our forecast as to how we intend to
expand the network.
Now clearly, our volume is being driven by e-commerce. I think Mike had said in the past here, it's grown five to six
times the rate of brick-and-mortar. I would tell you that we believe that we are uniquely positioned to compete in this
space. We have FedEx Home Delivery for customers that desire high-touch, high-value transportation services for their
residential deliveries. FedEx Home Delivery offers extra services, including day-definite service, appointment service
and evening delivery, in addition to signature options. And then we have FedEx SmartPost, which is uniquely
positioned to offer a low-cost option for customers who would like to offer free shipping to their customers and we do
this with final mile delivery by the USPS. So, we think that we're uniquely positioned in the marketplace to capture our
fair share of e-commerce.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jack Atkins with Stephens.
<Q - Connor Hustava>: Yeah. Hey, guys. This is actually Connor Hustava on for Jack today. Just had a quick
question on the tech product launches that are planned here in the second half of 2013. Can you just give us some color
on what you think that will do overall industry capacity and maybe what's baked into your guidance from a volume and
rate perspective? Thanks.
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: This is Mike Glenn. Obviously, we'll see some tech launches this week. There have been
changes in the way the tech products are moved into the marketplace. A lot more staging of inventory going on, on the
International front as opposed to using expedited from door-to-door. So we have seen some changes in that regard in
terms of how product is moved to the U.S. and put into inventory. We will certainly benefit from that with these
launches. Probably a greater benefit in the domestic system, although it is a short burst, so even though it's a lot of
traffic in a very short period of time, you don't see the long tail of that potentially you've seen in the past, although
certainly we'll benefit from accessories and other things that come on the back end of these tech launches.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jeff Kauffman with Buckingham Research.
<Q - Jeff A. Kauffman>: Thank you very much and congratulations, everyone. You did take down modestly your U.S.
and global forecast. I know you mentioned Fred that it was related to some changes in the make-ups of these growth
objectives, but in terms of your own outlook, you spent a little less CapEx than we were looking for. What are your
thoughts on your capital budget for this year, and what is changing in your own forecast where you're maintaining your
forward guidance in the face of lower global growth?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Jeff, this is Mike. Let me clarify on the calendar year 2013 economic outlook, I mentioned
that it's historical data revisions that are really driving the bulk of the reduction in our calendar year 2013 growth rates.
Obviously, as GDP numbers are updated, which takes some time, we build that back into the historical trends and that
affects the forecast going forward. So, really not as much material change in the fundamentals of the business as
opposed to just historical reversions on the economic forecast, and I'll let Alan handle the second part.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Yeah, Jeff. We're not changing our capital spending plans for this year. As I said, we want to
continue to invest heavily in Ground and we want to continue to do the fleet replacement at Express. As we look at
2015 and 2016 as part of the profit improvement program and other things, there may be a possibility that we will slide
some of that further out depending on how the economy goes and we'll just have to see. We have some flexibility to do
that, but I think $4 billion is the right number for us this year, and we can sort of hold that level for a while as revenues
grow, and we'll get a better CapEx to revenue ratio. I'm not making any 2015 commitments yet because we're going to
just have to wait and see what the outlook looks like, but I can tell you that the 767s, the first 25 of them are just

Thank you. Our next question comes from William Greene with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Hi. Good morning. Mike, can you remind us on the GRI on Express, how much of the business
does that cover and also does it include dim weight pricing changes because it seems like that's been quite effective in
the past? Thank you.
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Bill, I'm sorry, you had trouble, we had a – maybe a connection issue. Could you repeat the
question just a bit maybe get a little closer to the phone?
<Q - Bill J. Greene>: Sure. So, the question was on the GRI for Express, how much of the business does that cover
and does it include any changes in dim weight because that's been pretty effective for pricing in the past?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Well, it's been one of our key strategies to substantially increase the amount of parcel traffic
that is covered by the GRI and we've done a terrific job over the last three to four years. That's been a key component
of our revenue management program. So well over half the traffic is now impacted. We certainly have contracts that
still are in place today that are locked into a GRI and it's based upon the contract term and not the annual GRI, but our
sales team and our pricing science team have done a phenomenal job of working with customers to get them on an
annual rate increase, so we're very pleased with that. We did not make any changes to the dimensional weight that we
put in place several years ago. That's the last time we made the change, but that clearly has benefited the company, that
strategic change we made several years ago.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Allison Landry with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Allison Landry>: Good morning. I was wondering if you could quantify what the overall fuel lag headwind was
during the quarter and if we should be expecting a similar impact in Q2? Thank you.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Allison, this is Alan. While we don't give specific numbers, I can tell you it was significant. If
you just think about how the fuel prices ran up towards the end of the quarter and our fuel surcharge lags by six weeks,
it's pretty evident that we were paying a lot higher for jet fuel and not able to pass along with surcharge. As to Q2 and
the rest of the year, I wish I could tell you. I mean it's one of the things that's a big wildcard on a quarter-to-quarter
basis is what happens with particularly jet fuel prices, but also with diesel and vehicle fuel, but particularly jet fuel
prices. If the global political environment calms down a little bit and the price of crude declines and jet fuel follows it
then that would be beneficial to us in the second quarter. But I can't predict it. So, we just have the six week lag and we
just have to deal with it, over time it evens out, but it sure does cause volatility.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom Wadewitz with JPMorgan.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Yes. Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on one of the topics, Dave Bronczek, that
you talked about a little bit earlier on the shift of the IE traffic and I guess how that relates to trade down. So your
comments were pretty optimistic that you're making good progress and I just wanted to get a sense is that something
that you're optimistic because you're going to see this change, but you're early in the change in terms of shifting that
traffic? Or have you just executed this maybe quicker than we would've anticipated and you'd say, hey, 50% of our IE
traffic is already in commercial lift and that trade down headwind that we've been concerned about really wasn't that
big of an issue in the quarter? So, I guess, some further perspective on the trade down and shift of IE traffic would be

great. Thank you.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Thanks, Tom. Great question. We've actually been looking at this issue, planning for it. As
you know, we've talked about it for several quarters. Our team has executed this flawlessly. It's been terrific for our
customers and for our network of course. I think you're going to see going forward that we think we have more
opportunity in the International Economy side. We used to cap that International Economy traffic in our existing
line-haul network and going forward there's an opportunity to grow that and grow it successfully. So I think the answer
to your question, we've planned it now for several quarters, we've executed it flawlessly and we're very excited about
where we are. Mike?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: I just would add one point. I think one of the keys to success that we've had is the terrific
collaboration between our sales team and the Express operating unit in terms of getting customers into the right
network. And we're early in that process, but I'm extremely happy with the results in terms of how we've been able to
collaborate here to get to the right solution for our customers.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Keith Schoonmaker with Morningstar.
<Q - Keith Schoonmaker>: Thanks. Noticed a pretty strong 16% growth in international domestic volume. Is this
organic or mostly from folding in acquisitions? And I guess related, could you comment on international regions where
you've seen particular strength, please?
<A - David J. Bronczek>: Yes. It's a good question. It's from both, actually, acquisitions and our organic European
plan. The organic plan has performed outstandingly well. I'd like to thank and congratulate our team over there. We've
opened 87 stations in the last 18 months and the service has been terrific. So that, with the incremental acquisitions
we've added, that's where you've seen the domestic International volume up 16%.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin Sterling with BB&T Capital Markets.
<Q - Kevin W. Sterling>: Thank you. Good morning. Congratulations on a nice quarter. You talked a lot about
International Economy and Alan, I think you touched earlier, you said you talked about maybe a little bit more base
erosion in Express. So how would you characterize where we stand today with the customer trade-down? Is it the same
as it was a year ago? Has it accelerated and maybe it sounds like you guys are embracing it more, so maybe if you
could compare where we are today to where we were a year ago?
<A - David J. Bronczek>: I think a bigger issue, Kevin, is we're dealing with a new normal. We've seen a lot of the
trade-down already from customers that have made the change to deferred services. I think we're now talking about
more of a growth story going forward in terms of the mix of growth than we are the trade-down story. So, this is a
terrific opportunity for us and we plan to take advantage of that opportunity with our networks.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: If you think – this is Alan. If you think about the aviation and fuel and energy intensity of an
international movement, and the time differential between priority and economy, given how high fuel prices are, you
can understand why customers are trading down, because they get significantly better price, and they give up a couple
of days. That's much more difficult to manage in the short term than what we've been managing in the U.S. between
Express, Express Deferred and Ground, which we now have right about in the right place. As you noticed, U.S.
domestic did fine in the quarter on its revenue growth.
So I got to say, hats off to the sales and marketing team for grappling with this and handling this and how swift these
changes occurred. And our pricing, I think, is right. It's just going to take us a little bit longer than we'd hoped to get
this perfectly balanced. And Dave can give you some tactical information.

<A - David J. Bronczek>: Yeah, again, Mike mentioned it before. For example, on the high-tech sector these big
releases; in the past, I would've had to have added extra sections of flying. Now we've moved it into our FTN network,
and it's very consistent, it's very reliable, and we move it into our networks in the United States in Freight and Ground.
I mean it's a perfect portfolio play for us now, and the cost and profit implications are much greater. So I think yes,
we've embraced it, and I think it's a big opportunity going forward.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from David Vernon with Bernstein.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Hey. Just a couple follow-ups on the International Economy thing. First, Dave, did you
just say that the International Economy product was coming into the Ground or Freight networks, as opposed to the
Express network? Just as a clarification on the last comment. I wasn't sure if I heard that correctly.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: The International Freight that I'm talking about, coming out of Asia and around the world,
is just moving in a different network, in our FTN network. We move it around the world, instead of on our FedEx
Purple tails. When traffic gets into the United States, we look at the service requirements the customers want, and if we
can, we move it into Ground, we move it into Freight, we move it at Express.
Operator
Thank you.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: This is Fred Smith. Let me try to say a couple of things here to clarify some of the
things that we've been commenting on. In the main, Express traffic, whether it's package or light freight, is smaller and
lighter than the type of traffic that's handled in the FTN network.
So these big bulk shipments coincident with product releases by the high-tech folks are very difficult to handle, because
they're lumpy and they have expectations of very low yields. So that's the type of movement that Dave is talking about
FTN moving and then putting into the Ground and Freight movement.
The day-to-day Express movement, whether it's Priority or Economy, is picked up and transported by the Express unit,
and it's moved in the right network. And as Dave said, on the line-haul side, depending on what the customer wants, it's
toggled between Express and FTN, depending on the nature of the traffic.
You certainly cannot fly an owned airplane at today's yields in the general commodity freight network. Now, you can
say, I'm making money in my underbellies, if you're a combination carrier, but at today's yields, it's almost too costly to
cover the direct operating expenses, much less the capital expenses for some of these operations.
So the market has changed, and as Dave and Mike have said, and I said at the last conference call, it's important that
you recognize that the International Economy Express is a growth sector. Dave said it's growing 15%. So we've
embraced that, and the strategy we put in place over the last year and which our people have executed is terrific, and it's
a perfect complement to this heavier traffic that FTN carries, an awful lot of which goes on the ocean. And that is
inserted into the Ground and Freight networks when we get into the United States.
So I think there's a little bit of misunderstanding about the demographics of the traffic, as well as the nomenclature of
the traffic.

<Q - Brian J. Jacoby>: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Regarding future aircraft purchases, can you maybe tell
us a little bit more about where you guys stand with respect to leasing versus purchasing the aircraft? I know you said a
while back – a few years back that you're probably leaning more towards putting those aircraft on balance sheet, now
that you guys are pretty well positioned in the investment grade world?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: This is Alan. Pretty shortly everything is going on balance sheet whether it's leased or not, so
that's not why we leased airplanes in the past. We're going to own airplanes going forward, because we're a full
effective tax payer, and we can use those benefits. And one of the reasons we accelerated our capital the last couple of
years was in fact to take advantage of the 100% and 50% bonus depreciation.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: We haven't leased an airplane in years, 2000, Mickey just informed me, so...
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Van Sciver with Hedgeye.
<Q - Jay Van Sciver>: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. Looking at your International Express
regional market position, you have an outstanding franchise in the Americas and Asia, but a weaker position in Europe.
Does that lack of balance hurt margins, and how could you strengthen your presence in Europe?
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: Yeah, the comment that I made earlier and I think we talked about it before, our organic
European expansion is adding a very nice layer of growth and cost improvement in Europe and traffic coming in from
around the world into Europe. So we are working hard to be more balanced, I think that's your point, but we've seen
tremendous results in our plans. Now, we've had it now in place for 18 months, and we plan to expand that going
forward into the next fiscal year.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Just to remind you, in the last 12 months, we've bought companies in Poland, France, and South
Africa.
<A - Frederick Wallace Smith>: And a couple of years ago, we made a great acquisition in the United Kingdom, and
FedEx U.K. is a terrific operation now.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from David Campbell with Thompson, Davis & Company.
<Q - David P. Campbell>: Most of my questions have been answered but I did just want to understand the forecasts
for fiscal 2014 are partially based on so-called stable fuel prices. Does that mean stable relative to the prices in August?
Stable to what?
<A - Alan B. Graf>: It means that there's no volatility in them from where we are, because of the lag time between the
surcharge and the cost of the fuel, which I think I talked about earlier.
<Q - David P. Campbell>: All right. Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. We'll take our next question from Justin Yagerman with Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Hey, guys. I don't know if I missed it or not, but I didn't hear the change in frequencies
out of Asia when I had asked that with Dave earlier. And then I wanted to ask about the GRI, following up on Bill
Greene's question. The other thing that we didn't see this year is a change in the fuel surcharge alongside of a GRI with
Express, so I was kind of curious if you guys feel like that may not be needed anymore, or if that's something that you

just decided not to do this year, if that wasn't something that you disclosed in the release.
<A - David J. Bronczek>: This is Dave Bronczek. On your first point, it was my first comments that I made. We
actually adjusted our global network coming out of Asia this quarter, similarly to what we did last quarter. So yes,
you're right, we adjusted Asia down.
<A - T. Michael Glenn>: This is Mike. We began in 2005 of instituting higher base rate increases, while reducing the
fuel surcharge as you noted. The strategy there was to help ensure that the fuel surcharge index was properly aligned to
fuel prices, and it also gave customers more predictability, because if the base rates have been adjusted to account for
some of the fuel surcharge, obviously it doesn't have the volatility that it would have if it were sitting in the fuel
surcharge.
We believe the index as it sits today and has been in place since last January, is appropriate for the current
environment, although obviously we'll reevaluate that each year as part of the GRI and will determine next year as to
whether we need to go back to the prior practice or continue with what we did this year.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey. Thanks for the follow-up. So I wanted to ask one on Ground. Is there any way to bucket
how much of the margin pressure Ground is fuel and how much is kind of the CapEx rollout? And as we think about
that CapEx spend, is this kind of one year that sets you up for four or five years of growth or are we at the point where
you're going to have big CapEx increases in Ground every year for a while?
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Scott, this is Henry Maier. As I said before, virtually all of the margin impact in the first
quarter year-over-year is due unfavorable fuel. Concerning CapEx, we've put together five, six year forecasts on our
capital needs based on our growth and where we see we're going to be constrained in the network. I'll say again that we
are very disciplined about where we add capital. We try to avoid adding capital for peaks in business as best we can.
We tend to handle those with operating cost. And I think that's probably the answer to your question.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Derek Rabe with Raymond James.
<Q - Derek S. Rabe>: Yeah, good morning. This is Derek on for Art this morning. Thanks for taking my question.
Most of my questions have been answered. I wanted to look at the Freight division, though, if I could and maybe some
commentary there on how demand trended throughout the quarter, and then how it's shaping up so far in September.
Thank you.
<A - Alan B. Graf>: Okay, Derek. Thank you. Appreciate the question. Again, we're pleased with our momentum as
we had good balance between yield, weight per shipment, and volume. A few network adjustments during the quarter,
and again there will be one less business day. So, we were pleased with our progress in the quarter, and again, the ops
team's doing a really nice job on the efficiencies to balance off that one less day. But good balance overall, and our
focus is on good balance yield.

<Q - Bruce Chan>: Hi. It's Bruce Chan again. I just wanted to switch gears a little bit to talk about SmartPost.

rates through and keep things as they are?
<A - Henry J. Maier>: Yeah. This is Henry Maier. We have the ability through our contracts to pass through postal
increases. We are always impacted, though, by the timing and customer mix in terms of how quickly we can realize
that. And decisions to switch between networks are largely customer decisions. We don't drive that.
<A - William J. Logue>: Okay. This is Bill Logue from Freight. I've got a question here that came in on the internet
from [ph] William Flynn (50:06). What are the opportunities for increasing leverage gains in freight? It seems as if
you're taking advantage of investments in equipment in the form of lower maintenance cost, but these are being offset
by increased PT cost, purchase transportation costs. So how should we think about the dynamics in Freight going
forward?
s
Good question. Again, we've made some good investments in our fleets over the last three years. Purchase
transportation is an offset. Again, PT right now is – you'll see rates are up. We're moving as we saw, more to the rails.
So, a combination of moving to the rail, price increases in the purchase transportation, but again seeing the offsetting
benefit in our line-haul.
So again, we will keep investing in the fleet, obviously making sure we have appropriate equipment running at good
efficiencies, but again purchase transportation will always be a supplement to our line-haul, and again, our objective
there is a combination, because rail comes in the purchase transportation bucket. So again, line-haul as we all know, is
a key objective to improve that for the organization and again, a great benefit for leverage going forward for our
business.
