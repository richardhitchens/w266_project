Mary T. Barra
Thanks, Randy, and thanks to everybody for joining this call. On our last earnings call in April, I spoke about GM's
resiliency during a very challenging first quarter. As you all know the ignition switch recall and difficult market
conditions in some parts of the world put tremendous pressure on our bottom line. Nevertheless, we remain profitable.
Just as important, we also continued our steady investment in new products and we returned more than $480 million in
capital to common shareholders, stockholders through our first quarter dividend. Years of hard work to improve our
vehicles, our operations and the customer experience made this possible. As expected the same issues continued into
the second quarter, but once again, we had strong operating performance and we earned a profit on both an
EBIT-adjusted and a net income basis and we stayed on our plan.
I'll speak to all these points, starting on slide two, which presents a summary of our second quarter results; then I'll
review the highlights that speak to the heart of our business, which is to build great products, satisfy customers and do
it very profitably. At the top of slide two, you can see that we delivered 2.5 million units in the quarter. As we
announced last week, this was our highest second quarter volume since 2005. Sales in North America and China, the
two largest and most profitable markets in the world, were up 6% and 8% respectively. However, this was offset to a
large degree by declines in markets like Russia and Venezuela, where the industry is weak, as well as the strategic
decision we made to wind down Chevrolet Europe. This also had an impact on market share.
Our global market share in the quarter was down three-tenths of a point; however, market share in the United States
was equal to a year ago. On a revenue basis, we improved our results by more than $570 million thanks in large
measure to improvements at GM Financial.
Turning to the bottom line, net income to common stockholders was $200 million or $0.11 per share. Combined, the
recall-related charges and special items we cited in our press release reduced net income by $0.91 per share in the
quarter. Absent these items, net income would have been about $1.7 billion in the quarter.
Looking next at cash. Net cash from our automotive operations activities was $3.6 billion and the year-over-year
decline reflects recall activity as well as changes in working capital due to timing.
And what's not shown on the slide, our automotive available liquidity improved by $4 billion from a year ago. Finally
on an EBIT-adjusted basis, GM earned $1.4 billion and our adjusted automotive free cash flow was $1.9 billion. Absent
recall and restructuring expenses, EBIT-adjusted in the quarter would have been improved slightly from a year ago.
For the first half of the year, adjusted automotive free cash flow was nearly $1 billion better than a year ago. Chuck
Stevens will break all this down for you in just a few minutes.
Let's look at slide three, which presents several highlights from the quarter, starting with GM North America, where
our core operating performance was exceptionally strong. In fact, our EBIT-adjusted margins excluding recalls climbed
above 9%. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin growth, excluding recalls.
In China, we reported record sales and our margins improved by six-tenths of a point from a year ago. In Europe, the
wind-down of Chevrolet Europe is ahead of schedule and costs are below expectations. Meanwhile, the recovery of the
Opel/Vauxhall continues. Opel/Vauxhall sales increased 3% in the quarter and 4% in the first half. Our share was up in
11 European markets in the first half, including Germany, which share rose three-tenths of a point to 7%. In June alone,
our share in Germany reached 7.6%, which is almost up a full point versus a year ago.
New products have made a big difference. For example, the Mokka was the best selling SUV in the first six months of
the year in Germany. All of this keeps us on track to be profitable mid decade. We're also targeting European market
share of 8% and EBIT-adjusted margins in the 5% range by 2022.
GM South America meanwhile continues to be very challenging with volumes under pressure across the region, but our
core underlying performance in the region is improving. Finally, GM Financial continues to execute its growth strategy

in order to support increased GM vehicle sales. For example, the acquisition of the Ally Financial European and Latin
American businesses in 2013 as well as GMF's growth in the North America lease market helped increase their share of
GM financing activity from 13% to 20% compared to a year ago. This trend should continue as GMF expands their
prime retail loan program in the United States starting in the second half.
The next step for GMF is to complete the acquisition of Ally's joint venture in China, which we expect to close subject
to certain regulatory and other approvals late 2014 or as soon as possible thereafter.
Let's turn now to slide four, which discusses our recall activity in the quarter. Let me begin by stating that my total
focus is to make GM the best automotive company for our customers, as it relates to safety, quality, reliability and
overall value. We are not going to be satisfied by simply solving our current problems. We are completely aimed at
being industry leaders. By now, all of you are familiar with the findings of the Valukas report, which was presented to
our Board of Directors in June, and then shared with NHTSA and other government agency.
I have fully embraced the report and pledged to act on all of the recommendations. Importantly, a great many were
acted on before the report was even released.
Actions that we have taken include: elevating safety decision making to the highest levels of the company; creating a
new position, the Vice President of Global Safety, that's Jeff Boyer and he has full access to me and has regular
reporting out to our senior leadership team as well as the board. We also reorganized vehicle engineering and created
the new product integrity organization which I am confident will improve quality, safety and the functional
performance of our vehicles through better design, execution, and systems integration. We also removed 15 employees
from the company, some for misconduct or incompetence, others because they simply didn't take responsibility or act
with a sense of urgency.
We instituted the Speak Up for Safety program to encourage and recognize employees when they report potential
safety issues and do it quickly. We've already received more than 280 suggestions. And we've now added 60 safety
investigators to identify and address issues much more quickly. And we've aligned the legal staff to help assure
transparency and information sharing among the staffs and other business units across the entire company.
Overall, we are dramatically enhancing our approach to safety. You can see it in the aggressive stance we are taking on
recalls and the redoubling of our effort. This year, we have looked at vehicles going back to the 1990s and the results
were 60 individual recalls in United States, covering 29 million vehicles in North America. About two-thirds of the
recalled vehicles are no longer in production and more than 12 million of the vehicles will be fixed by simply replacing
or modifying the key.
In addition, some of the recalls were quite small. We had 13 recalls of less than 1,000 vehicles and five with less than
100. The financial impact of this activity in the second quarter is outlined on the slide. Our recall-related charge of $1.2
billion in this quarter. This work is now substantially complete and I believe we have now addressed some major
outstanding issues. But if we see new data, we will address it. Today, we are bringing greater rigor, discipline and
urgency to our analysis and decision-making process with regard to safety and our recalls. We are mining every source
of data available to us from the factory floor, to warranty information, to customer calls, to social media, to legal
claims, all sources of information. And we're not waiting to see if a trend develops. We want our customers to know
that if we identify an issue that could possibly affect their safety, we will act quickly.
With respect to the ignition switch recall itself, as I have said before, we are taking responsibility for what happened
and we are treating the people who suffered physical injury or lost a loved one with compassion, decency, and fairness.
As you know, the compensation program that Independent Program Administrator, Ken Feinberg, has developed will
begin accepting claims on August 1.
The creation of the program has resulted in a $400 million pre-tax special item in this quarter, as you can see on the
slide. Also, vehicle repairs are well underway. More than 550,000 vehicles have been repaired, and we are on track to
have enough kits to repair the majority of the recalled vehicles by early October. As parts availability has improved and
the pace of repairs has accelerated, we have seen a corresponding decline in the demand for rental cars. This was
expected.

Okay. Let's turn back to earnings and I'll now ask Chuck to walk you through a detailed review of the quarter, and then
Chuck and I will take your questions. Chuck?
Charles K. Stevens
Thanks, Mary. On slide five, we again remind you of the results for the quarter. Net revenue for the period was $39.6
billion. The nearly $600 million increase from the prior year is primarily attributable to favorable mix of $1.2 billion,
favorable price of $1.1 billion, increased revenue from GM Financial of $400 million, partially offset by a negative
$1.8 billion associated with lower wholesale volumes and unfavorable foreign exchange of $400 million primarily due
to the weakening of the Brazilian real and the Argentine peso against the U.S. dollar.
Our operating income was a loss of $500 million, primarily attributable to $1.2 billion in recall-related expenses and
$1.3 billion in special charges, which I will cover in more detail later.
Net income to common stockholders declined $1 billion to $200 million and our diluted earnings per share came in at
$0.11, again influenced by recall-related expense and special charges. As Mary indicated, net income was $1.7 billion
excluding recalls and special charges.
Automotive net cash from operating activities was $3.6 billion, a $900 million decrease from the same period in 2013.
For our non-GAAP measures, EBIT-adjusted was $1.4 billion in the second quarter, including $1.2 billion of
recall-related expenses and $200 million of restructuring. And EBIT-adjusted margin was 3.4%, down from a year ago,
again adversely impacted by a negative 2.9% due to recalls.
Adjusted automotive free cash flow decreased $600 million to $1.9 billion for the second quarter. However, this is
nearly $1 billion higher for the first half of the year compared to the first half of 2013, including $300 million of
recall-related cash costs.
On slide six, we disclose the special items that impacted earnings per share. Net income to common stockholders was
$200 million and our diluted earnings per share were $0.11. Included in our special items for the quarter is a $900
million non-cash pre-tax charge relating to a change in how we estimate costs for recall campaigns in GM North
America. This reduced net income by approximately $500 million in the quarter. And I'll go into more detail regarding
this change on the next chart.
Additionally, as previously announced, GM will implement a compensation program for those who have lost loved
ones or suffered from physical injuries as the result of an ignition switch failure related to the 2.6 million vehicles
recalled earlier this year. A special charge of $400 million pre-tax was taken for the GM ignition switch compensation
program, which reduced net income by $200 million on an after-tax basis. There is no cap on this program, but this
charge is the company's best estimate of the amounts that may be paid to claimants. Due to the unique nature of the
program, this estimate contains significant uncertainty, and it is possible that total cost could increase by approximately
$200 million. The impact of these special items had a $0.47 unfavorable impact on diluted earnings per share in the
period.
On slide seven, we give you an update on our GMNA recall expense. We have substantially completed our efforts to
address outstanding recall issues and also enhanced the analytical data available, which contributed to better overall
estimating capabilities. In addition, we have made several significant organizational changes, such as the creation of a
new Global Product Integrity organization and the appointment of a new Global Vice President of Vehicle Safety,
responsible for the safety development of our vehicle systems as Mary mentioned earlier.
As a result beginning in Q3, GMNA will accrue estimated recall expense at the time of vehicle sale, which will be a
similar method with how we currently accrue for policy and warranty and will be in line with other manufacturers.
Going forward, we expect future recall expense to normalize at levels higher, but not materially so, than levels prior to
the first half of 2014. Additionally, we expect to identify issues sooner, which may result in the frequency of
announced recalls increasing, but the number of vehicles per recall and the cost per recall event would be down. As a

result of changing how we estimate recall campaigns in North America, we took a $900 million non-cash pre-tax
special charge during the quarter. This is our best estimate of the remaining recall expense we expect for the next 10
years for 30 million GM vehicles on the road today.
On slide eight, we show our consolidated EBIT-adjusted for the prior five quarters. At the bottom of the slide, we list
the revenue and margins for the same periods. Our operating income margin for the second quarter of 2014 was a
negative 1.2%, down significantly from the prior period as a result of recall-related expenses and the special items I
reviewed earlier. Our EBIT adjusted margin decreased 2.4 percentage points to 3.4%. Our consolidated wholesale
vehicle sales were 1.5 million vehicles in the second quarter, approximately an 8% decrease from the prior year, and
our global market share decreased 0.3 percentage points to 11.3%.
On slide nine, we explain the $900 million decrease in year-over-year consolidated EBIT-adjusted. Volume was $300
million unfavorable due primarily to lower wholesale volumes in GMIO, and GMSA, as a result of the wind-down of
the Chevrolet brand from Europe and the challenging market conditions in South America. This was partially offset by
higher wholesale volumes in GM North America.
Mix was $200 million favorable, primarily attributable to North America. Price was $1.1 billion favorable due
primarily to recently launched vehicles in North America like the new full-size SUVs, full-size trucks, and vehicles
such as the Corvette Stingray as well as pricing performance in GM South America.
Costs were $1.6 billion unfavorable, including the impact of the $1.2 billion in recall-related costs in the quarter, $900
million in material costs associated with recently launched products, incremental restructuring expense of $200 million,
partially offset by $500 million in fixed and variable cost improvement. Other was $300 million unfavorable, primarily
related to foreign exchange.
Slide 10 gives our year-over-year EBIT-adjusted performance by segment. GMNA decreased $600 million to $1.4
billion including $1 billion in recall-related expense. GME decreased $200 million for a loss of $300 million for the
quarter, primarily driven by $200 million in incremental restructuring expenses. The performance in GMIO improved
$100 million to $300 million and in South America, EBIT-adjusted decreased $100 million on a rounded basis to a loss
of $100 million for the quarter.
GM Financial continued to deliver solid results with $300 million in earnings before taxes adjusted for the period, and
our corporate sector was a $200 million loss, including $100 million in recall-related legal expenses for a total
EBIT-adjusted of $1.4 billion in Q2.
We now move on to our segment results with the key performance indicators for GM North America on slide 11. For
the second quarter of 2014, our total U.S. market share was 17.9%, flat versus the same period a year ago, but up 90
basis points from the first quarter. Our retail incentive levels on an absolute basis were higher than the prior year period
and slightly higher than the prior quarter. Our incentives for the quarter were 10.6% of average transaction price. This
puts us at 108% of the industry average.
Slide 13 shows GMNA's EBIT-adjusted for the most recent five quarters. At the bottom of the slide, revenue in this
segment of the business was $25.7 billion, up $2.2 billion from the same quarter in 2013. GMNA's EBIT-adjusted
margin was 5.4% for the second quarter, which included the negative impact of 3.8 percentage points associated with
recall-related expenses. Excluding the impact of recalls, GMNA's margin is above 9% for the quarter and is up over
115 basis points in the first six months of the year compared to the first six months of 2013. In fact, excluding the
impact of recalls, GMNA EBIT-adjusted margin has been up for four straight quarters on a year-over-year basis.
Our U.S. dealer inventory increased to 799,000 vehicles, up from a year ago, but down approximately 17,000 units
from the first quarter. This is equivalent of 72 days' supply at the end of June, down from 83 days' supply at the end of
Q1, and up slightly from 70 days' supply a year ago. GMNA's wholesale vehicle sales were 830,000 units, 21,000 units
higher than the prior year. North American market share came in at 17.2%, which was a 0.1 point decline from the
prior year period, but higher than the prior three quarters.

On slide 14, we provide the explanation of the $600 million year-over-year decrease in GMNA's EBIT-adjusted.
Volume was $200 million favorable due to the 21,000 unit increase in wholesale volumes, driven by a growing industry
and our successful products such as the full-size pickup trucks. Mix was $200 million favorable due to our full-size
trucks and products such as the Corvette Stingray. Price was $800 million favorable on the strength of our full-size
trucks and all new full-size SUVs. Cost was $1.6 billion unfavorable, primarily due to the $1 billion of recall-related
expenses and material costs associated with new launches, partially offset by fixed cost savings and material
performance on carryover products. Other was $100 million unfavorable due to foreign exchange.
On slide 15, GME reported an EBIT-adjusted loss of $300 million for the second quarter, a $200 million decrease from
the prior year. Revenue increased 6.6% to $6 billion for the quarter and EBIT-adjusted margin in the segment
decreased 3.1 percentage points to a negative 5.1%, primarily attributable to incremental restructuring expenses. GME's
wholesale vehicle sales for the quarter were 305,000 units, up slightly from the prior year. And our European market
share was 6.8%, down 0.9 percentage points from the prior year, primarily related to the wind-down of the Chevrolet
brand. As mentioned earlier, the Opel/Vauxhall brand increased sales nearly 4% in the first half of this year and market
share increased 8 basis points year-to-date. After adjusting for incremental restructuring expense and despite challenges
in Russia, GM Europe is near breakeven and well on its way towards profitability by mid decade.
On slide 16, we provide the major component of GME's $200 million decrease in EBIT-adjusted. Volume was flat as
improving Western European markets were offset by conditions in Russia. Mix was also flat on a year-over-year basis.
Price was flat as competitive pressure in the industry was partially offset by price recovery for foreign exchange. Cost
was $100 million unfavorable primarily due to $200 million in incremental restructuring costs, partially offset by
material and fixed cost savings. Other was $100 million unfavorable due to foreign exchange. This totals to GME's
EBIT-adjusted loss of $300 million for the second quarter of 2014.
We'll now move on to GMIO's profitability for the prior five quarters on slide 17. EBIT-adjusted was $300 million,
including $500 million in equity income from our joint ventures. At the bottom of the slide, GMIO's revenue from
consolidated operations was $3.6 billion. The $1.2 billion decline from Q2 2013 is primarily due to lower wholesale
volumes in the Middle East and Chevrolet brand vehicles in Europe.
Consolidated operations' EBIT-adjusted margin was a negative 5.7%, down significantly from the prior year, primarily
related to reduced volumes in the region. Our net income margin from our China JVs remained strong at 10%, up 0.6
percentage points year-over-year. The region's wholesale vehicle sales were 157,000 for its consolidated operations and
830,000 for our China JVs, which was up 7.5% from the prior period in China.
Our market share in Asia-Pacific, Middle East, and Africa region was 9.7%, flat from a year ago. Our market share in
China was 14.4% for the first six months of the year, relatively flat compared to the first six months of last year as we
work to keep pace with the quickly growing industry.
On slide 18, we provide the major components of GMIO's year-over-year performance. Volume was $300 million
unfavorable due to 83,000 unit decline in wholesale volumes in our consolidated operations. Mix was flat on a
year-over-year basis. Price was $100 million favorable, primarily in our Middle East operations. Cost was a $200
million tailwind associated with wind-down of the Chevrolet brand from Europe and lower cost in Australia, India and
Middle East markets, partially offset by incremental recall and restructuring expenses.
Other was $100 million favorable due to improved equity income from our strong China operations. Going forward, we
continue to expect our China business to remain strong. With regard to consolidated operations, we should see the
benefit of important launches of the new full-size pickup trucks and full-size SUVs in the Middle East.
Slide 19 provides a look at GM South America's performance in recent quarters. Revenue decreased $1.1 billion to $3.2
billion, primarily due to lower wholesale volumes and foreign exchange, partially offset by favorable pricing and mix.
The EBIT adjusted margin in the segment was a negative 2.5%, 3.8 percentage points lower than the prior year. GM
South America's wholesale vehicle sales were 211,000 units, 67,000 lower than in the second quarter of 2013 and
South American market share declined to 16.7% in the quarter.

On slide 20, we look at the change in year-over-year EBIT adjusted, a decrease of $100 million. Volume decreased
$200 million, primarily due to lower wholesale volumes in Brazil, Argentina, and Venezuela. Mix was flat. Price was
$200 million favorable due to actions we've taken in Argentina and Brazil to partially offset foreign exchange in those
markets. Cost was flat as incremental restructuring expense was offset by fixed cost savings. Other had a $200 million
adverse impact, primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange in Brazil and Argentina. This totals to an EBIT adjusted
loss of $100 million in GM South America in the second quarter.
Slide 21 provides a walk of adjusted automotive free cash flow for the second quarter. As a reminder, our net income to
common stockholders was $200 million, after adjusting for non-controlling interests and Series A preferred dividends
and deducting GM Financial earnings, our automotive income was $100 million. We had $800 million in non-cash
special items and our depreciation and amortization was a $1.6 billion expense. Working capital was a $600 million use
of cash. The variance from prior year is primarily due to production timing. Pension and OPEB cash payments
exceeded expenses by $200 million in the quarter. Other was $1.9 billion, primarily attributable to recall charges during
the quarter, dividends from China joint ventures and timing of sales incentive accruals versus payments. This totals to
automotive net cash provided by operating activities of $3.6 billion. We had $1.7 billion of capital expenditures in the
quarter giving us an adjusted automotive free cash flow of $1.9 billion.
On slide 22, we provide a summary of our key automotive balance sheet items. We finished the second quarter with
$28.4 billion in cash and current marketable securities and $10.4 billion in available credit facilities for a total available
liquidity of $38.8 billion. Our book value of debt was $7.5 billion and our Series A preferred stock obligation was $3.1
billion. Our U.S. qualified and non-qualified pension plans were underfunded by $7 billion and our non-U.S. pensions
were underfunded by $12.3 billion. Our unfunded OPEB liability was $6.3 billion in the second quarter.
Slide 23 provides a brief summary of our auto financing activities. GM Financial has already released their results and
will hold their earnings conference call at noon. Our U.S. subprime penetration in the second quarter was 8.1%, down
0.4 percentage points from the prior year. Our U.S. lease penetration increased 4.3 percentage points to 24.2% in Q2 as
we continue to leverage our financing relationships and improve residual values to drive toward industry competitive
levels in key segments.
Lease penetration in Canada was at 27.5%, up significantly from last year, but more in line with industry. GM new
vehicles as a percentage of GM Financial originations rose to 75% and GM Financial's percentage of GM's U.S.
consumer subprime financing and leasing was 30% in the quarter. GM Financial's annualized net credit losses remain
low at 1.4% and their earnings before tax adjusted were $258 million for the second quarter, reflecting both continued
strong performance of their North American business and international operations.
Finally on slide 24, we highlight a few areas of focus for the second half of the year. Customer care remains our top
priority as a company. We will continue to work with our suppliers, our dealers and others to repair recalled vehicles as
quickly as we can and to continue to focus on improving our processes around our vehicle safety and our commitment
to our customers. We have some important launches in the second half of this year in many of our regions. We will
continue to focus on the important work of delivering flawless vehicle launches and introductions in these important
markets. With the successful new vehicle launches we've had thus far, we continue to generate strong results in the U.S.
and China and we remain on track to be profitable in Europe by mid-decade. We are confident we are currently on or
ahead of plan to deliver the results we promised earlier this year excluding the effects of recalls.
Finally, Mary will have more to say about our second half focus in her closing remarks. But I want you to know that we
are committed as a company to continue driving the strong underlying core operating performance we delivered in the
first half of this year across all regions and despite the challenges we face.
Now, Mary and I will take your questions, after which Mary will have some closing remarks.

Thank you, sir. Please note, the question-and-answer session is for analysts only. [Operator Instructions] Our first
question comes from the line of Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed, sir.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Good morning, everybody.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Hi, Rod.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Can you help us first of all with that slide 13, that $1.6 billion cost number? You did say that
about $1 billion of that was recall. Would it be reasonable to say that maybe $900 million was content? Last quarter
was around $1 billion, and then you had maybe $300 million of positive structural cost items, is that a good estimation
of that breakdown?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah. That's close, Rod. Out of the $1.6 billion, as we indicated, roughly $1 billion related
to recall activity. Material on majors was $1.1 billion unfavorable, partially offset by GPS carryover material
performance of a couple of hundred million dollars, and the balance was fixed cost.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Okay. So, okay. If that's right, material $1.1 billion and maybe it's $900 million net of some cost
savings on older items, how do we kind of put that into context against the pricing that you had in the quarter which
was $800 million? It would look like the contribution would be somewhat negative and it's still – it's kind of early days
when you compare the pricing versus the material right now. A lot of these products are pretty new. Is there anything to
kind of read into that?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Pricing on majors for North America in the quarter was $1.4 billion against that material
cost. Material on majors for North America specifically, Rod, was $1.1 billion. So roughly accretive to earnings, $300
million. I mentioned material performance on carryover favorable $200 million. So carryover pricing was unfavorable
in the quarter on a year-over-year basis about $600 million.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Okay. But this is arguably the peak of the company's product cycle and the combination of new
products versus carryover products doesn't appear to be favorable at this point. Is that something that we should be
thinking about sort of in the context of the longer term margin target? And I know you're doing north of 9% right now,
but the longer term margin target for North America being closer to 10%.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah. I would say we are still confident and convicted around our glide path to 10% EBIT
margins, Rod. I would suggest that we still have a significant portion of the launch cadence out in front of us. As we've
indicated before, we will be launching products in the 2014 to 2017 timeframe at twice the pace of the previous four
years. So, I think that there's continued opportunity from a pricing on new content. As I've discussed before, the
carryover pricing dynamic versus where we were sitting a year ago is becoming a bit more challenging and that's why
we need to focus on cost and efficiency, which is really the second leg of our glide path to 10% EBIT margins.
<Q - Rod A. Lache>: And just lastly if I can sneak another couple things in. Can you just clarify your wholesale of
830,000 units? Looks like it was maybe 60,000 units lower than production. Is that just rental car accounting and do
you have any just broad color on the outlook for the back half for South America or the consolidated IO business?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah. And for the first question, Rod, absolutely right. That's just rental car, the difference
between in-service versus auction. So over the next nine months to 12 months that will bleed out; that's the biggest
difference between production and wholesales. Relative to South America continues to be a very challenging
environment. Brazil and Argentina, the industry continues to weaken. But in the context of our overall results, we
continue to execute to our plan to drive efficiency in those operations, and I would expect, absent some change, to see
slightly improved performance in the second half of the year.
Consolidated operations, as we've talked before, we've got a number of important product launches in the second half
of the year, primarily led by full-size pickups and full-size SUVs in the Middle East. So again I would expect to see
some marginal improvement from a consolidated operations run rate as we get into the second half of the year. And
while we're at it, from a company standpoint as we've discussed before, we believe the second half of the year is going
to be stronger than the first half of the year ex-recall. And we're still confident that we're on or ahead of plan for the
year.

<Q - Rod A. Lache>: Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you, sir. And our next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citi. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Chuck, hoping we could maybe talk about the second half
outlook in North America. It sounds like you still are confident in the second half of the year. What are some of the big
buckets we should be thinking about there, both in terms of – and particularly a focus on kind of the pricing versus
material cost equation in the second half of the year?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah. I would say that our expectations for North America is that we will grow margins in
the second half of the year versus the first half, ex recalls, and also grow margins versus the second half of last year.
The big drivers behind that will be continuing the full-size SUV launch and getting that up to run and eliminating some
of the constraints that we've had from a production perspective. We'll have the ATS Coupe launch later this year from a
Cadillac perspective, mid-size trucks later in the year; I don't think that's going to be a big driver of earnings. Generally,
60% of the truck industry is in the second half of the year versus the first half of the year, so we expect continued
strength from a volume and mix perspective as well.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: That's very helpful. And then, two quick follow-ups. First, it does sound like you raised your
outlook for the mid decade in Europe from breakeven to profitable and maybe a subtle change, but maybe talk a little
bit about what may have driven that. And then secondly, just a quick housekeeping, what's the cash recall cost that we
should be expecting over the next several quarters?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Okay. Yeah. Speaking to Europe first, I think it's a combination of a number of things.
First, we continue to get traction in the core markets: Germany, the UK with Opel and with Vauxhall. The brand
strength continues to improve. The wind-down of Chevrolet Europe is ahead of plan and going much smoother than we
expected. About 80% of the dealers that are in wind-downs have signed up with Opel as well. So that's going extremely
well. And the industry is performing a little bit better than we expected. The other thing that's driving that with that
strength is we're going into the heart of the product launch cadence with the Corsa later this year and the Astra next
year.
On the recall, cash component of that, our expectations, Itay, is that 60% to 70% of the $2.5 billion that we've booked
thus far will result in a cash impact in the second half of the year with the balance rolling out into Q1, Q2 next year.
That's our latest thinking on that.
<Q - Itay Michaeli>: Great. That's very helpful. Thanks, everyone.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Brian A. Johnson>: Yeah. Good morning. Have a housekeeping question and then a more a strategic question.
On the housekeeping question, just following up on the wholesale versus the retail sales, if we just kind of look at it
from retail sales at the dealer level and inventory build, it looks like that number from which you put out there was
about 910,000 this quarter, yet you only had 830,000 wholesale units. That's a difference of about 77,000. If I look over
the last four quarters at that delta, it's never got above 26,000 units. Is there something different going on with either
the volume of rental programs, how much they want to do as a program versus risk cars? Is there anything with GM
Financial's leasing business that's going to affect recognition of a wholesale sale? And then kind of how does that play
out going forward? [indiscernible] (41:02) essential program business outside of daily rental?

Page 10 of 18
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah. I think your question was around the difference between production and wholesales
this time versus.
<Q - Brian A. Johnson>: No, actually the difference between dealer sales and dealer inventory build and wholesale
sales.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Okay. Well as.
<Q - Brian A. Johnson>: Walking at it a different way than from production.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah, as vehicles are sold to daily rental, while the revenue and associated costs are
reversed and then amortized over the anticipated life of that buyback agreement, the deliveries are counted in the
quarter when they're delivered to the rental. So that would answer the first question. Relative to the dynamic with daily
rental, first – the first half of the year is the typical seasonal pattern. If you look over the last few years there's always a
fairly significant difference between production and wholesales, especially in the second quarter. I would also say the
dynamic within daily rental, to your other comment, has changed a bit. We are taking advantage of our strong residual
values, used car values and putting more in repurchased, so that we can control that and control that inventory as it
comes out. Our overall fleet penetration is relatively flat year-over-year so from a total sales perspective, so there's no
dynamic there that is an anomaly. It's just timing and more repurchase versus risk unit.
<Q - Brian A. Johnson>: Okay. Because as I look at some of, at least our estimates, about a big chunk of your results
versus our models seem to be 30K wholesale units, and what I'm hearing is, you're doing more program business with
rental car companies and that's going to affect the timing therefore of the wholesale sales.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Correct.
<Q - Brian A. Johnson>: On a more strategic, in China, I think this is the second quarter in a row we've seen a
year-over-year gain in earnings. Margins are holding up. I do know you sent a new executive to China last year. And
maybe from the point of view of Mary, what do you think's driving this improvement in the equity income from China?
And in particular, maybe it's a Dan Ammann question as well. Is there a mandate now to actually not just hold market
share in China but to grow equity, income and profits?
<A - Mary T. Barra>: There's definitely a mandate to do that. There continues to be huge growth potential when you
look across the globe. I know people talk about China slowing, but it still is a huge opportunity from a growth
perspective. And if you look at some of what's fueling that is the SUV that we've recently launched. But there's still
much more work to do and opportunity when you look across the Chevrolet portfolio, the Buick portfolio, which
continues to be strong. And then the Cadillac portfolio, that's doing well as well. So we're really investing in not only
building the brands, but then also at my first trip there at the beginning of the year, and I think it was reinforcing
messages of the past, as the market grows, we need to participate in that growth in cases in a disproportionate fashion
to make sure that we're seizing the opportunity. So I think the team has really come together and look for every
opportunity. We continue to have our plans to increase capacity and continue to build the brand. So I expect that trend
to continue.
<Q - Brian A. Johnson>: And was there one thing specific that maybe added to the bottom line there, or was it just a
bunch of actions?
<A - Mary T. Barra>: I think it's a number of actions. I think it was again somewhat product driven, somewhat driven
by the focus of the team, and the clear expectations laid out, and the work that we need to do and convey as it relates to
the brands. I think Cadillac is also significant as well.
<Q - Brian A. Johnson>: Now, you're guiding to margins lower in second half, 9% to 10% versus 11%. Is that just
seasonality, product program launches and kind of – should we be thinking about the 10%-ish margin going forward on
a full year basis?

Page 11 of 18
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah. 10% is ballpark, the right number to think about on a full year basis. There's
seasonality in China. Typically Q1's stronger than Q2. We're holding to 10% EBIT margins on a go-forward basis. As
we've indicated, we expect the growth of Cadillac and launch of a number of SUVs to be a tailwind from a margin
perspective. But, as you know, the market in China from a pricing perspective on carryover is challenging; roughly 3%
per year net price deterioration. So, we will hold our margins by improving mix and continuing to drive cost efficiency
to offset those price headwinds. That's the broad strokes of the plan, Brian.
<Q - Brian A. Johnson>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah.
Operator
Thank you, sir. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS. Please proceed.
<Q - Colin Langan>: Oh, great. Thanks for taking my question. Can you give any – you said the cadence of earnings
is the same, but it does look like restructuring is a little bit more even through the year. I mean, how should we think
about the restructuring? Is the $1.1 billion for the year still good or is it actually coming in a bit lower than you were
thinking?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah, Colin. To your first comment, I think what we said was, in the second half we expect
earnings to be better than in the first half. So, not equal on a cadence perspective. And then from restructuring, we
talked about the $1.1 billion for the year. I would say in the first half of the year, we're generally on track on a run rate
basis to that $1.1 billion. The biggest driver of that is the restructuring events in Germany and that is pretty flat
quarter-to-quarter. So, I don't think that there's a material difference in the second half versus the first half on
restructuring.
<Q - Colin Langan>: And how should we think about the restructuring potential in GMIO, obviously with the end of
Chevy in Europe? What are the plans for that plant that was supplying the Chevy products?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: We continue to look at optimizing our footprint in Korea associated with the volume down
take. I would say for the year restructuring of costs in IO are in the range of $100 million to $150 million. It's really
largely dependent on voluntary separation programs and we work through that, and we'll continue to work through that
over the next number of years.
Australia, as we indicated before, we will continue to work through that restructuring between now and 2017, and that
will be part of the run rate that I talked about before where we would expect in the range of $400 million to $500
million, if you're restructuring on an ongoing basis.
<Q - Colin Langan>: Okay. And just one last one, can you clarify when you talked in the past about mid decade, that
doesn't mean 2015, is that correct when we think about both Europe getting back to profitability in the North America
10% margin? Or is that the right way to think about it, as somewhere in that range is the way to think about it?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah. The way to think about it is mid decade. I'm not going to get any more specific than
that, Colin, except to say this: we are on track and executing to the North American plan. If you look at the last four
quarters on a year-over-year basis, our margins are up excluding recalls 150 basis points. Clearly, we feel more
optimistic and forward leaning in Europe, because we've changed our guidance from breakeven mid-decade to profit by
mid-decade. We continue to work it extremely hard, but I would say for both of those commitments, we are on track.
<Q - Colin Langan>: Okay. All right. Thank you very much.

Thank you, sir. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America Merrill
Lynch. Please proceed.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Good morning. I just wanted to follow up on the product cadence and the cadence of earnings
that you're expecting in the second half of this year, particularly in North America. And Chuck, specifically and Mary,
it seems like there is an over focus in the market that you're sort of it's a one and done product cadence with the K2XX,
Silverado and SUV launches. But there's a lot more to the product launches as far as I can tell. And I'm just curious if
you can maybe either confirm or comment on the product launches going forward? And it seems like the HD launches
will benefit the second half of this year and the first half of next year. And then, over the next two years, you have the
launches of the small crossovers, the large crossovers and some mid-size sedans here in North America that should be
real positive as the market remains tight. So, I just curious if you can comment on that statement and really just
concerned that you're sort of a one and done product cycle here, because it just seems very misguided right now.
<A - Mary T. Barra>: Yeah. Couple points on that. First, you're absolutely correct, especially, when as you look at
our full-size trucks, there's more coming as we continue to look through the lifetime of the K2XX. I'm not going to get
out in front in announcing – I'm going to stick to our announcement cadence, but there's definitely more substantial
things coming to enhance the K2XX over its lifecycle. Also, I think the importance of the mid-size trucks that come out
later this year and then, as Chuck has said, there's clearly a strong cadence of products coming out over the next couple
years that I think – they've had the ability to have the complete focus of our work on material costs for those products
and optimization of, you'll say revenue and the cost aspects of it. So, you're correct, it's not just a one and done. There's
significant more coming not only for the K2XX, which we understand is very significant to heavy duty et cetera, but
other products as well.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Okay. And then just a second question Mary, on following up on all the recall activity and
sort of the re-measurements you seem to be viewing and sort of everything you've been digging up. There's always
been a question with GM's IT systems and your ability to really measure and metricise in response to things like these
recalls. And I'm just curious as you're going through this process, if there's anything you really think you might need to
revamp more on a structural basis on the IT systems in GM, so you can understand better and more quickly what's
necessarily going on the company.
<A - Mary T. Barra>: I'm not sure I completely understand your question, but as it specifically relates to recalls, I
mean I think there's a data, the ease of which data's available, but I'm not going to pin it on IT systems. I mean, it's
clearly the strong process that we need to have within the company that's process driven, people driven. And I think
we've addressed that completely with the creation of the Jeff Boyer organization. And the way that's structured, the way
that operates across the company, I would also say the way that we really, in that area, are comprehensively looking at
data to understand what the customer is seeing or experiencing, whether it comes directly from customer calls, e-mails
our Customer Engagement Center, warranty information, legal claims. Also, we have a team that just mines data off the
Internet to make sure we understand as customers raise issues.
So that is comprehensive and we're doing that. Now there's an opportunity to do that better, and our IT team is working
hand-in-hand with Jeff, because we feel – and actually we've bought in outside expertise as well to make sure we've got
the right tools to more quickly be able to mine data and spot trends or see connect points. So there's an IT aspect of it
and we're well underway doing that and we'll continue to just advance that. But I think the most important point to
make sure that we're looking across and understand what's happening with our vehicles, is the way we've completely
changed the organization, changed the process they follow and made it very clear to the entire organization what the
expectations are.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Right.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: And If I could, John, just to speak a bit to the financial systems in IT and I think you've
seen this. There has been a significant improvement in that over the last two or three years along with the finance
transformation and IT transformation and obviously more work to go. But starting with country of sale reporting,
product line profitability, we're launching globally, profitability on a VIN level basis. We're building an enterprise data
warehouse with a business intelligence group, so there's a lot of work that's been going on and we'll continue to go on

from specifically a financial perspective, so that we can get the right data, analyze it quickly, and react and I think that
we're well along the way on that.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: And we're looking forward to the VIN level profitability if you'll disclose it to us.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: We won't.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: One last question on subprime, particularly because GM Financial has a big exposure there.
There's obviously a great debate in the markets right now of this subprime being overheated for auto lending. It doesn't
necessarily appear that way to us. I was just curious if you can comment on sort of your exposure to subprime, what
you think of it right now and is it more of an issue or an opportunity?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah, that's a good question. It's been interesting. Our share of subprime actually has come
down, because for a while there was a competitive move into subprime, so it was being reasonably well served. It
looked like in the second quarter that there was a back off from that a little bit perhaps because of the exposures. Let's
just say this, AmeriCredit, now GM Financial are experts in subprime. They never lost money during the downturn in
2008, 2009. They know how to manage and score these customers. And I think that they manage an appropriate level
of risk associated with subprime. And again, as they expand their overall product offering, so we feel that that's a very,
very well managed segment of their business.
<Q - John J. Murphy>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yep.
Operator
Thank you, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Archambault from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed,
sir.
<Q - Patrick K. Archambault>: Yeah. Thank you. Good morning. I guess a couple for me. I mean, just first, I think
there was some production constrains, I think referenced towards the beginning of the call when we were discussing the
cadence of margins and the overall North America performance. So, maybe we could get into that. Obviously, just the
newer truck models and SUV models that are rolling off, how far are you away from the true run rate of production?
And as we think about – how do we think about that and how meaningful it is in subsequent quarters?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah. I would say it's not an overall system production constraint, more specific mix. We
talked about this before. The higher penetration trim levels, the crew cab versus double cab versus regular cab mix have
performed much better than we expected. We've been working hard in the first half of the year with suppliers, with
engineering to address these bottlenecks. What we currently have right now from a full-size SUV perspective are some
constraints on Escalade, up-level Escalade and Denali, the Yukon Denali. But we're going to continue to work through
that. We have the expectation that we will be able to free up some of those trim constraints as we go into the second
half of the year. So it's not like an overall capacity, but more specific up level trim constraint that we've had and I think
that's going to be net a positive benefit in the second half versus the first half.
<Q - Patrick K. Archambault>: Okay. That's helpful clarification. And then my follow-up was just on Brazil and
Latin America specifically. I know you did address it a little bit, but I wasn't sure if some of the color you provided was
GMIO, so maybe can we just, at the risk of repeating some of that, can we talk about sort of what the anticipation is
sort of for the back half? I'd also be curious specifically, are there concerns about inventory levels there? It's one of the
things that we've been hearing about with the general buyers strike going on ahead of the elections; people are just
stuck with a lot of stock that they need to get rid of in the second half. Thank you.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah. Let's talk about Brazil, South America. Clearly, the first half of the year impacted by
Venezuela; fundamentally no production and we're carrying all the fixed costs associated with that. There has been –
I'm not getting overly optimistic, but there has been some positive movement recently relative to currency releases. It
looks like we will be able to put some level of production in the second half of the year in Venezuela, so that would be

one of the drivers of the second half versus the first half performance.
The big question mark for us right now, is how does Brazil and Argentina – how do those industries perform going
forward whether there's just a hangover from the World Cup and things are going to normalize. It appears that the
government is trying to be supportive of the industry by holding off on raising IPI tax. So, we're optimistic that there is
some upside in the second half in Brazil and Argentina. I think the key thing is that we continue to execute the plan that
we laid out and drive efficiency and fixed costs. We continue to do restructuring there and take people out of the
system and optimize manufacturing. We're continuing to drive localization and improve logistics.
And relative to your question on inventory specifically, we saw that coming and part of the challenge in the second
quarter on the South American earnings, specific to Brazil is, we took a lot of production out in the second quarter in
advance of the World Cup, because fundamentally the country shut down. So we tried to get out in front of that
inventory issue in the second quarter.
<Q - Patrick K. Archambault>: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan. Please proceed.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I think that the North America margin
of 9.2% ex recall likely tracked below some of the higher end expectations. At the same time, I think investors believed
that you would be cyclically helped by product cadence in 2014 to such an extent that your margin ex recall would
likely decline next year. You've said before though that you think that in the march toward reaching by mid-decade a
run rate of margin that approximates 10% over the course of a business cycle that the intention would be to earn higher
and higher margins each year till you get to that goal. So, my question is, if investors are modestly disappointed today
with the current GMNA margin, because they think it's benefiting from a peaking product cadence, what can you tell
them that would give them the confidence in the mid-decade target that you repeated today, you have conviction? And
it seems like in Mary's response earlier to a similar question, she somewhat disputed the fact that product cadence is
currently peaking. What other margin drivers are there out there that are going to help you? If you could please just
kind of walk us though those multi-year drivers and trajectory of margin in a way that would make us excited.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yes, thanks, Ryan. First, I would say, look at the track record of execution going back to
2012 through today. And we've been pretty clear that our objective was to grow from 7% to 7.5% EBIT margins by 300
basis points and it was going to be over a multi-year period tranched in 100 basis points roughly over a three-year
timeframe more or less. Count – to date, for the last 12 months, we've grown margins in North America 150 basis
points on a year-over-year basis ex recalls, so we're executing to the plan.
As Mary indicated and I've talked about before, our launch cycle – our launch cadence over the next four years is going
to be at twice the pace it was in the previous four years. So it's not a one and done with the full-size trucks. As we
talked about the glide path, the first tranche of the margin expansion was going to be driven to a large extent by
launches; the second tranche really around cost and efficiency, primarily manufacturing footprint, the SG&A initiatives
we have with global business services, IT transformation and material cost and logistics optimization. And those are all
in execution mode.
And then the final driver of margin expansion was really around fully leveraging the business and that was the
expansion of GM Financial, that was growing our customer care and after sales business by expanding our reach in the
after sales market beyond traditional dealer parts with F&I products gap, extended warranty and that was really by fully
leveraging global connected customer and our capability with 4G LTE and our ability to manage the customer. So this
has been a laid out plan since 2012. We're executing to it and we're one-third of the way through it, and we've put the
numbers on the board thus far that we talked about. And that's why we're confident that we're going to continue to
execute to that plan.

<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Okay, great. Thanks. And then just my second and final question. It looks like you're
making progress on reducing your losses in consolidated international operations. I thought maybe the moves that you
were making there relative to Chevrolet in Europe would benefit earnings for GM Europe, but pressure consolidated IO
as you take out production before you take out capacity.
I know that consolidated IO is more than Korea so there's a lot of moving pieces. But it would seem that the stopping of
the export of Chevrolet vehicles might actually have improved profitability suggesting that the variable contribution on
those vehicles might have even been negative.
Can we look forward to maybe another leg in improved profitability for consolidated IO as you go ahead and now take
out that capacity that's no longer needed to support those vehicles that were previously exported?
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Well first, Chevrolet Europe results were reported in, and continue to be reported in the IO
sector. So by itself as we wind down Chevrolet, you would expect that to be ultimately a net positive. As a matter of
fact in the second quarter, part of the fixed cost improvement that we saw in IO was driven by reduced fixed costs
related to Chevrolet Europe.
At the same time we created a fairly significant capacity issue for ourselves in Korea that we need to deal with. We
took roughly 200,000 units of Chevrolet Europe volume out. That created a underutilized footprint, and we're working
to address that. That's got a bit longer tail on it to get fully addressed. We're going to have to manage through that as we
go forward.
For me, from an international operations perspective, the key that's going to change the dynamic from a – significantly
change the dynamic from a earnings trajectory perspective is going to be product. And we are working very hard on an
emerging market portfolio. That's first and foremost. Then get the business model, the infrastructure right around that
portfolio and then make sure that at the market dealer network, the brands are ready and built to the level so that we can
fully optimize that. So that's kind of the strategic footprint for IO.
<A - Mary T. Barra>: If I can just add to that, I think there – again, with the improvements that we've made from a
financial data availability to manage the business across the country, or across the globe, country by country as we look
at the consolidated international operations, we're really looking at, what does it take to win in those markets, to be in
the core of the market, as Chuck said, to have the right product cadence and then the right systems and business plan
around it? And I think, if you look at several of the last few months of personnel announcements we've made, there's
also a new leadership team across the board that fully understands their responsibility to look at it holistically, but make
sure in each of those countries we have a winning plan centered around product, but broader across the business. And
so we're watching that closely, working with that team.
<Q - Ryan J. Brinkman>: Great. Thank you both for all the color.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Thanks, Ryan.
Operator
Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Hey. Thanks, everybody. So, just my first question was just on the logic of including the majority
of the recall costs in adjusted EBIT, which traditionally was a metric to kind of demonstrate underlying profitability.
And I know the intentions are honorable and you've explained it that unlike other companies and maybe even yourself
in the past, you want to not hide these things and have them upfront and in the adjusted number. But I would imagine
recalling, 29 million recalls is pretty extraordinary. And just the reason why I'm asking is, a lot of investors are owning
your stock on the expectation of let's say real underlying EBIT improvements. And you maybe unintentionally put
yourself in a situation where just holding the underlying profit stable, you could have like a 40% or 50% increase in
EBIT next year, just on not recalling the vehicle again.

<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yes.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: So I'm just – yeah.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: I'm sorry, Adam. Go ahead and finish.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Yeah. So I just wanted to know the thought process and logic there, because it could create some
different, let's say, management expectations versus investor expectations.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Historically we have taken recall campaigns to EBIT-adjusted, and in the first half of this
year we certainly talked about whether we should think about this as a special item or not, but ultimately it boiled down
to a responsibility perspective. Operating management, the management, the senior leadership of this organization were
responsible for those charges, and we wanted to make sure that it was reflected appropriately in EBIT-adjusted for a
number of reasons. I think that the go-forward approach to this as you've seen, as we've got more data and the special
non-cash charge that we took in the second quarter, we're going to accrue recall campaigns on a perspective basis as
sold, which will more closely align with the competition and eliminate some of the volatility that we've seen on a
go-forward basis.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Okay. Can I just ask, is the incentive structure, are there any adjustments to the management
incentive structure though to adjust for that, so that you're not, let's say, rewarded for just non-repeat of recall costs.
<A - Mary T. Barra>: I'm not sure I completely understand your question, Adam but.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Sorry, Mary. Just to clarify, the – my understanding is, a significant proportion of variable
compensation is tied to delta of adjusted EBIT of the company. That's the heart of what I'm asking about.
<A - Mary T. Barra>: Well, look, I think the key is it wasn't treated as a special item. I mean, we don't broadly
comment on executive compensation, other than what we disclose on an annual basis. But I would say, I think we're
responsible, it's our – the basic need to do a recall is, when you – something's wrong with the vehicle from a customer
perspective, and that's the core of the business, and that's how we treated all of the recalls.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: I appreciate that. Just last as a follow-up and I know you won't be able to pinpoint it, but the recall
itself has obviously been a very important stimulus for showroom traffic at dealers. And I was wondering if when you
analyze that and in discussion with your dealers, do you think that the recall activity has been a net positive to your
volume, and the chance to kind of re-engage and rebuild trust and maybe offer a good deal to that extra traffic, or has it
been more neutral or net negative, in terms of volume, just isolating volume? Thank you.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Yeah. One specific data point, on the program that we offered to the ignition switch recall
population, 2.6 million vehicles, to-date, we've sold about 6,600 vehicles under that program. So clearly, that's been a
benefit for us to be able to re-engage with some of these customers that had very old product. I would say our dealers
are doing an outstanding job dealing with all of these customers that are coming in, trying to get their vehicles fixed.
We are working with the dealers to use that as an opportunity to demonstrate that our current products are much
improved versus some of these older, expired architecture vehicles that are being recalled.
I think it's too soon to tell. We need to continue to build that relationship and we're early in the process. But so far our
sales have been resilient; our loyalty rates seemed to be reasonably resilient and we need to continue to focus on putting
the customer at the center and taking care of all these customers that come in to have to have their vehicles repaired.
<A - Mary T. Barra>: Yeah. And just let me add to that, I mean it really is one interaction at a time and I have to
reinforce what Chuck said that the dealers are doing an outstanding job, when you think that as we talked to you at the
end of first quarter, we really did redouble our efforts and really went back deep into the late 1990s specifically as it
related to some of the safety systems related to ignitions, switches to make sure we were doing the right thing. And our
dealers have truly responded. And we do see this. And I've talked to dealers, Alan is clearly talking to dealers to make
sure that we see this as an opportunity to demonstrate the strength of the products that we have available today and the
customer the way that we're focused on the customer and the way that we want to make sure their experience goes well
as they go through this process. And it's a partnership, but it's one at a time. And we still have a lot to go as we look at

the second quarter, or second half of the year, so that will be a huge focus.
<Q - Adam Jonas>: Thanks for that Mary, thanks, Chuck.
<A - Charles K. Stevens>: Thanks a lot, Adam.
Operator
Thank you. And Mrs. Mary Barra, I'll turn the presentation back to you for your closing remarks. Thank you.
Mary T. Barra
Thank you, operator. And I want to start off by saying I really do appreciate the opportunity for both Chuck and I to
answer your questions. As we go forward here, I think we started the conversation by talking about the fact that
General Motors, I think we've demonstrated resiliency as we've gone through this. And I think we'd all agree, it's an
important quality in today's business environment.
But, I want to make it clear that we and the senior leadership and the team at General Motors, we understand that we
have a lot more work to do and we're focused on it. We are working hard to be one of the very best companies in this
industry and we feel and are committed to treating the customer right and making sure they stay at the center of
everything we do, because that's a long-term objective that happens, as I said, one interaction at a time, but we believe
it's key to winning in this business. It isn't a new strategy for us. We rolled out a couple years ago our core values and
the customer being the first and the importance of relationships and then excellence. And we've been consistent as
we've dealt with the issues that we faced in the first half of this year, of staying true to those core values.
And I think it's that sense of purpose that has helped us be able to stay on plan and drive our operating performance
during these first two quarters. I would also say it underpins everything we're doing as it relates to product design, the
way we engineer our vehicles and our power trains, supplier quality, our manufacturing operations and sales and
service. To demonstrate that, I think if you look at the work that's being led out the product integrity organization, or
the way Jeff Boyer is leading the Global Safety team, the work that Alicia is driving in the global quality and the
customer experience, those are all concrete examples of us demonstrating our commitment there.
So, everyone is aligned and I believe we still have a lot that we can do to really unleash the full power of GM and what
we can do to make sure we're putting the customer in the center of everything we do. As we move forward, we're going
to keep this discipline and focus as we repair all the recalled vehicles and also execute a number of other initiatives in
the second half of the year. And then if you look and we just kind of quickly go around the globe here. In China for
example, we have launches of the new Chevrolet Cruze, the Buick Envision which will be Buick's third SUV in
Europe.
We've talked about the strength of the product there and we're going to be launching the second generation of the Opel
Vivaro van and the fifth generation Opel Corsa. And that vehicle has gotten I think very strong reviews and these are
among what we've talked about, the 27 new Opel models coming between 2014 and 2018.
In North America, I am very excited because I think there's a huge opportunity with the Chevrolet Colorado and the
GMC Canyon. These trucks make us the only OEM that does have a full line with mid-size light-duty and heavy-duty
pickups. And we believe this is a huge opportunity to help us grow and conquest, specifically in California, which is
the largest market in the United States for mid-size trucks. We also will have another market share opportunity in the
U.S. when we launch the Chevy Trax early next year.
And I think the Trax is a great example of the way we're leveraging our global products and global scale to grow in key
markets including the United States, Brazil and China. Where it's already on sale, the Trax is proving to be a hit and is
doing very well. In China, it's already the vehicle is number one in the market and it has only been on sale there for
three months and year-to-date deliveries have passed 11,500 units in June.

So those are just a few of the products that kind of reinforce the conversation that we've been having throughout this
call that are in our pipeline. And I think it's important to end the call to talk about product because that truly is the
lifeblood of the company. And I think it's one of the strengths that we've clearly over the last few years demonstrated
that we knew how to do great products that are award winning and received well by our customers around the globe.
And that's what we're here to do. We're here to build great vehicles and to make sure we're doing it in a way that not
only satisfies our customers but really creates a unique experience and exceeds their expectations.
It's also our goal to do that to make sure, and we understand the importance of exceeding customer expectations but
more importantly exceeding our owners' expectations as well. So that's the commitment coming from me and I'll say
it's on behalf of our entire leadership team and we look forward to continuing to demonstrate that as we move forward.
So I appreciate the opportunity and I know we'll have an opportunity to talk soon.
