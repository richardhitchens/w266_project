risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.
Please note that these forward-looking statements reflect our opinions only as of the date of this presentation, and we

press release.
With that, I will turn the call over to Larry.
Lawrence E. Page
Hi, everyone, and thank you for joining us. It's great to be on the call this afternoon. If you are listing online, I hope you
liked our warm-up video. I hear they had a great time making it.
Okay, we had a really strong start to 2013, with Q1 revenue up 31% year on year to $14 billion. I want to give a big
shout-out to the sales teams that made this all possible. We tend to focus on product and engineering, but our business
organization is tremendously strong. They are Google's unsung heroes.
Over the last two years, we've worked hard to increase our velocity, improve our execution, and focus on the big bets
will make a difference in the world. Take Google Now. Our goal is to get you the right information at just the right
time. Launched nine months ago, Now provides boarding passes, delivery updates, and traffic conditions without you
having to ask first. In this quarter, we added movie tickets nicely packaged with directions to the theater.
I am also excited about our Voice Search momentum. Looking for the nearest pharmacy? Just ask Google for directions
and it will deliver them instantly, no typing needed. And you can now ask conversational questions like, "Do I need a
jacket this weekend?" Voice commands are going to be increasingly important. It's just much less hassle to talk than
type.
So in this quarter, we launched Chrome support for Web Speech APIs. Developers can now easily add voice
recognition into their web apps. We expect to see a lot of innovation there.
And lastly, our own Google Play is tremendous. It's being built, and one that's fundamental to the success of the
Android ecosystem. In our first year, we have signed partnerships with all the major movie studios, music labels, and
publishers. And our digital content is available in over 20 countries globally, seven of which we launched in Q1,
including India and Mexico. And last week, we launched a beautiful new UI, with better recommendations, bigger
images, and a simpler way to buy things. Play is already a great product, and we are improving it at a rapid rate.
As devices multiply, it's really important that our products work seamlessly, whatever device you are using at the
moment. It's why I love Google Play. It's a way to buy books, apps, movies, or songs and have them instantly available
on your Android devices, even when you buy it on the web. When you switch devices while reading, your book opens
exactly where you left off.
In the same way, we need to make advertising across devices really simple for our customers. Online advertising has
developed in very device-specific ways, with separate campaigns for desktop and mobile. This makes arduous work for
advertisers and agencies and means mobile opportunities often get missed.
So in February, we launched Enhanced Campaigns, a significant upgrade to AdWords. Nikesh will talk more about that
in a moment, but our goal is simple, to enable advertisers to focus on their audience and their message while we

dynamically adopt their campaigns across multiple devices. I've been very pleased with the rate of progress so far. We
are smoothly moving our huge advertising system and ecosystem on a dime.
In today's multi-screen world, the opportunities are endless. Think about your device. Battery life is a challenge for
most people. You shouldn't need to carry around a charger with you to make it through the day. If your kids spill their
drink on your tablet, the screen shouldn't die. And when you drop your phone, it shouldn't shatter. There is real
potential to invent new and better experiences, ones that are much faster and more intuitive. So having just seen some
of those upcoming products myself, I'm really excited about the potential there. In just under year, they've
accomplished a lot and have impressive velocity and execution.
I want to finish off by talking a little bit about the future. We invest the vast majority of our resources and time in our
core products as well as our big bets, like Chrome, YouTube, and Android. But as CEO, it's also super important to
keep focused on the future. Companies can tend to get comfortable doing what they've always done with a few minor
tweaks. It's only natural to want to work on the things you know. But incremental improvement is guaranteed to be
obsolete over time, especially in technology, where history has shown that there is a lot of revolutionary change. So a
big part of my job is to get people focused on things that are not just incremental.
Take Gmail. When we released that, we were a search company. It was a leap for us to put out an e-mail product, let
alone one that gave users 100 times as much storage as anyone else. It was the same with Android. And it's why we're
investing in what appear to be speculative projects to you today, such as self-driving cars. We found that with
ambitious goals and a committed team, you can make progress pretty quickly. The best people often want to work on
the biggest bets, and there's not much competition because no one else is crazy enough to try.
We started Google Fiber because Sergey thought it would be great to show how size of the Internet access can improve
people's lives. Three years later, our first homes are live in Kansas City. And in the last two weeks, we have announced
plans to roll out the service in Austin and Provo.
And just this week, after three years of development, we started handing over Glass devices to developers. I get chills
when I use a product that is the future, and that happens when I use Glass. Some day we will all be amazed that
computing involved fishing around in pockets and purses.
There are so many opportunities in the world to create technology that makes people's lives better. We are still only at
1% of what's possible. We're really just getting started, and that is why I'm so excited to be here working hard with
Googlers to take our company to the next level.
Thank you, and now I'll turn the call over to Patrick for some detail.
Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Larry. Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you for joining us. So let me dive in by reviewing the details
of our overall business financial performance, so here we go.
Our total gross consolidated revenue grew 31% year over year to $14 billion in Q1. The overall business was down 3%
quarter over quarter, driven by the softness in Motorola Mobility segment specifically. Were it not for currency
fluctuations, our consolidated revenue would have grown 33% year over year, or an additional $96 million, but the
quarter-over-quarter impact was really immaterial.
Google standalone gross revenue grew 22% year over year to $13 billion and was flat quarter over quarter. Google
website revenue was up 18% year over year to $8.6 billion, flat quarter over quarter, with strength across most major
geographies and industries. Google Network revenue grew 12% year over year to $3.3 billion and down 5% quarter
over quarter. The quarter-over-quarter impact was largely due to the effect of advertising policy decisions implemented
during Q4 and in Q1 as well. Other revenue grew 150% year over year to $1 billion and 27% quarter over quarter,
driven by Play Store sales, which also includes both hardware and digital commerce sales.

It's worth noting that a significant part of the sequential other revenue growth is due to the implementation of an
accounting change in our Play app revenue recognition policy. Currency fluctuations had an immaterial impact to
Google standalone revenue both year over year and quarter over quarter.
Turning now to Motorola Mobility, gross revenue was $1 billion. We continue to be very pleased with the velocity of
change at Motorola, as Larry mentioned. For example, this week we closed our sale of the Home business as well as the
Flextronics outsourcing agreement. We're seeing a lot of progress across the board in the transformation of Motorola
Mobility. We're excited about the future, but I wish to remind everyone that results from that segment will continue to
be variable.
At Google, global aggregate paid click growth was strong. We're up 20% year over year and, in fact, up 3% quarter
over quarter. Our aggregate cost per click [CPC] was down 4% year over year as well as down 4% quarter over quarter.
Currency fluctuations had a minimal impact on Q1 CPC growth. And similar to last quarter, as I mentioned, the
advertising policy change affecting Network revenue continued to lower the aggregate paid click growth and improve
CPC growth on a year-over-year basis. In addition, our monetization metrics continue to be impacted by the usual
factors that I've covered many times, including geo mix, channel mix, property mix, and product changes.
Turning now to geography and our geographic performance of the Google standalone business, we continue to see
steady performance across the U.S., the UK, and the rest of the world. In our earnings slides, which you'll find on our
Investor Relations website, you'll see that we've broken down our revenue by U.S., UK, and rest of world to show the
impact of FX and the benefits of our hedging programs. So please refer to those slides for the exact calculations.
Revenue from the U.S. was up 20% year over year to $5.8 billion. The UK was up 21% year over year to $1.4 billion,
which include $20 million of benefits from our hedging program. And in fixed FX terms, the UK actually grew 20%.
Non-U.S. revenue excluding the UK accounted for 44% of our total revenue, or $5.7 billion, up 24% year over year,
which includes a $15 million benefit from our hedging program. And in fixed FX terms, the rest of the world, in fact,
grew 27%.
So coming back at an aggregate level for total consolidated business, other cost of revenue was $2.9 billion in Q1,
excluding stock-based compensation and Motorola restructuring. Our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $3.9
billion, which also exclude our stock-based compensation and Motorola restructuring. And our non-GAAP operating
profit was $4.2 billion in Q1, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin of 30%.
For standalone Google, traffic acquisition costs [TAC] were $3 billion, or 25% of total advertising revenue. Other cost
of revenue was $2.1 billion, excluding $99 million of stock-based compensation. The year-over-year increase was
primarily driven by equipment cost, including: costs associated with the hardware sales on Play; carrier OEM revenue
share, driven by the implementation of our accounting change in our Play app revenue recognition policy that I
mentioned a minute ago; and content acquisition costs.
Non-GAAP operating expenses were $2.5 billion excluding stock-based compensation of $556 million in this case.
And non-GAAP operating profit was strong at $4.4 billion in Q1, resulting in a non-GAAP operating margin for the
Google segment of 34% for standalone. Lastly, depreciation and amortization expense on property, plant, and
equipment for standalone Google was $520 million for this quarter.
At Motorola Mobility, our total non-GAAP operating expenses, including cost of revenues, were $1.2 billion. And keep
in mind that intangible amortization of expenses attributed to standalone Google and Motorola Mobility are, in fact,
included in these non-GAAP measures. Of the $315 million in intangible amortization expense in the quarter, $153
million was the result of the acquisition of Motorola, of which $116 million was allocated to Google and $37 million
was allocated to Motorola Mobility. And as a result, the non-GAAP operating loss for Motorola Mobility was $179
million in Q1, resulting in non-GAAP operating margin of negative 18% for that segment.
Let me turn to head count for the consolidated business. In fact, it was roughly flat for Q1. Keep in mind that
consolidated head count includes the Motorola Home, and Home comprised roughly one-third of the total Motorola
head count. Standalone Google added about 1,200 people. And in total, the consolidated company ended the quarter
around 53,900 full-time employees.

Many of you may have noticed our effective tax rate that was very low, at 8% in Q1. Please note that this quarter the
rate reflects a recognition for the full-year benefit of our 2012 federal R&D tax credit, which Congress extended but
only retroactively in January of this year, so there was a catch-up for the full of 2012 in Q1. Additionally, there has
been the usual mix shift of earnings between domestic and international subsidiaries that continue to impact our tax
rate.
Let me now turn to cash management. Other income and expense was $134 million, which reflects interest income and
realized gains on investments, offset by the continued impact of our FAS 133 expense from our hedging program. For
more details on those OI&E, again, please refer to the slides that accompany this call on our IR website.
We continue to be happy with our strong operating cash flow at $3.6 billion. CapEx for the quarter was $1.2 billion
versus last quarter at $1 billion. And the majority of CapEx spend was related to production equipment, data center
construction, and facilities related purchases.
Our free cash flow was also strong at $2.4 billion. And please note that cash flow CapEx both include the Home
business for now.
And before I hand it off now to Nikesh, I want to say a few words about investing in our future and preparing for the
growth of our businesses. The success of our products and our continued strong performance, as portrayed by Larry's
comments, continue to support our optimism and our confidence to continue funding these strategic growth areas.
These include not only products like Search or YouTube and Android or Chrome, but also our infrastructure as well.
With that, I'll hand it off to Nikesh, who will cover in more details our business performance in the quarter. And after
his remarks, we'll open up the phones for questions. Nikesh, all yours.
Nikesh Arora
Thank you, Patrick.
Our business is continuing to perform well. We had over $13 billion in Google standalone gross revenue. Our core
business is strong across Search and Display, including the continued rise in mobile. I'm particularly pleased by the
positive growth we have continued to achieve in Display. Let's review a few key highlights for the quarter before we
talk in more depth about multi-screens, which Larry alluded to, and brand advertising momentum.
From a regional perspective, growth was fairly stable across the board this quarter. Asia continues to be our fastest
growing region. Southern Europe remained stable despite the continued economic woes in the region, although it has
been a strong sector for us globally, and the cold spring in the UK had led to stronger growth in the retail sector there.
Our shopping business continues to expand, with over 1 billion products listed. This quarter, we rolled out product
listing ads [PLAs] in Europe and also brought them to mobile devices.
I want to mention our policy efforts to ensure that we're working only with the highest quality partners, which Patrick
has already alluded to. We want to make sure we protect users from having bad experiences with websites and online
services. So we've tightened our policies and enforcement in a few areas, like downloadable software applications. All
these steps may impact network revenue in the short term, but they are essential in the long term for a better, safer web
experience for users and to encourage banks to invest more in online marketing and in our network. We strongly
believe what we've done benefits us in the long term.
Shifting gears to our Enterprise business, the Enterprise business continues to experience strong growth across pretty
much all products, regions, and industries. While our SMB segment is growing steadily, we're seeing significant
increase from large global organizations. In fact, 58% of the Fortune 500 are now actively using a paid enterprise cloud
product from Google. Recent wins include: ANA from Japan, their largest airline; Woolworth, with over 200,000 users,
Australia's largest retailer; BMW, which will uses Google Places and Street View in their Ultimate Driving Machines;
and the country of Malaysia that are adopting Google Apps for 10 million students, teachers, and parents. They're going
to deploy Chromebooks to primary and secondary schools nationwide.

Moving on to our marketing efforts, our marketing team continues to execute flawlessly. They have helped
Chromebooks increase their footprint in the U.S., expanding to more than 1,000 Best Buy stores nationwide, which
pretty much doubles the previous number of stores we had. The Samsung Chromebook has been the top-selling laptop
on Amazon since it launched. We've rolled out Nexus 4 in Russia, Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico, and expanded in the U.S.
to 3,000 T-Mobile stores.
I want to focus the rest of my remarks on two continuing trends that present great opportunities for us: first, the shift of
consumers to a multi-screen lifestyle; and second, the ongoing movement of brand dollars online. As Larry has said,
consumers are accessing content interchangeably on many screens throughout the day. Our clients are hungry to
advertise where consumers are. In fact, 95% of our clients have campaigns that run across multiple screens.
In February, working with Susan and Sridhar's team, we rolled out an ad campaign to make it easier for clients to
manage and measure campaigns that reach people across devices. Marketers will be able to deliver ads that are more
relevant to the users' context, using features like offers and proximity bidding. And they will be able to do a better job
of measuring global conversions.
Enhanced Campaigns is an important long-term bet that will help marketers. This is a big change for many of our
advertisers, and we've invested tremendous amounts of time and effort into making the transition as smooth as possible.
In the first two months since launch, more than 1.5 million campaigns have already been upgraded to Enhanced
Campaigns, and these clients are beginning to see great results. We expect to migrate all campaigns that we manage by
the end of the current quarter. While this is a complicated task, it's a great example of our focus on flawless execution
on behalf of our customers.
Now on to Brands; we see great remarketing success stories every day. Nissan Mexico's biggest launch of the year, the
Pathfinder, featured 13 video ads in a new approach to remarketing AdWords to video. Nissan connected their stores
while making sure that users who watched their videos were shown a new one each time. Newer Brand family formats
like our expandable Lightbox ads, our reserved inventory solution are helping clients create beautiful experiences with
sight, sound, and motion.
Over the past year, the number of advertisers using our Google Display Network Reserve option has increased fourfold.
Now we have two-thirds of the top 100 Ad Age brands using those products. This is fairly helpful in developing deep
partnerships with our clients, especially in the branding arena. For example, we're now working directly with adidas in
Germany on a new global branding budget.
Brands are also continuing to use the power of YouTube to help them reach consumers across screens. Today, more
than 1 billion people are finding the channels they love on YouTube every month. Users are now watching over 50
million more hours a day compared to a year ago, a 50% increase.
We had a record year for our Super Bowl Ad Blitz program. Views, votes, watch time, and advertiser participation
were all up from last year. We saw increased engagement across all screens. We had 1.3 million total hours of watch
time of commercials on Ad Blitz. That's the equivalent of the length of 325,000 Super Bowls.
More brands are also using YouTube as a strategic part of their campaign to reach a younger generation. For example,
Chevrolet built awareness for the Chevy Sonic with made-for-digital videos supported by YouTube and Google Apps,
all contributing to the successful launch of this all-new subcompact car.
Our worker brands also help our publisher partners. Our Ad Exchange supports all formats, all screens, and hundreds of
publishers, and continuing to grow well. We're offering new solutions for publishers like Google Consumer Service
and Google Play to help them make money from their content.
In conclusion, I want to thank all Googlers who helped deliver a great quarter and drove our business. This industry is
moving very fast and the opportunities are numerous. We're lucky to have such skilled and hard-working employees to
help drive Google and our partners in the future.
With that, thank you, Patrick.

Patrick Pichette
Thank you, Nikesh. Sean, if you don't mind, we'll start the Q&A session now, so I'll ask you to give us the instructions.
Q&A
Operator
Absolutely, thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC. Please go
ahead with your question.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Okay, two questions, please. First, Patrick, you mentioned this accounting change. But
could you just give us a little bit more detail on what that accounting change was versus Play? And then could you talk
about the TAC trends? I know it's just one part of your business, but it seemed to be moving in different directions on
your own sites, continuing to rise pretty dramatically; but on your network partner sites, falling off pretty significantly.
Can you just help us think about what that should look like going forward for both of those segments? Thanks a lot.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Yes, thank you for your question, Mark. Let's take them in a row. First on the Apps revenue
recognition policy, let me explain what happened there. And I'll use it with an example, if you don't mind. And the way
we did it is we changed the revenue recognition. So if you say you buy an app for $1.00 on the Play Store, $0.70 of that
$1.00 will be paid to the developer and does not impact our fee. Now it didn't before and it still doesn't today, so that
hasn't changed. In the past though, we would have booked the remaining $0.30 on a net of payments to carriers and
OEM, and then book that as gross revenue. Beginning in Q1, however, the entire $0.30 is now booked as gross, and the
payments to the carriers and the OEMs are now booked on other cost of revenue. So that's the big change that has
happened.
And basically, the reason why we did this is as part – as we were looking through the second half of 2012, we were
seeing – these used to be immaterial numbers for us. And then when we saw through the second half of 2012, we
decided to tune our accounting policies and made that change in Q1. So that's the issue of what's going on, on the
revenue recognition. So you'll see the impact both on gross and then, as I said, on other cost of revenue, and then you
get the net. So on a net basis, it doesn't change.
On the TAC issue that you've raised, Mark, then the answer is pretty simple. TAC has dropped overall because of the
change in our ads policies that we've done through Q4 and Q1. So in pushing hard on implementation of our ad policies
to the benefit of the user, the impact of that is actually that it lowered our network revenue, but it also lowered our
TAC, which is tied to AdSense partners in that role.
On our own Google sites, you'll have noticed that it continues to grow, and it grows because mobile grows. So the
volume of mobile in our mix is driving TAC total up. So overall, TAC is down for the quarter on an aggregate basis.
The ad policy changes have driven them down. And then our mobile for our own sites continued to drive them up. But
that's a good story because it means mobile is really continuing to be on fire. So that's the pieces of the puzzle. Thanks
for your questions because it wasn't that easy to understand it at first, but I hope that clarifies the point.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Thank you, Mark. Sean, can we go to our next question, please?

<Q - Ben Schachter>: Larry, in your prepared comments, you spent quite a bit of time discussing the non-core future
products. I was wondering if you could talk about any changes to the amount of resources being invested in Google ex
in these products. And also, can you tell us how you determine the appropriate size of the investments in these various
teams and products? And then just quickly, separately, Knowledge Graph, just in general, if you can give us an update
on the progress and how you measure that progress internally? Thanks.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Thanks, Ben, for the questions. I feel like every time I say anything, I get this question. I
think honestly, my job as CEO is to get people to do those things. If you look at most companies, they never do
anything different, and eventually they run into problems for that reason. So I think that's the common failure mode.
I think that the reality is it's pretty hard to invest significant amounts in new things because actually it's difficult to get
people to do those things. So we have nothing to say differently about our general philosophy of 80% on our core
things. I said that in my remarks basically, though we're still focused on our core products and our big bets, and that's
clearly the vast majority of our resources. We add resources to the new things as we're able to, and that will ensure its
success. But as an investor, [ph] I'm not sure I would hire (31:08). I'm certainly not worried about the expense of that
because I don't think – like I said, it's not easy to spend that much money on the new things. I'd be more worried that
we don't do those things fast enough and build on the revolutionary change that happens in the technology industries.
On the Knowledge Graph, I think there has been tremendous progress there. We've done the internationalization. There
are quality improvements, and we're breeding the kind of questions we can answer, as I mentioned, about weather and
other things, and that happens from improvements to our Knowledge Graph, and I'm very excited about that. And I
think we still have big investments there and you'll still – for a long time, we'll continue to see improved products there.
So can we have our next question?

Our next question comes from Anthony DiClemente with Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Anthony Joseph DiClemente>: Thank you very much, first question for Larry. I'm just wondering if you could
give us your thoughts on the impact of Facebook Home for Android, just given some have talked about the possible
impact on engagement with other Android apps.
And then secondly, and I guess this will be for anyone who wants to take it, I think investors are just wondering about
Enhanced Campaigns that you talked about launching in February. Should we expect any bumpiness or any near-term
dislocation from your advertisers, who are starting to become accustomed to Enhanced Campaigns onboarding to that
platform, with the understanding of the long-term opportunity, of course? Thanks.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Thanks, Anthony. I'll take the first question, and then maybe I'll give the second one to
Nikesh. I think that Google is really focused on building and creating great Android experiences within the strong
ecosystem that we have. And it's really great to see developers really focused on and building for Android. And so I'll
give Nikesh the second question about the Enhanced Campaigns. But I'm certainly, as I mentioned, I think that has
gone pretty smoothly and I'm pretty excited about it.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Got it. Thank you, Anthony. As Larry just said, it was very complicated. We had to train our
sales force around the world, and to launch simultaneously and work with our product team. But so far, the feedback
we've gotten from advertisers, it is positive because it basically takes away a lot of work from them. And we've been
able to migrate 1.5 million campaigns to Enhanced Campaigns.
We also have some great suggestions from our advertisers about what we should do to make it better, and we're
beginning to implement those. So we're hoping that towards the end of this quarter, we should have migrated all of the
campaigns, which are done separately as mobile and separately for desktop, as combined and really offer them the
benefits of location, context screens, all with one campaign. So effectively, I think in the long term, there should be
better ROI.

<Q - Anthony Joseph DiClemente>: Okay, thank you very much.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Sean, why don't we go to the next question, please?
Operator
Absolutely, our next question comes from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Justin Post>: Thank you. My question just is the mobile impact on the business. It looks like your top line
revenues have somewhat stabilized. But how is the transition to mobile impacting your high-level revenue growth over
a period of quarters and also your margins? Maybe you could give us a little help on that.
And then, maybe Larry, could you address the concern that constantly comes up about people using apps versus Google
Search? Obviously, the disclosures you've given suggest revenue on mobile is growing at or above industry. But are
you seeing any pressure from app usage versus search usage on mobile? Thank you.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Yes, thank you, Justin. I think maybe I'll take the second one first. We always get this
question about our apps versus Google Search. So I think I'm not super-concerned about that issue. I think that people
use also apps on the web, although there are many strong sites and so on, so we've been dealing with that issue for a
long time. I think fundamentally, Search is an amazing thing for publishers and software developers and everybody
else, and we deliver a lot of traffic and a lot of users to things. And so I think in general, the information wants to be
found. And we're really working hard to make sure that the user experience is great, and that we're delivering people
into the right places. So I think I feel pretty confident on that in the future level and that we'll get through that just fine.
So the second half of your question?
<A - Patrick Pichette>: The first part of the question was about top line, mobile versus other impacts on the business
and margins. Let me just jump in on this one quickly. And it's really about the new reality where we have all the
multi-screens. And Larry talked about this at length at the last earnings call, where the reality now is it's not about
mobile or tablets or desktop. It's about this unified life that you have where you're always connected. And the question
is are you getting the best answer all the time following me throughout my day? And that's why, in fact, Enhanced
Campaigns is great signal of that, where you're saying hey, let's find the right ad at the right time and the right answer
at the right time for you during your day. So I think that rather than to ask if which small piece part is going to
contribute plus or minus, the real question is are we growing the pie of your day with Google? And in the long term,
are we really contributing to create the best answers both for the advertisers and for your users? And that's really what
we're actually pushing for.
So I think that this trend really presents to us enormous opportunities. And when people ask about what's going on with
TAC, Patrick, what do you think the impact of CPC, on a very specific basis, I think that that's the wrong way to ask
the question. The real right way is the excitement we have about helping you throughout your day on all your devices,
and the pie grows for everybody. And that's the right way to ask the question. So thanks for your question on that,
Justin.
<Q - Justin Post>: Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Why don't we go to the next question, Sean?

Our next question comes from Carlos Kirjner with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Carlos Kirjner>: Thank you for taking my question. I have two. First on Google Fiber, setting aside the user
experience for those who get it, how do you expect Fiber to have major impact given that it will take many billions and
several years to pass something like 20 million U.S. homes? And after all that time and money, you would be at best a
mid-sized provider in a market that accounts for less than half of your current business.

Secondly, on the future of Search, Larry, you mentioned voice commands in your opening remarks. We already get
voice output with Jelly Bean. Put this together with Google Now and Knowledge Graph, do you see a future way to get
the answer to your questions sometimes before you ask it? How do ads come into this view? How do you generate
revenues in a world like this where you guys seem to be going to? Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Why don't I jump on the first question and then I'll let Larry answer the second one. Look, on
Fiber, I think it's really simple. It's very early days. We're totally excited about delivering a great user experience with
faster Internet speed. And gigabit, as Larry said, with Sergey's quest a few years ago, gigabit speed over 100 times
faster than the average American, that is a great user experience, and it's really about pushing for speed and writing the
new chapter, the next chapter of the Internet. So for us, I think we really are excited about this, and that's really what
we're focused on. On the second question, I'll let Larry give his comments.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: I'm glad you're very ambitious too, Patrick, because the fiber industry is not big enough for
you, so I applaud that. I think we'd love to find businesses much bigger than our entire current business to invest in, but
I think there are only a very small number of such companies that even exist. So I think we look at places where we can
provide a lot of fiber. We look at places where we can provide products that can make a really big difference in
people's lives and we can make a lot of money and resources doing it. And I think it certainly meets that criterion,
although as Patrick said, it's very early days.
On the voice stuff and knowing what people want before they ask for it and how do we make ads in that, how do we
make revenue and ads in Network, I'm not worried about that at all. We've been doing this for a long time. And in fact,
we really view – the reason we've been successful at doing advertising is we view that as another source of information.
So the search ads that we show have to be very relevant to make sense to you at that moment. And the more – the better
job we can do in providing you information, even without you asking for it, the better we can also provide commercial
information to you that people are excited about promoting to. And I think that's actually a huge, huge opportunity for
us. We're all about making things more efficient, about getting the right information to the right people at the right
time. And that's all going to improve in the kind of world that you were talking about. Thanks, can we have our next
question?
Operator
Our next question comes from Scott Devitt of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Scott W. Devitt>: Hi, thanks. I have two, please, the first one for Nikesh. You recently discussed the opportunity
for online advertising to exceed 50% of total advertising in the next five years, and you referenced video and
Internet-connected devices as catalysts. It's a big number, so I was just wondering if you could talk about that in a little
more depth and the way Google products actually serve as catalysts for that change?
And then secondly for Larry, could you just discuss the transition in Android management and what exactly Andy
Rubin is going be doing now that he has a new role? Thank you.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Okay, Nikesh. You want to take the first one?
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Sure. Scott, thanks for your question. I think what I was referring to was the fact that I believe in
the next few years, we will see connected TVs everywhere and we will be able to address a TV using IP. When that
begins to happen, I think the products we have in place, where we can dynamically serve ads which are more
personalized, which look more like information on display platforms or video platforms, is going to be very relevant.
So I think over time, the television industry shifts to a more addressable, more personalized, more IP-addressable type
of platform. And I think that we're well positioned in that space, given our large focus and emphasis on brand, given
our huge technology efforts that Susan's team does around Display and Video, and really getting our sales force
working really well with various brand advertisers around the world. So we're preparing for that eventuality, and we
hope it comes sooner than later.

<A - Lawrence E. Page>: And on the management change question, I think, as we've already said, we've really
exceeded the crazy ambitious goals we dreamed of for Android. It's the most used mobile operating system in the
world, and a really big thanks to Andy for that. And he really decided it was time to hand over the reins and start a new
chapter at Google. And we actually haven't actually decided what that is, and I'm not going to make news today on that.
And absolutely going forward. Sundar is going to lead Android in addition to his existing work on Chrome and Apps.
And he has a great talent for creating products that are really technically excellent yet easy to use, and he loves a big
bet too. So we said all that before. But I think we've had a very smooth transition, and I'm personally excited about the
future.

Operator
Our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Ross A. Sandler>: Thank you, guys. I had a couple questions about Google Glass. Larry, we had a chance to try
out Glass a few weeks ago, and we think you guys really nailed it, so congrats to the team. But can you talk about the
overall strategy with Glass? How do you plan to build out the ecosystem for third-party developers? What do you see
as the biggest function that Glass could address for users? And then do you expect the $1,500 price tag to come down
to a level that's more mainstream, or is this likely to remain a higher-end luxury device? Thanks.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Yes, thanks, Ross. I'm glad you're excited about Glass. I am too. I would say it is early days
on the product. We're just handing over small numbers so far. I think that we're probably pretty good at third-party
ecosystems with our experience on Android and a bunch of other areas, so I'm not too worried about that. There has
been lots of speculation on that, I would say it's all early. And I think the price tag was set for developers for our early
tests. We don't have any news to announce there, but it was clearly – I'm not sure I'd call it a luxury price, but certainly
a pretty high price.
I think that what I like doing with my Glass, I think, what will people do with Glass? I really – I find the photo taking,
the video, phone calling, quick messaging, directions ought to be a pretty amazing experience. And that's some of our
core functionality we've built into the device. We're excited to really get it out to some developers and have other
people create some amazing experiences with it which we haven't thought of yet. But like I said, it still early days but I
think it's very exciting. Our next question, please?

Our next question comes from Brian Pitz of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Brian J. Pitz>: Thanks. You mentioned expansion in the PLA ad format during the call. Would you give us a
sense for how maybe CPCs on these PLAs compares to the overall average and what kind of trends you're seeing; and
perhaps any comments on the current mix of CPC versus cost per action or conversions, and any incremental data on
how they perform? Thanks.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Hi, this is Nikesh. So I guess on PLA, so far we have been very excited we have over 1 billion
items in the product listing ads, and we just launched it in Europe. It's too early for us to share numbers on that topic.
But so far, all I could say is it's been neutral. There has been no impact that we'd like to share at the current moment.

Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Great, thanks for taking the questions. I just want to ask two things. Nikesh, you talked
about Southern Europe being stable in terms of macro. Just curious if over the last three months if you have seen any
changes at all in macro across the U.S. or Europe?
And then secondly, Patrick, if you could just talk about how you think about the longer-term margins on the Google
segment, that would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: All right, Nikesh, you've spent a lot of time in Europe due to the nice weather there.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Nice hasn't been more recently, Larry. Q1 was pretty dismal from a weather perspective.
Douglas, thanks for the question. I think, as I said, Southern Europe has been stable because there has been concern at
the macro level in Southern Europe, but our business has been stable. I think the macro conditions have been going on
for a while.
As far as the U.S. and Europe, I don't think there was anything out of the ordinary that we saw as it relate to our
business results. Our teams continue to execute and we continue to engage with advertisers across the board, large and
small. And we haven't seen any shift in those trends.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Let me jump on the second part of the question. Look, it's very clear. We care about revenue
growth. We care about profitability. And as we've said before, we're not in the business of money-losing businesses. So
regarding margin, for us what really matters is every incremental profit dollar creates shareholder value. And we're
focused on growing these profit dollars rather than the specific of the average aggregate margin.
So if you have a business for us that can be a $20 billion business that has a much lower margin than ours but
contributes a couple billion to the bottom line of the company, what's not to like, especially if it's rather capital-light?
And these are the areas that we're – in addition to our core business. Exploring – and by the way, they have a great
symbiotic relationship. When you have devices that are magical and that feed within our core software businesses,
there's this magical relationship as well that continues to enhance our offering. So the real trick there is to keep focused
on dollar margin pools, dollar margin and revenue, and then not worry too much about where the aggregate shows up
because it's all good for the shareholders.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: I should say, of course, we always look for businesses that have very high margins and high
revenues, of course, too. Let's take our next question.
Operator
Our next question comes from Heather Bellini of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: Hi, great. I just had a couple questions. One, I was just wondering if you could talk a little
bit about what you guys can do to help prevent Android fragmentation, if you can give us your views there?
And then on Fiber, I had a follow-up. If maybe you could go beyond the obvious, which is the obvious benefits that
people are getting in the cities that you've already rolled out to, if you could maybe help us think about the types of
services or offerings that you guys see as being possible as this becomes more broadly deployed?
And then lastly, especially given your prior comments on capital-light, I was just wondering how we should think about
your appetite for CapEx for Fiber? Thank you.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Yes, thanks, Heather. I guess I can talk a little bit about Android. This is Larry. And I think
that – I've actually had the pleasure recently of using a bunch of different Android phones from different
manufacturers. And the experiences are a bit different. Maybe the return -menu-back button is on different sides, there
are things like that. There are differences like that which are somewhat fragmented. But I find I have a pretty great
overall experience and there's a lot of innovation; and that the platform is moving really quickly, and that's how we

designed it.
So I think that's – and in the negative sense that's fragmentation, and the positive sense it's innovation and flexibility for
the different users of the Android ecosystem. So I think, actually, it's working pretty well. And we obviously evolved
the ecosystem to make sure – making sure that users get a really great experience and making sure – paying attention to
that and making sure that works well, so I think we're actually doing a pretty good job. I think on Fiber, you had some
questions on Fiber. I think Patrick can address that.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: Yes, I think that the thesis is not only about the future, but it's really a lot about today. Speed
matters today. When you wait for three seconds to get your YouTube video today with your current provider, that is a
terrible answer. And we think that Fiber and the services we offer in Kansas City today actually goes a long way to
solving a lot of today's frustrations, independent of tomorrow's.
In addition to that, our Kansas City offer that we have is already quite differentiated in offering an amazing service, for
example, with storage, with 2 terabytes of storage available and another in the cloud that really not only is about speed,
but it's about a package that says you should have abundance. And with abundance, then the third piece of it, which is I
think where you were going, is if the excitement of what the developer community can actually create for a world that
is, in fact, at blazing speed and with an abundance of storage.
So I think it's already today answering a big need. It's already today quite differentiated, and it is just laying the path for
what should be the next change of the Internet. And I think that you see it in Kansas City with so many developers
moving to Kansas City to actually create this coming world just gives you a glimpse of all the opportunities that are out
there, and that's why we're very excited about it. I think it's a...
<Q - Heather A. Bellini>: That's great. Thank you. And I was just wondering if you could help us think about the
appetite for CapEx?
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Look, we're going to look at these businesses as we would look at any business and make
appropriate investments. I think that, obviously, we know what's going on with that business. And like I said, it's early
days. We're excited about it, and we'll continue to evolve that. But as I said earlier too, it's difficult. Even if you wanted
to spend a lot of money on these things, I think [ph] there's a difficulty to that (53:29). So I think that's also good to
keep in mind how things have a natural rate of growth that makes sense. We've done pretty well with that over time.

or two.

Okay. Our next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Stephen Ju>: Thanks very much. So, Larry, can you give us some sense of how much incremental engagement
you think you can see for Google's products with new form factors like Glass and I guess watches as we look over out
of the next three to five years? And how transportable is Android across these new form factors in terms of getting
OEMs and other operators beyond just the smartphones and tablets to adopt it?
And, Nikesh, thanks for the number of campaigns on the Enhanced Campaigns platform. I'm now wondering like what
percent of your advertisers do you think have optimized their sites for content delivery across multiple devices. And
when do you think we'll get greater ability for attribution across mobile and desktop? Thank you.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Thank you, Stephen. Those are a lot of questions. I think we've got them all straight. Let's
see, so incremental engagement from Google's products from Glass and so on, and watches and things. I think that
computers are now a pretty big part of people's lives, so I think that's increasing as it gets more and more useful. And so
the amount of time, you only have 24 hours in a day, so there's some limit to that. But I think more importantly, the

usefulness of your engagement is going to increase. So right now, while you're just using your computer or your phone
or your tablet or whatever, and you're bored, maybe you'll be less bored and more productive or enjoy what you're
doing more and see more meaningful engagement. And I think that can result in much better business results and
happier people and all that. I think, obviously, Glass runs on Android, so it has been pretty transportable across devices,
and I think that will continue. I think, Nikesh, do you want to address the Enhanced Campaigns a little bit?
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Yes, thank you, Stephen, for your question. I think what's important to note is before we launch
our Enhanced Campaigns journey in February, we have been very actively working for the last year plus on our GoMo
campaign, which is GoMobile, because clearly, the first part of anybody leveraging their mobile website is to have one.
So we've spent a lot of time working with our advertisers and partners out there, both to get them online and also to get
them mobile. I think the Enhanced Campaigns then was a logical step.
Beyond that, because once you have mobile capability, once you have mobile sites and desktops, we want to make sure
that you can get best ROI across those things. I think that we're still working on this. We're still down in the journey.
We have a significant number of our early adopters onto Enhanced Campaigns. And as I said, we intend to get them all
migrated in the next few months, in the next 10 weeks actually. So that should be pretty good.
In terms of future, I think we also alluded to the fact that some of the things we are offering them are things like
proximity bidding and offers. So it's more about first getting them to leverage their current capabilities, but then also
giving more context and more location, which hopefully generates more ROI in the future.
<Q - Stephen Ju>: Thank you.
<A - Patrick Pichette>: And we have time for one last question. Sean, who is getting our last question?

Our final question comes from Neil Doshi with Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Neil A. Doshi>: Great, thanks for squeezing me in. Larry, could you talk a little bit about online/mobile to offline
attribution and what Google is doing to help bridge that gap to help advertisers realize ROI?
And then, Nikesh, can you just give us an update as to how far you are through the ads changes policy with your
network partners? Is that pretty much all done now, or is there more to go there? Thanks.
<A - Lawrence E. Page>: Thanks, Neil, for your question. I think maybe Nikesh has the answer on both of these. I
think our business has always been about attributing advertising spending and results accurately. And our sales success
at our company is really based on that one thing. So we're paying a lot of attention to those questions. Nikesh, take it
away.
<A - Nikesh Arora>: Neil, thanks for the question. Thank you, Larry. I guess what's the important part is we have
been working and we have hundreds of studies now working with our advertisers to actually look at both the offline
and online impacts. And one of the recent things we did is online-to-store is we've helped people understand how their
online campaigns are driving more and more people into store, which is most often offline activity. We also look at the
entire customer journey. We look across media sector events to show how you can run a campaign in the offline world,
how you can add online to it, and what kind of attribution that gets you in both offline media as well as online media.
So we do a bunch of stuff like that. Our research team is working with external research organizations, so I think we
have a reasonably robust practice there working with our advertisers.
And in terms of the update, in terms of the ads policy changes, we have implemented all of our ads policies. We
obviously have worked with almost all of our network partners. They understand our policies. Many of them have
made changes. I think we should be done with most of the transition. But of course, the effect of this policy change will
continue to happen throughout the rest of the year.
