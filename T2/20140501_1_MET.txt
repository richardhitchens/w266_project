MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like to thank you for standing by and welcome to the MetLife first quarter 2014 earnings
release conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we'll conduct a
question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. As a reminder, this conference call is being
recorded.
Before we get started, I would like to read the following statement on behalf of MetLife. Except with respect to
historical information, statements made in this conference call constitute forward-looking statements within the
meaning of the federal securities laws, including statements relating to the trends in the company's operations and
financial results and the business and the products of the company and its subsidiaries. MetLife actual results may
differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of risks and uncertainties,
including those described from time to time in MetLife's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission,
including the Risk Factors section of those filings.
MetLife specifically disclaims any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of
new information, future developments or otherwise.
With that, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Ed Spehar, Head of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.
Edward A. Spehar
Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to MetLife's first quarter 2014 earnings call. We will be
discussing certain financial measures not based on generally accepted accounting principles, so called non-GAAP
measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures and related definitions to the most directly comparable GAAP
measures may be found on the Investors Relations portion of MetLife.com in our earnings press release and our

quarterly financial supplements. A reconciliation of forward-looking financial information to the most directly
comparable GAAP measure is not accessible because MetLife believes it's not possible to provide a reliable forecast of
net investment income and net derivative gains and losses, which can fluctuate from period to period and may have a
significant impact on GAAP net income. Joining me this morning on the call are Steve Kandarian, Chairman, President
and Chief Executive Officer; and John Hele, Chief Financial Officer.
After their prepared remarks, we will take your questions. Also here with us today to participate in the discussions are
other members of management, including Bill Wheeler, President of the Americas, Chris Townsend, President of Asia,
and Michel Khalaf, President of EMEA, and Steve Goulart, Chief Investment Officer.
With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Steve.
Steven A. Kandarian
Thank you, Ed, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report solid first quarter results with operating earnings
of $1.6 billion, which exceeded our plan. Favorable investment margins and well-controlled expenses more than offset
fluctuations in underwriting and a $57 million after-tax charge to settle a licensing matter in New York. We anticipate
that underwriting margins will improve and consider the New York settlement to be an unusual item. While operating
earnings were better than our expectations, results were down 4% from our strong first quarter last year. Operating
earnings in the prior year quarter benefited from a weaker dollar and stronger equity market returns. Operating earnings
per share were $1.37, a 7% decrease from the prior-year period. Performance on a per-share basis was dampened by the
conversion of equity units issued in 2010 to fund the acquisition of Alico. The final $1 billion tranche of equity units
will convert in October of this year. Operating return on equity was 11.4% in the quarter.
First quarter operating earnings benefited from strong variable investment income driven by returns in private equity.
The operating earnings impact from variable investment income was $63 million above the top end of our expected
range or $0.06 per share. Investment margins had been resilient despite a prolonged period of low interest rates. Our
margins continue to benefit from effective asset liability management, good variable investment income and income
from derivatives, many of which were purchased in the mid-2000s to protect earnings in a low interest rate
environment.
Lower operating expenses had a positive impact on earnings in the quarter, driven by expense control in all three
geographic regions: the Americas, Asia and Europe, Middle East and Africa. We feel good that our cost saving
initiatives are translating into improved bottom-line results. Underwriting margins were lower than expected in Retail
Life and Group, Voluntary and Worksite Benefits largely because of adverse mortality. We believe underwriting
margins will improve for two reasons: first, our analysis suggests that most of the adverse experience in the first quarter
was the result of normal volatility. Second, there is seasonality in our business with underwriting margins typically
weakest in the first quarter of the year.
Given the underwriting performance this quarter, it is worth reviewing how we think about risk associated with
protection-oriented products. Our strategy to shift the sales mix away from market-sensitive products to
protection-oriented products should translate to a more balanced risk profile and a reduction in so-called fat-tail risk.
For protection products, we think the primary risk factor is earnings volatility as policyholder claims will sometimes
exceed pricing assumptions. We view the balance sheet risk associated with protection products as relatively modest.
This is true in group insurance where we have the ability to reprice the in-force book of business in the near term.
Overall, protection-oriented product lines have a favorable risk profile and relatively low cost of equity capital.
Although it may seem counterintuitive, in this case, lower risk does not mean lower returns. For example, Group,
Voluntary and Worksite Benefits remains a high-return segment, even with the less favorable underwriting results
experienced in recent periods, largely because of relatively low capital requirements.
A healthy spread between ROE and the cost of equity capital is particularly important in the current environment,
where capital requirements remain uncertain. Our strategy to shift MetLife's sales mix to our protection-oriented

products was clearly evident in our first quarter results. Group, Voluntary and Worksite Benefits sales rose 18% and
Emerging Markets sales were up 14%.
Variable annuity sales were $1.6 billion in the first quarter, down 54% year-over-year. However, the decline was only
4% sequentially, even though first quarter sales are typically weaker than fourth quarter sales.
Since 2012, we have focused on rightsizing our variable annuity business to achieve an appropriate risk profile.
Consistent with the December outlook call, we anticipate that variable annuity sales will decline this year. Looking
forward, we are now in a position to pursue sales growth with our redesigned mix of products to have a more attractive
risk/return profile. We remain committed to the annuity business as we see a substantial retirement savings opportunity
in the United States.
Next, I want to address the legal settlement, the licensing matter in New York, which is related to our global employee
benefits business. Let me start by noting that I am limited in what I can say about the terms of the settlement
agreement.
New York officials investigated whether companies we acquired in the 2010 Alico transaction were conducting
insurance business in the state without a New York license. The companies MetLife acquired run a business that
provides insurance to the non-U.S. employees of multinational companies. This insurance is sold through affiliates and
partners that are licensed in the countries where the insurance policies are issued. Under the terms of the agreement
with the New York Department of Financial Services, we can continue to have meetings and discussions in New York
with multinational clients and prospects about the capabilities of MetLife's non-U.S. affiliates and partners. We are
pleased to settle this issue with the Department of Financial Services, particularly because our largest operating
subsidiary is a New York-regulated insurer.
Finally, I want to close with a discussion of required capital and capital management. MetLife remains under Stage 3
review by the Financial Stability Oversight Council for potential designation as a non-bank systemically important
financial institution, or SIFI. We believe the evidence clearly demonstrates that MetLife does not pose a threat to the
financial system of the United States. However, if MetLife is designated as SIFI, we will be subject to enhanced
credential standards by the Federal Reserve. Because those standards have not yet been written, there is uncertainty
surrounding required capital levels for MetLife.
As a result, we have been conservative on capital management. Some shareholders have been frustrated by this
cautious approach to returning cash. We share their frustration. Our philosophy is that excess capital belongs to our
shareholders. The challenge is to strike the right balance between adherence to our philosophy and recognition that
required capital levels for MetLife remain unknown. We had anticipated that proposed capital rules would have been
known by now, but recent comments from the Federal Reserve suggest that it will be 2015 before we will see draft
capital rules for life insurers designated as SIFIs.
We will continue to take a conservative approach to capital management until there is clarity on these matters. But we
also recognize the need to consider the timing of those rules as our capital base continues to grow. The announcement
last week of a 27% increase in MetLife's common stock dividends illustrates the importance that we place on returning
cash to shareholders.
In closing, 2014 is off to a good start. And the increase in the common stock dividend illustrates our confidence in the
earnings power of the company. By significantly increasing the dividend, we are delivering on our commitment to take
steps to enhance long-term shareholder value.
With that, I will turn the call over to John Hele to discuss our financial results in detail. John?

margins, investment spreads, expenses, and business highlights. I will then conclude with some comments on cash and

capital.
As Steve noted, operating earnings were $1.6 billion, down 4% year-over-year and operating earnings per share were
$1.37, down 7% year-over-year. This quarter included two notable items. First, pre-tax variable investment income was
$429 million, reflecting strong private equity returns. After taxes and the impact of DAC, variable investment income
was $274 million, which is $63 million or $0.06 per share above the top end of our 2014 quarterly guidance range. The
second item was a legal settlement with New York, which reduced operating earnings in Corporate & Other by $57
million after tax or $0.05 per share.
Turning to our bottom-line results. First quarter net income was $1.3 billion or $1.14 per share. Net income included an
investment loss of $343 million after tax from the previously announced sale of the UK pension risk transfer business.
This was modestly below the $350 million to $390 million after-tax range we've previously disclosed. In addition, net
income included net derivative gains of $223 million after tax.
The net derivative gains in the quarter were driven primarily by three items that we consider to be either non-economic
or the result of asymmetrical accounting treatment. Number one, a decline in long-term interest rates. Number two,
changes in foreign currencies. And number three, the MetLife own credit impact associated with our VA program. The
decline in long-term interest rates in the quarter contributed approximately 70% of the net derivative gains, while
foreign currency and MetLife's own credit combined for most of the remaining balance. Book value per share,
excluding AOCI, was $49.34 at March 31, up 2% from $48.49 at December 31.
Turning to first quarter margins. Underwriting in the U.S. was less favorable than the prior-year quarter and our plan.
The mortality ratio in Group Life was 93.6%, unfavorable to the prior-year quarter of 91.3% and above our annual
target range of 85% to 90%. First quarter mortality is usually higher due to seasonality. We experienced an elevated
number of large claims in term and group variable universal life, which we believe is still within the range of normal
quarterly fluctuations. Retail Life also had unfavorable mortality quarter due to the three primary factors: One, two
large claims in variable and universal life; two, higher than normal incidents in traditional life; and three, a reinsurance
adjustment related to prior periods.
On the last point, we had incorrectly recorded policies that were term life conversions as reinsured over several years,
and as a result, now had to reimburse reinsurers for claims that occurred between 2006 and 2011. This catch-up
adjustment reduced operating earnings by $16 million after tax in the quarter. We are not normalizing for this
reinsurance adjustment as we typically do not normalize for mortality-related items.
In the quarterly financial supplement, you will note a change in how we are showing mortality experience. We have
replaced the historical Retail Life direct mortality ratio with an interest-adjusted benefit ratio. The historical ratio
reflected direct claims experience as a percentage of expected. The new ratio measures claims experience, net of
reinsurance and changes in future policyholder benefits net of interest relative to premiums, fees and other revenues.
We believe the new ratio will better demonstrate the relationship of mortality experience to premiums earned and
improve your ability to model this business. The interest-adjusted benefit ratio for Retail Life was 56.9% in the first
quarter, which was unfavorable to the prior-year quarter of 52.1% and our target range of 50% to 55%. While we are
changing the mortality metric we will discuss with you going forward, there is no change in the expected mortality
experience for our Retail Life business.
We've also changed the non-medical health benefit ratio in the QFS to an interest-adjusted loss ratio. The primary
reason for the change is to provide a better indication of the underlying performance of our runoff long-term care
insurance block of business. On the old basis, there would have been upward pressure on the benefit ratio as premiums
declined and investment income increased. And this upward pressure would have nothing to do with the underlying
performance of the business.
The new ratio adjusts for this by removing the impact of interest on reserves, and therefore, provides a clear picture of
morbidity margins. The non-medical health interest-adjusted loss ratio was 78.8%, favorable to the prior-year quarter of
79.6% and within our target range of 77% to 82%. The 77% to 82% target range for the interest-adjusted loss ratio is
consistent with the old range of 86% to 90% on premiums.

Dental margins were favorable to prior year and plan due to lower utilization. Disability underwriting results were
unfavorable to prior year and plan due to the lower net closures of existing claims. As part of our normal review
process, we are pursuing modest price increases in disability. However, it is important to keep in mind that dental is the
primary driver of the results in non-medical health. Dental accounts for more than 60% of our non-medical health
interest-adjusted loss ratio, while disability only accounts for 20%. Long-term care, which accounts for approximately
10% of the ratio, had favorable underwriting versus prior year quarter and plan, driven by premium rate actions and
lower incidents.
In our P&C business, the combined ratio, including catastrophes, was 94.3% for retail and 98.2% for group. The
combined ratios, excluding catastrophes, were 89.3% in retail and 94.3% in group. Overall, P&C underwriting results
were unfavorable to the prior year quarter and plan primarily due to non-catastrophe losses as a result of the winter
weather.
Moving to first quarter investment margins. The simple average of the four U.S. product spreads in our QFS was 233
basis points, including variable investment income and 192 basis points excluding VII. This result showed only a
modest seven basis points decline versus the prior year quarter of 240 basis points, including VII. Excluding VII, there
was a 19 basis points decline versus the prior year quarter due to the low interest rate environment.
With regard to expenses, the operating expense ratio was 24.1% in the first quarter as compared to 24.0% in the
year-ago quarter. Adjusting for the New York legal settlement, the normalized operating expense ratio was 23.6%
better than plan in the prior-year quarter.
Gross expense saves were $200 million in the first quarter and net saves were $124 million after adjusting for
reinvestment of $39 million and one-time costs of $37 million. We are pleased with our expense performance as we
remain on track to deliver gross saves of $770 million to $800 million in 2014 and $1 billion in 2015 and net saves of
$600 million in 2015.
I will now discuss the business highlights in the quarter. Retail operating earnings were $612 million, down 2% versus
the prior year quarter and up 1% when adjusting for notable items in both periods, including a net positive DAC and
reserve adjustment in the prior-year quarter and excess variable investment income in both periods. Life and Other
reported operating earnings of $244 million, down 4% year-over-year and down 5% when adjusting for excess and –
variable investment income in both quarters. The primary drivers were less favorable underwriting, partially offset by
lower expenses.
Annuities reported operating earnings of $368 million, down 1% versus the prior year quarter. Excluding a net positive
DAC and reserve adjustment of $29 million in the prior-year quarter and excess variable investment income in both
periods, operating earnings were up 5%. The drivers included lower DAC amortization and higher fees from separate
account growth. Group, Voluntary, and Worksite Benefits, GVWB, reported operating earnings of $188 million, down
18% year-over-year due to a less favorable underwriting in Group Life, disability and property and casualty, partially
offset by improved underwriting results in dental and long-term care.
GVWB sales were up 18% year-over-year with group sales up in the mid-teens and voluntary and worksite sales up
more than 30%. Even though we are modestly increasing disability pricing over the next year, we believe that first
quarter GVWB sales would generate an attractive return on investment.
Corporate benefit funding reported operating earnings of $355 million, up 21% year-over-year driven by higher
variable investment and recurring income as well as improved underwriting.
Latin America reported operating earnings of $183 million, up 28% year-over-year and 43% on a constant-currency
basis. These results reflected the Provida acquisition, which was in line with expectations and favorable market and tax
impacts, partially offset by less favorable underwriting and higher expenses due to business initiatives, inflation
adjustments and volume-related growth.
Premiums, fees, and other revenues were up 9% year-over-year, 22% on a constant-currency basis and 12% excluding
Provida on a constant-currency basis. The strong growth across the region was primarily due to higher annuity sales in

Chile and worksite marketing in Mexico. Sales were up 19% year-over-year and 15% excluding Provida, driven by
growth in the agency sales force, higher annuity sales, direct marketing and group medical in Chile as well as group
medical in Mexico.
Turning now to Asia. Operating earnings were $328 million, down 2% year-over-year. On a constant-currency basis,
operating earnings were up 8% driven by business growth and lower expenses, partially offset by a return to more
normal surrender levels in Japan. While Asia operating earnings were strong this quarter, they did benefit from the
timing of certain expenses. Premiums, fees, and other revenues were down 6% year-over-year, but up 6% on a
constant-currency basis, driven by business growth in Japan, Korea and Australia. Asia sales were up only 2%
year-over-year dampened by the results in Japan. Japan sales were flat as a strong rebound in retirement products was
offset by a decline in yen life sales due to pricing actions we discussed on our fourth quarter call. As a result, the
volume mix was favorable for expected returns.
Finally, in EMEA, operating earnings were $88 million, up 1% year-over-year and 2% on a constant-currency basis.
The prior period benefited by $8 million from unusual items in Greece. Adjusting for these items, operating earnings
were up 12% on a constant-currency basis, driven by business growth across the region. This was a strong quarter for
EMEA and we would expect lower operating earnings in the remaining quarters of the year.
Premiums, fees and other revenues were up 5% year-over-year on both a reported and constant-currency basis driven
by growth in Turkey, Russia, the Gulf and Poland. Sales increased 4% driven by 9% growth in Emerging Markets, led
by the Gulf, Turkey and Poland.
I will now discuss our cash and capital position. Cash and liquid assets at the holding companies were approximately
$4.7 billion at March 31. As expected, this decline from year-end was primarily due to the $1 billion of senior debt that
matured in February.
Turning to our capital position, the combined risk-based capital ratio for our principal U.S. insurance companies,
excluding Alico, at year-end 2013 was 450%. Also, our Japan solvency ratio was 945% as of December 31.
For our U.S. insurance companies, preliminary first quarter statutory operating earnings were approximately $760
million, down 4% from the prior year quarter and net income was approximately $666 million, up 18%. The
year-over-year decline in statutory operating earnings was primarily due to higher taxes, while the increase in net
income was primarily the result of lower derivative losses. Our total statutory adjusted capital is expected to be
approximately $27 billion as of March 31, up 4% compared to December 31.
In conclusion, MetLife had a solid first quarter with operating earnings better than our plan. Investment margins remain
healthy, expenses are well controlled and we continue to focus on generating profitable growth. Although underwriting
was weaker than expected in the quarter, we expect results to improve during the balance of the year.
And with that, I will turn it back to the operator for your questions.

currently legislation running through both the House and Senate to clarify Collins Amendment. If those – if that
legislation passes, will that change your view in terms of having to wait or will that give you enough confidence that
you'd be able to do something less conservative? That's my first question.
<A - Steven A. Kandarian>: Hi, Tom. Yes, there's legislation now proposed both in the House and the Senate, and
there's Susan Collins, who, for whom there's an amendment named in Dodd-Frank, which is Section 171 of
Dodd-Frank, was interpreted by the Federal Reserve as requiring them to use no less than bank standards for non-bank
SIFIs such as insurance companies. And there's now a bill that Susan Collins, Sherrod Brown and Mike Johanns from
the Senate have coalesced behind S. 2270. There's an identical bill now in the house H.R. 4510, again bipartisan
support by representatives Gary Miller and Carolyn McCarthy. That's all encouraging news, but of course there needs
to be a vehicle by which this would turn into legislation, not just a bill. And to date, there has been resistance to any
amendments to Dodd-Frank, a bill that's been promulgated now for – it will be four years this summer.
So our hope is that there will be some softening of the position of not opening up Dodd-Frank for amendments. And it's
not unusual for a very complex bill to have technical amendments after some period of time. And our hope is that
Congress can find a way to navigate these issues and get these kinds of technical amendments or nonpartisan, excuse
me, bipartisan, non-controversial, through Congress and signed by the President. So that's our hope and we're working
hard to try to support those efforts. If such a bill were to pass, that would be very favorable news, but I don't want to
over-blow it either. All I would say is to the Fed that you're not constrained, your hands are not tied in terms of
imposing Basel rules on the insurance industry. It doesn't say what rules they would apply, but presumably, they'd be
more tailored to the insurance industry, I think, that certainly would be a net positive. So that would be positive piece of
information that we certainly would take into account as we've thought about capital management.
<Q - Tom G. Gallagher>: So if it does pass, positive directionally, maybe, maybe not enough for you to change your
plan for now? Is that a fair way to characterize it?
<A - Steven A. Kandarian>: I wouldn't phrase it that way. I think that would be positive news and certainly that we'd
take that into account as we thought about capital management and that could have an impact upon how we would
move forward.
<Q - Tom G. Gallagher>: Okay. That's helpful. And then just one, I guess, business question from the standpoint of –
so Met and the rest of the life insurance industry now this quarter have had pretty weak mortality results across the
board. We've seen more pockets of this over the last few years. Any thoughts overall about whether this is truly just
seasonality and randomness of more deaths this quarter? Or do you think we're seeing something more structural in
terms of seasoning of more aggressive pricing years? Any help or color on that would be appreciated.
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Tom, hi. It's Bill Wheeler. So you know we ask ourselves that question less when we have
a quarter like this. We look at – we look at the claims and the data, our overall book, we look at – we always go back
and look at the last five years or 10 years and say jeez, am I missing a trend here? Is there something I should be
paranoid about in terms of our underwriting or pricing? So we examine this really carefully. And I think our conclusion
after this quarter is, there isn't a trend, there isn't something that we need – a deeper concern that we need to be worried
about. What we saw was some increases in severity, both in the life, individual life block as well as Group Life, and
maybe just a slight increase in frequency in Retail Life, which probably brought on by the weather.
And you know we know that happens, right? We see quarters occasionally like this where you have a big pop in
severity. And of course this quarter, in Retail Life, which wasn't very good, just remember the third quarter and fourth
quarter last year were extraordinarily low in terms of mortality experience, very good mortality experience. So it's – I
think we just have to appreciate that this can be a volatile business. And as Steve said in his prepared remarks, it doesn't
mean it's not a good business and with great returns on capital, but mortality over the short term could be volatile and
so you've just got to – you've got to take a little longer-term view.
<Q - Tom G. Gallagher>: Got it. So, Bill, no cohort years, anything along those lines as you've analyzed the data to
raise alarms?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: That's right.

Next question comes from the line of John Nadel of Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: Good morning, everybody. Steve, I have a question about the recent CCAR results for the large
bank financial institutions. I'm just curious whether you and the board and the rest of management have any real sort of
learnings or takeaways from the recent CCAR process? And maybe particularly with the focus on Citigroup's "failure",
which appeared to be, at least this is my sense, driven in part by sort of the global nature of their business. And I'm just
sort of wondering if you're incrementally thinking about implementing any changes? Or anything incrementally to your
enterprise risk management as a result of what you saw?
<A - Steven A. Kandarian>: John, I think you raised a good point, which is, we're in uncharted waters here.
Dodd-Frank passed in 2010, implementation really is in the very early stages. Everyone's learning how to work
together both on the regulatory side and, in this case in the bank side. And I think it's – people are going through kind
of the learnings of all this. And I think as of now, there's not a great deal of transparency in terms of how all these
calculations get done on the regulatory side.
So I think people are trying to figure out how to operate within that environment, and it's obviously been difficult in
some cases. And we're mindful of that and we are certainly building out our capabilities in case we are designated a
SIFI on a final basis and regulated by the Federal Reserve. So, it is something that we have spent a great deal of time
discussing internally at the management level with our Board. And we certainly are taking steps at MetLife to make
sure that we're prepared going forward, should we be finally designated as a SIFI.
<Q - John M. Nadel>: Okay. That's helpful. Obviously, it was a little surprising, right? And my sense is that
management at a couple of these companies, in particular, Citigroup were also may be taken by surprise in terms of the
result. So I know you guys had a little experience with that. The next question is more, it's about Asia and I was just
hoping we could get a little bit better detail on some of the underlying trends at more of the product level, maybe first
sector in Japan versus third sector, what you like and what you saw on the sales side, what you're sort of unhappy with?
If you could give us a sense there, that would be great.
<A - Christopher G. Townsend>: Sure, it's Chris Townsend here. So sales for Asia, as John mentioned, were up 2%
year-on-year and they were down 34% sequentially. So, if I take that sequential point first of all, we were at a very
significant account in Australia in the fourth quarter of 2013, plus there were some high sales of two yen-based life
products before they were repriced. So we repriced both of those products, one in October, one in December and then
now at or above our return hurdle rate.
So what you've seen is following that repricing a significant reduction in terms of the first sector life sales and because
of some of the packaging element which we've spoken to you before about, there's been a knock-on impact in terms of
the third sector as well. The persistency overall is good, revenues are up both sequentially and year-on-year. The cancer
product is selling very well, we launched a new cancer product last August and we're just about at 100,000 new
customers for that product now. And the cancer sales overall are up about 120% year-on-year. So going forward, what
you'll see is that we'll tweak slightly to the short – one of the short pay periods, the life product and also in the second
half, we'll launch a range of new A&H products and riders as well, so that will lift sales for the second half of the year.
I think the other couple of points to mention here is that we've spoken a number of times about the multi-channel
benefits of our business in Japan. And I'd just like to point out that the life sales have returned, sorry, the bank channel
sales have returned significantly as we've got greater stability in the yen-dollar and there's sort of a reduction in the
increase of the Nikkei and the TOPIX, we've seen that bank channel come back very strongly in 102% growth
year-on-year. And the final point here is, collectively, as you think of the repricing, those actions have turned into very
positive margin for us and we're up about 300 basis points or 400 basis points quarter-on-quarter.

<Q - John M. Nadel>: That's really helpful. And, Chris, maybe just one more quick one. Any expectation, what I
guess maybe was sort of what's your view reading tea leaves, if you will, of any chance for, in Japan for the
government to make some changes incrementally to co-pays?

Our next question will come from...
<A - Christopher G. Townsend>: I don't have a view on that right now.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Erik Bass with Citigroup. Please go ahead.
<Q - Erik J. Bass>: Hi. Thank you. First, can you provide an update on your thinking about the equity units? I know
that you've been clear certainly that you don't want to a buyback and then have to issue equity if capital requirements
change. But is your view on the equity units at all different since you're essentially issuing equity if you don't offset the
dilution?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: It was our intent when we issued those securities that we'd buy them back in the marketplace.
And we've mentioned that before. And again, the capital considerations that we're analyzing because of the uncertainty
of the rules which are not yet in draft form for us to review has resulted in us to date not buying back those equity units,
but certainly philosophically, that is something that we had intended to do when we engaged in the Alico transaction
back in 2010 and issued those securities.
<Q - Erik J. Bass>: Okay. And then I guess on the group business, can you comment a little bit more on just what's
driving the strong sales so far? And kind of current activity and pricing trends in the market? And I guess it's the new –
or the strong sales, is that coming more from new accounts or an expanded product offering?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Erik, it's Bill. I would say that the answer is both. Remember, we talked a lot about our
strategy of growing our group business, but going down market and growing at what I would call the middle market.
We have a very strong presence in the large company marketplace in the U.S. and going down market with what I
would say our broad product offering, which means not only our base coverages, but also all our worksite products.
And we're having a lot of success down there. So we've seen increased sales and I would say in the middle market as
well as strong worksite sales. And that's consistent with I think the strategy that we've laid out here in terms of a shift to
more protection products. And in terms of just that I would say the tone of pricing, the pricing environment is, I would
say, relatively good. The guys who run that business always sort of flinch when I say that, but they, because they
always feel there's something out there who's being a little aggressive, but I would say today, the pricing environment is
relatively attractive. And for the worksite portion of the business, we think it's quite attractive.
<Q - Erik J. Bass>: Okay. Thank you for the color.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Mark Finkelstein of Evercore. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Good morning. Actually it's sort of a follow-up to Erik Bass' question. Steve, in your
opening remarks, I think you addressed with Tom kind of the evolution of the rules and some of the legislative actions,
but you also talked about the rules, draft rules not coming out till 2015, and in your comments, you actually used the
words take into consideration the timing of the rules when we think about capital deployment. So the question is how is
the timing influencing or how is your thinking evolving in terms of the timing in terms of those actions?

<A - Steven A. Kandarian>: Hey, Mark. I think you saw it with our dividend announcement. I think that's a fairly
aggressive increase in the dividend given that we had a large dividend increase one year earlier and $1.40 a share for
dividend for MetLife, that translates to 2.7% yield and roughly a 25% payout ratio. So I think you're seeing we're
taking actions now that we think make sense for us to take given the delay in the pronouncement of the draft rules by
the Fed. And when we first engaged in this analysis and discussion internally, two years ago or more, we anticipated
that we'd have greater clarity by now about capital rules.
So as time goes on and cash accumulates in the company, I think we're trying to find that right balance between making
sure that we have adequate capital imposed rules by the Fed on the one hand, if we're finally designated, and on the
other hand making sure, we adhere to our philosophy of returning excess capital to our shareholders. So the dividend
increase, I think, is reflective of that consideration of the timing being pushed back and further accumulation of cash.
And again you saw effectively another capital action back last year in the fall when we acquired Provida for $2 billion
in cash without issuing any shares in that acquisition.
So we're trying to, again, strike that right balance, and certainly in terms of what we're thinking about in the future, we
have to really look at all these things from the perspective of both timing, how much cash we're accumulating, merger
and acquisition opportunities for us, acquisition opportunities for us, and where our dividend level is and so on. So
everything is really kind of part of a more complex equation that we consider as we look at capital management.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Okay. That's helpful. And then just two very quick business questions. In Asia, you
referenced favorable expenses. How much did that positively influence the Asia earnings? And then in EMEA, you
talked about maybe the run rate being lower. How should we think about that as well?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Hi. This is John. It's about $10 million for the Asia earnings on the expenses in the quarter,
and it's really just mainly due to timing. And I'm sorry, but I missed your second part of the question.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: A similar comment on EMEA? That the run rate was, should, going forward is a little
bit lower? Just trying to frame out how we should think about EMEA earnings.
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Slightly lower.
<Q - Alan Mark Finkelstein>: Slightly lower. Okay. Thank you.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Chris Giovanni of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Christopher A. Giovanni>: Thanks so much. Steve, you made the comment about VA where you think you now
might be in a position to grow with a better risk product. Is this still with the 4% rollup product? Or are you looking to
maybe re-risk the product to get back more in line with peers? And then in thinking about kind of the growth year, I
think one of the concerns you had with VA was uncertainty over the capital treatment for separate accounts the way the
current bank framework is written. So if you're looking to now grow VA again, has this changed? What's changed I
guess in terms of your confidence that a bigger VA book won't be an issue in federal oversight?
<A - Steven A. Kandarian>: So, Chris, let me take the first part of your question regarding the capital treatment of
VAs. Then I'll turn it over to Bill for the business discussion about our strategy going forward. Again, the rules are not
written so we don't know exactly how the Fed will treat separate accounts. However, I'd say conversations we've been
having with them and others in Washington are encouraging from the following perspective. I think they better
understand today than they did a couple of years ago how our business model differs from that of a bank. And I think
they understand that the non-guaranteed portion of VAs, that the true separate account component really is not a risk to
MetLife on its balance sheet.
So, banks don't have this separate account situation on their balance sheets, so there is, even if the Collins Amendment
is not modified, I think an opportunity for the Fed to say, look, bank rules just don't apply in this particular instance
about separate accounts. So it is possible, it's up to them, obviously, not me, but it's possible for them to look at

separate accounts and not assess either capital charges or significant capital charges for the non-guaranteed portion of
that business for us.
And there's no indication by them one way or the other. But I think I would simply say the conversations I've had
indicate more and better understanding on their part about what the risks truly are associated with that part of our
balance sheet, which is virtually zero, if it's someone else's money that has been accounted for on our balance sheet. So
with that, I'll turn it over to Bill for the business question.
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Chris, with regard to VA pricing and competitiveness, I know you know this, but
obviously, you've seen a real hardening of that market in terms of product features and investment options. And the
rollup rate is an important consideration, but it's really only one on the living benefit rider, there's other things going on.
And I think the other thing that's happened of course is, you've seen a lot of sales now, much broader, diverse group of
sales where there is no living benefit rider, where the main motivation is tax efficiency or other things. And so, we're –
our plan going forward is really to pursue all those avenues, not just, oh, we've got to have a more aggressive living
benefit rider, it's we've got to – we've got to make sure that we're in all of the other kinds of variable annuity products
to meet specific customer needs. And so, when we talked about our strategy, that's a big piece of it. Now, we're always
looking at how we can change our living benefit rider. And my guess is we'll modify that as well, but there's nothing to
talk about it at the moment. But that kind of gives you a little color of our thinking here.
<Q - Christopher A. Giovanni>: Okay. Both comments helpful. And then just one on ROE. Steve, you made the
comment that the group business despite some of this adverse underwriting is still generating good returns. And I know
you don't want to get into kind of segmented allocation of capital. But clearly, you are focused on growing certain lines
of business. So how should we be thinking about the returns on kind of the in-force that you're generating on those kind
of core businesses that you guys have? And then what's maybe the drag that you're seeing from those runoff blocks that
you've clearly de-emphasized around long-term care and SGUL?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Well, I'll give you a little color on that, Chris. The – our protection businesses, we're
talking mid to high teens ROEs. And they've always been that way. Honestly. That's, even in what I would say a tough
underwriting period. And obviously group is really the leader there and it's quite attractive ROE business. The – I
would say the asset-intensive businesses right now, especially with the longer-term liability, ergo long-term care, and
where there's been really low interest rates, those ROEs are under performing. And that's our challenge going forward
is to, is sort of to work on the risk profile of those particular products, but at the same time grow the higher ROE
business. And I would say obviously another factor is in emerging markets, ROEs there is a factor as well.
<Q - Christopher A. Giovanni>: And, Bill, would those be point drags to ROE or basis point drags to ROE? Just
speaking kind of in aggregate.
<A - William J. Wheeler>: You mean, you're asking order of magnitude of the drags?
<Q - Christopher A. Giovanni>: Yes. I guess thinking about long-term care and SGUL. I mean clearly they're
underperforming. But they're kind of reducing aggregate ROEs by a point, or are we talking basis points?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Well, the long-term care block in and of itself isn't that big. So it's relative to the size of
MetLife. So I'm sure that would be bps, not full points. But yeah, our, I would say in general, sure, the – those bigger,
those more asset-intensive, long-guarantee businesses have the impact on the ROE as points.
<Q - Christopher A. Giovanni>: Thank you.

Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Eric Berg of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Eric N. Berg>: Thanks very much. The underwriting in 2013 was, in some quarters, quite challenging. And now
you have another quarter of it although you have said that it really relates to cyclicality [indiscernible] (52:37) no trend

problem. My question is, when will we – when will you be in a position to sound the all-clear sign? If we have another
quarter or two more quarters, how many quarters, how many quarters of normal underwriting results do you need
before you can conclude that there is no problem? Thanks. That's my first question.
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Yeah, Eric, you broke up a little bit, but I think I got the gist of your question which is,
group underwriting experience last year was a little soft. And now we've had a soft quarter in the first quarter of 2014.
How long until we feel better about it? There is, if you look back at our history, especially in Group Life over time, in
the first quarter, we often run a mortality ratio of 90% plus, that's not that uncommon. This was a little worse than that,
obviously. And so, I would see this – I kind of view the Group Life experience as really kind of a seasonal quarter, but
a tough seasonal quarter, tougher than normal.
In terms of the future, look, we – our expectation is that our underwriting, especially in Group Life should start –
should revert to the mean in the second quarter. And if it doesn't, that'll be another data point, which would cause us
concern. But that's – our, that's why we kind of view this really as a blip, and there are definitely blips in these, in this
experience, not a trend. So I – my expectation is, I should see improvement in the second quarter, and if I don't, I
should be worried. And so that's kind of our feeling.
<Q - Eric N. Berg>: Very helpful. And, Steve, one follow-up question. On a global basis, it feels like the top line at
Met, and by the top line, I don't mean sales, I mean premium fees and other deposits, is growing at about a 5% pace
excluding the effect of currency. Is that consistent with your expectations? And how do you feel about that level of
top-line growth? Are you, are you satisfied with it? Or should it be better? Do you feel it's appropriate given the
markets in which Met is competing or do you feel it should be better still? Thank you.
<A - Steven A. Kandarian>: Eric, I think it's consistent with what our expectations are. But I also would point you to
the – my remarks a little bit earlier talking about essentially us pivoting from trying to get the risk profile right of the
company to now focusing on growth going forward. And I think that is – this is the right time for us to really think
about those opportunities throughout MetLife's business platform, meaning through geographies, different products and
so on and to press on the issue of growth going forward. So we've spent the last roughly three years trying to make sure
that we had our risk profile in the right place, the products designed the way that we felt offered good value to our
customers on the one hand, but also a fair return to our shareholders on the other hand, and didn't result in significant
fat-tail risk in the future. That was sort of step one of the strategy here, and step two now that we're pivoting toward is
finding ways to further grow the business.
<Q - Eric N. Berg>: Thank you.

Our next question will come from the line of Mr. Jay Gelb of Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Thanks. John, can you give us a bit more insight on the sources of the net cost savings in 2015, the
$600 million you broadly outlined?
<A - John C. R. Hele>: Sure. So these costs are really throughout the entire company. We've been focusing on many
different aspects and taking out over the past few years layers of management, particularly in the U.S. as well as the
reorganization we've done in Retail in the United States and moving people to Charlotte. In the technology side, we've
created a new center in Raleigh-Durham. And so you're starting now to see some of these flowing through, whereas in
2012 and 2013, we had more restructuring charges that were flowing through, so the net basis was less. You're starting
to see these cost saves flow through the entire company, not just in the U.S. but also even in Asia and other areas, we're
seeing continued cost discipline. And I think this is something that's starting to stick in our company and you're starting
to see the results in our financials.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Is there a certain metric we should focus on in terms of trying to track that level of improvement in
2015 and beyond?

<A - John C. R. Hele>: It's the expense ratio. However, you do need to adjust a little bit if we had some material
moves in our mix of business. So for example, in Latin America by the acquisition of Provida that runs at a higher
expense ratio. Very profitable business but a higher expense ratio. Without a mix change and for the whole company, it
takes quite a bit to really shift that. So on a quarter-by-quarter basis you'll see that ratio be a very good measure. But I
just caution you to adjust your models for when we do major material changes in the mix different businesses have
slightly different expense ratios.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Okay. Then separate topic, I guess more for Steve and Bill. On variable annuity sales growth, you
mentioned the likelihood that you could start growing VA sales growth again now with the new product in place and
the new mix and less reliance on living benefits. Should we think about that as a low, mid-single-digit growth
opportunity or perhaps something larger?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: I think if you think about the overall revenue of the business, yeah, I'd say it's – I don't see
this being a double-digit grower. Obviously, it somewhat depends on what's going on with the capital markets. But
assuming those are benign, I don't expect it to be a double-digit grower.
<Q - Jay H. Gelb>: Is that starting in 2015 though?
<A - William J. Wheeler>: Well, I don't think we're – I think we're a little ahead of ourselves in terms of kind of
giving specific forecasts for 2015 yet. But I think what we're trying to do is make sure it's clear that – we're still
committed to the annuity business.
