Paul M. Bisaro
Thank you, Lisa, and good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining the call today.
With the close of the Actavis Group acquisition and the combination of our two companies and now under one new
global name, Actavis, we are beginning 2013 on a solid commercial and financial foundation, well positioned for
sustainable long-term growth.
While the Actavis Group acquisition was our most significant event in 2012, there were many other accomplishments
to note across our businesses. In our Actavis Pharma segment, net revenues in the fourth quarter increased 21% from
the prior year. In the U.S. we launched a number of notable products, including generic versions of Adderall XR,
Lovenox, Xopenex, and Actos. In our ex-U.S. markets, we experienced strong growth as a result of a record number of
launches.
On a combined basis, we filed over 1,500 new dossiers globally and ended the year with over 185 applications on file
in the U.S. We were a leader in U.S. first-to-files in 2012, with 49 first-to-file applications pending with the FDA,
including 33 believed to be exclusive.
In addition, in January 2012 we acquired Ascent Pharmahealth and became the fifth largest generic pharmaceutical
company in Australia, an important market for us moving forward.
In our Actavis Specilaty Brands segment, we experienced growth in key promoted products, including Rapaflo,
Crinone, and Generess Fe, and we launched Gelnique 3% in the U.S. Additionally, we added Kadian, a modified
released morphine product that we acquired with the acquisition of the Actavis Group.
We expanded our brand portfolio globally as we launched Rapaflo, Gelnique, Androderm, and Oxytrol in Canada and
began filing products in Latin America with the filings of Rapaflo and Gelnique in Brazil.

We continue to make progress on our development pipeline with the completion of our Phase III program for our
progestin-only patch in the U.S., with the NDA submission by the end of the first quarter of 2013. Our FSH product
also entered into a Phase I clinical program.
We furthered our biosimilar initiatives with the acquisition of a biosimilar to Herceptin from Synthon, which we
contributed to the Amgen biosimilar collaboration.
After year0end on July 23, we announced the acquisition of Uteron Pharma, enhancing our pipeline in women's health
worldwide. The acquisition includes three potential near-term global commercial opportunities in contraception and
infertility, including one novel oral contraceptive. Several additional products in early stages of development are also
included in the acquisition.
We also continue our strong focus on operational excellence and the rationalization of our global supply chain. These
efforts resulted in the announcement earlier this year to restructure our Corona, California, facility. The facility will
scale back to focus solely on the manufacture of our oral contraceptive products. As you can see, it has been an
exceptionally busy and productive year.
Now looking to the financials, we delivered solid results in the fourth quarter of 2012, with net revenues up 13% and
non-GAAP earnings per diluted share of $1.59 compared to $1.77 per diluted share in the prior-year period. The fourth
quarter of 2011 included the launch of the authorized generic version of Lipitor in November, which contributed $0.64
to non-GAAP earnings in 2011 compared to a contribution of $0.03 to our fourth-quarter 2012 results.
Also, our fourth-quarter and full-year 2012 results include our current best estimate of shares issuable to the former
shareholders of the Actavis Group. The number of shares issuable is based upon year-over-year growth in cash
EBITDA for the legacy Actavis business as that is defined in the acquisition agreement. Based on our current estimate,
we believe they achieve year-over-year growth in cash EBITDA of 10%, which would require the issuance of 3.85
million shares associated with that earnout. By agreement, we will submit our determination of 2012 cash EBITDA
following our 10-K filing.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Todd to take us through the financial results in more detail.
R. Todd Joyce
Thanks, Paul. I will now review our results on a consolidated divisional basis.
GAAP net revenues for the fourth quarter were $1.750 billion, an increase of 13% over the prior year. Net revenues for
our Actavis Pharma division were $1.414 billion, up 21% year over year as a result of the inclusion of legacy Actavis
since November 1 and increased sales related to new products in key markets, including generic versions of Lovenox
and Xopenex in the U.S. These increases were partially offset by lower sales of the generic Lipitor. Ex-U.S. net
revenues were $524.7 million, up 245%, primarily due to the inclusion of legacy Actavis.
Actavis Pharma adjusted gross margin was 46.7%, up 2.9 percentage points year over year primarily due to the
prior-year impact of lower margins on sales of generic Lipitor and Concerta.
Moving to Actavis Specialty brands, net revenues were $132 million, up 9% on higher sales promoted products,
including Generess Fe and Rapaflo, and the addition of Kadian, which was acquired with the Actavis Group. Actavis
Specialty Brands adjusted gross margin was 76.9%, down 1.5 percentage points as a result of a favorable product mix
in the prior-year period.
Finally, net revenues from our Anda Distribution segment were $204 million, down 19% on lower chain sales, which
were partially offset by new product launches. Anda's gross margin for the quarter was 17.6%, up three percentage
points due to the lower chain sales relative to the prior year.
Turning now to operating expenses, consolidated GAAP R&D for the fourth quarter was $121.1 million, up 80% year
over year, primarily due to R&D associated with the addition of legacy Actavis as well as increased biosimilar product

development spending.
SG&A for the fourth quarter was $424 million, up 99% year over year, primarily due to the inclusion of legacy
Actavis, including certain acquisition, integration, and restructuring charges. Litigation settlements also contributed to
the year-over-year increase.
Net asset impairment charges during the fourth quarter were $29.9 million; $17.6 million relates to the planned
disposition of a German subsidiary, and $10.2 million relates to product rights acquired in connection with the Specifar
acquisition.
Amortization expense for the fourth quarter was $148 million.
On a non-GAAP basis, our income tax rate for the fourth quarter was 28.5%, down from 35% in the prior-year period,
primarily as a result with the acquisition. In addition, the company realized certain one-time foreign tax benefits
associated with our UK operation, which includes our biosimilar facility in Liverpool. This one-time tax benefit had a
1.5 percentage point impact on our fourth quarter non-GAAP tax rate, or $0.03 per share. On a GAAP basis, our
income tax rate was 75.3%.
Earnings on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes amortization and impairment charges and other charges detailed in
Table 4 of our press release, were $1.59 per diluted share in the fourth quarter, down 10% year over year due to lower
sales and contribution from generic Lipitor, offset in part by new products and the addition of the legacy Actavis
business. As a reminder, non-GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter of 2011 included a $0.64 per share contribution
from generic Lipitor. Due to the significant decline in the U.S. market for this product during 2012, the company
ceased selling generic Lipitor last month.
GAAP earnings for the fourth quarter were $0.21 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $393
million, unchanged from the prior year.
Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $220 million. and at year end, cash and marketable securities
were $328 million. And as of today, current and long-term debt is approximately $6.5 billion.
We remain well positioned financially following the acquisition of the Actavis Group. We will continue to focus on
accelerated repayment of our debt and maintaining a strong financial foundation to support strategic growth initiatives
within our global businesses.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Paul for a review of our 2013 forecast and concluding remarks.
Paul M. Bisaro
Thanks, Todd. I will now provide a review of the 2013 forecast.
First, there are no changes to our assumptions that were provided at our Analyst Day in January. For Actavis Pharma,
our forecast continues to include: the launch of generic Pulmicort with competition in the second quarter; one
competitor on generic Concerta beginning in quarter one and a second competitor 181 days after launch of each
strength; no additional competition in 2013 for generic Lidoderm and generic Adderall XR; mid-single-digit price
erosion in the U.S. on our base business and high single digit ex-U.S. Finally, no additional patent challenges are
included in our forecast.
For Actavis Specialty Brands, our forecast includes continued growth of our core promoted products, successful
approval and launch of Esmya in Canada, and no revenue contribution from Uteron products.
Our 2013 forecast remains as follows. Our estimate for full-year net revenue is approximately $8.1 billion. We expect
Actavis Pharma revenue to be between $6.3 billion and $6.5 billion. Our Actavis Specialty Brands, we expect net
revenue of $550 million to $600 million. And for our Anda Distribution business, we anticipate revenue to be between
$1 billion and $1.2 billion, with adjusted gross margins between 12% to 13%. As a reminder, Anda's results do not

include the sale of the Actavis products.
We expect adjusted EBITDA of $1.870 billion to $1.940 billion. We expect non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in
the range of $7.70 to $8.10 per share, reflecting full-year estimated shares outstanding of approximately 134 million.
For purposes of our 2013 forecast, we have taken the conservative approach of retaining the full earnout of 5.5 million
shares in our current calculations. As I noted earlier, our best estimate is that legacy Actavis achieved year-over-year
growth of cash EBITDA of 10%, which would result in the issuance of 3.85 million shares rather than 5.5 million
shares. However, the process for determining the final number of shares issued pursuant to the acquisition agreement
contains certain dispute resolution provisions. Because the share count will not be finalized for some time, we are
continuing to include the full earnout in our current 2013 non-GAAP EPS forecast. We will provide an update on
finalization of the numbers of shares issuable as soon as it becomes available. However, in the event that the total
number of shares issuable is determined to be 3.85 million, you could expect an increase of approximately $0.10 per
diluted share to our current forecast.
In summary, 2012 was a historic year in the continued evolution of our company into a leading global specialty
pharmaceutical company. As always, I would like to thank our employees around the world for all their hard work and
dedication to the growth of our global organization.
Now I'll turn the call back to Lisa for Q&A.
Lisa M. DeFrancesco
Hey, Kristi, we will take a question.
Q&A
Operator
Okay. [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Gregg Gilbert of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thanks. I have two. Guys, good morning.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Good morning.
<A - R. Todd Joyce>: Good morning, Gregg.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Paul, maybe from a higher level, industry level, you can comment on some of the implications
of GDUFA [Generic Drugs User Fee Amendment] implementation that maybe investment community may not
appreciate. And for Siggi, at this point, if you were a betting man, I was curious if you expect generic versions of the
old OxyContin to be launched this year. Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: I'll let Siggi go first.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Gregg, that's a very good question. I think the complexity around the OxyContin
remains. There's a patent case outstanding. And also, we have seen the review of the new OxyContin that the FDA has
published. And there has also been an FDA blog around this product that has been published on the Internet.
I think at this point in time, we remain – we are saying the same as in our Investor Day. It's a very complex situation.
Clearly, OxyContin to date doesn't have a TR in their label. But at the same time, we saw that in the review that there's
some TR [ph] detergent (17:00) in the formulation. So we don't know, but I want to emphasize. We don't include it in
our forecast for the year, and that's probably where my bet is.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Okay, that's good to hear; thanks.

<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: And on the implications of GDUFA implementation, I think the issue will be how quickly can
the FDA ramp up its personnel and be able to improve the timelines that we all hope they can do. I think certainly they
will be able to move certain things faster than others. I think the review process will take them a while to get up to
speed. They're going to have to hire more reviewers. They're going to have to train those reviewers and get them up to
speed, so that may take a little time. But I'm also hoping that they can hire lawyers and toxicologists and other things
that will help us improve the speed of some of the more complicated applications that are pending – and lawyers, of
course, because you never have enough lawyers. So you've got to hire enough lawyers to review the Citizen's Petitions
and things like that. That should help accelerate some of the approvals of the more complicated products, which I think
we have a lot of products pending, so I think that'd be very good for us.
And finally, I would continue to expect the FDA to continue its compliance push, as I would describe it. They will have
more resources to do that. And frankly, we look forward to that. We're certainly very comfortable with our compliance
position, and we applaud their efforts there.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Thanks.
Operator
Your next question comes from Randall Stanicky of Canaccord Genuity.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Great. Thanks, guys.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hi, Randall.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Paul and maybe Siggi, just can you maybe frame for us your Crestor 505(b)(2)
opportunity and how much potential penetration we could be thinking about should you be successful in the trial
decision and get on to market?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: So, Randall, it's a little difficult to put a number to it. We have been quite open, as we
are preparing to launch this product hopefully midyear. There's a 13-month stay on this product. I think the opportunity
we have been talking about is either through the PBMs, to work with the PBM to lower the cost of Crestor in the
market or to look towards the retail angle to work with us to change the prescription of Crestor.
Obviously, this is a challenging marketing effort. We have spoken to quite a few of the retailers. There is clearly an
interest in this product, but this would never be a ordinary generic with 80%-90% generic penetration for sure because
the prescription needs to be changed. But this could be an opportunity when it's launched, but it needs marketing
support. And we need to work with probably with both the PBMs and the retail angle to make it a good opportunity.
<Q - Randall S. Stanicky>: Are there other opportunities out there similar to this? We've seen this approach play out
with Lipitor via Arrow. As you think about the landscape, are there other opportunities on generics drugs that you're
seeing out there, Siggi?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yes, there are. Clearly, there are a lot of opportunities. I think because this is a
prescription drug, it's a little bit more complex because usually you need a sales force behind it. I think some
companies have 505(b)(2) on different salts on big blockbusters out there, which is an opportunity. But also, I want to
emphasize. Part of our portfolio is a 505(b)(2) in the injectable space, and that is much easier to market for the reason
that a decision of using that product is taken in the hospital, the nursing home, and the clinical center instead. And so
they buy in the 505(b)(2) because they deem it clinical equivalence and they use that in the clinic. So I think it's a much
better opportunity or easier to get the opportunity on the injectables versus the prescription drug.
In Europe, on the other hand, I remind you is that different salts are interchangeable. Actavis, for example, launched
atorvastatin magnesium in Spain before the Lipitor salt came off patent. And it was a great opportunity because in
Spain they were allowed to change it in the pharmacy. But as I said, there's a quite a few opportunity. You have to find
a smart way to sell it, but the injectable space is clearly where we will be making an inroad.

Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Ken Cacciatore of Cowen & Company.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Good morning, Ken.
<Q - Ken Cacciatore>: Morning, guys; hey, just a quick question on Adderall XR. Paul, I think that was your original
filing. So just any thoughts going on with the FDA in terms of moving along on some of these products -- Concerta,
Adderall XR?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, I need to be clear. I didn't formulate the product, but it was our filing, I assume, back
many years ago. Yes, I think the FDA has been at least demonstrating the ability to move quickly – more quickly on
some of these complex issues. I suspect they have a number of complex issues facing them, including Gregg's earlier
question regarding OxyContin. These are complex, not easily figured-out issues that they've got to work through, and
they're obviously spending a lot of resources trying to do that. So I applaud them for that effort. Hopefully, we can
shake loose some of the other products that we have pending that have issues surrounding them like this.
<Q - Ken Cacciatore>: Okay. And I was going to ask if you could point to any products, as you just mentioned, that
are like this. Is there any one that you want to highlight as it moves forward through the agency?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: At this point, I don't think I would like to do that. I think there's clearly been issues that
Citizen's Petitions have slowed down a number of our applications, and I think the agency is well aware of how that
works and they're doing their best to address it. But I think more resources are going to be needed for them to able to
deal with them.
<Q - Ken Cacciatore>: Okay; thank you.

Your next question comes from Louise Chen of Guggenheim.
<Q - Louise A. Chen>: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hi, good morning.
<Q - Louise A. Chen>: So I had a few. First one is, in light of the pricing pressure and manufacturing issues faced by
some of your competitors in the generic injectable space, how do you see this as an opportunity playing out for you?
And do you see the ability to make money where others have failed and why?
The second question I had is that you have a lot of potential shots on goal with respect to the women's healthcare
business. How big is that business today, and where do you want it to be over the next three to five years, and maybe
what is the key growth driver or key growth drivers for this business?
And the last question I had was on the key themes and topics you think may be discussed at the upcoming GPH (sic)
[GPhA] (24:01) [Generic Pharmaceutical Association] meeting that starts tomorrow? Thank you.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: So let me start on the injectable business. Clearly, there has been pricing pressure. It's different
between different molecules for sure because there is a shortage in the market. I think the FDA is working with us to
accelerate approvals. We have a big portfolio pending at the FDA of injectable products where we see opportunities.
But also at the same time is that usually manufacturers tend to fix their manufacturing problems. So we don't know how

long it stays.
It also is different between different molecules and different time points. But I think from our point of view is we feel
this is an opportunity. We are investing a lot in injectable product on portfolio both on quality and [ph] non on (24:52)
quality. We have good manufacturing sites, both in Romania and in Italy which supply into the U.S. market, so we feel
good about the market. But to make an overall statement about the pricing, it's different between different molecules,
different based on who your competitor is on each of the molecules.
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: Yes; thank you. This is Fred Wilkinson. On the Women's Healthcare, I'm glad
you recognized that we're -- got a lot of shots on goal; we do. We've been spending the last several years restocking the
Women's Healthcare portfolio. We really just entered back in about two – two and a half years ago with the launch of –
with the acquisition of Crinone and the launch of Generess Fe. We have a prenatal vitamin line that's accompanying the
Women's Healthcare franchise right now, and that rounds out what we're marketing today.
However, I think as you've seen with the acquisition of Uteron and our own internal development, that five products are
coming down the road fairly soon. We've got our progestin patch, which is a progestin-only contraceptive product. We
have Esmya, which is entering Phase III, for uterine fibroids. We have an IUD that comes out of Uteron that will have
global implications. We have an infertility product that will also have global implications, and then eventually a novel
OC, which will change the estrogen component of the oral conceptive business. So we're very excited about the
Women's Healthcare opportunity. We're excited not only for the United States, but the fact that we get to launch most
of these things globally. So I hope that gives you a picture of how we intend to expand the Women's Healthcare
franchise.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yes, and, Louise, regarding the GPhA meeting, I think one big topic, of course, will be
GDUFA implementation and FDA cooperation and trying to work together to make sure that's as smooth as possible.
There are going to be a lot of unintended consequences on some of this stuff, and I think we're going to have to have a
very open dialogue with the FDA. I think patent settlements, of course, will come up. We're heading toward a Supreme
Court hearing, and I think you know our position on that, at least my position on that. And then finally, I think
biologics will be a big part of the discussion as well. As we look to the future, as the country looks to the future,
something needs to be done on biosimilars that makes a reasonable reliable pathway for biosimilars to become
approved and marketed, and it simply can't be overlooked how much that has to get done. So I think those are going to
be the top topics.

Thank you. Your next question comes from David Amsellem of Piper Jaffray.
<Q - David A. Amsellem>: Thanks. Just to follow up on Adderall XR with Teva generic getting approved, any new
thoughts on how you think the competitive landscape will shake out in 2014? Do you think we're going to see
approvals or perhaps the impacts of the Sandoz filings? And then on the generic Lidoderm, any update on what your
latest intelligence is telling you about where Mylan is on their filing there? Thanks.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Let me take that as well; I leave Lidoderm to Paul. I think on Adderall, as we said on
our Investor Day, we will know better the further we go into the year how the competitive landscape will be in 2014
and exactly what happens. Teva got approval for the product. It doesn't change the picture this year because, obviously,
they are in our model. They have an AG today. I don't know their intent and if they're going to change it to their own
supplier or continue with the AG, but it doesn't change the picture as we see it for 2013.
For 2014, obviously, we expect Teva to be in the market. Will there be an additional player? We will know the further
we go into the year and before we give the 2014 forecast. You mentioned I think one or two players that could be there.
At this point in time, we really don't know. But we think – I think in the next three to six months the picture will
become a little bit more clear. Also for the reason, this is a very complex product. The development in Actavis took

over seven years. The development in Teva took many years, as was mentioned before. So I think overall, this is not an
easy product to develop and get approval for. But I think the picture will get clearer throughout 2013.
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: Right. And, David, on generic Lidoderm, we remain convinced that we have
maintained our exclusivity and we will not see generic competition in 2013. It is our anticipation and if we were to
model today how we would look at 2014, we would include a Mylan launch in 2014. But we also know that's there has
been at least some argument that their patch, which is designed differently than the existing Lidoderm patch, may not
be equivalent. That will be an issue between the innovator and Mylan and the FDA. But at the moment, as I said, if we
were to model it today, we would include them as a competitor in 2014.
<Q - David A. Amsellem>: Okay, that's helpful. Thanks.

Your next question comes from Shibani Malhotra of RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: Hi, yes, I've got a couple. The first one is for Bob. It's on manufacturing. Janet Woodcock
recently spoke about the fact that many sales don't value different levels of manufacturing. So I just wanted to talk -I
wanted you to talk through that idea where the FDA comes in and creates manufacturing operations and how you
believe what would be replaced in that sort of scheme.
And then secondly for Paul, the recent Actos generic that was approved by the FDA which wasn't yours, can you just
talk about the implications of that and what that means for the way the FDA is dealing with loss of patent exclusivity?
<A - Robert A. Stewart>: Okay. So on the manufacturing side, I would say that what we are seeing is certainly FDA
is increasing the bar both in terms of its expectations in terms of what's required in filing, so shifting more towards a
quality by design filing requirements. And then also in the inspectional aspect, we're seeing FDA increase both the
duration of inspections as well as the intensity of inspections. So there's no question about it; there's a rising
expectation around process capability, process understanding, as well as just leveling the playing field, so to speak,
between both brands and generics, and we're seeing it across the board on both.
What I would say within the Actavis world, both in terms of legacy Actavis as well as legacy Watson, we were focused
on improving our R&D through quality by design efforts as well as investing a lot in our manufacturing capacity and
capability. So we're already, in our opinion, ahead of the curve in regard to that and we're seeing that in our inspection
performance. So what I would say in general terms is that we feel we actually embrace where FDA is moving in this
regard. And I would say that looking at our compliance across the myriad of manufacturing sites both before and after
the close of the transaction here that all of our facilities really are focusing on the same operating principles.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yes, Shibani, it's Siggi here. I think on the Actos approval, if I recall, it was Ranbaxy
that got approval late. But really it doesn't affect us. We had built in additional competition on Actos. The six months
are more or less at this point in time. We came in three months late due to our court case with the FDA, but overall it
doesn't impact our model for this year.
<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: Okay. I was just more wondering about the fact that there were questions around the first to
file, and the company hadn't actually challenged the patent and that's why they got approved.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yes, I know there have been a number of, I guess, blogs about this issue. I can't say I followed
them all that closely. I think it is something we need to take a look at. This I think has a lot to do with the question
about whether it's a pre-MMA [Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003] or
post-MMA decision. And I think there was also a part of that decision, particularly with respect to Ranbaxy, where they
were able to give a selective waiver. Remember, a selective waiver is that if you are able to launch the product you can
selectively waive your exclusivity to someone else. And that was I believe an old rules provision. It may have carried
over into the new rules, but I'm not 100% certain. So it probably requires a bit of additional research around this whole
question about old rules versus new rules. It may be an issue that comes up – it rears its head again with OxyContin, as

a matter of fact, old rules versus new rules. So while we'd like to think that they're dead, that those products are gone,
but they're not. They'll still be around.
<Q - Shibani Malhotra>: Okay, thank you.

Your next question comes from Marc Goodman of UBS.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: Hi. Siggi, can you talk about some of the key markets OUS, so UK, France, Australia, some of
your key markets, and just what happened in the fourth quarter in the market, what happened with your share? And did
anything happen that's different from what you expected and just things like that?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yes, so let's take a few markets. So in the U.S., clearly we finalized the integration of
Actavis and Watson under the new name. We have kept the markets here of the combined company. We haven't lost
anything which was important and was the goal of the integration. We have worked hard to integrate. So customers
today, they order from one place today. We have one invoice system. And really the team has done a fantastic job in
keeping the sales and keeping the markets here, so that was a good thing.
I think overall in France, both Actavis and Watson have an operation in France. France is doing much better. The
increase in volume in France is significant after the French government changed the prescription rule and has been
pushing for more generic utilization. Still the prices are quite low. There is a competition. This is a market which is in
between of being a branded generic market with the sales forces needed because you need to drive sales with a sales
force towards the pharmacy, even though you don't visit doctors. But it's a growing market in terms of volume and a
little bit in terms of value at the same time.
The UK is a good market for us. The UK now with Actavis and Arrow combined in the UK, we're getting close to 14%
market here. It is the second biggest market. Overall, the growth in the UK for us was on the open molecules. We have
close to 300 different products on the market. I think it's about 330 products. I mentioned in our Investor Day, the
biggest growth product is our old molecule that came off-patent maybe 20 or 30 years, but we have a great supply chain
from our manufacturing plant in Dunstable to allow us to supply the market.
Overall in Australia, there's big price pressure. The Australia market is still growing. What we've got with the Ascent
acquisition is we are not only in prescription. We are in OTC. We are in dermatology. We are in skin care, and now we
are introducing the first brand product into the Australian market. But the price pressure is, clearly the PBS
[Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme] in Australia is introducing a new price list I think April 1 of this year. So we need to
find a way to lower our cost of goods to compete in the market, but we are strong enough. Remember that the top five
companies in Australia are about 97% of the market, but clearly we see additional price pressure in Australia. So
maybe without spending maybe more time, these are maybe the markets that you've mentioned to me.
I think maybe if I add one more market, Russia was probably the biggest surprise, a positive surprise in the Actavis
acquisition. Actavis we didn't have any operation in Watson in Russia when we came in. Actavis was number nine, a
significant growth on top line and bottom line, 430 sales reps. And in fact, we are today the sixth largest OTC company
in Russia. And that's I think a market which we will see significant growth in 2013 and going forward.
<Q - Marc Goodman>: So just to understand, France in actual dollars grew in the fourth quarter and grew throughout
the full year.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: France in actual dollars grew top line in fourth quarter and grew top line for full year.
Probably bottom line it grew also a little bit, but not by the same amount as the top line.

[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from Douglas Tsao of Barclays.
<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Good morning.
<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: Paul, at your analyst meeting, you pointed to Amgen's upcoming analyst meeting for greater
details on the biosimilar strategy or partnership. They didn't provide that much incremental detail relative to what we
knew and what you had talked about. I was just curious from your perspective when we should learn more about some
of the timelines and in particular around development milestones related to that partnership.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: I'm going to pass that one over to Fred.
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: Okay. Thank you, yes. So Amgen, between Amgen and ourselves, we did outline
the products that were now in our collaboration. You saw the four products. I think Amgen outlined what the revenues
were and had the announcement that they expect to launch sometime in the 2017 and beyond period. My sense is that
you're going to see a lot more information, though, as we go through the year, primarily because the clinicals will start
to get listed on some of the websites where clinical trials are required to be listed. And I think you'll see from that the
phasing of when those products will be coming to the marketplace.
Obviously, we're still early for trying to prognosticate what revenues will look like and what competition will look like.
But I think suffice it to say that the strategy of emphasizing manufacturing, emphasizing good quality clinical
programs, and other things are coming out of both of our mouths, and I think we believe in it very wholeheartedly. I
think they were great in describing the flexibility of our relationship, which really affords us the opportunity that when
commercialization comes along, we have two solid selling organizations that can take the opportunity that exists in
different marketplaces. And most likely most of these products will be launched differently in each different country.
<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: Okay. And then, Paul, or perhaps Siggi, if you could perhaps talk about opportunities for
Actavis to take additional market share both in the U.S. market as well as in some select international markets given the
greater scale and product portfolio that you're now offering?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Doug, that's a very good question. I think overall, the markets here in the U.S., we have
the opportunity because – we haven't been able to grow market share in the U.S. due to the strength of our supply
chain. I have to say as of today, we have the strongest supply in the industry. We have extremely good service level to
our customers, and that has allowed us to take additional market share. On top of that, we have 185 ANDAs pending,
so we will have significant new product launches, some of them fairly small, but everything counts when you go for
market share going forward.
Outside of the U.S., there is also this opportunity, and this is a little bit what we've talked about the revenue synergies
which we see going forward. First of all, like in a country like UK, where I mentioned we have 330 products on the
market, we have 5.5 billion tablets coming from the manufacturing plants in Dunstable to supply the market. We have
an excellent service level which has allowed us to grow Actavis. three, four years ago, it was only 9% to 10% market
share. We are growing to 14% – 15% now, which is linked to new products, service level, and the breadth of the
portfolio that coming back to the revenue synergies is this these cross-selling opportunities.
We have a significant portfolio around the world. We have been saying we have more than 1,000 products all around
the world, which we want to introduce in the right market, obviously in the right form. We have a great regulatory and
R&D team to support that. We've already filed the products, Watson products, into Actavis market and Actavis
products into Watson market to allow us to take this opportunity. But this will not come to light until after two to three
years due to the regulatory time lag there is.
<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: Okay, great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from David Buck of Buckingham Research.
<Q - David George Buck>: Yes, thanks for taking the question. This is I guess for either Todd or Siggi. Can you just
give the pro forma number for what the international business was overall in 2012 and what the growth rate was for the
business actually was?
And then may be for Paul, can you talk about just a couple of product updates, Mucinex family, how important the
oxymorphone standard formulation is to yourselves, and also Loestrin 24 and that ANDA, the importance there?
Thanks.
<A - R. Todd Joyce>: David, this is Todd. In terms of the pro forma, we're not going to break down the pro formas on
the top line basis. We did give some guidance at the Analyst Day in terms of pro forma EBITDA for the combined
business, and that was $1.7 billion.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yes, David, maybe I take the first two about Mucinex. We mentioned on our Investor
Day it's included late 2013. It's not a very significant number in our forecast. Obviously Mucinex, the brand company is
moving to a new dosage form at the same time when we don't have approval, so the opportunity has decreased a little
bit at the same time. We still feel good about our application and we put it in our forecast for 2013.
With regard to Opana ER, the question there is we have tentative approval for the 10-milligram, 20-milligram,
30-milligram, and 40-milligram strength. Impax has launched January 1, still the uptake hasn't been significant. As I
mentioned in the Investor Day, we are going to monitor that very closely how much generic penetration will be on this
product. We are ready to go if it is worthwhile as an opportunity to go, but we are monitoring that as we speak.
With regard to the tamper resistant formulation, it's in public [ph] knowledge (44:39). We have filed that formulation
also, so we see that as an opportunity later on. Maybe, Paul, if you take the...
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yes, on Loestrin 24, David, that's a launch we have by contractual right in 2014, and we would
expect to have six months of exclusivity on that product. So it is an opportunity for 2014 and is date-certain, and we'll
maximize that the best we can.
<Q - David George Buck>: And, Paul, just to follow up, so your view is that you're still maintaining that 180-day
exclusivity on Loestrin 24?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yes, at this time, that's correct.
<Q - David George Buck>: Okay, thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from line Ronny Gal with Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Good morning, everybody; two questions. First, on injectable, Siggi, I guess this one will go for
you. One of the things we're hearing from the companies or incumbents in this field is that there is much more of a
portfolio effect in injectables as opposed to being first to market, which is the situation with some of the oral products.
And therefore, when they come back to market, they will be able to take substantial shares at the group purchasing
organization, and some of the new entrants will not be able to hold to the shares they get. I just want to get your take on
that.
And second, we are hearing comments from the FDA that the respiratory guidelines are coming. And if [indiscernible]
(45:58), then some of the companies involved would have seen that portfolio. And I'm just guessing your global, I
guess, guess, would a pathway to make a substitutable generic for Advair and Symbicort be possible?

<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: So on the injectables, Ronny, you're absolutely right, and this is why I didn't want to
comment on the pricing because when a player comes back in the market, the pricing usually goes back down again
because it's group purchasing, as you said. It's key account management. You win a big portion through key account
management. So it's not like you take a fair market share, you win the accounts.
But the goal that we have is we are building the portfolio. We feel that in 2014, probably late 2014, we have a
significant enough portfolio to be able to compete in the injectable space. Today, we have relatively few products
approved. Part of the portfolio is with Sagent, which is selling the products on our behalf. We get part of that profit in
the agreement between the two companies. But we also have a long list of product pending at the FDA to be able to
offer to the groups in group purchasing a big enough portfolio to make it worth their while to work with us. So this is
the reason why Actavis originally didn't go alone into the markets because you're spot on; group purchasing is very,
very important in this whole thing, the service level to be able to maintain pricing but maintain market share.
Maybe on the respiratory, it's a fair question. The guidelines are coming; we sincerely hope so. We still remain that we
are hoping to develop on AB-rated. The backup strategy is 505(b)(2). But because of our infrastructure and sales
structure, the opportunity for us on Advair would be an AB-rated Advair. Like all the companies in the respiratory
space, I think we have been consulting the FD, both on the device but also on the clinical program that needs to be run,
and we are hoping that clarity will come out. What I can say is that the FDA has been very open to give advice. They
have moved forward in giving out scientific and technical advice, both on the device itself, but also on the scientific
program. So we feel that we are in a better position today than a year ago in terms of developing the product. But I
emphasize again this is a big challenge to develop AB-rated generic Advair.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from Elliot Wilbur of Needham & Company.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hi, Elliot.
<Q - Elliot H. Wilbur>: Thanks, good morning, Paul, first question for yourself and Todd. With respect to the pattern
of quarterly EPS progression over the course of the year, any commentary or color you could provide there; it looks
like Street consensus has it roughly evenly distributed, about 48% in the first half and obviously the balance in the
second half. Are you comfortable with that pattern?
And then as a follow-up with respect to performance of the Anda Distribution business in the quarter, can you talk
about some of the factors that led to what seems to be a very high margin. And obviously outside the reiteration of your
expectations for Anda, you've certainly exited the year at a much higher gross margin rate than you're guiding to for the
full year. I'm just curious if there were some one-time items in there or what drove that strong performance? Thanks.
<A - R. Todd Joyce>: Okay. Thanks, Elliot. Let me take the first one on the quarterly EPS progression. I think we
would expect that they would be slightly back-half weighted. And that would be principally due to, of course as it
always is, to launches, but also the realization of certain synergies won't really take place until the second half of the
year. So probably the progression needs to be modulated a bit from what's in consensus. But as you would expect, it
would be more backward weighted the third and fourth quarter.
Bob, you want to take the Anda?
<A - Robert A. Stewart>: Sure, on the Anda side, what we saw really is a quarter-over-quarter phenomenon in which
that this year we're projecting a higher chain, large chain type contribution which dilutes our margin profile, and we
didn't have that same effect in the fourth quarter of 2012. And so basically as you roll that forward, there's a dynamic
there in terms of mix between what I would say larger impact of retail and distribution services in which that dilutes the
margin profile. And that's why you see us guiding a little bit lower in 2013 in terms of distribution margin.
<A - Lisa M. DeFrancesco>: Can we go to our next question?

Your next question comes from Chris Schott of JPMorgan.
<Q - Chris T. Schott>: Great, thanks very much. I have just two quick ones here. First on the base business pricing
dynamics you're seeing in the U.S. market, is the dynamic you're seeing today in line with that mid-single-digit decline
you've modeled, or is there an expectation that market dynamics will change over the course of this year?
And the second question, as I think about the guidance and potential upside levers to the guidance, if we were to see
Actavis beat numbers this year, do you think it would be far more likely that comes from product launches occurring
that aren't in guidance, or would that come off on the cost side of synergies being realized faster than expected? Thank
you.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: So let me talk about the base business. I think overall it's difficult to say. I think we've
built in, as you said, low-single-digit price erosion or mid-single-digit price erosion in the U.S. business. It is driven by
new launches. So when you get the significant new launches of our big product like in fourth quarter when we got
additional competition on metoprolol, that had an impact on the price erosion in the market. Also at the same time, as
every year, we try to take the opportunity of raising pricing if we can. That happens once in a while when some of our
competitors have manufacturing issue at the same time. So we try to balance that; we look for that opportunity all the
time. But overall, it is quite stable through the year, but you see it in [ph] terms of lipid (52:36) when we get a
significant competition on our product because straightaway when you get additional competition, the price goes down.
<A - R. Todd Joyce>: Yes, and, Chris, on upside to guidance, I think it comes from actually both issues. I think our
ability to achieve greater cost capture -- that would be one area that we would look to to drive growth faster and, of
course, additional launches. And then overall, general performance. If we can capture more revenue, if you want to call
them revenue synergies, you can call them that, but it's getting better revenue performance from all the businesses. And
then finally our tax rate; if we can continue to find ways to improve our tax position, even 0.5% or a 1% makes a
significant difference to our guidance. So those are the things I think would be the levers.
<Q - Chris T. Schott>: Great; thanks very much.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from David Risinger of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Christopher Caponetti>: Hi, it's Chris Caponetti for Dave. A couple quick ones for Todd, please. I was
wondering if you could comment on organic growth in the OC and extended release franchises in the fourth quarter.
And then also if you could provide some color on the adjusted other operating income, I think it was $33 million after
GAAP adjustments in the fourth quarter. What drove that, and should we be seeing that in 2013? Thank you.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure, in terms of the OC, I'll have Siggi...
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yes, so as we have been very clear in OCs: there is no organic growth per se. We are
the largest supplier to the U.S. market with Teva, and it declines because of additional competition quarter on quarter.
We built that into our forecast. We expect it to decline. There has been approval from Sandoz, Lupin, Glenmark and
others, and obviously Mylan has been talking about coming into the market over the last two years. So there is no
organic growth but there has been less decline in the OC business than we had expected, and that gave us the upside in
the last year.
With regard to the modified release, its market share. It's basically when you get an additional modified release is when
we launch the new product. We have a significant pipeline of modified release products that we develop in Florida.
Actavis also brought to the company a significant pipeline of modified release, so we see an opportunity. Do you call
that organic growth? Yes, I want to call new launches organic growth because that's part of our business. So I feel that

we will continue in the controlled release formulation. We have a significant pipeline, significant portfolio. Each and
every product obviously goes down due to additional competition. As I mentioned, Toprol had competition from both
Mylan and Dr. Reddy's after mid of last year, and that led to significant price erosion in the market.
<A - R. Todd Joyce>: In terms of what's going through the other line within our financials, we've got some significant
non-GAAP gains going through there, which includes the gain on the divestiture of our own morphine sulfate product.
We had the gain on the euro hedge that was entered into hedge our exposure on the acquisition price. We also had the
Rugby disposition as well as the Moksha8 gains running through that line during the fourth quarter. And we'll post the
full detail of all of those items on the web shortly after this call.
<Q - Christopher Caponetti>: Great, thanks very much. And, Siggi, any good news on Intuniv for us?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: What do you mean by good news? We are in the court cases ongoing. And I think we
just want to say that this year, Shire said is we are in talks, but there is no progress as of today.
<Q - Christopher Caponetti>: Great, thanks very much.

Your next question comes from Jami Rubin of Goldman Sachs.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hi, Jami.
<Q - Ariel Herman>: Hi, this is Ariel actually in for Jami today, just one quick one on Revlimid. Can you just give us
a broad update on the case and your confidence in your position, and then maybe what are the next catalysts we should
be looking for?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: I think I'll handle that reasonably quickly. It's still a long way to off. As you probably know,
we're expecting hopefully the Markman hearing sometime later this year. We're hoping for it. It hasn't been set yet.
That would be the next catalyst in the case and we'll continue to pursue it. There are lots of patents that we've got to get
through. It's complicated but we're going to continue to pursue it.
<Q - Ariel Herman>: Okay, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Your next question comes from Jason Gerberry of Leerink Swann.
<Q - Jason M. Gerberry>: Just an Advair question, a couple actually. But can you just talk about when you would
need to invest in your own proprietary dry powder inhaler device and whether 2013 CapEx includes any spend towards
building up manufacturing capacity for DPI inhalers? I know your competitors have been pretty vocal about making
investment in DPI inhaler manufacturing. So I'm just curious where Actavis stands on both of those fronts and whether
we should be thinking about that as a partnership opportunity to overcome those hurdles or whether you make those
investments to CapEx in the out years? Thanks.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yes, Jason, you are spot on. We see this as a partnership opportunity. We're working
with different partners on different products. So overall we see who brings the best to the table. There are multiple
devices out there. We have evaluated quite a few of them. We think we have a good device that we are working on. But
overall, we see this that our partner would bring the device to the table. For DPI manufacturing plant, we don't see that
as a priority at this point in time because there is a significant clinical program to get through before even we go there,
and there is plenty of manufacturing space available that we can utilize, so not at this point in time investment.
<Q - Jason M. Gerberry>: And can you give us a sense of what you think it would cost if you were go it alone to
build up enough manufacturing scale to go after Advair?

<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: It would be a total shot in the dark. I don't think I'm going to comment on that.

Your next question comes from Gary Nachman of Susquehanna Financial.
<Q - Gary Nachman>: Hi, good morning.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Good morning.
<Q - Gary Nachman>: Paul, what's the outlook regarding your ability to do more branded deals in the near term? Are
there a lot more opportunities out there, and would they most likely be in similar size and scope to Uteron, do you
think? How do you think of that?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yes, I think that would be the way to think about it. For the short term, we're looking to
continue to fill pipeline slots as well as looking for even revenue slots if possible. But I would say that that's about the
right size for the short term. We're looking to pay down debt, as you know, but we certainly have the flexibility to do
that. I would also say we would continue to look for opportunities on the Actavis Pharma side as well. We have not –
we know we have some areas we'd like to shore up and provide additional opportunities. So continue to look for us to
do smaller tuck-in acquisitions in the short term and then position ourselves well for maybe a deal later on.
<Q - Gary Nachman>: Todd, maybe you can just tell us what was the leverage ratio at the end of 2012 and just
remind us of your targets for the end of this year and next year. Thanks.
<A - R. Todd Joyce>: The leverage ratio was just under 3.8 times at the end of the year. And our goal, assuming no
business development opportunities present themselves, we should be at roughly three times by the end of the year.
<Q - Gary Nachman>: Okay, thank you.
