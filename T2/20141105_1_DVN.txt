MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to Devon Energy's third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a
listen-only mode. This call is being recorded.
At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Howard Thill, Senior Vice President of Communications and Investor
Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Howard J. Thill
Thank you, Connor, and good morning. I too would like to welcome everyone to Devon's third quarter analyst and
investor call. I am Howard Thill, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations for
Devon Energy. Also on the call today are John Richels, President and Chief Executive Officer; Dave Hager, Chief
Operating Officer; and Tom Mitchell, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, we have a
number of other Devon executives in the room with us.
If you haven't had a chance to listen to the management commentary, you can find that along with the associated slides
and our new operations report at devonenergy.com. Additionally, starting with this quarter's results, we have included
our forward-looking guidance in the earnings release. I hope you've had a chance to review those documents because
today's call will largely consist of questions and answers.

With that, I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, John Richels.
John Richels
Thank you, Howard, and good morning, everyone.
As you all have seen, Devon delivered exceptional performance during the third quarter. We achieved record oil
production, which exceeded the high end of our guidance by 6,000 barrels a day. And with that strong execution, we
increased our 2014 production growth outlook by about 300 basis points, from 11% previously to 14%. And very
importantly, that increase came with no change in our 2014 capital spending profile.
We also increased our profitability, with pre-tax cash margins expanding by 20% year over year and exceeded Wall
Street's earnings expectations by $0.10. And lastly, we completed the final leg of our strategic repositioning with the
closing of our U.S. non-core asset sales.
So overall, it was an excellent performance for Devon, and we expect the strong operational momentum that we
delivered to continue into 2015.
While we're closely watching developments in the commodity markets, we are extremely well positioned to fund our
2015 capital program. We've got one of the strongest balance sheets in the sector. We are very well hedged, and we
have visible opportunities for continued dropdowns to our midstream business. This places us in a position to continue
to invest in our portfolio of high rate of return projects and many of the best U.S. resource plays.
So with that, as Howard said, today's call is going be a Q&A call basically. I'd just like to actually congratulate Howard
and his team for the changes. I hope that you all found it helpful, but we tried to put out the very best information that
we could. So with that, I'll turn it over to Howard for Q&A.
Howard J. Thill
Thanks, John. Before we get started, I'd just like to remind everyone to please limit yourself to one question with an
associated follow-up so that we can get as many people on the call as possible. And you can requeue for additional
questions as time permits. And so, Connor, with that, we're ready for the first question.

<Q - Doug Leggate>: So I wonder if I could take a couple. First of all, you've still not taken any steps to increase your
inventory in the Delaware Basin. I realize you've taken type curves up and so on. But I'm just curious as to what is it

going to take for us to see the greater confidence level as you derisk that play? And I've got a follow-up, please.
<A - David A. Hager>: Hi, Doug. This is Dave Hager. We are doing downspacing pilots in the first half of 2015.
When we see the results of those downspacing pilots in the second Bone Spring, we anticipate that our inventory will
increase. If you obviously look at our presentation and our investor book, it shows that we're currently just using four to
five wells per section. And so we think there's upside, particularly in the second Bone Spring, to this and we'll test it
with these downspacing pilots. And I'll remind you also that in our 5,000 locations we haven't counted anything from
the Wolfcamp. We think that's going to work and we think it's going to work well, but we just think the economics are
stronger in the second Bone Spring. So we're going to concentrate our evaluation there initially and then let the industry
do some of the derisking in the Wolfcamp and the Leonard Shale.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: I guess, Dave, I should have been more specific. I really was referring more to the Wolfcamp
than the Bone Spring because that's the area that's still TBA. After the numbers that we saw from EOG this morning, it
would seem that they're starting to suggest in a very similar area to yourselves that they've got much greater
confidence. I'm just wondering what it's going to take for you guys to get to the same point.
<A - David A. Hager>: We are drilling – actually, we drilled our first Wolfcamp Shale well in Loving County, just on
the Texas side. We're currently flowing back that well as we speak, so we'll have results for that in next quarter's call.
We'll be analyzing all the industry data and be providing numbers. Again, we have the acreage. It's not a question of
whether we have the acreage. It's just a matter of us analyzing the industry results and then providing you guidance
around that based on the industry results. So we're very confident it's going work, and so our overall inventory is going
to go up. It's just that we want to see a little more results.
Again, we think the economics are a little bit stronger in the second Bone Spring. We have more of the second Bone
Spring than some of our industry peers just given where our acreage is actually located. But the second Bone Spring is
a little bit shallower. It's a little less expensive to drill, and it's a little more oily. And so all of that cause the economics
in the second Bone Spring to be a little better, but that's not to say it's not a good, strong opportunity in the Wolfcamp,
and we're glad EOG is having success. It just makes our acreage look that much better.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Great. My follow-up, if I may, David, is related. I guess before I get into this, I should say that
the new disclosure and the conference call and everything else is really terrific, so thank you for making our lives
easier. But my question really is more about the increase in the type curve in the Bone Spring. So the IP rates obviously
went up significantly but the actual EUR did not appear to move. I think you put a plus on it as opposed to changing the
number. So I'm just wondering if I'm missing something there or if you could help us understand what your real
aspirations are as you look at that. And I'll let someone else jump on, thanks.
<A - David A. Hager>: We probably could have put a plus-plus-plus on that, to be honest with you, Doug, because we
feel very good about that as we get additional data and we get more production data on these wells that the EURs will
increase. We just want to see more production history before we say exactly what the new EURs will be. But I can tell
you; so far what we're seeing is these wells are coming on at significantly higher rates and they are essentially
paralleling the old type curve. They are not falling off more rapidly. So we feel very confident the EURs are going to
increase. We just want to get more data on these wells before we actually come out with what the increase will be.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: That's very clear, Dave. I hope you see you at the Father's Day game this weekend. Thanks.
<A - David A. Hager>: I'm planning on it, thank you.

<Q - Scott Hanold>: Maybe to stick with the northern Delaware Basin for now and just a little bit more color on some
of those downspacing pilots, obviously, four to five wells you seem pretty confident on and going to eight. Can you just
give us a little bit of color what you're looking for there? Is it just maximizing recovery? And should we expect because
those reservoirs drain pretty well, is it going to communicate a little bit, or do you think that those eight wells could be
fairly independent?
<A - David A. Hager>: Obviously, that's what we need to find out with these downspacing pilots. But what we're
really looking for is do we have good economic opportunities with these downspacing pilots, and so do they generate
returns that are competitive within our portfolio that we would want to drill these downspaced wells. We think that
particularly the most opportunity does sit in the second Bone Spring for this downspacing opportunity. Again, as I've
highlighted already, that those are the best economics in the northern Delaware Basin anyway. So if we have
downspacing opportunities, our belief is that they will compete very well within our portfolio.
But that's what we're really looking to see is just what kind of – obviously, there may be a little bit of degradation of
performance. We don't know. But with these larger fracs that we have, again, the whole idea is to create more complex
fracture networks immediately around the well bore but not to have them reach out as far, so that you can create these
downspacing opportunities where you can do the same thing on a downspacing basis and have very strong returns.
That's the theory of where we're going. We think it's going to work. We just want to see the proof with the actual pilots.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Okay. And is your acreage such that you could do a lot of this in pad development? Are you
blocky enough where this could be a pretty good thing? I don't know what the right number is, but what do you
envision?
<A - David A. Hager>: Well we're doing a lot of well pad development already and we can continue to do a lot of this
with pad development now. The specifics of how we would develop the downspace pads, I may have to defer. We may
have to just build additional pads and take them into incremental facilities on the same acreage there. I think that's our
plan right now. But frankly, we need to get a handle early on how much – there are not only downspacing opportunities
in the second Bone Spring. But if you go back to our investor presentation, we have slides there that show that also in
some of these areas we have Delaware sand potential. We have Leonard sand potential, and we have Wolfcamp. Not all
of them on all of the same acreage, but we have some areas where multiple formations are prospective. We actually
have even additional zones within the second Bone Spring that we're not sure that we're fully exploiting at this point
either, and upper sand in the second Bone Spring. We're testing that as well.
So there are not only downspacing opportunities but there are stacked lateral opportunities in the Delaware Basin that
again could significantly increase our inventory. And we need to get a handle for how many wells per section that
might be ultimately, and so we're doing some pilot testing around that. But the four or five wells per section when you
look at it on a stacked basis may be significantly higher than that.
<Q - Scott Hanold>: Okay, I appreciate that. It looks like you got a lot of good work in front of you. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Charles Meade with Johnson Rice. Your line is open.
<Q - Charles A. Meade>: Good morning, Dave, John, and Howard and the rest of your team there. A lot of good stuff
you guys have this quarter. But if I could just go back to the earlier question on the Bone Springs, I'm wondering if you
can add a little bit to the narrative of how you've changed your completion design and how much maybe that – whether
those – I believe it was 13 new wells in the quarter that led to this updated type curve, whether those were using the
1,500 pounds – 2,500 pounds per lateral foot that you referenced in your new completion design or whether those were
before this recent change.
<A - David A. Hager>: Charles, I can give you an answer on that. Our old completion design was really around 600
pounds per linear foot. We are now testing, as we said, up to 2,500 pounds of sand per linear foot. So far, we have
pumped between 25 and 30 jobs in the 1,500 to 2,500 pounds per linear foot range. Of those, we have actual well

results on about half of those. Now some of those have just not been on very long at all, and so we're still monitoring.
Others we have 30 days-plus. But the bulk of the well results you're seeing in Q3 do not have the larger, as far from a
production standpoint, actual production, do not have the larger jobs in there. And that's one of the reasons we have
confidence our volumes are going to continue to grow in the future.
Now what is the actual sand sizes in our type curve? I can tell you it's not – it's less than 1,500 pounds of sand per
linear foot. And so we think that if these jobs work on a consistent basis, there is additional upside to our type curve in
future quarters, but we need to see those results first and see that on more wells to really be able to say exactly how
much that would be.
<Q - Charles A. Meade>: Dave, that was an excellent answer. You actually saved me from having to ask a follow-up
because I was going to ask about what the future holds. So let me, if I could, go in a slightly different direction for my
follow-up. A lot of what you talked about in the Eagle Ford or one of the things you talked about in the Eagle Ford was
the optimization of choke management once you put those wells on production. That makes sense with you guys taking
over operatorship at that point. But is there a chance for a similar sort of completion optimization in putting higher sand
loading on those Eagle Ford completions as well?
<A - David A. Hager>: We're working with our partner, BHP, on that right now. Absolutely, we think there is. We're
working with a revision of a completion design on that. We're not prepared to go into a lot of detail as we speak right
now. But we can tell you that there is – we think there is upside associated with that when we get more results with our
revised completion design. We've already made modifications to it, but we'd like to see more results before we actually
go out with anything.
<Q - Charles A. Meade>: That makes sense, thank you.
<A - David A. Hager>: I might also mention – they're telling me here to mention it. Another good thing to mention is
we have done the larger revised completion design in Lavaca County where we actually operate, and you're seeing the
IPs on those.
The other thing I might mention on this choke management is that we have so far, most of the choke management work
we've done we're doing on a very engineered basis. That has been done primarily on older existing wells that have
already had significant decline. The real upside here, which you're not seeing yet in the production numbers and which
are upside to the type curve also, is when we start applying this very engineered approach to new wells, to new
completions. And so that's upside that we have not yet quantified for you but we think exists with the inventory. And
we're starting to roll that into, again, on a managed basis, managing well pressures to make sure we're maximizing rates
of return and we're not degrading performance. But we're starting to do this on an engineered approach with new wells.
And so there's still big upside potential if it works as well as we think it will on new wells.
<Q - Charles A. Meade>: That's great detail. Thanks a lot, Dave.

Your next question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: Good morning, gentlemen. I wanted to see if you could maybe elaborate a little bit on some of
the commentary around 2015 E&P capital being at similar levels to 2014. I just wanted to see if you could give us a
little bit of color because you are accelerating in the Cana. You have a full year of Eagle Ford spend in 2015 versus
2014, and you are accelerating some completion activity and you're ramping in the Delaware as well. So I just wanted
to see if you could give us some comfort level with next year's CapEx.
<A - John Richels>: Arun, as you know, we're still poring over next year's budget. We're just working on it now, and
we'll be coming out with it over the next little while. You're right. We're changing the number of rigs that we have
working in some of the areas, and all the things you point out are correct. But part of what we're doing is just shifting
our focus to the highest rate of return areas. So for example, we expect next year that the number of rigs that we have

working in the Miss [Mississippian] will probably go down in some areas and the southern Midland Basin may go
down, and we'll shift those rigs over to some of these other areas. So we feel pretty confident at this time that the kind
of growth that we've talked about, the 20% to 25% oil growth in 2015, is achievable within a budget that is similar to
what we had in 2014, which I think is a really positive development for us.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: Is perhaps another factor just perhaps reduced spending at Jackfish on a year-over-year basis?
<A - John Richels>: That as well. Certainly, we have less spending at Jackfish. As we mentioned, we are going to do
some appraisal work and some additional engineering work on Pike. That will be probably $250 million. But with the
completion of Jackfish 3 and relatively low maintenance capital on that whole Jackfish complex, we'll see our
expenditures come down there as well.
<A - David A. Hager>: Arun, this is Dave. As a reminder too, what I've been talking about with these previous
answers I've been giving, we're getting a lot more efficient. And so we don't have to add as much capital because we're
getting much higher IPs, and we think we're getting higher EURs in a number of these plays, and so it's not all about
adding rigs. We add rigs when we need to. But if we can get it out of better completions in a much more efficient way
with higher rates of return, that's a better way to go. And we think we're accomplishing that in a number of our plays.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: Just in summary, so the efficiency gains that you're seeing are going to offset maybe higher
activity levels plus the impact of some of the carries wearing off. Is that fair?
<A - David A. Hager>: Right, that's certainly part of it.
<A - John Richels>: We're not seeing it going up. Again, we stand by what we said on the capital though. It's going be
very similar to – we can have these kind of growth rates with very similar capital as we had in 2014, and those are the
reasons why.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: Okay. And my follow-up question is just regarding EnLink. I just wanted to see, John, if you
could articulate maybe your thoughts on ways to maximize value from this strategic partnership with EnLink. And
perhaps you could just remind us how this now improves Devon's overall capital efficiency and some of the cash flows
you get on a recurring basis from dividends.
<A - John Richels>: Sure, you hit on a couple of important points. Over the past several years, we've had a fair amount
of capital that we've put into our midstream operations. And with the transfer of assets to EnLink, that obligation or that
responsibility for that expenditure goes to EnLink. So that just leaves more of our cash flow available for our
development projects, which is a good thing. We also have, given that EnLink has very stable fixed-fee contracts for
the most part, we have a fairly reliable cash flow stream that comes to us from EnLink.
And as we look at the future, we've got a great asset there. The day we transferred our assets into the new entity to form
EnLink, it had a market value of about $4.8 billion. Today it's somewhere up around $9 billion. And as I said earlier,
we have a very visible growth profile as we continue to develop the assets that our management team at EnLink have
brought to the table. They've got a lot of organic growth opportunities, but we have continuing dropdowns both from
the general partner to the limited partner and from the possibility of facilities dropdowns from Devon to EnLink. So all
of those things point towards more efficiency on our part, more capital efficiency on Devon's part because of the
increased cash flow that's going into our development projects, and an increasing valuation for EnLink over the next
while; so all in all, a real positive development for us.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of David Heikkinen with Heikkinen Research. Your line is open.

now and the fourth quarter of 2015 whenever you make your board consideration?
<A - John Richels>: I think, as you know, David, on Pike, we're a 50% owner of Pike, and our non-operated partner is
BP with a 50% interest as well. And so this work that we're doing is very necessary work in order for us to really
understand the project and know what the capital costs are going to be and to fully delineate the area with the additional
stratigraphic test well. So this is work that's absolutely necessary for us to do, and it doesn't really change anything that
we might do going forward. I think we'll get this work done over the year and then take it back to our board for
consideration late in 2015. It really has no impact on exactly how Pike rolls out over time because this is work that –
this is a great looking project in what looks to be the sweet spot of the oil sands for SAGD development, so it's
something that we absolutely need to get our arms around. And then we'll take that to our board for consideration
probably late in 2015.
<Q - David Martin Heikkinen>: Okay. Then in the Eagle Ford, I thought your comments and you highlighted and
again reiterating Doug's comments, the operation report is really helpful and bold and italicized stands out. So the
potential for new type curve improvements and new wells around optimized production practices relative to your
quarter-over-quarter growth rates and your 100,000 barrel a day at least target in 2015, how should we think about a
sustained growth rate in the Eagle Ford with new type curve improvements? It just seems like your quarter-over-quarter
growth rates accelerate given the pull-down of backlog for the next couple quarters. Is that a fair assumption to think
you're accelerating growth in the fourth quarter and first quarter?
<A - David A. Hager>: Yes, I think that's probably a pretty fair assumption, Dave. We're really pleased with the way
things are working out. And we do see that with these new completions that we're working on right now as well as our
production optimization activities that we're doing, we see that things are continuing to improve, I would say. So we
haven't come out with definitive guidance regarding 2015, so I'm being careful not to say too much. But I can tell you
things are on the positive rather than on the neutral or negative, and so we feel really good about it.
<Q - David Martin Heikkinen>: Congrats, guys. Thanks.

Your next question comes from the line of Paul Sankey with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
<Q - Paul I. Sankey>: Good morning, everyone. Again, thanks very much for the additional disclosure. We always
greatly appreciate that. A very high level strategy question; hearing you talk and describe the way things are going, it
sounds like the move in oil prices really hasn't changed anything. Is there anything that has changed in your view of
future strategy as a result of the $25 drop in per barrel oil prices? Thanks.
<A - John Richels>: First of all, when we're implementing our strategy, as you know, we're looking at longer-term
prices, not what the spot price is today. Frankly, the longer-term prices haven't changed that much from where they
were when we developed the strategy and when we made the moves to so significantly transform our portfolio. So we
put ourselves in the position today of having an asset base that has very good rates of return that can generate high
margins where we can have robust growth and that has a lot of flexibility for the future in terms of oil or liquids-rich
gas. So really, the spot price, the change in the spot price hasn't really affected our view of what we might do.
And as we get into 2015, I think the very strong position that we're in is we've got one of the strongest balance sheets in
the sector. We're very well hedged already for 2015. We've got over 50% of our production hedged at a floor price of
$91 a barrel. So we've got a lot of price protection from that point of view. And with the additional financial levers that
we have with the dropdowns that we were talking about and other, we put ourselves into a very, very good position
even if prices stay a little bit soft in the near term. But as you can appreciate, as we get into 2015 and we start executing
that 2015 program, we're really more interested in what oil prices are towards the end of 2015 and 2016 and 2017
because that's when that production comes on and when you really drive the returns on the additional work that we've
done. So we feel very good about the strategy. We feel very good about the portfolio and the opportunity set that we've
created for the next several years.

<Q - Paul I. Sankey>: Great, that's a complete answer. Thank you very much. On gas markets, could you just update
us on what you see out there on natural gas as we head into winter? Thank you.
<A - Darryl G. Smette>: Yeah this is Darryl. And obviously, we started out 2014 with very severe winter weather. It
drove gas prices up. As we went through the summer, we've seen additional production come onstream which was
anticipated, probably a little bit more than we originally thought, especially out of the Utica and the Marcellus, and then
a very mild summer compared with the last couple that we've had.
But as we go into 2015, while we do see a continued increase in supply, we also are starting to see some increase in
demand we think. Most of that will come in the second half of the year and into 2016 with some additional capacity
coming on with petrochemical plants, electric generation, more exports to Mexico. So we're still fairly comfortable that
over the longer term we're going to see prices that range between $3.50 and $5.00. And as we look right now, they're
probably going be a $3.75 to $4.25 price for 2015. So we're pretty comfortable with those numbers. Those are numbers
that we've used in all of our economic evaluations for the last two or three years. So just as John said on the oil side,
there has really been no surprise to us in terms of what gas prices have been and how we've modeled the projects we
have before us.
<Q - Paul I. Sankey>: Great, guys. Thanks for the complete answers. Thank you.

Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: Thank you, good morning.
<A - John Richels>: Hey, Brian.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: We definitely appreciate the ops report, so thanks much for that. Can you talk to your needs
for infrastructure investment, particularly in the Eagle Ford and the Permian, over the next couple of years, and how
that level of investment differs, if at all, from what was being made in 2014?
<A - John Richels>: Let's let Darryl answer that question. He's the expert on it.
<A - Darryl G. Smette>: Brian, when you're talking about infrastructure, I assume you're talking about what I'll call
marketing or midstream infrastructure. Is that correct?
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: Actually, let me be clear because that's a good point. I was thinking more to support your E&P
growth, so processing to directly support your production growth plans, any sand expansions or logistics expansions,
water, et cetera, as opposed to what would be done by the midstream subsidiary for third parties.
<A - Darryl G. Smette>: I'll let Dave talk about water. Just in terms of – let's take the Eagle Ford first. Our acreage,
except for Lavaca County, both on the gas side and the oil gathering side, is dedicated under long-term contracts with
third-party midstream companies. Under those contracts, they have obligations to increase capacity as we increase
production in both cases. We so far have seen them perform, although we did have some gathering issues on the liquids
side, the ones we acquired from GeoSouthern. They worked very diligently to correct those issues, and each day that
gets better. So we expect it in terms of takeaway both on the oil and the gas and the liquids side in the Eagle Ford that
that won't really be an issue for us.
Turning to the Permian, we're in a lot of different areas, but what we have here is a little bit of a similar story in that a
lot of our acreage that we have here has previously been committed to third parties. Now there are some opportunities
in some areas for us to do independent work, but for the most part our acreage is dedicated to third parties. We've
worked with them consistently over the last two or three years to make sure that we have facilities in place when we
develop our wells.

Now we do not anticipate through at least 2015 and into 2016, we do not think there are going be any takeaway
capacity problems either on the gas side or the oil side or any processing issues. Now that could change if we get much
better results than we anticipate. But right now, we feel pretty comfortable where we are there. We do have some issues
on some Devon facilities, gathering facilities, where we undersized those facilities based on the success we've had. And
so we're now in the process of going back to those facilities and increasing capacity on those, and that process is
ongoing. We think most of that's going to be completed by the end of the first quarter, maybe into the second quarter of
2015. But we feel pretty comfortable where we are from a midstream type perspective in both of those areas.
<A - David A. Hager>: Brian, this is Dave. I might just talk briefly from the sand and the water standpoint. And before
I do that, I might even just make a more global comment here that we have put a real emphasis internal to the company
on what we call project management, which really is to make sure that we're doing good long-term planning addressing
all the issues that you're describing, and so that's a real focus within the company. We're not just out there drilling
wells. We're looking down the road two, three, four, five years and making sure we're addressing all those issues that
you're bringing up.
Regarding the sand side of the business, we think that we are – I'm not going to say it's not tight, it has been tight. But
at the same time, we think that we have the ability through our relationships with the service companies to get the sand
there for the wells. The tightest has been in the Permian Basin, obviously. Historically, the most difficult part is what
we call the last mile, which is really just trucking to the location. That has been somewhat improved here in the past
couple months or so. Overall, we think it's going be tight. But we think that given the strength of the company and the
strength of our relationships with the service providers and the bigger service providers particularly that we use the
most that we can handle that.
On the water side, we do not see any significant issue there at all. We are bringing in water actually from outside, from
the north into near where our activity is located in the Delaware Basin. We don't see any significant issue and we've
been planning for that. So we're in good shape.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: I appreciate that. And my follow-up is actually a follow-up to David Heikkinen's question
earlier, which is with regard to the Eagle Ford and the potential for type curve improvements next year. Can you just
add some color on what you're thinking about spacing in DeWitt County and whether there is the simultaneous
potential for downspacing and a type curve improvement, whether the spacing is set, and so it would just with be a type
curve improvement or one or the other?
<A - David A. Hager>: We're drilling on average at about 50-acre to 60-acre spacing. That is composed of 40-acre
spacing in the more oily parts of the play and then 80-acre spacing where it gets a little bit more gassy towards the
southern end of our acreage position. So on average, it's around 50-acre to 60-acre spacing currently.
Now, do I in theory see some potential upside for the same type thing that we're talking about in the Delaware Basin
where we could, with these more advanced and more complex fracs that are not reaching out as far, do I see some
downspacing potential in theory? Yes, I think it may exist. But frankly, we're less – let me put it this way. We're less
mature in our discussion process with our partner regarding that potential right now than we are on other initiatives.
And so the first thing we need to do is get these new better completion designs working real efficiently. And I think if
we do, then we maybe ought to make some progress on downspacing also.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: Great, thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of John Herrlin with Société Générale. Your line is open.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Great, thank you and thank you for the ops report. Dave, with respect to the shale wells with
greater frac completion intensity, are you just waiting for time to recognize the improvements, or are you doing any
science, any monitoring, micro-size, micro-tracers, or anything?

<A - David A. Hager>: We're doing quite a bit. I'll tell you what. I am going to turn the call over to our head of E&P,
Tony Vaughn, who can give you an even more detailed response to this, John. He's really close to this. So let him talk
to you about it a little bit.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Thanks.
<A - Tony D. Vaughn>: Thanks, Dave and John. I think you lead into a good conversation. In general, we're being
much more bullish in acquiring a lot more data than we have in the past. I think some of the things that have
differentiated Devon from some of our other companies that we compete against are just that. And so we are taking
cores, pressures, temperatures. We're using fiber optics in a lot of our wells around the company.
We also have a well-con 24 hour, seven day a week, 365-day center that really monitors all of our execution activities
very closely, so the attention to detail is much higher. We've stood up a lot of our integrated reservoir optimization
teams to take this data, incorporate more technical work into it. It's really providing a lot more abilities for us to model
both the reservoir, model the frac design work that we do. So the long answer is yes, we are taking a lot more
information. We're monitoring the data through micro-seismic, in some cases through fiber optics. It's really causing us
to see the real specifics about where our injected volumes are going, what's really providing benefit and what is not.
So actually, I think some of the questions that started the call out was more, and I think Dave hit on it very well, was
more about optimization, and that's exactly where we're at. So we're seeing improved rates, recoveries, and returns in
almost all of our areas. I think Cana was a great standalone example of taking a project that really wasn't competing in
our portfolio from a commercial standpoint and through much more improved data acquisition and technical work has
turned it into a project that we are anticipating funding in a much more aggressive fashion in 2015.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Great, thank you. My next one is for John. With the free cash flow from Jackfish, obviously
you can fund Pike. But in the event that that's not going be a project that's ramping up immediately, would you
repatriate the $1 billion a year to the U.S.?
<A - John Richels>: We sure want to try to do it, John, in the most capital or tax efficient manner that we could. And
frankly, I will point out to you. Even if we go ahead and fund Pike, we're still going have a bunch of free cash flow in
Canada because it's not taking up the Pike project. If it were to go ahead, it wouldn't take up $1 billion a year either. So
we are going to have some free cash flow. And my guess is that we won't bring that back. We'll try to do it as tax
efficiently as we can and deploy that here in the U.S.
We haven't in the past. We sometimes left those funds offshore or in Canada because we have not had to change or
alter our capital spending plans as a result of where cash is. We've got enough balance sheet flexibility, as you know,
and enough liquidity that we're not constraining our capital decisions in the U.S. by where the cash is. So that all points
to trying to bring that cash back in the most tax efficient way and not herding it back because it's really not going to
change our behavior in any event as long as we have the financial strength and liquidity that we have.
<Q - John P. Herrlin>: Great. Thanks, John.
<A - John Richels>: Okay. Thank you, John.

Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell with Tuohy Brothers Investment Research. Your line is
open.
<Q - Jeffrey L. Campbell>: Good morning. And I'd like to add to the commentary on the ops report which I've
already told Howard, which I think is great, but I also want to thank you for this expanded Q&A.
My first question is on the Delaware Bone Springs. Can you talk a little bit about how much the enhanced completion
method is increasing the per well completion costs on average versus the previous completion methods? And can you
provide any color on the return uplift that you alluded to in the ops report from these larger completions?

<A - John Richels>: Yes, the incremental cost is around $1 million give or take for the larger fracs. Obviously, it
depends on whether it's 1,500 pounds of sand or 2,500 pounds of sand per linear foot, but that's a good estimate for
what it is. So far and again, we haven't come out with the potential higher EURs. I can tell you that based on the very
preliminary data that we've seen that the enhancements in the rate of return are somewhere between significant and
staggering. And they are outstanding and certainly justify the incremental $1 million cost. And so we just want to get a
little bit more confidence in that before we roll out all those numbers.
<Q - Jeffrey L. Campbell>: That's good color. I appreciate that. The other question I wanted to ask was with regard to
the Eagle Ford. Could you provide some color on how you built such a large inventory through the third quarter of
2014 that you alluded to in the report? And going forward what is the inventory number you'd prefer to see?
<A - John Richels>: It just has to do – the inventory that has built up just has to do with the fact that we've obviously –
and this part of the business is, again, managed through BHP historically. But they've just been drilling wells and they
haven't had enough completion crews to quite keep up with the number of wells that they've drilled.
And that is why we have agreed to increase the number of frac crews, and actually they have agreed to have Devon
operate two of those frac crews. So we were increasing from five to nine, so two of those nine will actually be operated
by Devon. And we anticipate that they will take the number of uncompleted wells down by approximately 50%, from
around 120 to somewhere around 60 wells, somewhere at the end of Q4. And that's one of the things that does also give
us confidence. Not only are we going to see good production increases in Q4, but that's going to sustain itself through
the first part of 2015 as well.
<Q - Jeffrey L. Campbell>: Okay, thanks very much.

Your next question comes from the line of Biju Perincheril with Susquehanna. Your line is open.
<Q - Biju Perincheril>: Hi, thanks. Good morning.
<A - John Richels>: Good morning, Biju.
<Q - Biju Perincheril>: Obviously, your domestic portfolio has improved tremendously over the past year or so. I'm
just wondering with that. Has there been any change in how you're thinking about the oil sands business? Where does
that stack up related to your domestic business net?
<A - John Richels>: Biju, the oil sands business has some very positive characteristics that are different from some of
the rest of our business. We've always said that we thought that over time, we were going to provide the best returns
and the most solid returns for our shareholders by having a diversified portfolio. And we've never wanted to be just a
gas company or just an oil company. And so to have – we've liked that mix between natural gas, natural gas liquids,
and oil. And the mix between light oil and heavy oil is a positive one because they trade very differently and have very
different characteristics.
What we've been seeing with our heavy oil business is that the margins have increased significantly over time. And part
of that is the reduction in the differentials as more certainty has arisen around the Canadian oil sands business with
regard to takeaway capacity, and that's likely to continue. So our view of the future from a differential perspective is
that it's going to become more stable, less volatile over time, and that it's going be lower than it has been historically.
That's as a result of Energy East and Keystone XL, which will come on at some point in time, and Flanagan and all of
the pipelines that are being built; rail now being a significant part and probably a permanent part of the takeaway
capacity. So it's a very good business. As a matter of fact, in this quarter our operating margin from Jackfish was
somewhere just shy of $40 a barrel, so it's a pretty good business.
And so as we look forward, to have a piece of our portfolio in this type of asset that has basically no decline for 25
years, relatively low maintenance capital, is a nice piece to have. So it's still firmly part of our business. And I will say

that, and you've heard me say this, Biju; that when we got into this business, we recognized that if we were going be in
this heavy oil business, we had to be in a top quartile or a top decile project. We can't make money otherwise. And we
are fortunate our guys did a great job and we picked a project area that is really in the top part of this industry. And so
it's a real strong part of our business going forward.

your next question comes from the line of Phillips Johnston with Capital One. Your line is open.
<Q - Phillips Johnston>: Hey, guys. Thanks, two quick questions on the Medina well and the other four upper Eagle
Ford wells that will be spud by year end. First, are you using enhanced completion designs on those wells, and do you
plan to apply the same choke management system that you've tried in the lower Eagle Ford?
<A - David A. Hager>: Yes and yes.
<Q - Phillips Johnston>: Great. And just as a follow-up, you've talked about how these wells are located in the
thickest part of the upper Eagle Ford and certainly thicker than the area to the northeast where there have been some
very good well results by other operators. My question is what sort of IP rates or 30-day rates would you expect from
these wells? And if the wells are successful, how many upper Eagle Ford locations could you potentially add to your
overall inventory in the Eagle Ford?
<A - David A. Hager>: I don't want to – it's not even about initial IP or 30-day rates. It's about the sustainability of
those rates and what kind of EURs we need ultimately from those wells. So I don't have a specific number I'm going
lay out there for that to judge success or lack of success on those, but we'll be obviously watching the first few months
of performance.
How much there is, we're not quite ready. I don't think I have enough information really to say how much additional
resource or how many locations we have. We need to see some success here. This is a different type of formation
geologically also. This isn't a shale. This is a marl, M-A-R-L, which is a type of carbonate reservoir and actually has a
little bit of primary porosity to it. So it's going to behave significantly differently than a shale reservoir will. And we
need to see more results to really say what kind of spacing we could have if it works to see how many locations.
I will point out, I think you're probably well aware that obviously there have been some wells drilled to the northeast by
other operators, Penn Virginia and others. But I think also if you move to the southwest, there have been other
companies, I think specifically Marathon, that have been drilling wells for this same interval. This is not the upper
Eagle Ford shale. Some might call this the lowest-most Austin Chalk, but we've chosen for historical marketing reasons
I'd say to call it the Eagle Ford rather than the Austin Chalk. But it's actually a marl section that's above the upper Eagle
Ford Shale.
<Q - Phillips Johnston>: Okay. Great, thanks.

There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to John Richels, CEO, for closing comments.
John Richels
Thank you, and let me just make a couple comments and I'll turn it over to Howard just for a couple comments as well.
But I just want to say a couple of things. Thank you for hanging in with us for this long call, and we had some great
questions. But just want to pass on our thoughts here. We've seen a significant transformation in our asset portfolio
over the past year. So we have a great portfolio today with high-margin assets and a portfolio that has years of visible

growth. So today, we are laser focused on execution. And that's what's helped us deliver a great quarter for the third
quarter of 2014, allowed us to raise our full-year production target. And we're not taking our foot off the gas and this
strong operational momentum is going to continue into 2015 as we continue to grow our oil production and our cash
flow. And again, notably, I think we're doing that in a very capital-efficient manner. We're well positioned to fund our
2015 capital program with our strong financial position.
And lastly, while we clearly possess a great deal of financial strength, we are fully committed to exercising capital
discipline, maximizing our margins, maintaining our balance sheet strength, and optimizing our growth in cash flow

additional questions, please don't hesitate to give any one of us a call. We look forward to seeing you out on the road.
