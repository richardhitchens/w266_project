During this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. In our press release, slides accompanying this
webcast and our filings with the SEC, each of which is posted on our IR website, you will find additional disclosures
regarding these non-GAAP measures including reconciliations of these measures with comparable GAAP measures.
Finally, unless otherwise stated, all comparisons in this call will be against our results for the comparable period of
2012.
Now I'll turn the call over to Tom.
Thomas J. Szkutak
Thanks Sean.
I'll begin with comments on our first quarter financial results. Trailing 12-month operating cash flow increased 39% to
$4.25 billion. Trailing 12-month free cash flow decreased 85% to $177 million.
Trailing 12-month capital expenditures were $4.07 billion. This amount includes $1.4 billion in purchases of our
previously leased corporate office space as well as property for development of additional corporate office space
located in Seattle, Washington which we purchased in fourth quarter 2012. The increase in capital expenditures reflects
additional investments in support of continued business growth consisting of investments in technology, infrastructure
including Amazon Web Services and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations.
Return on invested capital was 1%, down from 12%. ROIC is TTM [Trailing Twelve Month] free cash flow divided by
average total assets minus current liabilities excluding current portion of long-term debt over five quarter ends.
The combination of common stock and stock-based awards outstanding was 471 million shares compared with 464
million one year ago.
Worldwide revenue grew 22% to $16.07 billion or 24% excluding the $302 million unfavorable impact from
year-over-year changes in foreign exchange rates.
We're grateful to our customers who continue to take advantage of our low prices, vast selection and shipping offers.
Media revenue increased to $5.06 billion up 7% or 10% excluding foreign exchange. EGM [Electronics and General
Merchandise] revenue increased to $10.21 billion, up 28% or 30% excluding foreign exchange. Worldwide EGM
increased to 64% of worldwide sales, up from 60%.
Worldwide paid unit growth was 30%. Active customer accounts exceeded 209 million. Worldwide active seller
accounts were more than 2 million. Seller units represented 40% of paid units.
Now I'll discuss operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation. Cost of sales was $11.8 billion, or 73.4% of
revenue compared with 76.1%. Fulfillment, marketing, technology and content and G&A combined was $3.83 billion
or 23.8% of sales, up approximately 289 basis points year-over-year. Fulfillment was $1.74 billion or 10.8% of revenue
compared with 9.5%. Tech and content was $1.26 billion or 7.9% of revenue compared with 6.5%. Marketing was
$616 million or 3.8% of revenue compared with 3.6%.
Now I'll talk about our segment results and consistent with prior periods, we do not allocate to segments our
stock-based compensation or other operating expense line items. In the North America segment, revenue grew 26% to
$9.39 billion. Media revenue grew 14% to $2.51 billion. EGM revenue grew 28% to $6.13 billion representing 65% of
North America revenues, up from 64%. North America segment operating income increased 31% to $457 million, a
4.9% operating margin.
In the international segment, revenue grew 16% to $6.68 billion. Adjusting for the $301 million year-over-year
unfavorable foreign exchange impact, revenue growth was 21%. Media revenue grew 1% to $2.54 billion or 7%
excluding foreign exchange and EGM revenue grew 28% to $4.09 billion or 32% excluding foreign exchange. EGM
now represents 61% of international revenues, up from 56%. International segment operating loss was $16 million, a

0.2% negative operating margin compared with income of $49 million.
CSOI increased 11% to $441 million or 2.7% of revenue, down approximately 27 basis points year-over-year. Unlike
CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock-based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP
operating income decreased 6% to $181 million or 1.1% of net sales.
Our income tax benefit was $18 million and includes $46 million of discrete tax benefits primarily resulting from the
retroactive reinstatement of the Federal Research and Development Credit that was enacted in January of 2013.
GAAP net income was $82 million or $0.18 per diluted share compared with $130 million and $0.28 per diluted share.
Turning to the balance sheet: Cash and marketable securities increased $2.18 billion year-over-year to $7.89 billion.
Inventory increased 27% to $5.4 billion and inventory turns were 9.5, down from 10.4 turns a year ago as we expanded
selection, improved in-stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 29% to $8.92
billion and accounts payable days increased to 68 from 62 in the prior year.
I'll conclude my portion of today's call with guidance. Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we've
seen to date and what we believe today to be appropriately conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently
unpredictable and may be materially affected by many factors including a high level of uncertainty surrounding
exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy and consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict
demand and therefore our actual results could differ materially from our guidance.
As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intra-company balances and foreign
currencies amongst our subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters and changes to our effective tax rates can
all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don't conclude any additional business
acquisitions, investments or settlements, record any further revisions to stock-based compensation estimates and that
foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they've been recently.
For Q2 2013, we expect net sales of between $14.5 and $16.2 billion, a growth of between 13% and 26%. This
guidance anticipates approximately 275 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP
operating income or loss to be between a $340 million loss and $10 million income compared to $107 million income
in the prior year period. This includes approximately $340 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of
intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income, which excludes stock-based compensation and
other operating expense to be between zero and $350 million compared to $360 million in the prior year period.
We remain heads-down focused on driving a better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We
believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholders.
Thanks, with that, Sean, let's move on to questions.
Sean Boyle
Great, thanks, Tom. Let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call. Operator, will you please remind our listeners how
to initiate a question.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from analyst Brian Pitz with Jefferies.
<Q - Brian J. Pitz>: Great, thanks. In February you changed your FBA fulfillment fees. Any comments on how this
affected third-party sales and what was the overall merchant response? And then just quickly, any update on your latest
plans for new fulfillment centers in 2013? Thanks.

<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of – I'll take the second part of the question first. In terms of new fulfillment
centers, we've announced three in the U.S. right now and then a few outside of the U.S., consistent with prior years, it's
early. We really like the growth that we're experiencing. We'll be adding more FCs through the course of the year, but
stay tuned and we'll update you as we go.
In terms of FBA, you know, there's not a lot I can talk to there. We're very pleased with the FBA business. We think it's
great for sellers, great for customers. And we're pleased to offer that service.
<Q - Brian J. Pitz>: Great, thanks.
Operator
Moving on, we'll hear from Scott Devitt of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Scott W. Devitt>: Hi, thanks. Tom, the international segment sales growth of 21% continues to show modest
deceleration, and I think with the exception of 4Q it's been trailing U.S. growth. And I understand that AWS is mostly
booked in the U.S. so that's a piece of the delta. But you've talked in the past quarters about the investments in
international driving margin to these break-even levels in international. I was wondering if you just could talk through
the deceleration in the revenue growth in those markets and whether that's comp-related, Europe macro or otherwise?
And then secondly, shipping costs on a net basis is again leveraging. I think that's the second consecutive quarter. I just
wonder if you could refresh us in terms of when the accounting change occurred in terms of the shipping revenue
calculation for FBA to just understand if that's just an organic number now? Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: The second half of the question, there's – it is organic. So there's no – it's consistent
year-over-year. So this is the first quarter that would be consistent year-over-year.
In terms of your question international, we're seeing still very solid growth, 21% on a local currency basis. As you've
read, certainly there's some softness from a macro standpoint that others are seeing, hard to know whether that's
impacting us and how much. We're not a bellwether for the economy but we're very pleased with the growth that we're
seeing. Again 21% on a local currency basis, unit growth is actually growing substantially faster than that. So, again,
that's what we're seeing.
In terms of investing, you're absolutely right. We're investing in a number of geographies, including certainly China.
We've been investing for several years, we continue to invest there, we think it's a great long-term opportunity, but
we're in investment mode and certainly some of the more recent additions that we've had with Italy and Spain are
certainly in investment mode as well.
<Q - Scott W. Devitt>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Moving on, we'll take a question from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Thanks. Just a broad question on demand. This kind of mid-teens at the low end revenue
growth that you've been guiding to for a quarter or two now, that would seem well below kind of the average that
you've seen in the past. Are there any other factors you would want to call out or specifically not call out? Do you think
that things like the imposition of state sales taxes are having a near term drag on growth rates? Last quarter I think you
talked about consumer electronics at the high end. Are there any particular categories there you'd want to call out as
maybe driving that low – that could produce the low end of the range outside of negative FX? Thanks, Tom.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure. We give, as we've been consistently doing, we're giving a wide range. We think it's
appropriate given all the factors. That's not something new that we're doing. That's something we've been doing for
some time and you're right, the growth rate guidance for Q2 is 13% to 26%. Certainly foreign exchange is having an

impact. That includes approximately 275 basis points of foreign exchange. So it's approximately 16% to 29% on a local
currency basis. So again, it's a wide range and there's probably not a lot to add there, but it takes into account all of the
things that we think we need to take into account as we give guidance.
And in terms of the absolute dollar range, it's very similar to what we would have, in terms of the dollar range, we
would have given for Q1. I think it's maybe $100 million difference in terms of the absolute value of that range that we
gave, so again, a wide range. We think that that's appropriate.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Thank you, Tom.
Operator
Our next question today will come from Ben Schachter of Macquarie.
<Q - Ben Schachter>: Are there any factors that are impacting the unit growth, particularly the shift from physical to
digital, for instance, a rented video versus purchasing a video or is there any other factors you'd highlight that are
impacting the unit growth?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: The one factor I would call out, first of all, in terms of overall unit growth, our overall unit
growth is 30% year-over-year, again, very solid growth. It compares to approximately 49% in Q1 of last year. So we're
certainly overlapping a pretty strong growth last Q1.
In terms of the physical and digital, certainly one thing that we're seeing is certainly digital is growing at a much faster
rate. And where you do see that a little bit is in our third-party units as a percentage of total units, you'll see that that's
approximately 40% this quarter. That compares to last year, up about approximately 100 basis points. But what we are
seeing is because the digital units are growing at a faster rate and they're mostly first party, you're seeing that number
impacted where that percentage as a percentage of our total is not growing as fast as it has the last few quarters. And,
again, that's largely driven by the digital units growth that you're seeing.
So again, if you were to back out, for example, and just look at our physical units, our physical units as percentage of
total units this year versus last year is up over 300 basis points. Again, that's 3P growth as a percentage of total units.
<Q - Ben Schachter>: Thanks.
Operator
Our next question today comes from Ross Sandler of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Ross A. Sandler>: Yeah, thanks guys. A question on the follow-up question on the shipping. So just your
shipping cost, not your net shipping margin, but just shipping cost relative to gross profit declined about 300 basis
points, similar to what you've seen over the past four quarters. So as you start to comp some of these efficiency gains
that you're seeing in shipping, do you think that line will continue to show leverage or is it going to start to level out
from here? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: We're certainly not giving guidance on any specific line item, but certainly over a long
period of time we think there's opportunity to be more productive there. And there's certainly efficiency gains to be had
there and that's something that certainly the team will continuously work on.
Operator
Next we'll hear from Colin Sebastian of Robert W. Baird & Co.

<Q - Colin A. Sebastian>: Thanks, a question on Web Services. I wonder if you can comment on enterprise level
adoption, whether there are any meaningful barriers to that happening over time? We notice you've been pretty
aggressive in hiring enterprise level salespeople. Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: No, I don't think that there is. I think that the team's doing a fantastic job in terms of
developing services that are great for many different customer types including enterprises, and the team is heads down
focused on making sure we have a great operational – these services are great from an operational standpoint and
security standpoint and they're doing a terrific job and so it's a very great opportunity for enterprises to adopt our Web
Services and the team is certainly focused on that along with other customers. Other customer sets. So again, it's a great
opportunity for those customers and for us.
<Q - Colin A. Sebastian>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Thanks for taking the question. You've clearly been more aggressive in terms of video
content recently and you're sort of leading with it more in the release tonight in terms of the business content. I was
hoping you could just add some more color here on the value that you think that TV and movie content adds to
consumers' overall purchase patterns. Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Sure. It's certainly one of our digital offerings and we have a number of, a few different
services. We have certainly content that we're using as part of our Prime offer that we have a lot of free content for
customers. We think that's a great service to customers along with our express shipping offers as well as other content
that we have free, for example, our Kindle Owners Lending Library for books. So again, we think it's a great – Prime is
a great value for customers and it's part of that value proposition.
We also have a very good transaction business for video as well that's growing very, very fast, and certainly customers
like it and we're seeing that reflected in the results that you see today.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Thank you.
Operator
Moving on. We'll hear next from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch. Mr. Post, your line is open. Please go ahead with your
question.
<Q - Justin Post>: Sorry about that, I was on mute. I was wondering if you could help us a little bit about the Kindle
ecosystem. On prior calls a few years ago you singled it out as a fast growth area and you were very happy with the
performance. We haven't heard as much about it lately. Kind of the impact of – how units are doing against your
expectations and then the impact it's having on Prime subs and also your gross and operating margins. Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: We're very pleased with our Kindle and digital business and we're super excited. In terms
of the ecosystem, you're certainly seeing that in our results that you see today.
For example, if you look at our media growth where certainly that ecosystem is more penetrated there than it is in
international and you see that reflected in those associated growth rates. Another way you see it is if you take a look at
our top ten best-selling items worldwide in Q1, the top ten are all either digital or Kindle-related. Paperwhite is our
best-selling product worldwide.
But again, all ten spots in the Q1 were either Kindle or digital items and I believe that that's the first time that we've
seen that. We've been looking at that from a quarterly results standpoint for some period of time and we've had various
levels of the top 10 but I think this may be the first quarter we've had all top ten being either Kindle-related or

digital-related.
So again, we're very pleased with what we're doing there and we're going to continue to innovate on behalf of
customers.
<Q - Justin Post>: Any impact on your gross or operating margins that you want to call out?
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: You know the one thing I would say is we certainly are investing. It's certainly an area of
investment and you're seeing that reflected. We're making a number of investments across the business, and certainly
we're investing in Kindle and our digital offerings. We're investing in some of the other things I mentioned earlier like
China, some of the emerging geographies. So those are certainly some of the larger key investments we're making.
<Q - Justin Post>: Thank you.
Operator
Moving on, we'll hear from Matt Nemer of Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Matt Nemer>: Good afternoon. We're hearing reports that there is refrigeration equipment going into some of
your fulfillment centers outside of Seattle area. I'm just wondering if you can update us on plans to expand Amazon
Fresh? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: No, I have nothing to announce. We're very pleased with what we've seen in the Seattle
area. But again, it's been a test and we continue to monitor that test carefully. It's certainly something that we see that
customers love the experience. The challenge has always been making sure we can get the economics right and that's
something we'll continue to focus on.
Operator
And up next we'll take a question from Steven Ju of Credit Suisse.
<Q - Stephen Ju>: Hey, Tom, anything you can say in terms of how much Amazon Instant Video as well as
potentially your own in-house produced content currently helps and will – should in the future help reduce churn at
Amazon Prime? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Thanks for the question. Yes. We haven't released any of the numbers. It's something that
we're tracking very closely. It is something that we believe over time will reduce churn and is certainly helping today.
What we are seeing is great traction, we see a lot of usage of the service, customers love it and we think it's a very
interesting part of Prime offering and that's why we have been expanding and why you see some of – the more recent
announcement including some of the stuff included in the earnings release today around original content. So again, it's
something that we find very interesting and we're excited about it.
Operator
And we'll go next to Ken Sena of Evercore Partners with our next question.
<Q - Ken Sena>: Hi. I was just hoping you could maybe provide a little bit more color on the unit growth deceleration,
and looking back over the last four quarters, it seems like about 500 basis points or so each quarter of deceleration. You
had about 200 basis points here which is an improvement, but anything you could say just to any signs of maturity in
some of the businesses and maybe where that deceleration is specifically coming from? Thank you.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: No, it's not a lot I can add. I think 30% is still a very strong growth rate. Again, that's
growing at a faster rate than revenue: revenue at 22%, revenue at a local currency growth of 24%, very strong.

Third-party growth continues to be very strong. Retail growth is strong. So again, there's not a lot I can provide you
there. But again, keep in mind that we are overlapping 49% growth last year Q1 which is certainly a little bit of a
difficult compare, but again, pleased with the 30% growth rate.
Operator
And our next question today comes from John Blackledge of Cowen & Company.
<Q - John R Blackledge>: Great, thanks. Just a question on the Amazon advertising platform. Given the immense
amount of purchase data you have on Amazon customers, how is that being used as a competitive advantage and maybe
just provide an overall view on the direction of the Amazon ad platform over time. Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of the platform itself, we think it's a very sizable, very good long-term opportunity
for us. And it's something that we've been working on for some time. And we just think it's very interesting. One thing
you'll notice on our site we're being obviously very – making sure the customer experience is great. What we're really
trying to do is we're trying to help customers find and discover what they want to buy online. So we're very – again it's
very customer-centric but it's also from a business standpoint a very good long-term opportunity. We have a great team
that's working on the opportunity and we're excited about the long-term potential of it.
Operator
Moving on to Anthony DiClemente of Barclays.
<Q - Anthony Joseph DiClemente>: Hi, thanks. I'm just wondering what you're seeing in terms of the attach rate of
your transactional video on demand business versus usage of Prime Instant Video. I'm wondering if your consumers
tend to choose between the two when they're making a selection, or does one sort of drive the other? Does a Prime
subscriber have a higher transactional VOD attach rate than a non-Prime? So it would be helpful to hear what you're
seeing there in terms of usage.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: Yes, I think the only thing I can help you with is we see, I'll take Prime customers, for
example. We certainly see adoption of the service in terms of free content, but those same customers are purchasing
content as well. And so there is a good attachment to it, which we like.
And what we see Prime members doing, not just within video content, but we see them doing a lot of cross shopping.
So it's not surprising. We see them do – maybe a customer comes and has been traditionally purchasing them pre-Prime
in a few categories. We find that they do a lot more cross-shopping, same thing with digital content.
As they use the service, they might start with the free content and then they will also continue to view and stream free
content but they'll also purchase paid content. So it's a nice effect that we're seeing, which is why we like Prime so
much.

Up next we'll hear from Youssef Squali of Cantor Fitzgerald.
<Q - Youssef H. Squali>: Okay, thank you very much. Two quick questions, please. Going back to the international
question, what's causing international media to decelerate? I think last year, Q1, I think it was up 22%. FX-adjusted this
quarter it was up 7%. Is it all macro or are there any maybe other factors that you can talk about, maybe specific to the
SKUs or something? And the other is more of a clarification. I know last quarter you gave the unit growth in aggregate
versus the unit growth of 3P. I was wondering if you could give that to us as well.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of the international media growth, this quarter it was 1% on a dollar basis, 7% on
a local currency basis. You know, in terms of the overall growth rate certainly what you're seeing is digital content as

part of that is growing very fast but it's not as large or as penetrated, our ecosystem isn't as developed, I would say, as it
is in the U.S. And so when you compare the two geographies for a second, that's one of the more meaningful
differences that you see between the two is you see that both are growing digital content very fast. It's just the
ecosystem is more built out in North America. But, again, certainly we see very positive signs given the growth we're
experiencing in international, it's just on a lower base, so that's again, to be helpful there.
In terms of the unit growth we said that our overall unit growth was 30% for the quarter. Our 3P unit growth, I don't
have the overall growth rate, but it's growing at a faster rate than the total.

Our next question today will come from Jordan Rohan of Stifel.
<Q - Jordan E. Rohan>: I was hoping you could comment on the market entry and expansion strategy for Amazon in
Brazil. There seemed to be a tremendous amount of press last year about it and it seems to have died down to some
degree. I know the company may already be there with Amazon Web Services and some Kindle offerings but when do
you think that might get a little bit broader?
And secondly, there's been some stories recently about an Internet streaming device, a box, a set top box, something of
the sort. Can you comment on any new hardware form factors including that plus some sort of a cell phone or handset
that might be coming down the pike, anything to look forward to in the Kindle family or related? Thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: In terms of geographic expansion, there's not a lot I can say specifically about Brazil. We
think we're in the right geographies. Right now we've expanded into a number of geographies over the past few years.
It's certainly something always we look at and you should expect us to expand into additional geographies over time.
In terms of any questions related to our product roadmap, we have a long-standing practice of not talking about what
we might or might not do there. But we're certainly excited about the product roadmap that we have for the future, and
again, we have a long-standing practice of not giving details until closer at launch.

And ladies and gentlemen, we do have time for one final question today. That question will come from Jason Helfstein
of Oppenheimer and Company.
<Q - Jason S. Helfstein>: Thanks, can you give us a little more color around customer growth? I mean, that number
has been slowing, not dramatically, but that is a slowing trend. Are you focused more on higher value customers to
drive the business and any color around the quarter would be helpful, thanks.
<A - Thomas J. Szkutak>: We're actually pleased with the growth from a customer standpoint. We've seen very good
growth, and we continue to – we have many, many teams across Amazon that are just heads-down focused on trying to
improve the customer experience and inventing on behalf of customers, so we couldn't be more pleased with what
they're doing and you see that reflected in our overall growth rate this quarter, with revenue up 24% on a local currency
basis, and units growing at 30% on top of a strong growth quarter last year Q1.
<Q - Jason S. Helfstein>: Thank you.
Sean Boyle
Great. Thank you for joining us on the call today and for your questions. A replay will be available on our investor
relations website at least through the end of the quarter. We appreciate your interest in Amazon.com and look forward
to talking with you again next quarter.
