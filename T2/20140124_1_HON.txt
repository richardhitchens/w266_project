MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Honeywell's Fourth Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. At this
time, all participants have been placed in a listen-only mode, and the floor will be open for your questions following the
presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded.
I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Elena Doom, Vice President of Investor Relations.
Elena Doom
Thank you, Zach. Good morning, and welcome to Honeywell's fourth quarter 2013 earnings conference call. Here with
me today are Chairman and CEO Dave Cote; and Senior Vice President and CFO Dave Anderson.
This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at
honeywell.com/investor. Note that elements of today's presentation do contain forward-looking statements that are
based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. These elements can change and we ask
that you interpret them in that light. We do identify the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in
our Form 10-K and other SEC filings.
This morning we'll review our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2013, as well as share with you our
guidance for the first quarter and full year 2014. Finally, as always, we will leave time for your questions.
So with that, I'll turn the call over to Dave Cote.
David M. Cote
Thanks, Elena. Good morning, everyone. As I'm sure you've seen by now, Honeywell delivered another excellent
quarter, capping off a terrific 2013. We're benefiting from our diverse portfolio and that continued focus on new
products and geographic expansion, plus our ability to effectively manage in what continues to be a slow growth macro

environment. The importance of that balanced portfolio was evident last year as it helped us to offset some of the
headwinds we faced in Defense and Space and Advanced Materials over the course of the year.
Most importantly, the businesses all executed very well, delivering margin expansion in every business last year. As for
the fourth quarter, it's very encouraging to see sales grow 8%, up 5% organically, with organic growth better than
expected across all four businesses. We continue to drive margin expansion, up 50 basis points year-over-year, or an
impressive 70 basis points when you exclude M&A. And we delivered pro forma earnings per share of $1.24, $0.02
above the high end of our range.
So we're starting this year with positive momentum. Short cycle order rates continue to get better. And there are
pockets of acceleration in the commercial aftermarket, ESS, Advanced Materials and Turbo, all suggesting a modest
improvement in end market conditions overall.
We're also seeing order momentum out of our long cycle businesses, building on the robust backlog that's positioned
heading into this year, with ACS solutions orders up strong double digits and our Defense backlog up about 20%
year-over-year due to strong international wins.
We're also increasingly confident in our outlook because of the smart gain deployment actions we took in the fourth
quarter. As you saw from our press release, we're able to proactively fund restructuring and other actions, fully
deploying the $195 million pre-tax or $0.16 EPS gain from the sale of B/E Aerospace shares in the fourth quarter.
You'll recall we received about 6 million shares as part of the Consumable Solutions business sale in 2008, and we sold
2.6 million of those shares in that fourth quarter. We also sold an incremental 1.5 million shares in this first quarter, and
that will yield about a $0.10 gain that we'll similarly deploy with repositioning and other actions. So in total, a pre-tax
gain of approximately $300 million; $200 million in the fourth quarter and $100 million in the first quarter, with some
more remaining in the bank.
Restructuring benefits have been an important driver of our productivity engine, and they'll continue to drive benefits in
2014 and beyond. Dave will take you through some of the details in a moment, but the projects funded in the fourth
quarter alone are estimated to yield about $50 million of benefits in 2015, with a full run rate savings of over $100
million. We're being proactive about keeping that pipeline full. And as such, we're planning to fund additional projects
in the first quarter with the gain that we'll have from those B/E share sales. We think these actions position us well for
further margin expansion over the next five years.
In the fourth quarter, we took the opportunity to accelerate a $50 million charge related to environmental matters at
Lake Onondaga in Upstate New York, minimizing future environmental headwinds from this site by proactively
seeking agreements for the completion of both dredging and capping activities based on our ability to complete the
dredging portion a year early and reducing the overall cost of the project. We think this sets us up very well over the
coming five years as we'll begin to show moderation in ongoing environment charges in the out years.
And we also offset the loss on the sale of Friction Materials through the deployment of that B/E share gain. As you saw
earlier this month, we agreed to sell Friction Materials, which we expect to close sometime in the second half of the
year. We think this transaction will help our Turbo business focus on their differentiated technologies and long-term
growth outlook.
While we think it's prudent to remain cautious on the overall macro environment, we're also increasingly confident in
our 2014 outlook based on the momentum we saw in the fourth quarter. So for the year, more of what you've come to
expect: strong sales conversion and double-digit earnings growth, and strong cash flow. We're going to continue to
remain flexible. And while managing our cost is important, we're also focused on supporting sales growth and investing
in high ROI capacity in PMT, new products and technologies, and high growth regions.
Our strong backlog and new product pipeline is setting us up for a multi-year cycle of outperformance. For example,
Honeywell's Wi-Fi Smart Thermostat with Voice Control won the Envisioneering Innovation & Design Award for
2014 at the International Consumer Electronics Show. This latest connected home innovation employs new voice
technology allowing people to simply say, hello, thermostat, to activate and control their home's temperature. And I've

got to say this is pretty cool. I've got them in my own house and it's pretty neat, because if nobody else is listening, at
least your thermostat does what you ask it to.
As everyone at Honeywell knows, I'm extremely optimistic about where we can take our proprietary cloud-based voice
control solutions. We're focused on providing a more productive and enhanced customer experience, and our guys keep
getting better and smarter with a bunch of new stuff in the pipeline. And you can expect to see lots of cool innovations
at the March Investor Day, where each of the businesses will highlight a number of new products and roadmaps for
future growth and productivity.
We're focused on delivering 2014, but we will also be issuing new, five-year targets through 2018 that we think will
continue to differentiate Honeywell. Our seed planting for the future, great positions in good industries, our strength of
execution and the power of One Honeywell will allow us to deliver on those targets and continue to outperform again.
So with that, I'll turn it over to Dave.
David John Anderson
Thanks, Dave. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for participating in this morning's call. Let me start on slide number
four, the 4Q 2013 results.
As you can see from the numbers we delivered at or above guidance on every metric in the quarter. Sales came in at
$10.4 billion, above the high end of our guidance range. They grew an impressive 8% on a reported basis, 5% on an
organic basis. The strength we saw at the year-end was broad-based, as Dave said, with better-than-expected results
really across each of the segments. We'll take you through those details in just a moment. On a regional basis, organic
sales were up 5% in the U.S., up 4% in Europe, and we had organic growth of 13% in the fourth quarter in China.
Segment profit growth and margin expansion were both strong. Segment profit increased 12%; margins expanded 50
basis points to 16.1%. And if you exclude M&A, which of course was largely the impact of Intermec, segment margins
expanded 70 basis points, with growth in all four of the businesses. Productivity continues to be a key driver, of course,
offsetting inflation and also offsetting the continued investments that we make for growth.
When you move below the line, which we're going to detail further on the next slide, you'll see that our gain from the
B/E share was fully deployed through higher restructuring, environmental charges, as well as the recognized loss on the
sale of Friction. Pro forma earnings per share, which excludes the impact of the fourth quarter mark-to-market
adjustment was $1.24, an increase of 13% on a year-over-year basis. Now the fourth quarter reported EPS of $1.19, up
$0.32 from last year, which you recall included roughly last year $1 billion pre-tax mark-to-market.
This year, in the U.S. we ended up with no MTM adjustment, as the potential gain that we would've occurred – which
would have occurred was offset by the proactive adoption of the latest pension mortality table, specifically the latest
2013-DB projection scale for those technical pension experts out there. So what remained was an adjustment in our
international plans, primarily due to lower interest rates in Germany or about $50 million pre-tax or $0.05 earnings per
share.
In the U.S., we ended the year with a discount rate of 4.89%, a return on asset of 23.1%, which contributed to 100%
funded status globally in our pension plans at year-end. Now for the full year 2014, we're now expecting about $130
million pension income left in 2014 compared to 2013 based on those better-than-expected return on assets. And we
expect this lift to generally be offset with higher OPEB and repositioning expenses over the course of the year. So that's
the same as we guided when we spoke to you in December.
And finally, free cash flow in the quarter of $1.4 billion represented 142% free cash flow conversion and brought the
full year conversion to just under 100%.
So with that, let's go to the one-time gains and deployment, slide number five, to give you a little bit more detailed view
of the deployment of the B/E share gain. Now as you can see and as we've said, that $0.16 per share gain from the sale
of 2.6 million shares in the fourth quarter equals the amount recognized for restructuring actions, corrective

environmental remedies and the sale of Friction. Restructuring represented about half of the gain deployment. And
building on some of the themes you've heard from us before and you'll hear more about it in March in our Investor Day,
these restructurings actions really support our future performance.
On average the projects included in the fourth quarter have a little longer paybacks than our historic average, but still
very good ROI. They'll provide a modest tailwind for 2014 earnings, really again supporting the confidence that we
have in our guidance range. But that benefit will roughly double to approximately $50 million of PBT or EBIT in 2015,
with further benefits in 2016 as we realize run rate savings from these actions of approximately $110 million per year.
Next you can see the incremental environmental charge Dave referenced earlier. I'm not going to go into detail in this.
Again, it's the proactive agreement that we sought on the ongoing Lake Onondaga remediation. We're now likely to
complete, as he said, dredging activities a year earlier. As a result, we've got better visibility on the cost profile going
forward, and that supports both production and cost efficiencies that lead to moderation in our out-year expenses over
the next five years.
And finally, the recently announced sale of Friction Materials to Federal-Mogul, which results in a $0.04 book loss in
the quarter. The transaction is expected to close, as we've said, in the second half of the year. And until then, of course,
the Friction business will remain part of our full year 2014 outlook.
And finally based on the roughly 1.5 million B/E shares we sold in the first quarter, so quarter-to-date, we expect an
additional $0.10 per share gain that we intend to deploy further to restructuring and other actions, similar to what we
had in the fourth quarter. So overall, these actions again will help position the company very well for future earnings
growth.
Let's go now to slide six, talk a little bit about the full year results 2013. Sales up 4%, 2% organic, to $39.1 billion. Of
course, the reported sales reflect the favorable impact of our acquisitions, primarily Thomas Russell, Intermec and also
RAE Systems. Segment profit for the year, up 8%, double the growth in sales, demonstrating again impressive
conversion, translating to 70 basis points of margin expansion to 16.3%; really terrific performance and continuing that
track record at Honeywell.
All of this resulted in pro forma earnings per share of $4.97, up 11% over 2012; again, another year of double-digit
growth. You recall, we set the bar high for 2013 and we delivered again above the high-end of the range. And again,
our recorded EPS for the year reflects a $0.05 mark-to-market adjustment related to the international plans as I
discussed with you earlier.
And finally for the full year, free cash flow at $3.8 billion was slightly above our guidance, driven by the strong finish
to the year, despite an increase in CapEx in 2013. And a lot of that, of course, going to the initial stages of capacity
expansion for PMT; and more about that later as we talk about 2014.
So now let's go through the highlights for the fourth quarter and the full year for each of the segments, starting at slide
even with Aerospace. Sales growth turned positive, as you can see for Aero in the quarter, up 3% organic, at the
high-end of our guidance range.
I'd like to take a minute just before we get into each of the components of Aero, just to walk you through some
one-time items that netted within the quarter within the Aero segment. Aero recognized a significant IP litigation
settlement which resulted in a royalty gain in the fourth quarter of $63 million pre-tax. We had line of sight to the
timing of this in the quarter and we proactively ensured timing was aligned with roughly $68 million of BGA OE
payments. Both of these items impacted sales and segment profit. They were contemplated when we gave our outlook
for Aerospace in December, so they net and literally had no to de minimis impact in terms of the reported numbers, in
terms of the segment profit and segment margin numbers for Aero in the quarter.
With that background, turning to the commercial businesses, commercial OE sales were flat in the quarter, however, up
12% if you exclude the impact of the OE payments that I mentioned earlier. We saw the continued benefit of higher OE
build rates in large air transport and strong sales to high value business jet platforms. That would include Gulfstream
and Dassault which had – both had good double digit numbers.

Commercial aftermarket sales were up 5% in the quarter supported by favorable flight hour trends both in ATR and
also robust repairs, modifications and upgrades or new sales in BGA, partially offset by fewer engine maintenance
events in a quarter. Notable in the quarter was the improvement in ATR spares which we expect to continue in terms of
a run rate in 2014.
Now in Defense and Space, sales were up 2% but down 3% excluding the royalty gain in the quarter that I mentioned
earlier. Defense continues to be impacted by planned program ramp downs and delays in U.S. partially offset by
growth in the international markets. However, on the positive side as Dave referenced, the backlog for Defense was up
significantly in 2013. So a positive sign as we look forward to the next five years.
And turning to segment profit, note that the higher royalties in Defense and Space were offset by – again, by the BGA
OE payments. Aerospace margins expanded 60 basis points to 20.5%, truly really good performance primarily due to
productivity net of inflation, and partially offset by investments for growth. Now Tim's going to talk more about this in
March at the Investor Day but the investments we're making in quality pursuits are resulting in big platform wins and
growth for the future.
Let's turn now to ACS on slide eight, Automation and Control. ACS sales were up 10% in the quarter, up 4% organic.
They finished the year very strong with continued acceleration in the products businesses, combined with strong orders
in the solutions businesses. Let's just go through a little bit of a color for the major components of ACS.
For ESS, for Energy, Safety, and Security, the sales were up 18% reported, 5% organic. Good growth in Security, Life
Safety and ECC as a result of the U.S. residential and retail chain strength I mentioned earlier and that's been a theme
obviously, new product introductions, and also continued good geographic expansion at ACS.
Process Solutions sales were up 1% in the quarter, organic, with continued good services growth more than offsetting
large project completions. However, organic orders in the quarter grew double digits driving further backlog expansion
at HPS and a robust project pipeline ahead. And as we saw throughout 2013, HPS had strong sales conversion as a
result of higher margin backlog and the benefits of prior period repositioning actions.
And finally for the Building Solutions and Distribution business, BSD, sales were up 4% organic driven by higher sales
in our Americas security distribution business, and like Process Solutions, BSD order rates grew double digits in the
quarter, primarily driven by a large energy win.
Moving to the margins, ACS was down. As expected 20 basis points to 15.3 basis points in the quarter. Again,
consistent with our planning assumption, primarily driven by the diluted impact of the Intermec acquisition and also the
investments that ACS is making for growth, partially offset by productivity net of inflation as well as ongoing
repositioning benefits.
So now let's go to slide number nine, look at Performance Materials and Technologies, PMT. You can see sales for
PMT were $1.7 billion in the quarter, up 12% reported, up 9% organic. And above the high end of our range, our
guidance range, driven primarily by strong results both in UOP as well as in Fluorine Products. This is also reflected in
terrific segment profit growth of 30% in the quarter for PMT.
Just a couple details, starting with UOP; sales were up 24%, up 17% organic, driven by the addition of Thomas Russell
and increased catalyst and gas processing sales, again reflecting continued strong refining, petrochemical and gas end
markets. The Advanced Materials sales were up 4% versus the prior year, reflecting improved production volumes in
resins and chemicals, as well as fluorine products, resuming production in Metropolis.
Margins for PMT were up 210 basis points, primarily due to the strong volumes but also productivity, again partially
offset by continued investments for growth. Obviously, another good year for PMT. Strength in UOP more than
offsetting the challenging year that we had in Advanced Materials and of course, again a reminder, we're investing in
new capacity in UOP and also transitioning our existing footprint to support new technologies in Advanced Materials.
And then just a couple highlights on Transportation Systems on Slide 10. A strong finish for TS. Sales growth
accelerated up 15% organically in the fourth quarter, driven by new launches and also higher global turbo gas
penetration. Over the course of the year, we've seen Europe stabilize with modest improvement as we exited the year

with high EU light vehicle production, up about 3% in the fourth quarter versus a very challenging fourth quarter of
2012, you'll recall, when sales were down 8% organically. We also benefited from an uptick in China commercial
vehicle demand, driven partially by Euro3 pre-buy activity in anticipation of the new emission standards in 2014.
Segment margins for TS expanded 250 basis points to 13.6%, primarily due to the strong material productivity and also
volume leverage in Turbo.
So now let's turn to slide 11, give you a little bit – just an update and again a preview of 2014. We continue to expect
sales in the $40.3 billion to $40.7 billion range for the full year, up 3% to 4% reported and approximately 3% organic.
Again, this range is still predicated on a euro rate of roughly $1.30 at the midpoint with the high end of the range closer
to $1.35.
We also continue to expect segment margin expansion 30 basis points to 60 basis points up, or 50 basis points to 80
basis points excluding M&A. Now embedded in that guidance includes roughly $25 million of additional repositioning
benefits spread across the portfolio in 2014 from the actions that we took in the fourth quarter of 2013; those that we
just reviewed with you.
We're increasingly confident, as Dave said, in our EPS framework of $5.35 to $5.55, representing 8% to 12% growth
over 2013. The full year growth linearity remains in line with our prior year results and the range also continues to be
based on a full year tax rate of 26.5%. Now, we're expecting $3.8 billion to $4 billion of free cash flow, up low to mid
single-digits, reflecting approximately $300 million of increased capital spending in 2014 compared to 2013.
Now before we turn to the first quarter on the next slide, I just want to take a couple minutes and talk about some of the
bullet points on the bottom of this slide; talk about some of the key planning assumptions for the year. As you can see,
we're expecting roughly flat margins to start the year driven by two things: the acquisition dilution associated with the
Intermec acquisition, and also lower high net margin Parex petrochemical catalyst shipments in UOP in the first quarter
of 2014 versus the very record shipments, the tremendous record shipments that we had and we enjoyed in the first
quarter of 2013.
And as we discussed earlier, we'll have about a $0.10 gain reflecting in the B/E shares sold in the first quarter, which
will be deployed to restructuring and other actions. So no net income or EPS impact anticipated from those actions.
And as a result and as reminder, although we announced the divestiture of Friction Materials, it remains in our full year
sales and margin outlook for now and we'll update you accordingly upon the close of the transaction with no significant
impact to full year 2014 earnings guidance.
So with that background on the full year, let's talk about the first quarter, a little more details on the guide that I just
referenced. We're expecting – this is on slide 12 – we're expecting sales to be in the range of $9.6 billion to $9.8 billion,
up 3% to 5% reported or 2% to 4% on an organic basis. Segment margins are expected to be, ex-M&A, up in the range
of 20 basis points to 40 basis points.
Let's look now at just highlights of each of the businesses, starting with Aero for the first quarter. We're expecting sales
for Aero to be flat to slightly down with mid single-digit growth in Commercial, offset by mid single-digit decline in
Defense. On the commercial OE we expect lower regional sales to be a drag on ATR OE in Q1, as well as for the year,
offset by healthy demand for mid-to-large cabin business aircraft in BGA OE.
On the aftermarket we're expecting ATR spares growth to be ahead of flight hours in the first quarter and the continued
positive story in terms of BGA RMUs to benefit the quarter as well as the full year. As for margins, we expect a slight
decline year-over-year in the first quarter for Aero, primarily due to higher initial OE shipments due to a platform win
and higher mechanical OE sales in the quarter. Aero margins are expected to pick up pace over the remainder of the
year.
For the first quarter, ACS sales are expected to be up 6% to 8%, 2% to 4% organically with low single-digit organic
growth across each of the three businesses. Now, the macroenvironment is obviously looking moderately better as we
start 2014 for ACS, and we continue to see residential strength as well as modest improvement in the non-resi markets.

A strong orders growth we saw at the end of 2013 for ACS both in the short and the long cycle gives us obviously
increasing confidence. And due to the acquisition dilution, the ACS margin rate in the first quarter is expected to be
flattish with margins again improving over the course of the year driven by good growth as well as productivity.
PMT is expecting sales in the first quarter to be up 4% to 6%, building on a terrific first quarter 2013 as was obviously
the strong performance we had in 2011 and 2012 in PMT. We're expecting another quarter of sales growth in UOP but
as I referenced, the mix of shipments for UOP in the quarter will result in a headwind for the margin rate for PMT. And
on Advanced Materials, we're expecting flattish sales, primarily driven by unfavorable price [ph] raw (29:19) spreads
in R&C and lower R-22 pricing in fluorines, which is why our new Solstice product suite is so important as it ramps up
over the coming years. Now as you know, PMT is also continuing to run at full capacity levels at many of its plants and
will start to benefit from increased capacity in 2015, but particularly pickup in 2016 on that front.
In Transportation Systems, expecting more of the same, with sales in the first quarter of 5% to 7% driven by new
platform launches, continued Turbo gas and diesel penetration and also increased European light vehicle production
rates on a year-over-year basis. We expect TS margins to be up approximately 250 basis points, primarily from volume
leverage in Turbo, as well as productivity gains.
EPS for Honeywell first quarter, we expect to be in the range of $1.23 to $1.27, up 6% to 10% year-over-year when
you normalize for the effective tax rate using our full year expected rate of 26.5%, and again consistent with our normal
EPS linearity profile.
So now let's go to slide 13 and just summarize before turning it back over to Elena for Q&A. So obviously, 2013
behind us. We've demonstrated, once again, we can deliver on our commitments despite limited help from the macro
environment. It's a big reminder of the value of the diversified and balanced portfolio, the strength of the positioning in
that portfolio as well as the strength of the Honeywell playbook. We set, we met high expectations particularly as it
relates to margin expansion and earnings growth. All of the businesses as Dave said executed well with margins
expanding in every business in 2013. We achieved this while maintaining our focus and investment for the future,
doing the smart things that are going to deliver value for years to come.
And as we've said before, we're planning for more of the same in 2014. Modest top line growth, but strong margin
expansion. We feel more confident in our outlook based on the signs of stability and the pockets of improvement in
both the number of short and long cycle businesses. But nothing, as Dave said again, at this time suggests anything less
that conservative planning is prudent.
The playbook is working. Our operating initiatives are having many more innings in terms of the results that are
yielding, setting up discernible multi-year tailwinds. Seed planting and repositioning benefits, they've become a
hallmark of our execution story. We're investing in more profitable growth as well as asset efficiency. And as you can
see now, we have significant restructuring savings in the bank for 2015.
So in summary, we're excited about what the year 2014 entails. We're near the finish line of the last five-year plans set
back in 2010. We've got a lot of momentum across the portfolio leading up to our March 5 Investor Day. We'll be
updating you there on our framework for 2014, unveiling our new five-year targets out to 2018 and also providing
roadmaps by business on how each SPG President plans to drive for more profitable growth through more innovation
and execution.
So with that summary, Elena let's go to you for Q&A.
Elena Doom
Great. Zach, if you can open up the line, we'll take our first question.

The floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Scott Davis with
Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Scott.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Guys one of the numbers you gave, China up 13%, I think that's the best quarter you've had in
China and, gosh, I think it's been quite a while. I mean what – can you give some granularity, I mean, it's – I don't think
many of your competitors are going to see anything close to that. So what's working for you in China? And what's your
– what's the visibility? I mean is there a turn there in the businesses you're selling into? Or it's just more short-term?
<A - David M. Cote>: Actually, we feel pretty good for us in China, Scott. We did pretty well. If you take a look at a
total year and the fourth quarter and when we take a look at our short cycle order rates, they're also looking pretty
robust, and it's pretty much across the board across all the businesses. And I really think it has a lot to do with the focus
we have on becoming the Chinese competitor. Just makes a lot more local in everything we do, and I think as an
economy it's going to continue to grow and grow for a long time and we've just been working very hard at positioning
ourselves there to be successful.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: So I guess the natural follow-up to that is just that, is this more Honeywell specific, or do you
think – you see an actual turn in the overall industrial macro in China?
<A - David M. Cote>: I guess I'd break it into the two pieces. I'm not sure always how reliable all the statistics are
when you see industrial production and that kind of thing out of China. So whether it's really good or really bad on the
statistics, I don't know that I – I take some of that with a bit of a grain of salt. Overall though, I would say, we still see
it growing and within that, we're growing better. So I think it's a combination of the two.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. Fair enough. And then, you guys just talked a little bit about Turbo. It's always been a
great business and you've grown above market I think something in the neighborhood of, call it, 7% or something over
production vehicle numbers. But we hit an inflection point here where you can outgrow those historic levels just
because the CAFE Standards and such globally are all ticking up to such aggressive numbers pretty quickly. Is that –
can we start to think about Turbo as being a higher growth than 7% plus global SAAR or is this what you saw in the
quarter more of a short term temporary?
<A - David John Anderson>: I'm not sure what number I would put on the overall growth Scott, but I would say, as
we said in last year's investor presentation, there's explosive growth possible in our Turbo business for a number of
reasons.
One is exactly what you said about the increasing standards around the world. The second is that Turbo is one of the
easiest, least technologically difficult things for any OEM to do in order to achieve those standards. There's a lot of
more complex stuff they can do. But Turbos are pretty well known, pretty well understood. I think that penetration
rate's going to continue and we're uniquely advantaged within that space because we have a jet engine business. And
that jet engine business allows just stuff like material science, airflow handling to be shared with a turbocharger
because a Turbo is really just a small jet engine. So again, I think it's a combination of the two that, that market's going
to continue to grow very well but we will also grow very well within that market because of our capability.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Fair enough. Okay. I'll pass it on. Congrats on a good year, guys.
<A - David M. Cote>: Thanks.
<A - David John Anderson>: Thank you.

And we'll go next to Steven Winoker with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Thanks. Good morning, Dave, Dave, Elena. Nice
close to 2013.
<A - David M. Cote>: Thank you.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Let me start with just the growth investments that you referenced in most of the business
units. Can you give us any kind of – excluding the repositioning, just the operating expense impact maybe in total, or
some sense for sizing how big they were this quarter?
<A - David M. Cote>: I can't get it off the top of my head. It's a decent size number.
<A - David John Anderson>: Yeah. It's – if you look at it across the business, and here we're really talking about
Steve, obviously we talk about growth in investments. And so yes, you put that in – the investment part of that in quote
because it's really P&L, but it's really building for the future. So it's a combination of R&D new products, the whole
new product process and introduction process.
<A - David M. Cote>: And CapEx.
<A - David John Anderson>: CapEx, and the flow through of depreciation related to that CapEx. It's the expansion,
feet on the street in terms of high growth region as well as just as you know, just the overall continued investment we're
making in terms of sales and marketing capabilities, and engineering capabilities. It's about 50 basis points.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay.
<A - David John Anderson>: [indiscernible] (38:38) when you think about the total of that.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. That's helpful. And I suppose in March, we'll get a more detail not just anecdotes
around traction of – as you mentioned, you've been making these investments for years now on a relative performance
versus direct competitors and peers. I think that would be helpful because it's often something we hear about.
The second one is on the repositioning projects themselves. Maybe give us a little sense for where you're directing us? I
take it, it's no longer Friction Materials. So where is it going and what kinds of things are you doing? Is it Intermec? Is
it M&A oriented? Or we're – investors often wonder, is this the end of it for Honeywell from a repositioning
standpoint? Maybe give us a little flavor for what you're finding?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, first I'd say if you noticed, it's really spread across the businesses where we've done a lot
of this. And the nice thing I like about it is we still see lots of opportunity to be able to improve our operations. As you
know, our margin rates are still lower than our say high margin rate peers, and that's all upside for us as we continue to
make the company more efficient. So the restructuring is pretty much spread amongst the businesses.
<A - David John Anderson>: And I think Dave, just – I could just add to that and Steve, we talked about this. You're
aware of this. I mean, the whole ideation, if you will, the development of projects and the pipeline of projects is
something that we take very, very seriously and it's something it's not a stop start. This is a continual process in terms
of really looking for those opportunities to really set a new bar, if you will, in terms of the performance of the
businesses.
And the other thing is it's really consistent with that we've talked about, which is to continue the expansion and the
growth of the global footprint of the company, really realizing the opportunity that exists in terms of the GDP and the
GDP growth globally, so all of that functional transformation. It's amazing the things that we continue to do in terms of
really re-thinking our model for support; both the service levels, the quality levels and the cost levels in FT.
Just this past year, with working with Dave in the Functions, it's amazing the amount of things that you can consider to
be still sort of breakthrough. Those all represent the repositioning opportunities. We view this very, very positively.
We're obviously strategic in our thinking and then very good. We think in terms of execution have actually delivering
on those results. We take that very seriously as well in terms of the ongoing tracking and management of these projects.

So it's something you ought to count on from us.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Right. In light of the volume growth that we're starting to talk about, I assume your
capacity utilization levels are low enough at this point that there's not a lot of CapEx coming other than what we just
talked about for UOP and specific projects on that front?
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah. It's largely a PMT issue, to your point. Not much of an issue in the other businesses.
<Q - Steven Eric Winoker>: Okay. Great. And I'll pass it on. Thanks.
<A - David M. Cote>: Okay.
Operator
We'll go next to Steve Tusa with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Hey, good morning.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Steve.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Maybe you could program the Thermostat to say, great quarter so we don't have to say it every
conference call here.
<A - David M. Cote>: I don't mind.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Hey, on the fluorine side, you mentioned it's an incremental headwind in the first quarter. I
mean, it's not a huge part of your business. And I think pricing has kind of stabilized there. In fact, I think one of your
main competitors talked about raising price earlier this year. Maybe – can you talk about with the volatility in price
there, even though it's small, what kind of impact it's had on you in the last year, and what kind of impact you think
that's going to have maybe quantified in the first quarter?
And then, am I right in kind of viewing the second half as just a much easier kind of price comp on fluorines, or does it
get worse from here?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, I obviously don't want to comment on anything anybody else is saying about it. I would
say, though, that we did see degradation in the course of last year largely because of non-patent related products. And
this is a game where you got to be able to have really unique stuff, and that's the advantage we have. Once we're able to
start producing that and introducing it, then we'll be in that much better shape. I don't know that we've actually said
quarter-by-quarter how much this is going to – how much it affects us, but we did feel most of that effect last year. So I
don't expect to see a huge decrement again this year.
<A - David John Anderson>: It is a – just to add, Dave, to what you said. It is, and Steve as we've referenced, a
meaningful headwind for us in the first quarter and it's measurable in terms of that impact, so that is something that's
going to moderate in terms of the headwind in the first quarter. It happens to be paired timing-wise with also the
headwind that we've got out of UOP in terms of Parex shipments when we really had...
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: For the first quarter.
<A - David John Anderson>: For the first quarter, yes sir, where we really had just a blowout, you'll recall, first
quarter 2013. And by the way that first quarter 2013, as I referenced when I went through my remarks, was also on top
of a very strong first quarter 2011 and the first quarter 2012. So in 2014 we have a little bit of the, sort of the
confluence of events with both UOP, fluorines a little bit in resins and chemicals, and it is related to the phenomena,
Steve, that you mentioned and basically that moderates then over the course of 2014.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: So is it an R-22 or R-410A issue?
<A - David John Anderson>: It's largely R-22.

<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. So this is really the volatility. I mean, you had a spike in the price so that should
normalize. And is it about like, the saving about it is a third of the year-over-year comp, the down 150 basis points in
margin?
<A - David John Anderson>: In terms of the headwind that we're going to have from PMT in the first quarter due to
the phenomenon I just mentioned. And by the way, the other headwind we have as I talked about was ACS, which is
well known in terms of the acquisition, in terms of just margin rate. I'm just talking margin right now. You know, it's
about, say, about a third of the impact in terms of the PMT phenomenon.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. That's great. And one last question before the March meeting here. I mean, you guys are
kind of putting up the low double-digit, low-teens growth. I mean you're kind of managing pretty well to that number.
It seems like you guys are a little more optimistic on the economy, which would suggest that maybe at the end of the
day that 12% to 13% consistent EPS growth is not really going to be that much of a standout performance. I mean, at
what point do you kind of look up and in a better economy see peers growing, you know, maybe 15% plus and think
about maybe doing something a little more to get that growth rate up? Or do we still have kind of the mentality that,
look, order is going to click away and do – we think over a five-year period an above-average type of growth rate? I
mean is there any discussion as to kind of that high level approach to the business model?
<A - David M. Cote>: I'd say, Steve, there's always, obviously, a big difference between actual and forecast. And
when you're trying to forecast out for five years, it's one thing to just put a really bullish economic scenario behind it;
it's another to say, okay, we want to make sure that we can do whatever it is that say we can – that we're going to do. I
would rely though that if we take a look at how we've done on actuals, if we – historically, we've always done very well
when it came to actuals, especially versus our forecast. And if we say, okay, we've got a plan to grow a certain percent
over the next five years, and the economy is significantly better than what we expect, I certainly won't be holding
ourselves to that as a maximum. Rather, we're going to continue to be focused on how do we outperform our peers
every quarter, every year just like we have in the past.
So I wouldn't get too hung up on a forecast at how bullish is the macro forecast for the economy. I'm certainly hopeful
that it ends up better than what I tend to think it's going to be, but it is showing signs of some life now. I don't know
that we're going to see a really robust economy over the next five years, but you just don't know. No matter what
happens it'll be our intent to outperform on the actuals.
<Q - Stephen Tusa>: Okay. Thanks a lot.
<A - David M. Cote>: You're welcome.
Operator
And we'll go next to Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - David M. Cote>: Hey, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Hey, Dave. One way to get at that question is that it kind of looks like the cabbage patch is
really filling up. I mean, you know...
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, we've done a lot of seed planting. There's a lot of cabbage to be picked up. I agree with
you.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: So, I mean obviously you're not going to announce deals here today or anything, but how
active is the M&A pipeline and where's your head at on share repurchase? Obviously, you've got the $5 billion
authorization you put out there. It's not clear that you're going to really aggressively move against that though.

Page 12 of 17
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, I'd say harking back to the comment Dave just made on restructuring and how we keep a
pretty full pipeline, we do the same thing when it comes to M&A looking at what's available, what's possible, how do
we continue to do what we call our milk runs and just calling on companies. And you've heard me liken it to being in a
retail business, where you sit there and from 10:00 to 2:00 nobody shows up, and then at 2 o'clock for some reason
seven people come in at the same time and you wonder why it wasn't spread out during the day. Well, the same thing
happens with M&A deals. Sometimes they come in a bunch like they did nine, 10 months ago; and sometimes you go a
year-and-a-half without much happening.
So it's tough to predict. And if you're focused on making smart deals like we continue to do, then it's probably going to
keep coming in bunches, because I never say, okay, we've got to deploy $2 billion a year or anything like that. I want to
make sure that we continue to stay smart about this. That being said, there's still a lot of opportunity for us when it
comes to M&A. It's a big world out there and we look at the possibilities for great positions in good industries, building
off the portfolio we have. There's still a lot of good stuff out there. So we're going to continue looking.
When it comes to repurchases, yeah, I want that in our quiver as things that we look at doing. We're going to continue
to at least hold share count flat; it's my intent to do that. And I want to make sure that we're a little more opportunistic
when it comes to it. I'm always fearful of falling into that 80% that buys at the wrong time, and I'd like to make sure
that we fall into the 20% that looks like, wow, that was a really smart thing to do. And I think timing does make a
difference there and we'll continue to think about it that way. So I still see a lot of M&A potential, and I think we've
proven over the years that we're reasonably good at it.
<A - David John Anderson>: I think another thing to add, if you just look at 2013 and this is another I think kudos for
the company, look at 2013, we had $1.1 billion in terms of share buyback. We had roughly the same number in terms
of M&A. Dividend, we paid out $1.4 billion round, $1.375 billion roughly, $1.4 billion. I mean this is very strong
performance. And I think if you look at the track record of Honeywell of what we've been able to deliver not only
operationally, but in terms of smart, as Dave said, smart capital deployment, smart deals we've done.
You go back to 2005, the Novar transaction, the UOP transaction; go forward in terms of what we've done in terms of
building out a position in gas detection, our safety products business, the growth now in AIDC scanning and mobility.
These are all very, very smart adds that lend themselves to further, both organic and inorganic growth, the Thomas
Russell add to UOP.
And as Dave said, Jeff, the pipeline is rich. There's always the distance between the cup and the lip in M&A. It's very
tough to move from concept to actually close. But what we've done has been very successful. And the track record as
well of balance in our capital deployment; 50% of our cash over the last 10 years deployed to build the business either
through CapEx or M&A; 50% back to shareholders either in the form of dividend or share buyback. So we're just going
to continue to be smart about it. And we think that disciplined approach pays out over time together with the operating
discipline and the operating performance.
<A - David M. Cote>: And, Jeff, I like everything Dave just said with one exception, I might modify and correct his
pronunciation of the word smart.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Interesting. No, I mean I...
<A - David John Anderson>: You think I would learn after all these years, wouldn't you?
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Yeah. When you're smart in China...
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah. Thanks, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Yeah. So, Dave, I also just asked that question though in the context of the situation where it
looks like you maybe could be net cash by the end of this year, and you're going to lay out a new five-year target, right?
I doubt if you're modeling the recession, perhaps you are, but if you're going to grow earnings, 10%, 12%, 13% the
next five years, that's going to be a lot higher when you get in front of that.
<A - David M. Cote>: Really? Yes, Jeff, I'm well aware of the cash that we have on the balance sheet.

<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: And then just finally, Dave Anderson each extra year you'd lay out targets for more profitable
growth. So clearly you're going to project higher margins across each of the four segments. Are there any particular
areas that actually stand out as being more target rich from your margin standpoint?
<A - David John Anderson>: What do you think, Dave? I think really it's across the board, don't you?
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah. We see upside in every single one the businesses, Jeff.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: All right. [indiscernible] (54:03).
<A - David John Anderson>: The pattern of that, Jeff, will vary just like the pattern varies by quarter in 2014. They'll
vary by business, by year based upon their individual growth outlooks, and just, if you will, the makeup of the long
cycle, short cycle. All of those factors are going to influence it. But when you look at the overall five-year numbers, as
Dave said, we think they're very positive across all the businesses.
<A - David M. Cote>: By the way, Jeff, just a compliment for you. We were really amused by your phrase, a pretty
typical Street forecasting error. Well done.
<Q - Jeff T. Sprague>: Yes. It's 23% every year, right? Have a good day. We'll talk to you later. Thanks.

<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: Couple of things. One is, on Thomas Russell, looks like the numbers were sequentially
about the same. How is it doing? Can you kind of provide an update for us, please?
<A - David John Anderson>: On Thomas Russell?
<A - David M. Cote>: Doing well.
<A - David John Anderson>: Doing well.
<A - David M. Cote>: It's I'd say between their capability and ours, extremely complimentary in market, technology
and sales outreach and even manufacturing. So quite good.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: I mean year-over-year you're still like in high, what I'd call a 20%, 30% growth rate?
<A - David M. Cote>: I don't know that we disclosed that, did we?
<A - Elena Doom>: No. I think that, that's...
<A - David M. Cote>: Nice try, Howard.

<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: And then in terms of Aerospace new products, I think that there's been a number of them in
terms of synthetic vision and in terms of some other things in terms of integrating the cockpit. Might you talk about
them and sort of what you're finding as you test market them?
<A - David M. Cote>: I'm not sure what you're looking for specifically there, Howard. But, yes, we do have a pile of
new products coming out of the Aero business, some of which they've talked about, some of which they haven't. And
so far so good. Things are going well.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: I mean, one of course is all the connectivity things that you've got and maybe you can

business is. You've had pretty robust results from competitors and sort of chatter about some inventory restock, and you
guys are going to be rolling into – you actually had easier compares this quarter. You seem to have easier compares on
the segment. As the course of the year unfolds, what are your thoughts there towards the cadence of that business?
<A - David M. Cote>: I assume you're talking about Aero, John?
<Q - John G. Inch>: Yeah, I'm sorry. Commercial Aerospace aftermarket.
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah. We think that's something that starts to get a little bit better this year than it was last year
overall.
<A - Elena Doom>: I mean specifically, John, to put some perspective on it, we had something [ph] shifting (57:43)
numbers. If you look back at the fourth quarter of 2012, we did start to see the impact of aircraft dismantling and asset
pooling and that really pulled down in the developed economies our spare sales. U.S. – for example, U.S. spares in the
fourth quarter 2012 were down over 20%. Obviously, this is partially offset by what we talked about a year ago a bit of
a pull forward in buying behavior out of China.
So in the fourth quarter of 2012, our China spares were up over 40%. So now, as we fast-forward to 2013, in the fourth
quarter we did see a return of more normal buying behavior across almost all of the geographies, but in particular you
see the U.S. rebounding nicely, up over 20%, while China spare sales increased sequentially though they're still facing
that difficult comp and I think down about 10% within the quarter.
So moving forward to 2014, we do expect the ATR aftermarkets there to grow in the first quarter in excess of flight
hours, as a result of some easier comps and obviously more normal buying behavior.

<Q - John G. Inch>: And this obviously pertains to prospectively better margins in the segment as the year unfolds, if
I'm reading that right? Yes?
<A - David John Anderson>: I think that's right.
<A - Elena Doom>: That's right.
<A - David John Anderson>: And maybe a way to summarize all of that is to say that the guidance is the same, which
is we're looking at mid-single digit growth in the commercial aftermarket for Aerospace in 2014.
<A - Elena Doom>: For the year.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Can I ask about Transportation? I think European light vehicle in the first quarter was down, in
terms of production, down double-digits. Why is the number – I realize there's a little bit of a currency headwind, but
given the strength of Transportation in the fourth quarter, sort of the momentum that you seem to have, why is your
guide still kind of where it is? Why is it – like, why 3% to 5%? Why isn't it up a little bit higher for 2014?
<A - David M. Cote>: You're talking about TS in total?
<Q - John G. Inch>: Yes, correct.
<A - David M. Cote>: Yeah. I guess this is the moderating effect of Friction, plus there's I'd say conservatism on our
part when it comes to what's going to happen in Europe. And so, we think it's bottomed at this point and that's why
we're starting to see increases as the new launches more than offset the slight declines. But it's just more a case of just
wanting to not get too far out front on this one.
<A - David John Anderson>: Currency also has a big impact, Dave, in the assumption that we make. We're using – as
you'll recall, John, we're using 1.30 euro to dollar. So that has a little bit of a headwind effect too, and TS is a largely
non-U.S., today, business. So that does have an influence as well.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Well, is there any sort of rate to your assumption that perhaps maybe the rebound you're seeing in
light vehicle consumption in Europe is perhaps a little bit short-term duration or is there something else? I'm just trying
to – is this anything more than conservatism, I guess, is kind of what I'm going after?
<A - Elena Doom>: Well, John, I would point out that in the fourth quarter we did see very strong buying behavior in
China, and I think Dave referenced this in his opening comments. But there is some pre-buy ahead of some potential
regulation changes on emissions that certainly boded very well for the TS sales in China in the quarter. So we're not
anticipating that, that repeats.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Okay. Now that...
<A - David M. Cote>: Plus, John, I am also hopeful that it's conservatism on our part.
<Q - John G. Inch>: No, I get it. I'm just making sure there's nothing else in the mix that we haven't perhaps thought
of.
<A - David M. Cote>: There's nothing bad.
<A - David John Anderson>: No.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Just one more quick one then. It's a little bit of back to the M&A question. Dave Anderson had
set a $1 billion placeholder for this year, and it kind of makes sense as a placeholder. I just want to know, Dave Cote,
how are you thinking about perhaps the prospects given the strength of your balance sheet toward – if the opportunity
came along doing, say, a meteor deal in ACS or something that could sort of build up the success of Intermec and some
of these other deals you've done, or that you really sort of see 2014 at this juncture still kind of a – very much a bolt-on
year?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, again, John, I'd go back to what I said earlier, it's tough to know.

<Q - John G. Inch>: Yeah.
<A - David M. Cote>: We look at small stuff, we look at bigger stuff and you just never know when something is
going to all of a sudden become actionable. And I don't want to ever commit to certain amount every year because it's
not necessarily the way deals come in. But I could tell you we're very interested in M&A because I think we've proven
we're good at it. We're as focused on doing a good job with it today as we were 10 years ago because it's not an area
where we ever want to make a mistake. So who knows? I would just say that I have a predilection for doing M&A
because I think we're good at it. It's a way for us to really add value.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Right. No, I understand. But, Dave, do you personally – would you prefer to do a bigger deal if
the opportunity arose because of the success you've had, or do you think the smaller bolt-on framework is really still
the playbook we should think about?
<A - David M. Cote>: Well, I guess it depends on how we define bigger deal because I'm not favoring one or the
other. At the end of the day, I just want to do good deals, and I'd rather do 10, $200 million really good deals than to do
a $2 billion average deal. By the same token, if there is a $2 billion really good deal, I'm certainly not going to sit here
going, well, that's too big. I don't want to do that. So it's going to be on a case-by-case basis. The thing I can promise
you is, no matter how this ends up evolving or developing, I'll be able to make a strong case to you on why we can
make good money on this, focused on cost synergies, not counting on sales synergies, and it'll be a great position in a
good industry.
<Q - John G. Inch>: Thanks very much. See you in March.
<A - David M. Cote>: You're welcome.
Elena Doom
All right, Dave. Do have any final comments?
David M. Cote
But of course. We certainly like what we've accomplished and not just in this quarter, of course. While that does feel
good, what feels even better is what we can see coming as we continue to outperform. I've got to say, it's been very
fulfilling to complete our first five-year plan with panache even in a weaker than expected macro economy. That being
said, as I say a lot and my team has heard me say a lot, yesterday's press clippings wrap today's fish. We intend to
continue outperforming for a long time and the seed planting that we've done for several years now puts us in a great
position to make that happen. We continue to look forward, and we look forward to sharing our next five-year plan
with you at our March Investor Day. Thanks for listening.
Operator
Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. Please disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful
day.
