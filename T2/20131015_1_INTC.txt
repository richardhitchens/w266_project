Thanks, Mark. During the third quarter, our revenue grew 5% sequentially and was flat versus the third quarter of 2012.
Year-over-year, PC CPU volume declines slowed and were offset by solid growth in the data center and enterprise.
While consumer demand in emerging markets was sluggish, we started to see early signs of improvement in North
America and Western Europe. I see our performance in this environment as evidence of an increasingly broad and
diverse product portfolio. I'd like to highlight a few of the most important results from the quarter.
Following the launch of Ivy Bridge EP and the Atom-based Avoton SoCs, the Data Center Group delivered all-time
record revenues. DCG saw strength across its lines of business and geographies. Cloud revenue was up 40%
year-over-year, storage was up 20%, and high-performance computing was up 27%. Even traditional enterprise servers
were up a bit over the last year on the strength of our MP product line.
While the Data Center Group's results demonstrate some of Intel's Core capabilities, we saw strong performance
beyond DCG. Our Embedded business grew 21% year-over-year, reaching an all-time record for revenue, driven by
communications infrastructure, transportation, the Internet of Things and retail. Embedded revenue is well on its way to
a double-digit growth year.
Just a few weeks ago, we announced our newest product family, Quark, an ultra low-power and low-cost architecture.
And while any significant revenue impact is some time away, the architecture and the speed with which we're bringing
it to market are evidence of the changes we're making to ensure we're in a better position to lead and define technology
trends moving forward. And finally, our NAND business grew 20% over last year, as enterprise and data center
customers' increasing use of high-performance SSDs have put this segment on a path to double-digit growth for the
year.
We continue to make progress with the industry's first 14-nanometer manufacturing process and our second-generation
3D transistors. Broadwell, the first product on 14 nanometers, is up and running as we demonstrated at the Intel
Developer Forum last month. And while we're comfortable with where we're at with yields; from a timing standpoint,
we're about a quarter behind our projections. As a result, we're now planning to begin production in the first quarter of
next year.
In the Wireless business, I was pleased with our progress on LTE. Our multimode data modem is now available in the
Samsung GALAXY Tab 3. By the end of the year, we expect to have voice-over LTE versions available for customers.
And our second generation of voice-over LTE product with carrier aggregation will be available in the first half of next
year.
Over the past couple of months, we've also launched 15 new 22-nanometer Atom SoCs. These products are designed
for markets ranging from consumer tablets to cloud data centers. During the holiday selling season, you'll see Atom
SoCs in tablets as low as $99 and in 2 in 1 systems as low as $349. At the same time, you'll also find Haswell systems
with outstanding performance and 50% better battery life using Windows 8, Mac OS and Chrome as low as $299.
Together, Bay Trail and Haswell are making possible a range of innovative new form factors at breakthrough price
points.
The past few years have seen dramatic changes in the way consumers use and interact with technology, and those
trends aren't slowing down. And while preferences for form factor, OS' and price points have evolved, the market's
appetite for computing has continued to grow. We're going into the fourth quarter with the broadest portfolio in Intel's

history, positioned to fully participate in all of that growth.
With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.
Stacy J. Smith
Thanks, Brian. The third quarter revenue came in as expected, and gross margin was slightly better than the midpoint of
the forecasted range. Third quarter revenue came in at $13.5 billion, up 5% from the second quarter. At a segment
level, the PC Client Group grew 4% sequentially and the Data Center Group grew 6%.
The Data Center Group returned to double-digit year-on-year growth in the third quarter, growing 12% from a year
ago. As expected, inventory levels across the worldwide PC supply chain grew slightly, as customers built
Haswell-based PCs, but inventory levels are still being managed well below historical averages.
For the fourth quarter of 2013, we're forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $13.7 billion, up 2% from the
third quarter. Relative to the historical seasonal increase, the fourth quarter forecast reflects the orders we're seeing
from our customers and their desire to keep inventory levels lean.
Moving to gross margin, third quarter gross margin of 62% was up four points from the second quarter and up one
point from our guidance. The increase from the second quarter was as a result of lower platform unit costs, higher
platform revenue and lower write-offs. In addition, factory start-up cost came down in the third quarter as spending on
process engineers was re-classified from cost of sales to R&D. For the fourth quarter, we expect gross margin to
decrease by one point to 61%, as we increased factory spending on 14-nanometer.
For the third quarter, spending was down $100 million from expectations and flat from the second quarter at $4.7
billion. The $100 million decrease from expectations was as a result of a lot of small actions across the company to
reduce spending. For the fourth quarter, we're forecasting spending consistent with the third quarter at $4.7 billion.
In order to better align resources with our priorities, during the third quarter, we approved and communicated several
restructuring actions. Restructuring charges in the third quarter were just north of $100 million and we expect
restructuring in the fourth quarter to be roughly flat. Operating income for the third quarter was $3.5 billion, with
earnings per share of $0.58.
Taking a look at the balance sheet, total cash investments ended the quarter at $19.1 billion, up $1.8 billion from the
second quarter. In the third quarter, we generated approximately $6 billion in cash from operations, paid approximately
$1 billion in dividends, purchased almost $3 billion in capital assets and repurchased over $0.5 billion in stock.
Inventories were flat from the second quarter.
The fourth quarter revenue forecast of up 2% reflects the caution we're seeing from our customers due to weak
consumer end markets for the PC segment of our business. That said, we're seeing some important positive trends. The
enterprise market for PCs strengthened in the third quarter and the consumer markets in the U.S. and Europe appear to
have bottomed out. Our Data Center business returned to double-digit year-on-year growth based on the resumption of
growth in the Enterprise market segment and continued robust growth in cloud, high-performance computing and
storage.
From a product perspective, we have an unprecedented line-up of products coming to the market this holiday season.
Haswell delivers a historical increase in battery life across a diverse line-up of ultra mobile form factors like 2 in 1
convertibles, tablets and other touch-enabled devices. We're also starting to see our customers come to market with Bay
Trail based designs that will further extend our product line across screen sizes and price points in both tablets and PCs.
This extension of our product line-up across devices, price points and operating systems positions us to grow our
business across a broad range of compute devices.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.

All right. Thank you, Brian and Stacy. Moving on to Q&A. As is our normal practice, we would ask each participant to
ask one question and just one follow-up if you have one. Nova, would you like to go ahead and introduce our first
question, please?
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Joe Moore>: Great. Thank you. If you talk about the PC client market, if you look at the IDC data, they actually
showed sequential growth that was a little higher than yours. So I know you got tired of us asking all the time why you
guys were above them when they were negative. Just any reconciliation that you could give us on – it looked like they
showed sort of 8% sequential growth reconciliation of their numbers to yours?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah. Joe, I think when you get into the quarter-on-quarter movement, that's hard to tie out. But
when we look at their view of the year and our view of the year, it still is roughly in line. So it could come down to just
what's happening in the inventory pipeline. Sometimes differences come down to what's happening in China. But I
think we're pretty aligned with their view. Remember, our unit growth will be a little higher than what they show in
their headline PC number, because our unit growth will include things like tablets and 2 in 1s and things like that.
<Q - Joe Moore>: Great. And then the comment that inventories in the PC supply chain built slightly sequentially, but
are still below normal, can you characterize what's going on there? And where do you expect that to go over the course
of the rest of this year?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah. I think it's a continuation, Joe, of what we've seen really in the last four or five quarters
that the – our customers are managing the worldwide inventory of PC supplies to lean levels. I think it's a reflection of
just how dynamic the industry is, in some of the markets how volatile it is. So they're keeping inventory levels low.
That was true in Q2, it's true in Q3; and the expectation in Q4 is that people will continue to manage things lean. And
I'll say for our own inventory levels, we've taken $1 billion plus out of our aggregate inventory. It was relatively flat
quarter-on-quarter. And again, as I think about Q4, I think we'll keep our inventory levels flat to down from this.
<Q - Joe Moore>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Mark Henninger>: Thanks, Joe.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Your line is open.
<Q - Blayne Curtis>: Thanks for taking my question. If you can just provide some general color on when you look at
your outlook of plus two within desktops, notebooks and servers, do you expect all three segments to grow to this
number? Thanks.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure. This is Brian. We don't see those as varying greatly amongst them. So we see all of
those segments growing as we move into the fourth quarter. And as we said in our prepared statements, what we saw in
the third quarter and we believe will move into the fourth quarter as well is stabilization in what I'll call the mature
markets, U.S., Western Europe and with Asia; and especially China still remaining relatively volatile. And that's where
we see the growth as well is in mature and emerging – Western Europe and U.S. markets.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: And if I can give some color on the server portion, Brian was talking about the clients there. In
the server market, we saw nice unit growth in Q3. And I'd actually expect that unit growth on a year-over-year basis to

accelerate in Q4. So I think we'll have an acceleration of server, DCG revenue growth when we get into the fourth
quarter. And that will be significantly above the corporate average.
<Q - Blayne Curtis>: Thanks for that. And then it may be a little early on Bay Trail, but if you could just talk about
the customer adoption and then any early indications of sales of those products? And then as you look at this kind of
touch-enabled device, how those expectations of adoption of that progressed through the year and as you look in the
holiday season?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure. This is, again, Brian. So remember, Bay Trail has always been a second half and
really a late second half introduction product; and that was a pull it. So we pulled that in in order to bring it into 2013.
We've seen great adoption. We have over 50 design wins, with about half of those being 2 in 1 devices. We talked
about those devices hitting new price points. The other place that Bay Trail is going into is tablets. We think that by
Black Friday, you'll see eight to 10 SKUs on shelf. So that's less than we'd hoped for, but that still shows – the 50
design wins shows really strong adoption.
The second part of your question was around touch, which is a broader question. We continue to see touch adoption
growing month by month as the price points come down; and the price point pattern now is below $50. We've put touch
as a requirement for the fourth generation Core Ultrabooks. And you're seeing Bay Trail clamshells with touch-enabled
at $299, which is a new real price point for touch-enabled devices. So we see it continuing to grow as we enter next
year.
<Q - Blayne Curtis>: Okay. Thanks for that.
<A - Mark Henninger>: Thanks, Blayne.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Patrick Wang of Evercore. Your line is open.
<Q - Patrick Wang>: Great. Thanks a lot. Hey, you guys talked a lot about traction in your low-priced tablets,
Chromebooks, handsets. And you even talked about Avoton in low-power server. Your notebook ASP I think was also
down slightly year-over-year. Can you talk about and give us some perspective on the trajectory of your ASPs longer
term? And then, I mean is this something that really concerns you guys?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: ASP for us will really be a function of mix. I think we have a very strong competitive position
now when you think about the Server segment of our business, the Core segment of our product line. I think the pricing
within the bands in those markets is pretty stable. We haven't been increasing pricing even at a time period where our
ASP increases has just been a function of mix. And so, if I think out at the next couple of years, what I think will
happen is you'll see those higher end price bands were driving for some low level of growth, you'll see faster growth at
the low-end price bands, and then you'll see faster growth in the Server segment of our business. And how it plays out
to the average is going be a function of mix.
The thing you don't want to lose here though and we've talked about before is that we have very different cost
structures among the different segments of the business. So for us a Bay Trail effect that has a lower ASP isn't
necessarily a bad thing relative to a Celeron, because it also has a much better cost structure relative to the Celeron.
<Q - Patrick Wang>: No. I understand. Okay, thanks very much for that. And then also, I think you talked about a
delay of Broadwell production by a quarter. If you had ramped it this quarter, what would the impact have been to
gross margins? I guess in other words, what are some of the things we should think about when that production actually
ramps?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah. So no impact to Q3 gross margin, I think you can see that on the reconciliation; and no
impact to Q4 gross margin from what we're expecting. We would – as I've kind of telegraphed on the call last time,
14-nanometer spending was projected and will increase quarter-on-quarter. That will be about a half a point decrement
to gross margin, but that's the same decrement. It will probably hit us in different buckets, but it's the same impact on

gross margin.
<Q - Patrick Wang>: Okay. And nothing different in the first quarter?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah. Also, I'd give you the same answer as I think about 2014. Roughly speaking, the spending
on 14-nanometer is going to be the same, which means that the gross margin impact over the course of 2014 will be the
same as it was. Again, it may hit in different buckets, but it will be the same gross margin impact.
<A - Mark Henninger>: Thanks, Patrick.
<Q - Patrick Wang>: Thanks so much.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Doug Freedman of RBC Capital.
<Q - Doug Freedman>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. And Stacy, if I could just build on that a little bit
going through, can you give us an idea of what type of start-up charges we're going to weather next year?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah. That's probably a better conversation for the investor meeting that's in a month. I'll start
to give some of the puts and takes in 2014 gross margin and how we're viewing the business. But it is related back to
the question that was just asked on the 14-nanometer push. And so, let me walk you through a little bit about the
categorization in Q4 which may give you some insight into how this could play out.
As I said, and as Brian said, we're moving production on 14-nanometer out about a quarter. We're seeing an increase in
14-nanometer spending in Q4 as we would have expected. What we thought a quarter ago and what I telegraphed on
the call is that as that spending increases and we start production, we move cost from start-up to production cost, but
then we reserve it out. And if you remember, last quarter on the call I said expect some headwinds in Q4 to gross
margin because we have an increase in reserves.
Well, as we push the production date, what you'll see is the same impact on gross margin, but in Q4 it's likely to be a
little bit of an increase in start-up costs, and then you won't see the reserve impact that we had expected a quarter ago.
So slightly different buckets. I'd still expect next year you'll see a reduction in start-up cost. It may be a little less than
what we've seen in other even numbered years. But then you'll see an offset on the other side of that of reserves, and so
the same gross margin impact over the course of the year.
<Q - Doug Freedman>: Great. And for my follow-up, Brian, could you give us an idea of your first couple of quarters
here? And we've noticed clearly with Quark and your moves to try to make the company move a little quicker, we're
now having some restructuring charges. Where are those restructuring charges targeted at? And what might be some of
the trigger points that you have to make you move the ship in a different direction? Is the slowdown in PCs or
notebooks, is there a trigger point that makes you change the way in which you attack some of these businesses?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure. So first I would separate a bit the restructuring charges from our desire to move
quicker into broader markets. Restructuring charges were mostly around the shutdown of the Hudson, Massachusetts
factory, and that was really talking about a factory that was our last 200-millimeter factory on 130 nanometers, and that
factory had just finished its life as a factory and it couldn't be upgraded to 14-nanometers or beyond. So that's what
most of that was. And in general, restructuring charges aren't necessarily driven by how you move an organization like
this into innovative new areas.
For me, the way I look at this is, this is really about pushing our architecture in both directions. It's moving down and
moving Atom to be more integrated, more capable with higher graphics and higher connectivity and then moving up on
the data center side with more robust products there, more integration up there, and more unique products by customer
and by workload to target those areas that can utilize our Core technologies. And the trigger points for me as we move
through these is really around how fast is the organization able to adopt.

So we have a process coming where we want to be able to adjust products, because we believe these markets are going
to be changing up until the last minute before you ship something. So three or four months before a product's going to
ship, we want to get to a point where we could make changes in the characteristics of those products. And we're ways
away from that, maybe a year, year-and-a-half, but we believe we can get to a place where we have that kind of
flexibility and IP configuration that we can do that.
<A - Mark Henninger>: Thanks, Doug.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: I think I'm going to give – I'll give Brian a little more credit here than he was giving himself.
He's right that in the restructuring piece the asset impairment it is almost entirely driven by that factory. The larger
portion of that is the people movement piece of it. And I think Brian and Rene are both moving fast in terms of picking
areas where they want to make investments, picking areas where we're going to invest less. And so that that's the lion's
share of that particular line item, and almost all of the Q4 number is just as we're looking to move people from one part
of the company to make investments in area where we think we're going to get an enhanced return.
<Q - Doug Freedman>: Great. Thanks for all the detail.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is open, sir.
<Q - John W. Pitzer>: Good afternoon. Brian, just a follow-up on the Broadwell. I'm just kind of curious why the
push-out? Can you elaborate a little bit? Is this a technical issue? And if it is, why are you confident you overcame it or
is this really a market issue, i.e., there's a little bit excess Ivy Bridge inventory, which is pushing out Haswell, which is
the ramp which is pushing out Broadwell? If you could elaborate, that'd be great.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure. It's absolutely not the latter. It was simply a defect density issue. As we develop these
technologies, what you do is you're continually improving the defect densities, and those result then in the yield, the
number of die per wafer that you get out of the product. And what happens is you insert a set of fixes in groups. You'll
put four or five, maybe sometimes six or seven fixes into a process and group it together and run it through, and you'll
expect an improvement rate. Occasionally, as you go through that, the fixes don't deliver all of the improvement you
thought. We had one of those.
Why do I have confidence? Because we've gone back now and added additional fixes, gotten back on to that curve. So
we have our confidence that the problem is fixed because we have actually data that it is fixed. And so that gives us the
confidence that we're going to keep moving forward now. And that happens sometimes in these development phases
like this. So that's why we're going to move it a quarter. Remember, Broadwell and Haswell are pin compatible, so for
the most part these will slide into existing systems. And it delivers the next generation of the low-power Broadwell-Y,
which is going to give even more capability for fanless Core products. So we and our OEM partners have a strong
desire to get Broadwell to the market. So if I could, there would be nothing slowing me down. This is a small blip in
the schedule, and we'll continue on from here.
<Q - John W. Pitzer>: Perfect. That's helpful, Brian. And as my follow-up, Stacy, the last couple of quarters relative
to the gross margin bridge or puts or takes, you've kind of given ASP as a potential allowance on the downside, and I
guess I didn't see that in Q4, which kind of confuses me a little bit given that that's the Bay Trail quarter ramp. And so,
I'm kind of curious, are you just getting more confidence as you're mixing lower that that ASP is not a factor in gross
margin or how should I think about that?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Well, I think it goes back to the question I answered earlier. So yeah, I mean, as we're
successful with Bay Trail, it will cause the average ASP to come down in the Client Group. But keep in mind, we're
forecasting a very robust growth rate in the data center. And so, you have kind of the highest end of the Intel product
family growing significantly faster than the rest.
<Q - John W. Pitzer>: Perfect. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Romit Shah of Nomura. Your line is open.
<Q - Romit J. Shah>: Great. Thank you. On DCG, you guys have been talking about a double-digit annual growth
target for the year. And just based on my math, you would need to grow data center 20%-plus in the fourth quarter to
get there. So could you talk a little bit about near-term momentum? And then as a follow-up, I just wanted to ask about
the Federal shutdown. It seems like it's dragging on. I'm wondering if you're seeing any impact to your broader
Enterprise business?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah. This is Stacy. I'll take those, and Brian can editorialize on our elected representatives. On
the data center, yeah, we're – don't pin me down to exactly 10% growth, but we're going to be within spitting distance
of that for the year. That does imply a growth rate that's significantly accelerated from the 12% that we had in Q3, and
that's what I expect, and that's what Brian expects from the GM of that business. Generally what we're seeing, Brian
talked about the really robust growth rates we're seeing in the cloud, high-performance computing, storage, and we've
seen a resumption of some growth rate in the enterprise, which has been the headwind that we've been facing in that
business.
To your question on the debt ceiling debate, I'd say we have not seen any impact on our business. I think generally the
financial markets have been pretty tame in their reaction to this, but it's in my opinion needs to be fixed. We don't want
to cause people to doubt that the U.S. is going to make good on its debt obligations.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: I'm not going to comment any further on that one.
<Q - Romit J. Shah>: All right. Thanks.

Our next question comes from the line of Glen Yeung of Citi. Your line is open.
<Q - Glen S. P. Yeung>: Thank you. Brian, I probably heard this wrong, but just wanted to clarify. You made a
reference earlier to Mac OS, were you suggesting that you would see Bay Trail devices using Mac OS?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: No. I said that we would have products across the board. It's Haswell.
<Q - Glen S. P. Yeung>: Okay. Very good. Just wanted to clarify that.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: That was a group – I think that comment was around Bay Trail and Haswell in all OS
forms.
<Q - Glen S. P. Yeung>: Good. Okay, glad we clarified that then. As a follow-up, I did want a little bit more color, if
you would, on what you're seeing in enterprise. It's consistent with what I've been seeing in the quarter as well, but
what I don't understand and hopefully you may have more color on this, is the fact that it's enterprise suggestive of that
it may be a more sustainable trend than we would otherwise see? And do you see any underlying reasons for why
enterprise may be getting better?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Well, so you're talking about the classic enterprise. I think this is a case where at least up
until the recent times, especially in the U.S., as companies became more comfortable with what the spending horizon
was going to be and what their projections for the rest of the year were, they started to unleash IT budgets. And so, we
started to see an uptick in that. Especially Western Europe and the U.S. started to grow again slightly. Do we think it

Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland of FBR. Your line is open.
<Q - Christopher Adam Jackson Rolland>: Hi, thanks for the question. I thought maybe you guys could give us a
little more granularity into what's going on with the other IA operating loss. Do we sort of think that this is about as
large as it gets as Bay Trail ramps or how do we think about that on an ongoing basis? Is this a good run rate or how do
you guys sort of forecast that going forward?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: I think I can unequivocally say for Brian and I, it is not a good run rate. We don't enter
businesses to lose money. So our intent is to improve it. I think it's probably worthwhile to talk about what's happening
when you do year-over-year or quarter-on-quarter, probably year-over-year is the more illustrative portion of that. But
what you see going on in other IA is, first and foremost, the embedded or the Intelligent Systems Group had a very
good quarter, record revenues, robust growth rate, very profitable. Offsetting that is really three things that impact the
operating profit.
So first, netbooks are coming to the end of their life as a category. We're down to some single-digit millions of revenue
from netbooks, a year ago that was pretty robust and those were pretty profitable products. A year ago, if you recall, we
were talking about a buying pattern from one particular customer in the modem space that didn't repeat this year. So
you get a little bit of a year-on-year comp.
And then the other impact is this is a place where we've been making significant investments. The things that we've
been talking about here of having products, SoCs that span across price points, across operating systems, those are
places where we're making investment. We believe that investment is really important to the future of the company,
and we believe that investment gives us a differentiated competitive advantage out in time and lets us bring the best
products to the market out in time.
<Q - Christopher Adam Jackson Rolland>: Okay, great. Thank you for that. Also, on the Broadwell quarter
push-out, do we make up for that at some point in the future or would this also push Skylake?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Yeah. We do not think it will push Skylake. So this is just – and in fact, we'll even make up
in total volume within a quarter or two after the one quarter push. So we tend to make these up very, very quickly; and
the two are independent. The early learning that's going on during the process development has no impact on Skylake's
ability to come to market.
<Q - Christopher Adam Jackson Rolland>: Okay. Thanks so much, guys.

Our next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy of Stifel, Nicolaus & Company. Your line is open.
<Q - Kevin E. Cassidy>: Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted a few more details on the data
center, some of the moving parts. So Stacy, you said that you expected unit growth to accelerate in the fourth quarter.
Would that be because of the Avoton or do you expect ASPs to go up also? Is it the mix shift going to higher
performance servers?

<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Boy, you give an inch. I think I'm not going to get more granular than I got. I would expect that
unit growth accelerates from what we saw in Q3 and revenue growth accelerates from the 12% year-over-year growth
we saw in Q3. I'm not going to get more granular than that.
<Q - Kevin E. Cassidy>: Okay. Maybe if you could just tell us about the third quarter with ASPs up 2%, was that
mostly driven by the introduction of E5 or is it an overall shift towards higher performance computing?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah. I'd say it was probably more tied to the fact that the Enterprise segment went from decline
to some single-digit growth; and that is tied to the E5. It's a combination of those two things. But the enterprise tends to
buy a pretty rich mix of MP. That's why it's such an important segment for us, and so single-digit growth there is pretty
helpful.
<Q - Kevin E. Cassidy>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO. Your line is open.
<Q - Ambrish Srivastava>: Thank you very much. My first question is on the guidance, Brian, and you told us that
the guidance is based on what you're seeing, the order patterns that you're seeing. But just wanted a little bit more color
as to in terms of form factors from your OEM customers as well as from you, there seems to be more out there. So in
your opinion, what is it? Is it not the right form factor for OEMs which is causing – and we understand the macro is
pretty anemic, but in the context of new products that are coming out, it has to be disappointing for you to see the order
pattern. So what in your opinion is causing that? And I had a quick follow-up after that, please.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: So I'm not sure I completely understand your question. If your question is around the
number and variety of form factors, we're actually pretty excited about the rate of innovation we're seeing in 2 in 1s, in
convertibles, in OS forms, Android, Chromebooks and WIN 8, 8.1. So we've been pretty enthusiastic about what we're
seeing. And in fact, we've been meeting with most of our customers and OEMs and looking at their Q1 line-up with
them. And I've been astonished by the amount of innovation and creative designs that are coming.
I think when you talk about just the market in general how we see it, we're trying to bring innovation to the PC, but
we're also trying to move into these markets that are growing already like tablets and phones. And so, our view is that
at the end of the day, the customer is going to choose their form factors. And tablets are absolutely here to stay, and we
plan to participate in those. And that's why you see us in tablets from $99 to $350. And our job is to try and innovate
and actually drive our capabilities into the tablet space that nobody else could deliver, and bring that valuation and
drive up in those markets.
Across PCs, we believe that as 2 in 1s, especially Haswell-based 2 in 1s with all-day battery come to life, we're already
seeing some signs of tablet market share win back as these 2 in 1 devices, especially in enterprise and the business side,
hit the market and people see the value of having both devices, the best of both devices, a tablet and a PC, all in one.
And so, we believe that as we go through the fourth quarter and we get more of these devices out there, we'll see how
this plays out over time now.
<Q - Ambrish Srivastava>: Okay. That's helpful. And then on the pricing front, Stacy, you highlighted, yes, pricing
could be lower on the mix, but then cost is lower for Bay Trail. But I'm just looking at the dichotomy in desktop and
notebook, and maybe there's a very simple explanation. Desktop volume is down year-over-year, ASP is up, notebook
is the reverse on the ASP front. ASP is down year-over-year, but volume is down as well. So could you just help me
understand why the difference in the two trends? Thank you.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Well, I think what you're seeing is you're seeing notebook pricing coming down over time as
that becomes a broader and broader market. So I think it's as simple as that. I think the desktop piece is really
interesting. What we've seen in the desktop – again, I'm kind of zooming out and taking a two-year view. You've seen a

segment that's been relatively slow growth. Think of it as kind of single-digit percent growth, but a lot of segmentation
happening within the category. And so, it's gone from the desktop business being primarily these beige boxes to
all-in-ones and detachable all-in-ones and pretty high-performance devices that are doing gaming as, well as these very
cost-effective machines for first-time buyers in emerging markets.
So you've seen this kind of hyper segmentation of the category, and more stability in the pricing as a result because you
have these different segments. I think we're on the verge of seeing that kind of segmentation play out now in the
Notebook segment with what we're seeing with 2 in 1s and Ultrabooks and detachables and convertibles. So it'll be
interesting to watch that play out.

Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.
<Q - Timothy Arcuri>: Thank you. The first question is on CapEx. Stacy, is the cut due mostly to 450? You had said
before that there was no push-out in the timing, but some of the companies selling equipment are saying that there has
been some push-out. So I'm just wondering where that cut is coming from? Thanks.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: You're talking of the $200 million? No, there is actually no cut in there. We're just kind of
refining our forecast as we get down to one quarter left in the year.
<Q - Timothy Arcuri>: Got it. Great. And so, just to be specific on the timing on 450, nothing has changed there?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: So let me answer that one. We've not changed our timing. We're still targeting the second –
later half of this decade. We continue to see great value in 450. It brings tremendous economic value to everybody who
participates in it. We continue to work with our partners. We're part of the joint development program in New York
continuing to work on 450. We continue to work with our partners, especially TSMC and Samsung. And we're still
targeting the back half this decade. This is a long 10-year program when you really take a look at it. And so, I think
you'll get mixed signals throughout that 10 years. Take a look at the long-term trend and then really start to understand
the economic value here, and you'll see it will get there in the end.
<A - Mark Henninger>: Thanks, Tim.
<Q - Timothy Arcuri>: Okay. Thanks so much.

Our next question comes from the line of David Wong of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
<Q - David M. Wong>: Thanks very much. So Bay Trail, if I'm not mistaken, there's some Android tablets using
Clover Trail+ that are currently available. When might we expect Android tablets using Bay Trail in the market?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure. You're absolutely right. There are several tablets out there currently today with
Clover Trail+ using Android. What I told you was there are about 50 designs on Bay Trail, about 20 of those are on 2
in 1s, probably 25, 20 of them are Bay Trail tablets on Android. There's going to be about eight systems on shelf, eight
to 10 systems on shelf, we believe, by the, say, Black Friday timeframe. Most of those will be Android tablets.

<Q - David M. Wong>: Okay, great. And could you fill us in on what proportion of your Core family sales will be
Haswell in the December quarter? And are you seeing Haswell-Y being extensively adopted in tablets or is it primarily
the regular Haswell that goes into tablets and 2 in 1s?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah. We don't get to that level of granularity to break out our sales by product family. I think
Brian gave you some good insight into the number of systems that we see coming to the market, a lot of which will be
there before Black Friday and then even more of it kind of build out over the course of Q1. I'll let Brian answer the Bay
Trail-Y.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: You asked Haswell-Y versus...
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Haswell, sorry.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Haswell standard. First, most of the tablets we're building with OEM partners are Bay Trail
or, as you said, Clover Trail+ based. There are some that are being based on Core. Most of those are being based on the
standard Core product.
<Q - David M. Wong>: Okay, great.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: The Haswell-Ys are going into the fanless systems or extremely low-power 2 in 1s.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah.
<A - Mark Henninger>: Thanks, David.
<Q - David M. Wong>: Okay. Thanks.
<A - Mark Henninger>: All right. Operator, we'd like to go ahead and take two more questions, please.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Covello of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - James V. Covello>: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question. Stacy, something you had alluded to in your
presentation at the Developer Forum, I wonder where you think die sizes are headed on average for the company given
some of the moves into these different markets that you talked about?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Again, it's going to be similar to the ASP question. When you're talking average die size, it's
really going to be a function of mix. So it becomes hard to answer. I think when you look at it by segment, we're
improving our cost structure in each of the segments of the business. So die size is going to get better in the Core
family, it's going to get better in Bay Trail, it's going to get better in the Tablet segment of the business. But the mix
will really dictate the average. I don't know, Brian, if you want to add anything to that.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Yeah. I would agree with Stacy. Each one of the families of products we have roadmaps
with, even with integration, but because of Moore's law we're able to continually drive down the die size. It's going to
be mix dependent. We think, and if you look at the average mix, it will be down slightly, but it's a not a dramatic drop
at least. But again, it will be mix driven.
<Q - James V. Covello>: Okay. That's helpful. And then if I could ask for my follow-up, in terms of the mobile
market, the handset market in particular, how important do you think connectivity in the other surrounding pieces
around the processor are for Intel to be successful in this market? And how do you feel you're positioned in those
complementary pieces around the processor?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure. The connectivity and COMs, both are very important. We've had Wi-Fi for 12-plus
years, so our position in Wi-Fi is good. We've made acquisitions in GPS and GNSS lately to add to our portfolio. And
we talked about in the prepared statements about our progress on LTE, and we actually believe we're making great
progress in LTE. We have LTE data now; LTE data and voice by the end of the year; LTE with carrier aggregation first

half of next year. That's very good progress in our minds on LTE.
I want to remind you though, but it's really – when you take a look at these SoC products, it's about all of the IP. So
you've got to get the graphics right, you've got to get the connectivity right and you've got to get the COMs right. And
we really have a drive to both get our individual IPs correctly there and then to integrate them into the silicon. And
that's kind of the order that you have to do it in. You have to go get the IP correct. That's why you see us – our LTE
products as stand-alone now, and then you integrate them in once you get the capability in a stand-alone product. And
we'll be working on that next year.
<Q - James V. Covello>: Thank you so much.
<A - Mark Henninger>: Operator, please go ahead and introduce our last question.
Operator
Our final question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from BoA Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.
<Q - Vivek Arya>: Thanks for taking my question. Brian, my first question is within DCG, can you help us quantify
traditional enterprise versus some of the growth categories in the cloud, storage and networking? And where I'm going
with that is when does this latter growth part start dominating and what are the implications on ASP when that
happens?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: I've never done a calculation on when they would overtake enterprise. I mean, if you take a
look at it, we said that cloud, storage, networking, we're growing 20%-plus. I'd have to go back and take a look. We can
have that discussion maybe at the investor meeting on how those percentages of the business change over time.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Vivek, if you go back and look at last year's investor meeting, you'll see something presented by
Diane that actually very explicitly breaks out the size of the different segments and the growth rate. And what you'll see
there is enterprise is 40%, 50% of the overall Enterprise segment. These other segments in aggregate are overtaking it
kind of as we speak and growing really fast. And we'll talk a lot more about that in a month.
<Q - Vivek Arya>: Got it. And then as my follow-up, I wanted to just get a sense for how much of a leapfrog
advantage will 14-nanometer provide in the mobile market? Because recently we saw very impressive benchmarks
from Apple on their A7 SoC. I understand that they optimized a lot of things within their system that other customers
may not be able to do, but they were able to show very impressive benchmarks on 28-nanometer silicon. And I'm
wondering, as you think about your 14-nanometer products and the fact that you really need to leapfrog to get major
share in mobile, how should we think about how big those advantages will be, like what the discussion with the
customers have been so far?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure. So let's make sure we – I mean, you just kind of used the generic word of
benchmarks, and there's a lot of different ones that are out there. And so, I'm not sure exactly which ones you're talking
about. But if you just take a look at our products and all of our products are 64-bit, so we've had that for an extended
period of time; and the products that we're shipping today are already 64-bit. And if you take a look at things like
transistor density and you compare, pardon the pun, apples-to-apples and you compare, say, an A7 to our Bay Trail,
which is the high-density 22-nanometer technology, then our transistor density is higher or more dense than the A7 is.
So it's a good product.
I'm not in any way trying to deface that, but we do see the Moore's law advantage from 28-nanometer to 22-nanometer,
as an example, when you compare dense technologies to dense technologies. We believe – I mean, 14-nanometer is just
an another extension of Moore's law. So it'll have that same roughly twice density that you'll see between 28-nanometer
and 22-nanometer. You'll see that same kind of increase or improvement as you move to 14-nanometer. It is a true
14-nanometer technology. Did I answer your question?
<Q - Vivek Arya>: Yes. So, Brian, maybe what I was trying to get to was, as you look at the kind of Android
customers or Chrome customers that you might engage with the 14-nanometer, how is that changing from the

engagement that you have with Bay Trail? Basically the question is, is the level of engagements accelerating as they
look at your 14-nanometer progress?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: So, yes, from that perspective they see a roadmap now, I think more importantly than just
14 nanometers. What they see is a roadmap from us around the Atom SoC, and they see Bay Trail as a great first step.
It's a great product. You've seen some of the performance benchmarks out there. We just talked about the transistor
density. So Stacy's talked about our cost and our ability to hit these lower price points. It's got good graphics
performance. And as I said, we're able to provide a 64-bit solution across all OS options as well.
And so, they look at that and then they look at our roadmap and say, okay, they've got LTE, they've got connectivity,
they've got them as stand-alone, they have plans to integrate those technologies in, in a basic SoC and they're starting to
build confidence at our roadmap along with us. And that's I think what they really look at us as is – they say an Atom
roadmap that's highly competitive.
