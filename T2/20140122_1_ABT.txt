In today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand
Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable
GAAP financial measures in our earnings release and regulatory filings from today, which will be available on our
website at abbott.com. Our commentary on sales growth refers to operational sales growth, which excludes the impact
of foreign exchange unless otherwise noted.
I will now turn the call over to Miles.
Miles D. White
Okay. Thanks, Brian. Good morning. This morning I'll review our 2013 results as well as our outlook for 2014.
For the full-year 2013 we achieved ongoing earnings per share of $2.01, representing double-digit growth over 2012.
At the same time, we returned nearly $2.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases and
announced a substantial increase in our dividend beginning this year.
Strong performance across many of our businesses and operating margin expansion enabled us to deliver on our 2013
expectations despite a few challenges. Similar to other multinationals, we were impacted by a slowdown in several
emerging economies as well as by foreign currency. Abbott was also impacted by a supplier recall in International
Nutrition. As I've discussed on our previous earnings calls, we were able to offset these impacts in 2013, in part
through selective cost management. At the same time, we executed on our key priorities. We achieved high single-digit
sales growth in Diagnostics, Vision Care, and Nutrition, excluding the impact of the supplier recall, as well as
sequential improvements in our vascular business each quarter of last year.
We increased total company emerging market sales by 11%. This was driven by double-digit growth in our
Diagnostics, Medical Devices and Nutrition businesses. We completed two acquisitions in Medical Devices that
brought us important best-in-class technologies to expand our presence in our Endovascular and Vision Care
businesses. We launched numerous new products, including our MitraClip structural heart device in the U.S., multiple
innovations in our Cataract Lens business that are driving share gains and nearly 70 product launches in Nutrition. And
we expanded our margins significantly in Nutrition and Diagnostics.
As we move into 2014, we'll continue to appropriately invest in our businesses to execute on our strategic priorities to
drive long-term growth. Our ongoing earnings per share guidance of $2.16 to $2.26 calls for double-digit growth at the
midpoint. However, in the first half the year, we will see some carryover effects from foreign exchange and the
nutrition supplier recall where we're making good progress to recover our share.
The long-term fundamentals of our business are strong, and we remain committed to increasing returns to shareholders.
In addition to our dividend increase, we're projecting an increase in share repurchase activity. Overall, we expect to
return more than $3 billion of cash to shareholders in 2014, which Tom will discuss in a few minutes.
Moving on to our 2013 results and outlook for the businesses in 2014. In Nutrition, as expected, fourth-quarter sales
growth increased low single digits, affected by the supplier recall that was initiated in August. The additional marketing
investments we made in the third and fourth quarters are supporting our recovery, and we're on track with our
expectations to recapture our share in the affected geographies. As we look to 2014, we remain optimistic about our
growth prospects in Nutrition and we are well positioned to achieve our strategic priorities.
We will further expand global capacity with three new manufacturing facilities that will come online in the U.S., China
and India this year. Demand is strong for both Adult and Pediatric Nutrition. We'll continue to see productivity from
our R&D organization and expect to launch several important innovations in 2014 that will help us gain share, and in
Adult Nutrition, continue to shape and grow that market.
With the combined launch of new products, we expect to return to high single-digit operational sales growth in
Nutrition this year as we lap the impact from the supplier recall in the second half of 2014. This will continue to be
driven by double-digit growth in emerging markets, which we expect to comprise nearly half of Nutrition's total sales

by the end of this year.
And finally, margin improvement, which remains a key priority for this business. We expanded operating margin in our
Nutrition business by nearly 300 basis points in 2013, ending the year at 18.7% of sales. We expect meaningful margin
expansion again this year and the business is well on track to reach its 2015 operating margin target of more than 20%
of sales.
In Established Pharmaceuticals, full-year sales increased modestly. As we've discussed, macroeconomic and market
pressures in certain emerging markets impacted EPD more significantly than we had anticipated at the start of last year.
At the same time, new commercial leadership is working to improve how we execute our branded generic strategy in
both emerging markets and developed countries. As I've said, this will take time, and we'll be looking for improved
momentum in this business heading into next year.
Over the next several years, we expect continued improvement in EPD's growth as sales in emerging markets become a
larger component of this business. Growth rates in emerging markets have been and are expected to continue to be
higher than the growth rates of developed countries and the overall global economy and Established Pharmaceuticals
remains well aligned with the fundamentals driving long-term growth for healthcare in emerging markets.
In our Medical Device business, which includes our vascular, Diabetes Care and Vision Care businesses, sales
increased 4% in fourth quarter. In vascular in 2014 we expect continued improvement over full-year 2013 driven by
growth in emerging markets and the launch of multiple new products to expand our leading share positions. This
includes the U.S. launch of MitraClip, our first in class product for the minimally invasive treatment of mitral
regurgitation, which is the most common heart valve condition in the world.
Combined with continued growth outside the U.S. we expect strong double-digit growth of MitraClip sales in 2014.
And we have the expected launch of the new peripheral stent in our endovascular portfolio and we will continue to
expand share with our leading drug-eluting product portfolio. We launched XIENCE Xpedition in August in Japan and
we'll launch it in China this month. We'll also continue to expand share of our bioresorbable vascular scaffold Absorb
outside of the U.S. At the same time, we move it through the development process in several key geographies including
the U.S., Japan and China.
In Vision Care, sales increased 15% in the quarter driven by accelerating growth in our cataract lens business. This
business now represents more than 65% of our Vision Care sales and has been growing well in excess of market growth
rates. We expect double-digit sales growth for this business in 2014 with continued positive momentum from new
products. And this includes our TECNIS Toric lens in the U.S., our TECNIS OptiBlue lens in Japan and our new
Catalys laser cataract system as well as new product launches we expect early this year.
Diagnostics remains one of our most durable growth business consistently delivering mid- to high single digit
operational sales growth for the past three years. Full-year 2013 sales growth of 8% was balanced geographically with
double-digit growth in emerging markets and mid-single digit growth in developed markets. Margin expansion once
again exceeded expectations for the full year increasing 300 basis points versus 2012.
In 2014, we expect strong performance from Diagnostics as we continue to build momentum in core laboratory
diagnostics, increase the penetration of our molecular and point of care businesses and expand our presence in
emerging markets across all three Diagnostics businesses. In our R&D pipeline we'll continue to invest in the
development of several new instrument platforms across the Diagnostics portfolio that we expect to launch over the
next several years. These new systems add new features that are important to our customers such as speed, scalability,
productivity and shorter turnaround time.
So in summary, as we look to 2014, we again expect double-digit ongoing earnings per share growth. We're on track
with our recovery efforts in nutrition, we're projecting an increase in share repurchases in 2014 following a 57%
increase in our dividend announced last October and as we move into the second half of this year we expect stronger
sales and earnings growth highlighted by a reacceleration in our Nutrition business, continued durable performance in
Diagnostics, strong Vision Care growth and another year of double-digit sales growth in emerging markets.

I'll now turn the call over to Tom and Brian to discuss 2013 results and the 2014 outlook in more detail. Tom?
Thomas C. Freyman
Thanks, Miles.
Today we reported ongoing diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of $0.58, in line with our previous
guidance range and up more than 20% over the prior year. Sales for the quarter increased 3.3% on an operational basis.
That is excluding an unfavorable impact of nearly 3% from foreign exchange. As anticipated, fourth quarter sales
growth was affected by the supplier recall in our International Nutrition business which reduced operational sales
growth by an estimated 1.5 percentage points in the fourth quarter.
Operational sales growth was driven by high single digit growth in Diagnostics and double-digit growth in Vision Care.
Sales in emerging markets were up 9% in the quarter on an operational basis. Reported sales, which include the impact
of exchange, were up slightly in the quarter. The fourth quarter adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.4%, in line with
expectations and up 60 basis points versus the prior year despite a negative impact from exchange of 60 basis points.
Ongoing SG&A expense was 28.5% of sales, somewhat lower than expectations, reflecting in part G&A expense
reductions. Finally, our adjusted gross margin ratio improved by 160 basis points over the prior year in the quarter.
Overall, as we look at 2013 we delivered strong ongoing earnings per share growth in line with our initial guidance and
up double digits despite some challenges. We also achieved a number of financial objectives we set out a year ago. Our
Diagnostics business expanded its operating margin by 300 basis points and continued to deliver strong top line growth.
Our Nutrition business expanded its operating margin by nearly 300 basis points. And overall, we expanded adjusted
operating margin by more than 100 basis points.
Turning to our outlook for the full year 2014, today we issued full-year ongoing earnings per share guidance of $2.16 to
$2.26, reflecting double-digit growth at the midpoint of the range. Before I review our forecasts for sales and P&L line
items, I'd like to discuss certain factors that are impacting our forecast for 2014 and comparison to 2013.
We achieved our ongoing EPS expectation in 2013 in the face of a negative foreign exchange impact on sales of
approximately 2%. Additionally, the supplier recall in our International Nutrition business impacted EPS by an
estimated $0.10 per share in the second half of the year. The effects of these two items on growth will carry into the
first half of 2014.
In terms of exchange, the yen began a steady decline in the first quarter of 2013 and a number of emerging market
currencies similarly weakened beginning late in the second quarter. Both of these events are expected to affect reported
results in the first half of 2014, but if current rates were to hold, exchange impacts would normalize by the second half
of 2014.
Over the past 12 months, we've been assessing how to better align our resources and infrastructure to meet the needs of
our business following the separation from AbbVie. As I mentioned previously, we took some selected G&A expenses
out in 2013 and reduced our ongoing SG&A expense ratio from 31.3% of sales in 2012 to 30.6% in 2013.
In 2014, as part of our efforts to get our support structure to appropriate levels, we will take further actions to reduce
our expenses. We expect SG&A expense as a percentage of sales to decline by around 70 basis points in 2014. We'll
continue to update you on these initiatives as appropriate.
We project share repurchases in 2014 to exceed $2 billion, above the 2013 level. Combined with the 57% increase in
the dividend announced last October, we plan to again return substantial cash to shareholders in 2014.
In 2014, we intend on a one-time basis to repatriate about $2 billion of 2014 earnings generated outside the United
States. We expect that the cash taxes due in the U.S. on this one-time repatriation will be low as we plan to accelerate
utilization of various long-term deferred tax assets. This repatriation would result in specified charges to tax expense of
around $0.40 per share in 2014, of which $0.30 would be non-cash, with $0.10 in cash taxes.

Turning to our 2014 outlook, we're forecasting operational sales growth in the mid-single digits for the full year 2014.
Based on current exchange rates, we'd expect exchange to have a negative impact of somewhat more than 1% on our
full-year reported sales, with the most significant impact in the first half of the year. This would result in reported sales
growth in the low to mid-single digits for the full year 2014.
Operational sales growth is expected to be driven by continued strong growth in Diagnostics, Nutrition, and Vision
Care, along with an improvement in the growth rate in Vascular. We're also forecasting continued strong growth across
our businesses in emerging markets. We expect a high single-digit operational sales decline in our Diabetes Care
business, driven by reimbursements, reductions and competitive dynamics in the U.S. Brian will go into more detail on
the 2014 outlook by business in a few minutes.
We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 55% for the full year 2014, which reflects a negative
impact of around 90 basis points from the combination of foreign exchange and the effects of U.S. market conditions
on our U.S. Diabetes Care business, partially offset by underlying improvements in Nutrition, Diagnostics and Vision
Care. We forecast ongoing R&D somewhat above 6% of sales and ongoing SG&A of approximately 30% of sales for
the full year 2014.
Overall, we expect to expand our full-year adjusted operating margin by approximately 60 basis points in 2014. We
forecast net interest expense of around $90 million, non-operating income of around $10 million, approximately $50
million of expense on the exchange gain loss line of the P&L and an ongoing tax rate of 19% for the full year 2014.
Finally, I'd like to review the quarterly outlook for 2014. For the first quarter, we're forecasting ongoing earnings per
share of $0.34 to $0.36. As I discussed earlier, certain anomalies will affect sales and earnings comparisons in the first
and second quarters of 2014 including the carryover effect of 2013 foreign exchange movements and the 2013 supplier
recall in Nutrition.
We forecast modest operational sales growth in the first quarter and at current exchange rates we'd expect a negative
impact from exchange of approximately 3% resulting in reported sales down low single digits. We forecast an adjusted
gross margin ratio approaching 54% which reflects impacts from foreign exchange, the 2013 supplier recall in
Nutrition and competitive dynamics in Diabetes Care. We also forecast ongoing SG&A expense of around 33.5% of
sales and R&D expense approaching 7% of sales in the first quarter.
For the second quarter, we're forecasting ongoing earnings per share of $0.49 to $0.51. We forecast operational sales
growth in the low to mid-single digits in the second quarter and at current exchange rates we'd expect a negative impact
from foreign exchange of approximately 1.5 percentage points. For the first and second quarter we project specified
items of $0.27 and $0.22 respectively reflecting the same items as we identified for the full year in our earnings release.
As previously indicated we expect the pace of both sales and ongoing EPS growth to accelerate in the second half as
comparisons become more favorable with operational sales growth in the mid- to upper single digits and steady
operating margin expansion.
So in summary, we delivered double digit EPS growth in 2013 and our 2014 outlook reflects double-digit earnings
growth at the midpoint of our guidance range driven by improving sales growth in a number of our businesses and
expanding operating margin.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian to review the business operating highlights.
Brian Yoor
Thanks, Tom.
This morning I'll provide a more detailed review of our fourth quarter performance and our 2014 sales outlook. As
mentioned earlier, my comments will focus on operational sales growth. I'll first discuss our Nutrition business where
global sales increased 1% in the fourth quarter and were impacted as expected by the supplier recall in International

Nutrition. This sales disruption is estimated to have reduced global Nutritional operational sales growth by
approximately $90 million or somewhat more than 5% in the quarter.
Global Pediatric Nutrition sales were down 2% in the quarter including a 3% decline in international Pediatric
Nutrition. Excluding the impact of the sales disruption, international Pediatric Nutrition sales would have increased
strong double digits driven by market uptake of new product innovations. While U.S. pediatric sales were relatively flat
in the quarter, Abbott remains the market leader in the non-WIC segment of the U.S. infant formula market and
continues to drive uptake of recent innovation launches.
Global Adult Nutrition sales increased 5% in the quarter with international adult sales increasing 14% driven by strong
growth of our Ensure and Glucerna brands along with execution of several market development initiatives. U.S. Adult
Nutrition sales were down 5% impacted by the exit from certain non-core business lines as part of our margin
improvement initiative as well as higher sales in 2012 from the timing of a new product launch.
We continue to focus on innovation in our global Nutrition business. In 2014, we anticipate several important programs
to drive share gains in Pediatric Nutrition and category expansion in Adult Nutrition where Abbott holds the global
leadership positions. This includes the recent launch of Similac single pack in the online market segment in China
which brings Abbott's best-in-class packaging solution to this large and rapidly growing segment of the infant formula
market.
At the same time, we continue to expand our manufacturing and R&D presence to be closer to our customers. As Miles
mentioned, three new manufacturing facilities will come online this year including plants in China and India. In
addition, we are investing in local R&D and recently opened a new R&D center in China and broke ground on a new
pilot plant in Singapore. As result of these efforts we expect our R&D resources based in emerging markets to grow to
more than 30% over the next few years.
For the full year 2014 we are forecasting high single digit sales growth on an operational basis for our global Nutrition
business. We're on track with our recovery efforts in the geographies affected by the supplier recall and forecast low
double-digit operational sales growth in operational nutrition. As Tom mentioned, we'll see a first half carryover effect
of the supplier recall, and for the first quarter we are forecasting a low single digit sales declined on an operational
basis for our global Nutrition business.
In our Diagnostics business, we achieved nearly 9% sales growth in the fourth quarter, including mid-teens growth in
emerging markets. Core laboratory diagnostic sales increased more than 9% in the fourth quarter, driven by continued
above market performance in both developed and emerging markets. This business continues to execute on its
commercial strategy to deliver total solutions that are efficient, flexible, and cost-effective to large healthcare
customers.
In molecular diagnostics, worldwide sales increased 1% in the fourth quarter, with international sales up 10%, led by
strong growth in infectious disease platforms and geographic expansion in emerging markets.
In point of care diagnostics, worldwide sales increased 14%, driven by continued growth in the U.S. hospital and
physician office lab segments as well as a double-digit growth in emerging markets.
In 2014, we expect to again deliver above market performance in global diagnostics. In core laboratory diagnostics
we'll continue to broaden our ARCHITECT assay menu and execute on our commercial strategies in both developed
and emerging markets, such as China, Brazil and Russia. We also expect continued double-digit growth in our
infectious disease business in molecular diagnostics, and continued market penetration with our point of care platform,
with double-digit growth in emerging markets across all three businesses.
At the same time, we'll continue development of several next-generation platforms that are designed to positively
impact point of care, improve service to customers, enhance laboratory productivity, and reduce costs.
For the full year 2014, we expect our global Diagnostics business to generate mid to high single digit operational sales
growth, with mid to high single digit growth in core laboratory and molecular diagnostics and double-digit growth in
point of care diagnostics. For the first quarter, we are forecasting low to mid-single-digit operational sales growth in

our global diagnostics business.
In our Established Pharmaceuticals business, or EPD, sales increased in the quarter modestly. Sales growth in our key
emerging market segment increased 10% in the quarter, led by strong growth in Russia, China, and Brazil. We continue
to focus on broadening our core therapeutic area product portfolios, strengthening our commercial capabilities, and
implementing tailored strategies to accelerate growth in emerging markets. Sales growth in our developed and other
market segment decreased 7% in the quarter and continues to be impacted by market conditions, particularly in
Western Europe.
As we look ahead to full year 2014 for EPD, we expect low single digit operational sales growth as we build
momentum over the course of the year. Given that 100% of EPD sales are outside of the U.S., this business is relatively
more impacted by exchange movements so we'd expect sales to be relatively flat on a reported basis.
In the first quarter of 2014, we are forecasting sales to be relatively flat on an operational basis, which includes a timing
impact from a plant shutdown to expand capacity in order to meet increasing demand for one of our key products in the
emerging markets. Including the impact of foreign exchange, we expect first quarter reported sales to be down
mid-single digits.
And lastly, medical devices, which includes our vascular, Diabetes Care and Vision Care businesses. Sales growth in
medical devices increased 4% in the fourth quarter. Our vascular business achieved another quarter of sequential
improvement in its growth rate, with worldwide sales up nearly 4%. International sales increased more than 5%, driven
by continued momentum across key geographies of XIENCE Xpedition and Absorb, double-digit sales growth of the
MitraClip and strong performance of our endovascular portfolio. U.S. sales increased 1% in the fourth quarter.
In 2014, we expect continued sales growth improvement in our vascular business, driven by a number of new product
launches, including MitraClip, the approval and launch of a new peripheral stent in our endovascular portfolio, and the
continued growth of Absorb. We continue to move Absorb through the development process in several key
geographies. Most recently, we completed enrollment in our Absorb trial in Japan, and we are on track to complete
enrollment in China and the U.S. in the first half of this year. For the full year 2014, we expect sales in our global
vascular business to increase in the low to mid-single digits on an operational basis, with low to mid-single-digit
growth in the first quarter.
In Diabetes Care, global sales in the fourth quarter decreased 3.5%, impacted by implementation of the CMS
competitive bidding program for Medicare patients. International sales, which represents 60% of total Diabetes Care
sales, increase 4% in the quarter, driven by strong performance in the emerging markets. For the full year 2014, we
forecast a high single digit decline in global Diabetes Care on an operational basis. In our international Diabetes Care
business, we expect similar performance to 2013, driven by continued double-digit growth in emerging markets. This
will be offset by an expected decline in the U.S. impacted by reimbursement reductions and competitive dynamics
resulting in a low double-digit operational sales decline for our global Diabetes Care business in the first half of 2014.
In Vision Care, we achieved nearly 15% sales growth in the fourth quarter, with balanced double-digit growth in both
emerging and developed markets. Sales of cataract products increased strong double digits, outpacing the global
cataract market, driven by the continued uptake of recently launched products. These new intraocular lenses, or IOLs,
provide Abbott with access to large and growing segments of the cataract market where we weren't previously
competing.
We expect continued strong growth in our Vision Care of business this year as we continue to introduce new products.
This includes the launch of new preloaded IOLs, which improve the ease-of-use for the cataract surgeon, as well as the
further penetration of our new Catalys laser cataract system, which is receiving very positive feedback. For the full year
2014, we forecast double-digit operational sales growth in our global Vision Care business with mid to high single digit
growth in the first quarter.
In summary, we achieved our expectations for 2013, including double-digit ongoing earnings per share growth, a more
than 100 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin, and numerous new product launches. In 2014, we are
well positioned to deliver another year of double-digit ongoing earnings per share earnings per share growth with

accelerated growth in the second half of the year.
We will now open the call for questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Mike Weinstein from JPMC.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Good morning. Can you hear me okay?
<A - Miles D. White>: Yes.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Okay. Perfect. Okay. Let me start with the combination of repatriation and buyback.
Tom, it looks like you're, if I'm reading the press release and your comments correctly, that you're repatriating $2
billion. There's going to be both a cash and non-cash cost of doing so and you're using that to buy back stock, but
you're backing out the impact of repatriating from your earnings and your guidance for 2014. Is that right?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Just a few points. I don't think you can directly link the two items. Certainly, what this is
about, Mike, is monetizing assets as early as we possibly can and providing strategic flexibility from a financing
perspective across the company.
We're in a position here where we have these deferred tax assets that, as you know, typically get realized over a long
period of time in future tax returns, and this is an opportunity to immediately use them to help monetize and bring back
only 2014 earnings. This has nothing to do with anything in the past. And provide that cash here in the U.S. for
strategic flexibility and the various things we would want to use it for. So since it is one-time in nature, it's going be
done only on 2014 earnings. This is a one-time opportunity to monetize these deferred tax assets, that's why we're
handling it as a specified item in 2014.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: But you're repatriating $2 billion, and you're using $2 billion to buy back stock, but
you're backing out – at least the cash impact you would think should go through the income statement.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: But, again, it's one-time in nature, Mike. Our pattern in the past has been to reinvest. Our
expectation as we go forward beyond 2014 is to reinvest these foreign earnings, and this is a one-time opportunity
where basically the focus is to monetize these assets as early as we possibly can and allow them to be redirected to
whatever productive use, whether it's strategic initiatives, share buyback or whatever.
And the other thing I'd mention is, in 2013 we bought back over $1.5 billion in shares, so it's difficult to directly link
this planned action with a share repurchase. But I think it's a matter of just productively using these assets in the best
way possible for shareholders overall, and we think this is an opportunity we want to capitalize on in 2014.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Okay. It's probably worth spending just a few minutes on the first quarter guidance
because obviously there's a disconnect between your guidance and the Street. I think we kind of knew the Street was
aggressive, but there's still even a wider disconnect than we were modeling. So maybe spend a minute on some of the
different elements here. I think we're aware that FX is a headwind, but you talked about a couple of other items, an
issue where you're bringing a plant down. Maybe you can just walk through and maybe try and help us bridge where
the Street is at and where you guys are at for the first part of the year.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Really, Mike, the two big things are FX, but obviously the Nutrition supplier recall as
well. I mean, you saw the impact on the third and fourth quarters of our 2013 results. As you know, we managed
through that quite well and delivered on expectations overall, but that factor is carrying into the first half. As Miles
mentioned, we are making good progress on recovering. We're right on the path we projected. But as we've said from
the very beginning, when this occurred, this is going to cause a very tough first half comparison in 2014, and that's
what you're seeing. There are, at the business level, other relatively smaller comparison issues, but these really are the

two big factors that are causing the first quarter to be tough.
The last thing I'd add is while exchange is a challenge for us in 2014 in the first half, the first quarter is particularly
impacted in 2014 because as the exchange rates moved in 2013, some of those costs are in inventory as we close out
2013 and flowed through the P&L in the early part of the year in 2014. So the exchange impact is particularly acute in
the first quarter, and I think those two factors really are the main reasons for the forecast being a little bit different than
what people are expecting.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Okay. Just on the early first quarter top-line growth, it sounded like you were guiding to
a constant currency that would be low single digits since you were anticipating a low single digit decline in reported
revenues. Just help us with from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, what gets a little bit more difficult? And then I'll
drop. Thanks.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: It really has to do with trends in the businesses. Certainly, as we talked about the growth
rate in International Nutrition is being impacted by Fonterra, by the recall, there are phasing. As you know, our
Established Pharmaceuticals business is a business that changes from quarter to quarter.
In the first quarter, there's a plan to expand capacity for one of our key products. As a result of that, we are going to
have to shut down the plant in the quarter, and that will draw down some of the sales until we can start the plant up
again in the second quarter and get the growth rate going back up in that business. I'd say those are the primary reasons.
There's some timing effects in Diagnostics as well, but those are the main reasons why the first quarter is in the range
that you described.
<Q - Michael J. Weinstein>: Got you. Okay. Thanks, Tom.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you, and our next question is from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Good morning. Tom, you gave us some help on the first quarter gross margin number. I
wonder if you could help us sort of into the second quarter on gross margins or just maybe more qualitatively first half
versus second half, how GMs likely trend and what are the key headwinds and tailwinds that we should think about,
obviously FX being one of them.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yeah, I'd say the two things going on in gross margin as we look at 2014 are pretty much
what I mentioned in my remarks. We're just slightly down year-over-year, and then that's really currency, again, being
challenging and the competitive dynamics we talked about in Diabetes Care. I think as you look out into the second
quarter that the pattern or the expectation for the full year could be extrapolated into our expected gross margin
progress in the second quarter of the year.
So those are really the two main factors. It was what I mentioned in my remarks. I think it does mask a lot of good
things happening underneath in the businesses, particularly in Nutrition and Diagnostics, but also in Vision Care in
terms of expanding the gross margin before some of these exchange effects hit the businesses.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Okay. Maybe just two more quick ones, one for Tom and one maybe for Miles. But in terms of
the buy back, you're very clear on how you're funding the buy back this year, but Tom, could you give us a sense of
free cash in 2014, and how we should think about funding dividends or buy backs, either through using debt or
repatriation going forward?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Yeah, as we look at free cash flow after capital expenditures and dividends, and as you
know, we are stepping up the dividend in 2014, I'd say in the $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion range is something we would
expect, and that leaves a lot of strategic flexibility for whatever might occur or opportunities that might pop up during
the year. So as you know, we had some anomalies in our cash flow in 2013 relative to the carryover effects of

separation, but we should be back into that pretty strong operating cash flow level and strong free cash flow to support
the strategic objectives of the business.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Okay. And then, Miles, you made some commentary in your remarks about going after costs
and Tom talked about the leverage we're going to see in 2014, the company since the spin has talked about on a per
segment basis being able to achieve very strong margins, obviously nutritionals comes to light, do you see further
opportunities for going after corporate cost post the spin and is it likely that those type of initiatives are more ratable or
is there a possibility for more decisive action? Thank you.
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, I think the simple answer to your question is yes, it is a focus for us, not just related to
the spin, but in general, related to the shape of the business. A lot of our business is outside the U.S., and so there's an
opportunity to structure ourselves from a support standpoint a little differently and definitely we are addressing that.
We're putting a fair amount – as you know, we put a lot of attention on gross margin above the line there, but we're also
putting a fair amount of attention on general and administrative costs across the corporation, not only at the corporate
level but in the divisions, in support and overhead costs.
So I do think there's opportunity there. By its very nature, some of it can be more immediate, but then some of it is
more ratable, because in some cases, you got to replace old processes with new processes or old systems with newer
ones, et cetera. So I think it's commendation of both, David.
I like to push hard for sooner rather than later. I think this is one of those areas where chronic dissatisfaction or
impatience is a good thing, and so we push on that. You're always trying to balance disruption to the organization or to
the business versus the ongoing operation, but yes, there is an opportunity, we are on it, we are paying attention to it,
and it is a combination of frankly, both immediate and more ratable.
<Q - David R. Lewis>: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from David Roman from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Thank you, and good morning. I wanted to touch a couple of business specific dynamics and
then one strategic question. I guess maybe we could talk start with EPD, and Miles, can certainly appreciate your
comments that it takes time for a new management team to get in place and affect their impact on the business, but
maybe you could go into a little bit more specifics about what the path is for that franchise. If I look at the non-key
emerging market segment, that has been a business that has been deteriorating, I think, each of the past several quarters,
and it doesn't, it's a little bit unclear given how this business works what exactly turns this around, so maybe you could
just provide a little bit more color on what steps the new management team is taking and then how we would see those
flow through into reported numbers?
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, I think we've got two very different stories here, as I've said the past, you've got very
much an emerging market story and a developed market story, and then within those, some segmentation. I would tell
you that in the emerging markets, there are many that are very attractive, some that are less so, because they may be
more commodity oriented than brand oriented.
We tend to be focused on the ones where it's advantageous for us to be very brand oriented and the markets are very
attractive and profitable. As much as the growth rates may look modest or lacking, the profit profile of this business is
quite attractive. Gross margins in this business are above 60%. It's a very run well-run business, it's a very attractive,
profitable business. If it was an unprofitable business it'd be a whole different story but this is actually a very attractive
business and the question is getting the segments right in terms of the attractive markets and those that are less
attractive.
So we put our focus on emerging markets that are sizable, where we've got critical mass and are attractive and our main
focus there is two things: one, expanding the breadth of the therapeutic categories and the product lines that we're

offering and frankly improving our branding and consumer skills as an adjunct to that business because in any given
country how we reach the consumer whether through the physician, the hospital or direct to the consumer and so forth
does make a difference.
So in the emerging markets I think that's the focus and it's getting a lot of attention. It's a lot of blocking and tackling
and smaller things but frankly it's working. We saw in the fourth quarter a return to double-digit growth in emerging
markets for EPD which is what I frankly expect. We know that some of those markets slowed last year. That's a
function of the markets but the growth rates were still quite attractive to us relative to other geographies around the
world.
On the developed market side I think the single biggest difficulty that we and a lot of our competitors face is Europe.
And I think that's true across a lot of businesses. Our Diagnostics business has weathered the economy and the actions
in Europe well but a lot of other businesses are struggling with Europe. And I think that's true for us, I think it's true for
our competitors. We've watched – I can't say growth rates it's more like decline rates – price pressures and volume rates
and so forth and I know that others have been hit harder than we have. But nevertheless we're down in these developed
markets about 10%. And so we can be up 10% in emerging markets, down in the developed markets and it cancels out.
I'd like these emerging markets to keep growing and get to be a much bigger portion but we've got very close to a 50-50
split right now where what we're struggling with in the developed markets with price and utilization cuts and other
things is being offset by growth in emerging markets which we intend but the way we deal with those developed
markets is quite different. There's a fair amount of expense reduction, focus, restructuring, et cetera and I know this has
been one that we've been challenged on from time to time. The previous questioner, Mike Weinstein, is constantly
questioning me, I think, on this one and I have to say a fair question. The emerging part of this is going quite well and
the developed part – it's uphill.
The legacy of the business is a combination of businesses we've acquired and legacy Abbott and so forth. I think if we
were starting with a clean sheet of paper we'd target those markets that have the most attractive attributes but the fact is
we've got a lot of legacy markets here in developed economies that we've been in for a long time and that continue to
experience economic pressure, the most fundamental of those being Europe. So we continue to look at that particular
geography and that particular segment of business and deal with it differently than we deal with what we view as a
fairly attractive growth opportunity in a lot of the emerging markets.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Okay. That's helpful. And maybe switching to Diagnostics in the U.S. specifically, could you
comment on the molecular business? You have pretty strong trends in point of care as well as the core lab segment and
I would've thought there'd be some potential to cross-sell or leverage the different platforms. But it was a pretty tough
quarter in the U.S. in the molecular segment. Any further detail you can provide on market dynamics or company
specific factors?
<A - Brian Yoor>: Yeah.
<A - Miles D. White>: Go ahead.
<A - Brian Yoor>: I was going say, David, this is Brian. I'll kick it off and if Miles wants to add more color. In the
U.S., first of all let me say our underlying franchise of infectious disease is growing very strongly. It's doing very well.
We did have some comparables with respect to how you realize companion Diagnostics revenue. We had some revenue
in 2012 in the quarter that did not repeat. Just a little bit more choppy in that respect and also we just had a little bit of
an impact from the timing of when we ceased the distribution agreement but that doesn't impact the underlying
business.
The underlying business is poised to continue to do well with a focus on infectious disease. I think to look at the full
year is probably more reflective of how to think about molecular in the U.S. and we do expect a step up from that as we
move into 2014 with our continued success and focus on infectious disease. I think it's really important to note in this
business too that 60% of the sales are outside the U.S. and you can see the double-digit growth there. We are doing
very well in emerging markets in our platforms in infectious disease, and so we like the growth rates that we see overall
for molecular.

<Q - David H. Roman>: Okay. Then maybe just one last strategic question. As you look at the evolution of the sort of
"new Abbott story" over the past 12 months, I think we started a year ago with sort of a view of a growth company of
mid to high single-digit topline growth. Obviously some well-documented challenges that emerged over the course of
2013. You had a pretty, obviously, significant increase in the dividend in the third quarter of this year, and it seems like
we're shifting from a growth company to a capital return company. How should we think about the strategic positioning
of Abbott longer term? And Miles, where you're taking the business, growth versus capital return, M&A versus
shareholder buybacks, and things like that from a capital deployment standpoint?
<A - Miles D. White>: Well, I think you ought to think about the company much as we described. It's definitely a
growth platform with an intention of growth. The things that I'd say probably disappointed me or set us back last year
was largely foreign exchange, which was a big deal. I mean, that hit the top line and the bottom line and we are able
offset that, but that was one thing. And I think the recall we had in the Nutrition business was a couple of hundred
million dollars. That's a big hit. And that particular business is one of our big growth drivers.
I'd say strategically I'm pretty pleased with how the base core businesses are all performing, particularly relative to the
nature of the geographies and economies and so forth out there. I think that's all trending pretty well. The one business
where it's got a lot of my attention and focus, as we just talked about, is the branded generic pharmaceutical business,
where I'd say strategically I'd like this one to be improving faster.
What I'd call your attention to is after we acquired AMO, I'd say analysts and some shareholders had a fair amount of
skepticism about the performance of that business for some time, and admittedly, it took a few years to pick up
momentum there. But today, that business is churning at a fairly steady double-digit growth rate. It's gaining share. It's
doing quite well. My own impatience would have been that it do that much faster than it did, and I'm always pushing
for faster progress or faster impact in the performance of a business. I guess not just for your expectations, but for my
own. And yet we got to where we wanted to be.
We saw with the vascular business terrific performance. We've seen steady quarter-to-quarter sequential improvements.
We've gained share in the vascular business across the board, every geography we're number one in the stent business
around the world. The AMO business is doing exceptionally well that way. Diagnostics has had a very steady
sequential track record of improving growth. The frustration I've got is the pace of that improvement in EPD right now,
and it's got the focus of our management team and my focus. It's the only place I'm really, I guess, strategically a little
frustrated. But a lot of that has to do with the nature of the developed economies. And I think you're going to hear that
from a lot of our competitors and a lot of other businesses.
So I would say first of all, in no way do I think we're stepping away from an intention of growth, a focus on growth, a
focus on share gain or a focus on geographies where the dynamics are, frankly, around growth. I think that's all still
very valid, very true.
At the same time, we and other companies, if we're well run, we accumulate a fair amount of cash. And our investors
are looking for a return. And I think if we are not able to deploy some of that cash to strategic opportunities or we
disproportionally accumulate cash relative to strategic opportunities, we look at the shape of our balance sheet, we look
at the shape of all that, and I think if investors – you know, we've got this tension between the long term and, of course,
the quarter. And each quarter, we've got to report to our investors how we're doing, but I think also investors would like
the constant feedback of a healthy return, particularly in uncertain economies and uncertain times.
Our company has had a history for probably more than 30 years of very steady dividend growth and return to investors
that has got a certain identity and a certain appeal to a lot of investors. And we've had a very fairly steady track record
of share repurchase. We've had a steady track record of pretty significant profitability and cash accumulation and cash
generation. We've had a good track record with M&A and other things and I think we try to keep all that in balance so
that our investors are benefiting both from the growth profile over the long-term and a good healthy cash return when
economies are more uncertain and on a steady reliable basis.
So I would tell you I don't think it's black and white. You're not one or the other. We happen to be both. And that's been
the hallmark of the company for decades that we've been a growth vehicle and we've had a nice healthy cash return of

dividends and share buyback. And I think if we're successful, profitable, generating that kind of cash, that's what we
ought to do is find that balance.
<Q - David H. Roman>: Okay. That's helpful perspective. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Lawrence Biegelsen from Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Let me start on EPD. Miles, on the last
call you expressed your commitment to the business. I guess I'm wondering within EPD – you're obviously more
excited about the emerging market opportunity. Do you need to have an EPD business in the developed markets? That's
my first question.
<A - Miles D. White>: Need? No. Want? It depends. I think it depends on the dynamics in any given market. I'm not –
I don't think any of us are pleased with the pressures or decline, if you will, of growth rates in say Europe, but at the
same time, Larry, it's extremely profitable business. Even with all the price pressure, utilization pressure and volume
pressure it's a very profitable business. So I think our challenge is – it's always how long will these circumstances last?
How long will these dynamics last? Is this a trend that doesn't change? Is there a bottom? Is there a turn? Is there – how
long does this endure? And what's the best manner for us to derive best value for our owners, our investors, our
shareholders in that time?
You can get hung up on the optics of growth rate and say, gee it's hurting – it's diluting my growth rate, but at the same
time I think there's the notion that it's making a fair amount of money. And it's profitable and there's value in that. So I
think our job is to figure out the best way to optimally derive that value for our investor and that's a trade-off between
what we can do here over some duration of time relative to how long we expect market conditions to exist or what's the
best deployment of the asset value in the event we can derive the right value for it but when it's as profitable as it is,
that's a tough trade-off.
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: That's helpful. And then on Adult Nutrition, can you talk about the impact of the
divestitures and any quantification and when that laps – particularly in the Adult Nutrition business in the U.S.?
Thanks.
<A - Brian Yoor>: Yeah, Larry, this is Brian. You're seeing in the fourth quarter on the adult segment in the U.S.
around a four-percentage point impact headwind and that also does spill into the first quarter as well. As we were
talking about some of the things impacting first quarter that would be one item that spills into the first quarter of 2014
as well for the U.S. adult segment in Nutrition.
<Q - Lawrence H. Biegelsen>: Thanks for taking the questions.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question is from Glenn Novarro from RBC Capital Markets.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: Hi. Good morning. Two questions. First on the infant nutritional business, you mentioned on
the call that the recovery in emerging markets – China, et cetera – was on track. I was wondering if you could share
with us some evidence that suggests that things are on track? Was December better than November? Is there script data
that you're tracking? Any color that would be helpful to give us confidence that the business recovers other than just
from easy comps. And then as a follow up, I...
<A - Miles D. White>: Go ahead, Glenn. I'm chuckling a little bit because I'm thinking no, we just make this stuff up.
Of course, I'll answer you in just a second. Go ahead.

<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: And then just second just on operating margin goals. It looks like you're going to get to the
nutritional operating margin goals sooner than expected. And it looks like Diagnostics, we're going to hit those goals
quickly too. So I'm wondering as we look at nutritionals, is 25% a realistic new goal and with respect to Diagnostics,
are we in the late innings or is there another opportunity for more expansion there? Just qualitatively if you can help us
think about the longer-term goals there. Thanks.
<A - Miles D. White>: All right. Let me go back to the beginning. First of all, evidence of recovery. There's three
major geographies that we're paying a lot of attention to in the recovery of this recall that we experienced in Nutrition.
It's China, Vietnam and Saudi Arabia, all of which are fairly important markets to us. We do get market share data. We
get it from multiple sources in these countries. We get off take data, meaning what leaves the shelf. We get a fair
amount of actually measured data. We get it from multiple sources. And then we get a fair amount of anecdotal data as
well. And we do track it. It is numerical. It is measurable.
We are seeing sequential month-to-month, in fact, we've got a fairly, I'd say, robust model that's been pretty accurate
for us that's predictive. It takes into account holidays, buying patterns, consumer patterns, all that stuff, believe it or not,
in all these markets, so we can do that. And there's a bit of a lag, maybe a month or a month and a half in some cases,
and it varies by geography, but we are able to measure our progress. We're ahead of our progress in China, our model,
we're ahead of our expectations. We're ahead of our expectation in Vietnam. And we're a little behind in Saudi Arabia.
And so we're able to measure that. We're able to see sequential evidence. We've got enough data points now that we
can trust our forecasting, trust our model, trust our data, trust our feedback. Early, mid and late fall, we didn't have
enough data points yet to be confident of the kind of trends we were seeing because there's some, not cyclicality, but
there's some up and down in the trends depending on holidays and other things. And we've seen enough of that now.
We've had enough months of recovery that we can pretty reliably forecast for ourselves and for you how we will
recover in the various countries.
So I'd say, yeah, there's definite evidence, definite data. We definitely can see it, and I'm pleased by what I see, frankly.
I think our teams in those countries are doing an excellent job. It gives us not only data about us but data about
segments, data about competitors, et cetera, and how we believe all of that's going, so I'm pleased with what I see.
With regard to operating margin goals or even gross margin goals, I'd say for Diagnostics, late innings. I think there's a
point where even if we could do better, I'm not sure I'd want to. I would always look for improvements in gross margin,
but then you have discretionary spending in R&D or sales and marketing expenses, et cetera, that then get down to
operating margin. And I'd say in the Diagnostics business, I'd say late innings because I'd like to be putting more and
more into R&D there. I think we've got a nice model from a sales and marketing standpoint, but as you know, in the
Diagnostics businesses, we've got half a dozen systems, major systems, in development, and these are expensive
programs, all of which are tracking very well as we renew the system platforms that are in the market.
So over the next, I don't know, five or six years here, there's going to be a steady drumbeat of new product coming
that's going to drive the growth of this business globally on top of the install base we already have, and I think those are
very important initiatives. So I'd like to be putting money into R&D, or more money into R&D. That's not to say you
should expect any kind of diminishment in bottom line. You should not. But I'd like to be improving the gross margin
in order to be able to invest more in what we would call discretionary spending in R&D and maybe even SG&A.
So I'd say that one, while they've managed profitability, I think, brilliantly, and yes, they are ahead of schedule, I think
it's delivered for the investor, the shareholder and the business, and strategically, it also needs to be reinvesting in itself
as we go along, which it's doing and I think it's found a nice balance.
On nutritionals, I think there's still a lot of opportunity, and I would not go so far as to set a specific numerical target
for you, as ambitious as you might be, but I'd probably say the same thing. We're always looking to improve our gross
margin, and to the extent that, that drops through to the bottom line, that business is not as expense-intensive in R&D.
R&D doesn't cost as much as a percent of sales. And so it's a highly productive R&D organization in terms of new
product development, new product innovation, et cetera, and it's got a low percentage of sales spent in R&D. It's much
more SG&A or marketing-intensive. If I were going to spend more money promoting that business, I'd do it in the sales

and marketing lines.
And I think that as the gross margin continues to improve there, which I expect it will substantially, I think there will be
a sharing between dropping it to the bottom line for the investor and reinvesting further in sales and marketing and
expansion because there's so much opportunity, particularly internationally, for this business. So I think that's about
how would characterize it.
I do expect to continue to see margin expansion there, and I'd say that these businesses in particular, all the businesses
have put a fair amount of focus on margin expansion, and they've gotten it, and you've seen that in the gross margin
line in our reporting. You've also see exchange, foreign exchange erode some of that, or in some businesses, like the
vascular business, while they've had great improvement also in gross margin and yields and productivity, we've also
seen price pressures that they've had to absorb, and I think the fact that under some of the pricing and utilization
pressures we've seen in Europe and other geographies in some of our businesses over the last several years and
particularly last year, the margin improvement initiatives that we've had have not only mitigated that but continue to
improve margin anyway. So I think there's more to come.
<Q - Glenn J. Novarro>: All right, great. Thanks for the color, Miles.

Thank you. Our next question is from Rick Wise from Stifel.
<Q - Frederick Wise>: Good morning, everybody. Tom, if I could ask you again on gross margin, so the 55% gross
margin guidance you said included 90 basis points of negative FX, the Diabetes and some other offsets. Was that, I
assume that plant shutdown is reflected in that as well. Can you break that portion out just specifically?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Sure, Rick. The plant shutdown I referred to is just a timing issue. That's affecting the
gating of sales for that one particular business between the quarters, so that really, I mean certainly, there's a little of
startup and the like, but it's not meaningful to the overall corporation, so that really is not related. It's really the two big
factors that we cited as a lot of good things, as Miles mentioned going on within the businesses underlying, and being a
little bit offset or largely offset by those two factors.
<Q - Frederick Wise>: Okay. Another, coming at it another direction, is part of the gross margin headwind what I'll
call temporary excess capacity from the three new nutritional facilities? Is that a big factor?
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: There is a little bit of startup there as well. But again, I don't think that's overall
meaningful for the overall comparison year-over-year for the entire corporation. Certainly there's some cost in there,
but they have a lot of other good things going on in terms of their margin improvement programs that overall are
driving an improvement in the Nutrition gross margins in 2014.
<Q - Frederick Wise>: And one last quick one. The buy back, does that get you to the middle of your guidance range
or the high-end? How do we think about that? And maybe you can comment on whether you'd do an accelerated share
repurchase. Thanks so much.
<A - Thomas C. Freyman>: Well, the guidance is the guidance. It's the range, and obviously, our baseline expectation
is to be within the range, and if the year goes well, we'll be in the high-end, and if there were challenges, we're going to
work not to be below the middle. So that's the way we think about the guidance. And what I would say is, what is a
definite part of the plan is to buy back shares roughly in the range we talked about today, certainly that's a baseline you
can count on as you build your model for 2014, and there's no plan at this time to do an accelerated structure, but that's
something we've looked at and will think about.
<Q - Frederick Wise>: Thanks.

Thank you. Our next question is from Josh Jennings from Cowen & Company. Josh, your line is open. Please check
your mute feature. And I'm sorry, we're getting no response. We'll move on to the next question. Our next question
today is from Kristen Stewart of Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to focus in on the vascular business. I
know you'd commented on strong growth in MitraClip, I was wondering if you'd be willing to provide a baseline
number of where it ended this year with European sales, and then just thoughts around as you're rolling this out in the
U.S. just the strategy given the reimbursement environment?
<A - Brian Yoor>: Yes. Hi, Kristen. This is Brian. MitraClip had strong growth in Europe, I think it ended the year
approximately around $130 million. We expect some additional approvals in certain countries there to continue our
growth in Europe, so we expect another year of strong growth with MitraClip in Europe region in 2014.
I will say with respect to the U.S., we were very pleased with the decision that was made by the panel last year to
receive the approval that we have for the degenerative mitral regurgitation patient in the U.S. that's at high risk. It's a
pretty – I'll say, modest way to think about it but we're going to take it the right way in terms of how we approach our
centers and those large cardiac specialty centers that are capable and have the expertise to work with the MitraClip.
Again, another year of strong growth. I think we could think about it probably approaching close to $200 million as we
move into 2014 but clearly between the Europe side and the U.S. side a nice contributor to our overall vascular growth.
We continue to work towards also the reimbursement and improving our reimbursement there. I think we've discussed
before that we ultimately foresee this coming more in line with the TAVR line of reimbursement in the U.S. and again,
I know the societies have submitted for the national coverage and as well we also submitted for what would also be a
special add-on technology indication. We'll have more color to provide for you on both of those in the later part of
2014.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Okay. And then I guess just more broadly just in structural heart, how do you see
MitraClip fitting in? Do you need to surround it with additional programs to really have that platform be competitive or
do you think looking ahead just having a transcatheter mitral valve repair product alone will be successful within
Abbott?
<A - Miles D. White>: Kristen, this is Miles. I think it could standalone quite easily but I think we're always looking
for more innovation, and more opportunity to expand a position in a given treatment segment. So I'd put it more in the
desire rather than need. I think that given the lack of therapies out there to treat patients it clearly can standalone but to
the extent that other therapies evolve over time here it's certainly to the benefit of the patient and the business to expand
the offering.
<Q - Kristen M. Stewart>: Great. And then just on the stent business, I was wondering if you could offer any
additional commentary just on the Absorb product and what you're seeing in terms of market share positioning in the
accounts in which you're in? And then just to remind on the timing to the U.S. I think you had mentioned that you
expected to complete enrollment in the U.S. study this year? Just wanted to confirm that.
<A - Miles D. White>: Let me address share and then I'll hand to Brian to talk about U.S. First of all, I'm very pleased
with how the overall shares of the stent business have evolved. We have grown share in all of our geographies. We
hold the number one position in stents across Europe, the U.S., Japan, et cetera. We've not only held share but gained
share. I think that's been gratifying for the breadth and the strength and the quality of the product line. I think it's been a
challenging environment to some degree from a competitive or pricing standpoint. I expect that to mitigate some here
going into this year and we're seeing that as we see sequential improvement in growth at least in our own business.
And as regards Absorb, I think the acceptance – the use of Absorb continues to improve. Its share continues to improve
and continues to grow in many accounts and I'd have to note that while the trend has been a fair amount of price
degradation in this segment, Absorb is selling at a premium to metal drug-eluting stents, et cetera. So it continues to
gain share. It continues to gain a share of procedures in accounts where it's being used. It continues to grow very nicely

and do so at some premium to what are truly good quality stents out there in the metal drug-eluting stent category. So
with that let me give you to Brian to talk about the U.S.
<A - Brian Yoor>: Yeah, so, Kristen, obviously Absorb, a great contribution, as Miles had mentioned, to Europe and
our share gains there year-over-year. In the U.S. we're expecting to complete the enrollment in 2014 and that also goes
for China as well. We just completed enrollment for Japan. I think the way to think about this too is we're only in half
of the market – the worldwide market today if you think about it in terms of being in Europe. But we still have another
half of the world to go here. And so by completing these enrollments we set ourselves out there to be the only one in
this kind of technology with the opportunity to continue to penetrate and achieve the workhorse status we expect to.
Yeah.
Yolanda, we have time for one more question.
Operator
Thank you. Our final question today is from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James.
<Q - Jayson T. Bedford>: Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. I just wanted to revisit an earlier question on
EPD. I'm still a little unclear as to the source of the sluggishness in developed markets. Is it increased competition? Is it
a demand issue? Is it price? And then just as a follow-up, can you kind of give us the estimated market growth rates in
EPD and if it's easier, you can split it between emerging markets and developed markets.
<A - Miles D. White>: In the developed markets, it's a little bit of the items you discussed. Price, as we talked about
last couple of years, has probably been running at a rate twice what it has been prior to maybe 2012, and it'd been very
low single digits and it's probably doubled for a period of time. That seems to be mitigating a little bit as we go
forward, and I'd say the balance is basically either austerity in some of the countries where scripts are actually down or
and in some cases in our portfolio, a few of our products have, we're at the end of patent lives in Europe, and we did
have a few of those, we had a few patented products and some of those went off patent, and each one is relatively
minor, but that's been part of what's going on in the developed world.
I'd say in terms of market growth rates, it depends on markets, obviously, India for us is a key market, and while it
slowed probably into the mid-single-digit range in 2013. IMS forecast it to be back into that double-digit range in 2014,
which is a positive for us. I'd say overall in the key emerging markets, we're seeing basic market growth probably in the
mid-single range, maybe even a little bit better in a country like Russia, for example. And I think most investors are
familiar that Europe has been a pretty sluggish market overall from a volume perspective, and that's carried over into
our business as well.
<Q - Jayson T. Bedford>: Okay. And then just lastly for me, getting back to the discussion on cash repatriation, do
you anticipate that you'll be more active with M&A in 2014 than you were 2013.
<A - Miles D. White>: I think it all depends on the opportunities out there. I don't feel cash constrained about any of
that. I feel more constrained by what I view as a not terribly robust set of opportunities or valuations. I'm always
vigilant for opportunities for the company, but they've got to be a good fit strategically, and they've got to be good
valuations.
<Q - Jayson T. Bedford>: Fair enough. Thanks.
Brian Yoor
