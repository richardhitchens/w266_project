Inge G. Thulin
Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining us for the call today. For 3M, 2013 was a very
successful year. Our team did an excellent job of bringing our vision and strategy to life and increasing 3M's relevance
to customers around the world. We delivered a strong performance, and importantly we have advanced the company
through the three key strategy levels: portfolio management, investment in research and development, and business
transformation. Let me give you a bit more on each of these key levers.
In 2013, portfolio management remained at the front of how we manage 3M. For example, we combined and scaled
businesses in Electronics and Energy to better serve our customers, gain rapid cost synergies, and address
underperforming businesses. We took similar actions in Safety and Graphics to enhance our product offerings and
improve our relevance to customers. And when it made sense, we exited, as we did with the fly-fishing business within
the Consumer business group. We continued to build strengths on strengths by investing in research and development,
which is the heartbeat of our plan. Our increased investment is focused on long-term disruptive technologies aimed at
opportunities with significant growth potential.
We made good progress with business transformation, enabled by our global ERP implementation. We rolled out in
several countries in 2013 as we moved forward into the deployment phase. This effort will help us to create a more
efficient and productive 3M. Our teams are building on their experiences from the initial rollouts in order to improve
our capabilities to deploy going forward. Overall, very good execution by our team in these strategic levers.
At our investor meeting in December, we announced plans to better optimize our capital structure. These plans will
reduce our total cost of capital, allow us to further expand the company, and enable even higher returns to our
shareholders. Organic growth remains key to our plans, so we will continue to invest in CapEx and research and
development. And we are planning to invest $5 billion to $10 billion in acquisitions through 2017, with more possible
given the right strategic opportunity. We also announced in December a 35% increase to our first quarter 2014
dividend, along with a stronger commitment to share repurchases. Over the 2013 to 2017 planning period, we expect
gross share repurchases of $17 billion to $22 billion versus the prior expected range of $7.5 billion to $15 billion. This
more aggressive deployment of capital reflects the strength of our business model and our confidence in 3M's future.
Now I will review financial highlights from 2013. Please turn to slide 4. For the year, sales were nearly $31 billion, up
3.2% in dollar terms. Organic local currency growth was 3.4%, led by Health Care and Industrial at 5% and Safety and
Graphics at 4%. Geographically, we posted positive organic growth in all regions. Latin America/Canada led the way,
with organic growth of 7%; Asia Pacific rose 4%; the United States was up 3%; and Europe/Middle East/Africa was up
2%. Currency impacts reduced worldwide sales by 1.6%, and acquisitions added 1.4% to sales growth for the year.
Operating margins remained strong at 21.6% or 21.9% excluding acquisitions. Four of our five business groups
delivered margins above 21%, evidence of continued broad-based effectiveness and efficiency. Earnings were $6.72
per share, up 6.3% year over year. We returned a record $6.9 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends and
share repurchases. Finally, free cash flow conversion was 89%, with return on invested capital at 20%. Overall, I'm
very pleased with our 2013 results. We delivered good, broad-based performance while investing and building for
long-term success.
Let me now review the outlook. Please turn to slide 5. We described our 2014 planning estimates in detail at our
December investor meeting, and we are maintaining those estimates today. We expect 2014 earnings per share in the
range of $7.30 to $7.55 and organic local currency growth of plus 3% to plus 6%. Foreign currency translation is
expected to be neutral to minus 1%, and we anticipate a tax rate of 28% to 29%, with free cash flow conversion of 90%
to 100%.
I'll now turn the call over to David Meline for the detail on the fourth quarter results. David?

David W. Meline
Thank you, Inge. I'll begin by reviewing the fourth quarter sales growth. Please turn to slide number 6. Organic local
currency growth was 3.4% in the fourth quarter, including organic volume growth of 2% and selling price increases of
1.4%. Price increases have been positive in 2013 for a couple of reasons. First, investment in research and development
continues to support a strong price/value equation in many of the markets that we serve. And, second, we adjust selling
prices to offset currency devaluations in certain developing countries, which has been the case in 2013.
Acquisitions added 0.7 points to sales growth in the quarter, all due to Ceradyne in our Industrial business group. We
acquired Ceradyne in late November of 2012, so we are now past the one-year mark. And, beginning with December
reporting, we no longer report Ceradyne sales as acquisitions.
Foreign exchange impacts reduced sales by 1.7 percentage points in the fourth quarter. Currency impacts were negative
6% in Latin America/Canada and negative 5% in Asia Pacific, while EMEA had a positive 3% currency impact year on
year. On a total U.S. dollar basis, sales rose 2.4% versus the fourth quarter of 2012.
Looking geographically, local currency sales growth was 4.5% in the United States, the highest of any region during
the quarter. All business groups grew organically in the U.S., with particular strength in Industrial and in Safety and
Graphics.
Organic sales growth in EMEA was 3.4% in the fourth quarter. West Europe in particular grew by 3%, continuing the
positive trends we have seen in recent quarters. And Germany, the largest of our West Europe subsidiaries, grew a solid
8% organically. All businesses posted positive organic growth in EMEA, led by Industrial.
Asia Pacific grew 3.3% organically in the fourth quarter, with Consumer, Health Care, and Safety and Graphics leading
the way. Industrial also posted positive organic growth in the fourth quarter within APAC, and Electronics and Energy
grew just slightly. Japan continued to grow nicely, with 4% organic growth year on year. China/Hong Kong grew 1%
organically versus a tough prior-year comp of 16% plus in the fourth quarter of 2012. Excluding Electronics,
China/Hong Kong grew more than 6% organically in Q4.
Organic local currency sales growth was 2.2% in Latin America/Canada during the fourth quarter, which was below
recent trend levels for a few reasons. One, we saw some slowing in government tenders for infrastructure projects in
certain countries, which impacted sales in our Electronics and Energy business. Consumer was also soft in Q4 due to
weak retail demand and challenging year-on-year comps. And, lastly, sales in Venezuela declined year on year due to
economic and the political situation there. Venezuela diluted fourth quarter organic growth in Latin America/Canada by
1.5 percentage points, and we continue to work towards minimizing our bolívar exposure and any associated costs.
Organic local currency growth was 4% across all developing markets and 3% in developed markets.
Let's turn to slide number 7 for a discussion of the fourth quarter income statement. Sales for the fourth quarter were
$7.6 billion, an increase of 2.4% in dollar terms. Gross profit rose 5.8% to $3.6 billion, and gross margins rose by a
solid 1.5 percentage points to 47.5%. SG&A spending increased in line with sales growth, and R&D as a percent of
sales rose by 10 basis points to 5.8%. Operating income increased nearly 10% versus the fourth quarter of 2012. GAAP
operating margins were 20.9%, up 140 basis points year on year. Organic volume growth added 20 basis points to
margins, and the combination of lower raw material costs and higher selling prices contributed a positive 160 basis
points year on year.
Fourth quarter margins improved year on year in our recently acquired Ceradyne business, which added 30 basis points
to total company operating margins in Q4. We expect further margin improvement in 2014 for this business. Strategic
investments reduced margins by 70 basis points year on year. This represents incremental investments in disruptive
R&D, ERP, and various restructuring actions. Lower year-on-year pension and OPEB expense boosted fourth quarter
margins by 30 basis points, while foreign exchange impacts reduced margins by 40 basis points.
Fourth quarter earnings increased 15% to $1.62 per share. Average diluted shares outstanding declined 3% year on
year, which added $0.05 to EPS, and currency impacts hurt fourth quarter earnings per share by approximately $0.04.
The fourth quarter concluded a good year for the company, and the 3M team is energized and confident as we begin

2014.
Now let's turn to cash flow. Please turn to slide number 8. We generated $2 billion of operating cash flow in the
quarter, up $255 million versus last year's fourth quarter. Higher net income and lower pension contributions were the
primary drivers of this improvement. Capital expenditures were $543 million, an increase of $36 million. Looking
ahead to 2014, we continue to expect full-year CapEx will be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion. Fourth quarter
free cash flow was $1.5 billion, up $219 million year on year. And we converted 131% of net income to cash versus
124% in last year's comparable quarter.
For the full year 2013, free cash flow was $4.2 billion, and conversion was 89%. We paid $423 million in cash
dividends during the quarter, or $1.7 billion year to date. And, as Inge mentioned, in December we announced a 35%
increase in our first quarter 2014 dividend. Gross share repurchases were $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter and $5.2
billion for the full year. For 2014, we expect full-year gross share repurchases will be in the range of $3 billion to $5
billion. In total, we returned $2.1 billion in cash to shareholders in the fourth quarter, or $6.9 billion for the full year.
Both are all-time-record levels for 3M.
Net debt at year-end 2013 increased $900 million year on year and $300 million sequentially. As I mentioned at our
December investor meeting, we expect to add leverage of $2 billion to $4 billion in 2014 as we continue to improve the
efficiency of our capital structure. During the fourth quarter, 3M issued an eight-year euro bond yielding less than 2%.
The face amount was €600 million or US$815 million.
Let's now review our fourth quarter performance on a business-by-business basis. Please go to slide number 9. Our
Industrial business had another strong quarter, with sales of $2.6 billion and 6% organic local currency growth. Our
advanced materials and automotive OEM businesses generated double-digit organic growth, and we also posted good
growth in 3M Purification, aerospace, and automotive aftermarket. Organic local currency sales increased in all
geographic regions, led by the U.S. at 8%. EMEA grew 6% in Q4, including more than 10% in Germany. Organic
growth was 3% in both Asia Pacific and in Latin America/Canada.
The Ceradyne acquisition added 2% to Industrial's growth in the quarter. Fourth quarter operating income was $553
million, up 14% year on year, and operating margins increased 150 basis points to 21.5%. Volume leverage, positive
selling prices, and good productivity contributed to the improvement. Our Industrial business had an outstanding year
in 2013. Organic sales growth accelerated in the second half of the year versus the first, and sales exceeded $10 billion
for the first time ever. Nice performance by the Industrial team.
Please turn to slide number 10. Our Health Care business generated sales of $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter. Sales rose
4% in organic local currency terms, with the strongest growth in health information systems, food safety, and critical
and chronic care. Drug delivery systems declined in the quarter. All geographic regions generated positive organic local
currency sales growth, with Asia Pacific up 6%, Latin America/Canada up 5%, and EMEA and the U.S. each up 3% in
the quarter. In developing markets, Health Care grew 10% organically in the fourth quarter. This has been an area of
strategic investment priority for some time, and we are encouraged to see consistently strong organic growth as a result.
Fourth quarter operating income in Health Care was $425 million. Operating margins were 31.2%, which was very
much in line with full year. Fourth quarter margins were down a point year on year against a strong comp in Q4 of
2012. The recently enacted U.S. medical device tax was a contributing factor.
Please go to slide number 11. Safety and Graphics had a solid fourth quarter, with 5% organic local currency sales
growth and 16% growth in operating income. Organic growth was broad-based, with nearly all businesses posting
positive growth. Personal safety, by far our largest business within Safety and Graphics, generated high-single digit
organic growth in Q4. We also posted good growth in roofing granules, commercial graphics, and architectural
markets. Sales in Safety and Graphics grew organically in all major geographic regions, with Latin America/Canada up
8%, Asia Pacific and the U.S. up 6%, and EMEA up 1%. Operating income increased 16% to $256 million, and
margins rose 2.2 percentage points to 19.1%. Profits benefited from volume leverage, price performance, and solid
productivity.

Now let's look at Electronics and Energy, found on slide 12. Fourth quarter sales in this business were $1.3 billion, up
0.4% in organic local currency terms, and operating income rose 1% to $221 million. Margins were 16.7%, up 40 basis
points versus last year's fourth quarter. I mentioned in our October earnings call that we expected sales and earnings for
Electronics and Energy to be very close to last year's levels, and in fact that is what happened. Electronics-related sales
declined 2% on an organic local currency basis, with positive growth in optical films offset by declines in other
businesses. In our Energy-related businesses, sales increased 2% organically, led by our electrical markets and
renewable energy businesses. On a geographic basis, organic local currency sales increased 2% in EMEA and the
United States, Asia Pacific rose slightly, and Latin America/Canada was down year on year. Despite challenging end
market conditions, the Electronics and Energy team executed very well in 2013. Second-half organic growth rates were
stronger than the first, as were operating margins. It was a good result in a tough market.
Finally, let's review the Consumer business, found on slide number 13. Sales in the Consumer business group were
$1.1 billion, with organic local currency growth of 1.3%. Recall that in the fourth quarter of 2012, Consumer generated
9% organic local currency growth, so the comp here was quite challenging. Organic sales growth was strongest in our
consumer health care and home care businesses, and we also had a positive organic growth in DIY. Sales declined
slightly in stationery and office supplies, impacted by continued consolidation trends in the office retail and wholesale
market. On the positive side, we recently launched a new line of Command adhesive products for outdoor use, which
contributed nicely to fourth quarter growth.
The U.S. retail shopping season is an important factor for the Consumer business, and we would characterize this year's
season as okay but not strong. Fewer shopping days due to the late Thanksgiving holiday were a factor for most major
U.S. retailers and for their suppliers. On a geographic basis, sales in organic local currencies increased 9% in Asia
Pacific and rose slightly in both the U.S. and EMEA. Latin America/Canada declined 6% year on year. Operating
income was $226 million, with operating margins of 20.4%.
That concludes my comments regarding 3M's fourth quarter business results. I'll turn now the call back to Inge.
Inge G. Thulin
Thank you, David. To summarize, Q4 was a strong finish to a very successful year for 3M. In 2013, we achieved good
growth and solid profitability while advancing our strategic initiatives and investments. Perhaps most importantly, we
came out of 2013 stronger than we entered it, with both sales and earnings growth accelerating in the second half of the
year versus the first. 2013 results provided further proof that our strategies are gaining traction and driving our
performance to higher levels. I can think of numerous examples that illustrate this, but I will highlight just a couple.
Let's start with our US$1.4 billion automotive OEM business, which in 2013 grew 7% organically, more than twice the
rate of global auto production. We achieved this result through improved customer relevance, leveraging 3M's vast
technology capability to solve problems for this important group of OEM customers. This business grew significantly
in Q4 in developing markets like China, Mexico, and Indonesia by offering relevant solutions to these rapidly growing
markets. Another example is our Safety and Graphics business group, which saw margins expand by more than 2 points
in the fourth quarter. This improvement is due to part to several recent portfolio actions, which have resulted in
improved customer relevance, greater scale, and reduced cost. We also saw improved profitability on recent
acquisitions in this business. These are just two powerful examples of many that illustrate how the strategies are
pushing 3M's performance to a new level.
In closing, I want to recognize the people of 3M for their many contributions that continued our success as a company.
We have great confidence and good momentum as we enter 2014. Our team are focused on executing our plan and
creating even greater value for our customers and our shareholders. Thank you for your attention this morning, and we
will now take your questions.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with
your question.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Thank you, and good morning, everyone.
<A - David W. Meline>: Morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Morning, Joe.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: So my first question's really on the organic growth trajectory. It seems like you're exiting the
year pretty strongly in industrial and in Safety and Graphics but still some weakness there in Electronics and Energy.
And so I was wondering if you could just provide some context and color as it relates to the guidance that you have for
2014. Because the ranges across your segments tend to be pretty consistent, and so whether you have more or less
confidence in any of the segments as you're building into 2014.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, first of all, we hold to our guidance of 3% to 6% for the year, and you're right. We are
coming out strong of the year, right? So if we look upon our performance in between Q3 and Q4 and add that together
for the second part of the year, we had a very good second part of the year. So we feel good about that.
In terms of businesses, you can see that we have had very good tick up in Industrial as of lately, and we feel very
confident of that business in that range, which is 3% to 6%. The same for Health Care. Health Care is continuing to
grow well for us, and specifically as you have seen in the developing economies. And, again, we had in this quarter a
10% growth in that part of the world. And we have a very strong platform in the developed world, right? So we feel
confident around that.
I would say the other businesses are right in the middle of the range. We don't see any indication at this point in time of
going outside the range. Again, as we now, Electronics and Energy is very much based in the electronics space based
on the market, right? And, as you know, that is what we are following. And if that's a little bit slower, that will impact
us of course, but it can turn around relatively fast. So from that perspective, the 2% to 6% guidance we have there, we
feel confident with that, so no change at this point in time.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: Okay. Thanks, Inge. That's helpful color. And I guess my one follow-up question is really –
and, David, maybe -
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: The 2% to 6% range is for Electronics and Energy. It's 3% to 6% for the company.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: That's right.
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: No, no, that's right. And I guess my one follow-up question is really for David. I know that
you haven't made any changes to guidance. At the outlook meeting, you provided us with a 2014 earnings bridge. I was
wondering if there were any changes to any of the sub-buckets. And, specifically, perhaps you can provide some color
on the pension number, which was a pretty wide range at $0.10 to $0.20.
<A - David W. Meline>: Sure. So if you look at that earnings bridge, the answer would be right now, we don't see any
changes to the bridge, the elements. If you were to think about where we're monitoring at the top or the bottom of those
ranges, first on pension, we come in now with a confirmed year-over-year decrease in expense of $150 million or $0.15
a share, so right in the middle of that range we'd provided. And what I would say right now is the other area that we're
monitoring, we said zero to $0.05 on foreign exchange, and if there's anything that – if I marked that to market today, it
would be certainly towards the lower end of that $0.05 headwind versus the range right now, versus as we saw it a
couple months ago. So, otherwise, we think we're looking fine in terms of the other elements.
<Q - Joseph A. Ritchie>: And just to clarify, the lower end of that range, so you think the FX headwind is going to be
closer to zero?

Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Scott Davis of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, David.
<A - David W. Meline>: Good morning.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Congrats on a good 2013. Inge, you mentioned M&A in your prepared remarks, and can you
talk through – you put out a pretty big number as a target of potential deals. I mean, can you talk through your
confidence in deals, maybe the timing, the types of things you're looking at? Obviously can't name names, but I think if
I look back at the years of 3M, it's been hard to really – there hasn't been a lot of consistency to the M&A effort. So if
you'd just give us a little sense of what you're looking at there.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah. Well, first of all, as you know, we have been working for the last 18 months to clarify the
position of our businesses relative to our portfolio. And I think that's an important starting point relative to
understanding of where we try to go. So if you think about Heartland and Push Forward, of course places for us that are
interesting in order to build out, not only in terms of research and development but potential acquisitions. So I think if
you think about it from that perspective, we will likely look upon businesses that will either strengthen our very strong
position for the Heartland divisions, and/or accelerate growth in Push Forwards. So, by definition, we're looking for
many elements, as you know, relative to acquisition candidates, but think about it in those categories.
Now, there can always be an exception to the rule, and if you have businesses where we really need to boost up our
performance or build out and build more relevance, we will do that as well, right? And I think if you go back and think
about FSTech that we did, it was into the traffic safety system that by definition not is either Heartland or Push Forward
but was important for us to make that acquisition in order to build out the relevance in that market. So that's the way –
think about it in that way versus think about as business groups, right? [ph] We're interesting everywhere, but I think
(33:26) it's from a market perspective in order to move the company forward.
Now, the pipeline is good for us. We have – as I said, we have laid on a little bit of – we have always had a process of
bottom-up. We [ph] have type of (33:38) laid on a top-down approach as well in order to make sure that we do not miss
out on potentials that go across business groups in terms of potential. Where we have talked about size of potential
acquisitions, I think that's a couple of things. We have built out now a very competent group relative to integration,
because one of the things that is important for us is to integrate the acquisitions as fast as possible and get the benefit
for you and for us in terms of return of the investment. Now, we will not go crazy if it doesn't. We have done
acquisitions in the past that have been on very small to mid-size, and we will really evaluate huge, huge acquisitions in
terms of strategic importance. So I think you will see acquisitions in mid-range as well as we go ahead here. In terms of
timing, as you know, it's very difficult to comment on timing. In some cases it will take some time, and we are very
careful as we do this, as you know.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, obviously 3M is focused on R&D – has been
important and goes back a long ways. But something seems to have changed since you've taken over, Inge. It seems
like the R&D focus may be yielding more results. If you just look across where the growth rates have been higher, it's
been generally the more, I would say, R&D-intensive businesses have been outgrowing the markets the most. I mean,
what have you specifically changed that's yielded that acceleration in new products?

<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, first of all, this is not about me. This is about a very dedicated 3M team. So it's not about
me. The credit should go to the business groups and the divisions and the subsidiaries. But I think that what I'm doing,
I'm encouraged them, really, to make sure that they understand the business model in terms of us being able to create
more value for our customers, because that is the heartbeat for us in terms of making sure that we maintain and
eventually improve margins and the return on the business. So I think there is reviews, the whole way up to me, relative
to how we're doing and also try to encourage to help them if there is some project that is maybe more difficult for them
to pull off based on the current situation.
So it's a little bit this of running a business with glasses on, with one microscope on one side and a telescope on the
other side of the glasses, right? And I think that's important for us to do. So we feel good about it. We are very
committed to research and development. It is, by definition, a real value creator for 3M. And if you think about it, we
are, in terms of technologies, we are a creator and builder of technologies, and we're also a user. But in addition to that,
other companies can use the technologies. So that's the difference for us. We create and we develop the technologies,
and in many cases we're using it. But other companies, we can help them a lot, for them to be more competitive by
using our technologies, and that is the strength of 3M.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. I think I did a lousy job of asking the question. I think what I was meaning to say is have
you made any change at all from focusing the efforts on disruptive technologies versus extensions?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yes, we have. Yes, we have. And that additional – as you know, when we try to go from
historically 5.5% closer to 6%, and you saw we made a small improvement on that. Specifically this quarter, we moved
again. That additional investment is all into disruptive technologies for the future. So that's an important – thank you
for that question. It's a very important piece.
<Q - Scott R. Davis>: Okay. Thank you, guys.

Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Obin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your
question.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Yes. Good morning, guys.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Andrew.
<A - David W. Meline>: Good morning.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: Hi. Just to dig in a little bit into what's happening in the emerging markets and I guess
specifically in South America. It went from being the fastest growth market to the slowest growth market. How much
of a surprise was it, what happened in the quarter? And how are you sort of monitoring the developments there to make
sure that it stays under control?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Let me start on the front end of the business. First of all, there was a slight slowdown in the
economies down there, and we saw that, as David said in his speech here earlier, it was specifically around consumer
confidence that impacted our Consumer business. And then it was very much on, I would say, government-related
businesses specifically into utility businesses, where we have a strong position. So I think that – and that was
broad-based for us. So the economy slowed. And, as you know, there is a big business around mining in that part of the
world. So that impacted us, and I would say, I don't know, you will always be a little bit surprised when you're not
growing as fast as in the past because you will do that. But, generally speaking, we had a good feeling of what is
happening in that part of the world. In terms of risks, as we talked about Venezuela, it's – David will make some
comment here relative as to how we are managing and monitoring that.

<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah, thank you, Andrew. So I think picking up on Inge's comments, if you think about the
guidance we provided in December, we indicated we think that this year will grow 8% to 11% in the region. So a little
bit off of where we have been in the last couple of years, but still elevated. And I would say, today, as we look at that,
probably we're thinking about it more along the lines of the low end of that range of 8% to 11%. And specifically it
relates to what Inge said: We've got some sectors in which we saw some slowing. We don't necessarily think that's
going to remain slow all through 2014, but we have to take that into account.
And then I think in particular we saw what's going on now, a very fluid situation is developing, in particular in
Venezuela, and at some level in Argentina as well. And so if you look at our business, we've got about – each of those
countries our business is a little less than $200 million of revenue in each of the two countries. We've been in them for
many decades, so we have very capable local management, and we have a good position in those markets. But,
inevitably, it does create both some risk in terms of our revenue growth in 2014, as well as financial risk. So – and
that's something that we monitor very carefully and we manage carefully, given the volatility that we have in those
markets and others.
So if you look, for example, today in Venezuela, which is what we've called out as the most significant of our risks, we
run the business on a local basis. The net monetary asset position of the balance sheet is basically flat, so that gives us a
very good position in terms of addressing any risks that might occur. But we also have a $40 million receivable sitting
at parent from the subsidiary on imported goods, and that's something that we're watching and managing quite
carefully, because we do recognize that there's risk there that we're going to have to manage through.
So I would say nothing that's material for the corporation, but it's certainly something that we're very carefully
monitoring and reacting to so that we can manage that risk, which is really a conversion risk. And, of course, you see in
our results overall very strong pricing in the emerging markets, which is the other component of how we manage the
risk of these countries. So we feel good about our ability to manage risk but, as I say, we're also very cognizant of the
fact that we need to be proactive as well.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: And the other side of the coin, the Health Care, you have very high-margin, high-growth
business in emerging markets part of the strategy. Did very well in terms of top line growth. Could you just give us a
sense, how connected is this business to FX fluctuations? Or is it fairly shielded? Just in terms of how the business
works in emerging markets? How should we think about it?
<A - David W. Meline>: Sure. Yeah, no, it's a good question. So I would say that you start – in terms of FX risk, you
have to think first about the overall risk profile that we have as a company, and Health Care is part of that. So we hedge
on a rolling basis 50% of our exposures, which covers all of our business flows and our inter-company exchange
fluctuation. So that applies to Health Care as with the other sectors of the business, so that's an important element that
enables us to manage the risk.
And then the second piece is obviously through time, the best way to manage foreign exchange risk is to have a
balanced footprint of exposure structurally. So that's one of the reasons why we continue to localize the production of
our products into the countries where we sell, which gives us a balanced foreign exchange risk profile. And, I think as
you know, we've been working hard to both grow Health Care and as part of that strategy to localize production, which
helps us to have a good profile to have local production, local R&D, which is closer to the customers, but it also gives
us a better risk profile from a foreign exchange perspective. So I would say Health Care I don't view as something with,
if you will, outsize risk compared to the other sectors in our business.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: I guess what I was trying to say – just let me just explain -
<A - David W. Meline>: Sure.
<Q - Andrew Obin>: – is Health Care spending in emerging markets, do you feel it's stickier versus Consumer
spending? It was sort of a simpler question, I think.
<A - David W. Meline>: Okay.

Page 10 of 17
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, I think it's – as I've said earlier, in order for you to build out your business in a way, you
will be able to move Health Care faster, in a way, than the Consumer – I mean, you're talking about developing
economies – due to the fact that there's many drivers there in terms of key opinion leaders that try to get to a service
level and an outcome around Health Care that is very strong. Versus you think about Consumer, which is very much a
retail brand equity driven, which take you longer time, in a way, to change the mind-set of people to go from one brand
to the other. So, generally speaking, I would say that in the model that I've showed you multiple times now in terms of
how developing economies are evolving from manufacturing to infrastructure to safety to retail consumer, in the end,
health care. Often health care can come earlier due to that element. And in health care, generally speaking, in fact,
dental and orthodontic is coming faster than the big health care business.
So, for us, it's a good model. We have still huge opportunities there. And we're very pleased of the growth we see that
is now coming based on some strategic investment we did – started a couple of years ago, actually, in order to build up
that business.

Our next question comes from the line of David Begleiter of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - David W. Meline>: Good morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, David.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Inge, very good margin performance in Safety and Graphics. What type of operating
leverage would you look for in Safety in 2014 over the course of the year?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, I would say, first of all, thank you for the compliment relative to the improvements of the
margin. And I think one of the reasons there is that some consolidation that was done of the businesses. So as we move
ahead into next year, we are basically looking for the same leverage into 2014 specifically in that business. So I don't
see us as any huge change for us. I think we're on the level now that is, in the end of it, very competitive for us.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Understood. And just a follow-up on Asia. Volume growth did slow. Was it all due to the
tough comp in Electronics, or was there some slowing in end market activity as well?
<A - David W. Meline>: Generally, the Asia performance was in line with where we've seen it growing through the
year. And as we called out, I'd say a couple areas that slowed – one was in China, and that was most particularly related
to the underlying Electronics business. If you look at, the base business, excluding Electronics, grew at 6% in China.
And then if you look at our performance in Japan which is the other most significant business we have in Asia, we
grew quite strongly, 4% overall, but we were double digit in the industrial areas. So it's – I would say, David, most
specifically we see it linked to the Electronics performance in Q4.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Continued very strong growth in Consumer and Health Care businesses.
<A - David W. Meline>: Yep. Yep.

<A - David W. Meline>: Good morning.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning, Steven.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Could you just start with inventory impacts, in terms of – distribution is obviously
important. Were you seeing any kind of stocking increases, decreases? How should we think about that?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Generally speaking this quarter, no change, right? We didn't see anything. We didn't see
anything of – either on the Industrial, general Industrial or specifically, as you know, we could be more concerned
around consumer electronics. We didn't see any change there. And the other thing is around retail. I think retail we're
very stable as well. And, as you know, they [ph] are (48:52) manage it very, very carefully. So I would say we don't see
anything there in terms of change, and it's not a concern for us as we're sitting here now.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay. So all that U.S. growth is sort of core customer growth, then, on the manufacturer
side in Industrial?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Yeah, correct. Yeah. In U.S., we had a very strong growth in the whole Industrial space, right,
which then had a very good impact for many of our businesses generally speaking, right, in the Industrial space. So you
have the whole Industrial business grew, but you have also Safety and Graphics with the – all the Personal Safety
business are doing very well in an environment like that. So that was good for us. So Industrial in U.S. in the quarter,
Industrial business you have 8% growth. And Safety and Graphic had 6% growth. And then it was a little bit slower in
the Consumer and Health Care in United States at the end at this quarter.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Okay. And maybe just one more on pricing. So 1.4%, again, very strong, making up, as
you mentioned, for this combination of currency devals elsewhere, as well as sort of just core R&D supporting margin.
But maybe – can you give us an idea again of, of that 3% to 6% growth in 2014, how much of that are you anticipating
to be volume versus price? And do you think that – is your ability to keep up with continued currency moves with
price, any issues on that front as you look forward?
<A - David W. Meline>: Sure.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Or we shouldn't just sort of count on those two offsetting each other?
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah, no, it's a good question. So, as we looked at it in the fourth quarter and set out the
guidance, our thinking has been that that is primarily volume that we'll look for in 2014 on the top end, on the revenue
line. But obviously – so, in other words, we expect price to be declining through the calendar year as we step through
the quarters. Now, that would change, and it goes back to the view, to the extent we see weaker foreign exchange occur
in certain of the countries where we operate, certainly we'll have to look at the actions that we need to take to preserve
our position in the market and our ability to remain competitive. But certainly our experience – most recently in 2013,
but you can look over a longer period of time – is, as long as we continue to offer a very strong price/value equation to
the customers, we're able to address that through price as we need to. So I think we feel comfortable that we can do
what's necessary to maintain that relationship.
<A - Matthew Ginter>: Hey, Steve, it's Matt.
<Q - Steven E. Winoker>: Great, thank you.
<A - Matthew Ginter>: Just to clarify one thing: Prices will be positive on the year, but the positive impact should
moderate as the quarters go on.
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah, yeah, sorry. Yeah.

Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray of Citi Research. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Good morning.
<A - David W. Meline>: Good morning, Deane.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Hey, first question for David on corporate expense. You had highlighted that that would come
in lower, and it did come in lower. And you said that there would be some ERP expenses that would be shifted to the
segments, but it still came in lower than what we were looking for. So is there anything else going on in corporate, and
what should be the run rate for that over the course of 2014?
<A - David W. Meline>: Right. 2014. Yeah, so the corporate expense line, it came in a little bit lower in the fourth
quarter. And, frankly, there are ups and downs there based on closing out accruals on a quarterly basis or one-off
events. So I would say nothing that I would point to that was of a particularly headline and unusual nature in Q4. If I
look forward into 2014, we expect that the corporate expense line is going to come in for the year somewhere in the
range of $200 million to $250 million versus I think it was $320 million in 2013. And the majority of that, you can
largely attribute that to the declining pension expense. So we'll pick up about two-thirds of the $150 million pension
expense decline I mentioned will show up in that corporate line. Hence a reduction year over year of that magnitude.
And, again, it bounces around quarter to quarter, but generally speaking, I think you can pencil that in throughout 2014.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: Good. That's real helpful. And then, David, I know you guys are not in the quarterly guidance
business, but for the first quarter, would you want to call anything out that would be unique seasonally?
<A - David W. Meline>: Sure.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: And as for seasonal, I mean both calendar and as well as weather -
<A - David W. Meline>: Okay.
<Q - Deane M. Dray>: – that might be a factor that we should be considering, any one-timers.
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah, if you look at the business through the year, what I would say is that we consider most
of the factors, whether that be at the top line, whether it be expense elements, we think that it'll be pretty steady through
the year and follow more typical seasonal patterns. So obviously first and fourth quarter typically have the lowest
revenue, but that'll be the case as we see. The couple of exceptions I would offer – one is one we already talked about,
which is we do expect through the year to see some declining contribution of the price in raw materials as we move
through the year, so positive but declining.
Secondly, we had called out in December, and that continues to be our intent, which is both the incremental investment
we're making in our European Centre of Expertise on a year-over-year basis, as well as some restructuring actions that
we have been looking at primarily in Europe and the U.S. The sum of those would be about $20 million to $30 million
of additional expenses, which are comprehended – there's the strategic investment line – but you can see that it will be
somewhat front-loaded for the year into Q1.
And then the final point I would make on this is the one I talked about already, which is, with what's happening in the
markets globally right now, we're monitoring carefully developments in some of the emerging markets with a specific
focus on Venezuela, because I think there's some discernible risk there, some event risk, which looks like may
materialize as soon Q1.

Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.
<Q - Laurence Alexander>: Two quick ones. On your comment about the slightly weaker trend in infrastructure
markets, are you seeing any signs of that bottoming out? And, secondly, with respect to the emerging market volatility
or credit risk that may be developing there, is that an opportunity for you to further gain share because of your
relatively low cost of borrowing and access to finance? Or do you think that that won't really have a material impact on
your relative share position?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: On the first question, I think that in terms of the infrastructure specifically, for us, it was related
specifically to utilities and government businesses in one part of the world, and it's also related to the mining industry
there. We see that easing up as we go into 2014. So it's not overly a concern for us.
In terms of emerging markets – and so let me give a perspective on developing and emerging markets. We have been in
the developing world for many years. So think about 3M. We started to do business outside of United States in the
1920s. And, in fact, we have done business in BRIC, in Brazil – we were 1946. So we have been for a long time in that
part of the world. And the strengths for 3M based on the history is that we have learned a lot. So we know how to
monitor situations like this. And in developing economies, there will always be some type of bump in the road as you
go. Now we have a very good point to say that when that is happening – and we have not only seen it, we have lived it
many times over the year, and not only in the organization but me personally and David Meline as well, as we have
lived in some of those countries, so we have seen it and we have worked in those environments. The strength for 3M
when this is happening is we are never going back. We continue to stay, but we are adjusting our organization.
And we are in all cases, I would say, from an historical perspective, we are coming out stronger when it's done. And the
reason for that is we right-size the organization, we stay, continue our local connections, and we help the customers that
are still there. Because when it turn again, because it will turn up, we are there with them. So in all cases what have
happened for us is that, in a case when you come in a turmoil like this, we are coming out stronger due to the fact that
we stayed. And I think that is an important element to know. So we are very local in the countries, but we have very
strong, centralized team with experiences that can help out in terms of making sure that processes is right even on the
financial side. And David will make some comments relative to that.
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: But it's actually – for us, it's – it's not a good thing generally speaking, but we're coming out
stronger after a turbulence like that.
<A - David W. Meline>: No. And you're right, Laurence. We try to maintain a conservative posture from a
risk-management perspective, and we do enjoy the benefit, as do other large, well-managed multinationals, of having
good access to credit, having the ability to assess credit risk, and so, exactly. While it can be bumpy at the front end, if
you basically keep your head down and remain calm and have a playbook, as we do, typically we can be advantaged as
you see things start to turn around.

<Q - Ajay Kejriwal>: So maybe on Health Care margins, you talked about the medical device tax impact. Maybe any
comment on what you saw in drug delivery systems, the trends there and any impact on margins from that business?
And then also I know in the past, David, you've talked about flexibility in that business in terms of how you manage
margins and spending relative to top line. So if you can comment on how we should think about margins in 2014 for
Health Care?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, as you asked specifically about DDSD, that is very much a project-based business, right?
So we are selling R&D to other companies, and we are also selling products. So that's a business that can move a little
bit in terms of quarter by quarter. So there was nothing happened there that is unusual, meaning we lost business or
something like that, so it's a strong business for us. In fact, we have extended some of the bigger contracts have now
been extended. So as we look ahead for that business it's a very solid, very good business for us, and we're very pleased
with that. So look upon that as there's always a start and a beginning to a quarter, and this quarter based on the contracts
and project we're working with, this is how it came out. So I wouldn't like you to be overly concerned about that
business. In terms of Health Care, generally speaking, in terms of the margins, David will make some comments
relative to that.
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah, so if you look, Ajay, if we look, I think it's – how it looks for us in 2014, I'd make a
couple comments and maybe just pick up a little bit of commentary on the overall trends. So Health Care we expect to
run in the low 30%'s through 2014. The Industrial, Safety and Graphics, and Consumer, we expect to run around, as has
been the case, around the company average. And if you look at Electronics and Energy this year, we ran in the high
teens last year, which is what we'd expected as we started the year. This year we see that trending towards – the high
teens towards 20%. So that's how we're looking at the overall view for the businesses. And I think the final point I'd
offer – I talked about the corporate line. There's about a 30 basis points year-over-year increase in the costs that we'll be
seeing in the businesses as it relates to our strategic initiatives around business transformation, the restructuring we've
talked about, and the innovation funding.
<Q - Ajay Kejriwal>: Got it. That's very helpful. And then maybe some color around stock repurchase or the range
you have, $3 billion to $5 billion? Maybe just conceptually, what would be the variables that drive that purchase near
the high end versus the low end?
<A - David W. Meline>: Sure. So, yeah. So if you look at that and just to kind of frame the commentary, so as we
announced in December, we made a decision as a company to adjust our capital structure to one that's more efficient.
So by definition that means increasing from a de minimis level the portion of our funding from borrowing, right? From
bond issuances and borrowing. And it means that we also have to, as a part of that, reduce the portion of the structure
that's coming from equity funding. So by definition that means we reduce the equity funding. We're going to do
buyback, we said, of $17 billion to $22 billion for the period. We then looked at the sources and uses to the best we're
able to predict them in the year, and we concluded that it looked to us, starting the year $3 billion to $5 billion at the
gross level looks like the right number for the company.
And, as I said in December, the way I think about that is that it's certainly something that's more discretionary than a
number, frankly, many other of the variables we manage from a sources and uses perspective, but it's our best view as
we start the year. And what we'll do then is we'll have a portion of that repurchase that we'll do on a steady basis
through the year. We also look and pay attention to intrinsic value to the price in the market of all assets, including the
one we're repurchasing here, and that impacts how we deploy capital into that area. So we'll adjust our share repurchase
through the year based on the overall view of the business and sources and uses, and we'll also adjust the repurchase
activity based on thinking about a core component as well as how the share price is looking as well.
<Q - Ajay Kejriwal>: Got it. Thank you very much.
<A - Matthew Ginter>: Thanks, Ajay.
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah.

Our next question comes from the line of Shannon O'Callaghan of Nomura Securities. Please proceed with your
questions.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Matthew Ginter>: Good morning, Shannon.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Morning.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Hey, David, just maybe if we could size this Latin America risk that you called out with
Venezuela and Argentina. So you said they're both less than $200 million of revenue each.
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: So, I mean, at the corporate average margin, you're talking about, sort of less than a
dime of EPS. I mean, is that the scope of the risk you're talking about, or is there more risk than that? I mean, could
things get worse than that in terms of losses or other impacts?
<A - David W. Meline>: Sure. Yeah, that's a good question, Shannon. So I don't see, right now, from what we can see,
and obviously it's pretty fluid, if I were to size that risk, I think there's event risk that could put the exposure from an
earnings perspective into the $0.03 to $0.04 a share range.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. Thanks. That helps.
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah.
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: And then the strength in Europe, right, I mean, you talk about Germany being very
strong broadly, I think, but also particularly in industrial. I mean, do you have a view in terms of how much of the
strength you're seeing in Europe is intrinsic to Europe versus related to export?
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Well, I think it's a mix, and I also think one of the things we have to think about here is just the
comparison, right? But, first of all, we see very good acceleration, specifically on the Industrial side, I would say both
in Germany and also even if a reporting issue, [ph] nothing we talk about West Europe, but (1:07:37) we also see that
in Poland, actually. So I think we see both West Europe being driven by manufacturing uptick, which I would say it's a
balance in between domestic production for Germany but also export for them. Of course, as you know, it's a big
automotive industry in Germany that are exporting quite a bit.
So I think we have still to be cautious about Europe, but it's a very positive trend, and if we look upon it for our side, in
West Europe, we had Q1 this year was a minus 3%, we're basically flat in Q2, we have a 3% growth in Q3, and another
3% in Q4. But I would say when I look upon it, when you get Germany from flat in the first half of the year to around
6%, and it was 8% in the last quarter, that's very encouraging for us. And, again, as I said, the businesses there for us
that had good growth was Industrial had 6% growth in West Europe. So it's encouraging for us, but we still have to be
cautious as we go into the year. And we are [ph] type of (1:08:59) looking upon next year for flat to 3% growth, right?
<Q - Shannon O'Callaghan>: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.
<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Thank you.

<A - Inge G. Thulin>: Hi. Good morning.
<Q - Drew A. Pierson>: I know we're running long. Just quickly, I don't know if you commented on the linearity of
the quarter. Is there anything interesting to call out in terms of month-to-month trends?
<A - David W. Meline>: Within the quarter, yeah, I would say nothing, Drew, that we'd want to point to that would be
unusual spikes up or down beyond what we've talked about more generally this morning.
<Q - Drew A. Pierson>: Yeah. And then on the price/cost side, I believe you mentioned the gradual closing of that gap
through the year. Just when we think about the components of that, I know you have your sourcing programs, I know
the raws have maybe ticked up very slightly, but maybe just a little bit more color around how to think about the
different factors and how they've progressed?
<A - David W. Meline>: Yeah, so if you look at the components of price and raw materials, so we talked about price
where we exited 2013 quite strong. We see that then moderating as we walk through the year towards a de minimis
level, right, but still slightly positive. And if you look at raw materials, what we indicated our outlook for the year was
another favorable $0.05 to $0.15 a share performance in 2014. We exited the year actually pretty stable with raw
material performance. So we were down a couple percentage points in 2013 through the year including Q4, and we see
that moderating somewhat as we move through the year. But there will be some carryover impact certainly as we enter
the first part of the year here.
<Q - Drew A. Pierson>: Okay. Thanks for the detail.
<A - Matthew Ginter>: Thanks, Drew.
<A - David W. Meline>: Sure.
