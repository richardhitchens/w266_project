Also on the call and available during the Q&A are Siggi Olafsson, President of Actavis Pharma; Fred Wilkinson,
President of Actavis Specialty Brands; Bob Stewart, President of Global Operations; and David Buchen, our Global
Chief Legal Officer.
Please note that today's call is copyrighted material of Actavis and cannot be rebroadcast without the company's

Actual results may differ materially from current projections – from current expectations and projections depending on
a number of factors affecting the Actavis business. These factors are detailed in our periodic public filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, including but not limited to, the Actavis, Inc. and Warner Chilcott Form 10-Ks
for the period ended December 31, 2012, and Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2013.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Paul.
Paul M. Bisaro
Thanks, Lisa, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to announce another strong quarter for Actavis driven by
strong growth across each of our three businesses. At the close of the quarter, we also completed the acquisition of
Warner Chilcott, which I will address later.
Turning to slide five, let's begin first with our financial results. Third quarter net revenues reflecting standalone Actavis
only increased 57% to just over $2 billion. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were up 55% to $2.09 and adjusted
EBITDA increased 61% to $489 million.
Our Actavis Pharma segment, shown on slide six, had another strong quarter highlighted by the U.S. launch of a
generic version of Lidoderm on September 15 and the generic version of Lynlor, Oxycodone capsules, for the UK
market in September.
We also continued to strengthen our pipeline announcing patent challenges on a number of products including first to
file opportunities on generic Nucynta ER and Suboxone Thin-Film.
For the nine months ended September 30, Actavis submitted 32 new filings in the U.S., 16 of which are potential
first-to-file opportunities. Globally, we launched 509 products and filed more than 980 market authorizations –
applications, over the same nine-month period.
Finally, integration of legacy Watson and legacy Actavis is now essentially complete and the annual run rate of
synergies is in line with our previously disclosed targets.
Turning to slide seven, in our Actavis Specialty Brands business, we experienced continued growth in key promoted
products including Rapaflo and Generess Fe. Generess Fe hit a milestone of over 100,000 total prescriptions.
Androderm 2 milligram and 4 milligram, Crinone 8% and Trelstar also showed growth over the third quarter of 2012.

We continued to expand our Women's Health pipeline with the acquisition of worldwide rights for albaconazole, a
novel, oral antifungal agent in development for the treatment of candidiasis. These rights were acquired from Palau
Pharma.
We also received approval in a number of countries for Levosert and we secured approval for Rapaflo in Brazil. We
continued to expand in North America with our Canadian launch of Fibristal, which is also known as Esmya.
We closed the acquisition of Warner Chilcott on October 1 and are now in the process of actively integrating Warner
Chilcott into our Specialty Brands business.
Turning now to slide eight, Warner Chilcott also had a strong third quarter and year-to-date performance. Warner
Chilcott posted revenue of $1.8 billion in the first nine months of 2013, and third quarter revenues of $601 million, a
decrease of 1% over the prior year period.
The oral contraceptives franchise posted 10% revenue growth for the first nine months of the year driven by strong
sales of Lo Loestrin Fe and recently launched Minastrin 24 Fe. The Estrace Cream revenue increased 13% over the first
nine months of 2012 and Doryx franchise revenue increased 40% over the same period driven by a successful launch of
Doryx 200 mg in July of this year.
In the GI franchise, Warner Chilcott successfully launched Delzicol and expanded Asacol HD. The franchise has
retained 90% of the revenue following the launch of Delzicol in March. As expected, Warner Chilcott's bisphosphonate
franchise decreased 24% in the first nine months of the year as the entire category continues to contract. Warner
Chilcott also received approval for Lo Loestrin in Canada with a launch planned in 2014.
I'll now turn the call over to Todd to take us through the third quarter financial results in more detail.
Robert Todd Joyce
Thanks, Paul. Turning to slide nine, I will now review our results on a consolidated and divisional basis for standalone
Actavis. GAAP net revenues for the third quarter were $2.013 billion, an increase of 57% over the prior year, reflecting
strong growth in all three of our business segments. Net revenues in our Actavis Pharma division was $1.552 billion, up
69% year-over-year as a result of the acquisition of legacy Actavis group and new product sales in key markets, offset
in part by the impact of competition on our authorized generic version of Concerta. Ex-U.S. net revenues were $609
million, up from $198 million in the third quarter of 2012, primarily due to the inclusion of legacy Actavis. Actavis
Pharma net revenues of $1.552 billion during the third quarter of 2013 consist of net revenues of $981 million in the
Americas, $487 million in Europe, which includes Medis, and $84 million in EMEA.
Actavis Pharma adjusted gross margin was 51.5%, primarily due to increased margins on our generic version of
Concerta, as a result of our contractual arrangement with Ortho-McNeil-Janssen, and sales of our Lidocaine Patch
products.
Turning to slide 10, Actavis Specialty Brands net revenues were $154 million, up 27% on higher sales of promoted
products, including Rapaflo and Generess Fe. GAAP R&D investment declined 17%. On a non-GAAP basis, R&D
investment is higher over prior year investment as a result of a number of pipeline products entering Phase III
development. Specialty Brands adjusted gross margin increased to 76.1%.
Turning to slide 11, net revenues from our Anda Distribution segment were $307 million, up 26%, driven by increased
sales of brand products and higher sales to chain customers. Anda's gross margin for the quarter was 13%, lower than
the prior year period due to increased sales of brand products in the quarter.
Turning to slide 12, consolidated operating expenses have increased significantly year-over-year as a result of the
addition of legacy Actavis. Consolidated GAAP research and development for the third quarter was $158.8 million, up
41% year-over-year.

Consolidated GAAP SG&A for the third quarter was $455.7 million, up 103% over the prior year. Amortization
expense for the third quarter was $146.3 million. On a non-GAAP basis, our income tax rate was 27.2% in the third
quarter, down from 33.8% in the prior year period as a result of the acquisition of the Actavis Group.
On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes amortization, acquisition-related impairment charges as well as other items
detailed in Table 4 of our earnings press release, earnings for the third quarter were $2.09 per diluted share, up 55%
year-over-year as a result of growth across our Actavis Pharma and Actavis Specialty Brands segments. Adjusted
EBITDA for the third quarter was $489 million compared to $305 million in the prior year as a result of the addition of
legacy Actavis and growth across the business.
Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was strong at $271 million and cash and marketable securities were
$374 million at the end of the third quarter.
Turning to slide 13, we began the fourth quarter in a favorable debt position with a leverage ratio on October 1, 2013
following the close of Warner Chilcott acquisition of approximately three times. Assuming no additional investments,
we expect it to be at or below approximately 2.8 pro forma leverage by year-end 2013. We also announced our
intentions to call our legacy Watson $450 million notes due in 2014, which will generate interest savings in the fourth
quarter and into next year.
With that, I'll turn the call back over to Paul for an update on our 2013 forecast and on expectations for 2014 and
concluding remarks.
Paul M. Bisaro
Thanks, Todd. Beginning on slide 15, as most of you know, our business now consists of Actavis Pharma, Actavis
Specialty Brands and Anda Distribution. These three groups are supported by an industry-leading global supply chain
and an exceptional shared service team. We believe that this model provides us with significant opportunities for
continued growth.
Moving to slide 16, with the addition of Warner Chilcott, Actavis Specialty Brands now has a strong combined
presence in four key therapeutic areas, women's health, urology, gastroenterology, and dermatology.
Turning to slide 17, we are actively integrating Warner Chilcott into the Actavis Specialty Brands business and
aggressively implementing defined integration activities.
We remain on track to achieve more than $400 million in after-tax operational and tax synergies and additional $50
million in pre-tax interest rate savings related to the replacement of $2 billion in Warner Chilcott term loans at the close
of the acquisition. We anticipate announcing additional updates related to our synergy progress including the future
sales force structure by the end of the year.
Turning to slide 18, following the close, we are in the process of actively evaluating all projects in the pipeline. We
may have the ability to accelerate some of the projects and have identified a few low-value projects from the combined
portfolio that we intend to eliminate. We anticipate providing you with an updated combined pipeline including these
changes at our Investor Day in January. We did, however, want to provide you with an update on some of the nearer
term and late-stage development opportunities that will impact the business over the next 12 to 18 months.
We have a December 27 PDUFA date for our Progestin Patch and anticipate launching that product in the second half
of 2014. Levosert is now approved in 11 countries and Actavis expects to launch in the UK in 2014. Our partner
Gedeon Richter is also expected to launch in its Central European territories around the same time. We expect to gain
European CE Mark approval for Diafert in early 2014 and 510-K clearance in the U.S. in the late – in late 2014. And
we look forward to publishing the data on Diafert following CE Mark approval.
The PDUFA date for Metronidazole Gel licensed from Valeant is March 2000 – March 24, 2014 and we expect to
launch the product immediately following FDA approval. We have several programs already in or about to enter Phase
III by the end of the year. Esmya, which we licensed in from Gedeon Richter, for uterine fibroids and Udenafil for

erectile dysfunction along with our biosimilar programs for rFSH, Herceptin, and Avastin.
Likewise, we expect our E4 combination oral contraceptive and sarecycline to enter Phase III development in 2014.
With the close of the Warner Chilcott transaction, we are updating our fourth quarter and full year 2013 forecast and
providing an initial 2014 outlook.
We plan to give a more detailed 2014 forecast early next year. Slide 20 provides the forecast for the fourth quarter,
including a full contribution of Warner Chilcott following the close on October 1. We now expect the combined
business to post non-GAAP earnings of between $2.95 and $3.05 per share for the fourth quarter with approximately
175 million shares outstanding.
On slide 21, we now expect 2013 revenue of approximately $8.6 billion, adjusted EBITDA of between $2.22 billion
and $2.24 billion, a full year fully diluted share count of approximately 144 million shares and full year 2013
non-GAAP earnings per share between $9.26 and $9.39.
Slide 22 provides our assumptions for 2014. Our forecast for the Actavis Pharma business assumes additional
competition on our generic extended release portfolio, generic oral contraceptives and generics for Concerta and
Lidoderm during the year.
We assume date certain launches for generic versions of Intuniv and OxyContin TR. We also include additional
undisclosed product launches and select risk-adjusted Paragraph IV opportunities. In terms of generic pricing, we
assume mid-single-digit price erosion in the U.S. and high-single-digit price erosion in markets outside the U.S.
Moving to slide 23, in our Specialty Brands business, we assume growth in key promoted products such as Delzicol, Lo
Loestrin, Minastrin, DORYX, ESTRACE Cream, Rapaflo and Generess Fe. In addition, we assume several key product
launches such as Lo Loestrin in Canada, our Progestin-Only Patch in the U.S., Diafert and Levosert in several markets,
and Metronidazole in the U.S.
We also expect continued significant declines in the Bisphosphonate business in 2014 with generics expected for
Actonel midyear. Our forecast also assumes the elimination of the co-promotion agreement for Actonel and Atelvia
with Sanofi in the U.S. market.
Turning now to slide 24, we expect non-GAAP EPS for full-year 2014 to be between $12.25 and $13 per share. This
assumes a full-year tax rate of between 16% and 18% and approximately 176 million shares outstanding for the year.
Turning to slide 25. In summary, we believe Actavis combined with Warner Chilcott has a number of opportunities for
strong growth in 2014. And we expect to generate significant cash flow, which will permit us to continue to invest in
opportunities that will further generate growth. Lastly, I would like to thank all our employees around the world for
their hard work and dedication to the growth of our global organization.
With that, let's turn back to Lisa for Q&A.

<Q - Marc Goodman>: Good morning. Hi. Two things. One, can you talk about the generics gross margin in the
quarter and the push-pulls and how to think about just kind of the base gross margin? What's going on there? And then
second, tax rate, interesting that you've kind of expanded the guidance range a little bit down further. Can you talk
about the tax rate going forward and how we should think about it?
<A - Robert Todd Joyce>: Marc, this is Todd. I'll cover both the margin and the tax rate question. As we look out at
the margin, the margin essentially was – was – sequentially was roughly in line with the second quarter. And so, we did
see some pushes – some push and pull in the components of the gross margin. We saw some higher margins on generic
Concerta as a result of the contractual arrangement we have with J&J. Lidoderm came in – price came in favorable on –
on our launch of that generic product. So, that's going well. We did see some lower pricing on a handful of generics,
but roughly in line with what – what we've been seeing through the first six months of the year, first nine months of the
year have been fairly consistent.
On the tax rate side, we've expanded the range a little bit. We've – we think there may be some additional opportunities
that we'll realize in 2014 related to manufacturing that may be able to help our tax rate, lower that tax rate from our
original guidance of 17%, still early in the process. The planning is going well. We had some ups and downs in our
estimates, but we still feel very comfortable around the midpoint of that range at 17%, and we're exploring
opportunities to bring the tax rate and do better – do better than 17% in 2014.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of David Risinger of Morgan Stanley.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Thanks very much. Excuse me, I have two questions, please. The first is, I'm assuming that
your guidance both in terms of your 2014 outlook and your long-term targets for double-digit organic earnings growth
incorporates generic pricing pressure from buyer consolidation between the retailers and distributors globally. If you
could just confirm that and then if you have any additional comments to offer on the generic pricing outlook, that
would be helpful. And then second, Siggi, I was hoping that you could talk about your outlook for Western Europe and
how you're thinking about potential divestitures in certain countries and what you are reflecting in the 2014 outlook at
this time? Thank you.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Thanks, David. So, with regard to the pricing assumptions in the U.S., you're right. We
assume the consolidation that is happening obviously with Walgreens, Alliance Boots, and then ABC on one hand and
obviously McKesson and Celesio, all these companies are big customers of ours and we work very closely with them.
This has been built into our focus for 2014 onwards. I think the good thing is, we have met with all the parties. We had
a very good meeting with Walgreens, Alliance Boots, and ABC last week. So, we feel we are starting to understand the
situation much better. I think we have built it into our pricing assumptions appropriately. With regard to the generic
pricing outlook at a high level, what has happened probably over the last two years is it has been more common that
obviously there is a price erosion in the market due to the consolidation. But there is opportunities to take pricing
increases. And that is what has changed. So, this maybe five years ago when there wasn't an opportunity. These pricing
increases have been in products which – where there has been a manufacturing problems or stock-out situation. So I
think that has been a fact in the U.S. generic market that there is an opportunity to take price increases but also at the
same time with the environment on the consolidation of the customers, clearly there's a pricing pressure overall in the
market.
With regard to Western Europe, as we said, as Paul mentioned, we assume high single-digit price erosion overall in
Western Europe. We are very happy with our businesses in U.K. and Nordics. Those continue to grow. We mentioned
the Oxycodone launched in U.K., but also a significant opportunity has been in the U.K. due to the quality problem
some of our competitors in that country have had, and the same applies to the Nordics where we are growing the
business well.
With regards to the Western European countries, which we announced, we are looking for either restructuring or
divesting, that process is going well. We feel that we fully understand the business. We assume that we keep that in our

books for 2013 fourth quarter, but we assume to take that out in the revenue forecast and in the overall forecast for
2014. So, that's how we build up our assumptions. We expect to know the outcome of any divestiture or restructuring
by the end of fourth quarter of this year.
<Q - David R. Risinger>: Thank you.
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of David Buck from Buckingham Research.
<Q - David George Buck>: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. It's on the branded business, I guess for Paul and
Siggi perhaps as well, can you talk about the expectation for the OC market, when potentially you could have Loestrin
24 generics? And can you talk a little bit about, maybe Siggi can add, what you learned about the mesalamine market
and the potential for legacy Asacol generic competition and how difficult is it in fact to formulate generics of these
products, Asacol and your own Lialda ANDA? Thanks.
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: So, this is Fred Wilkinson. We're very excited about the oral contraceptive
franchise. We've – Warner Chilcott just launched the Minastrin 24, it's going extremely well, that's following the
launch of Generess, which we did several years ago. I think the combination now between the companies, it's around a
10% market share and growing. Lo Lo, we do not anticipate launching a generic – a launch of a generic to Lo Lo. So
that will be the core stable of our promotional activities in 2014. We think we've got nice – three nice brands that we
can work with throughout 2014 to continue to grow this franchise.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yeah. I think, David, if I take a little bit about the mesalamine generic franchise, we
have said that previously we feel very good about our ANDA Lialda application. We obviously resubmitted a year
ahead of the guidance document coming out, but we have looked at the data and we feel very good about the
application. Obviously, we are working very closely with the FDA to secure approval. Also, a hearing on that product
will be in the first week of December, so it has been announced on the appeal, so we are looking forward to the
outcome of Lialda, but we feel good about that product.
With regards to the opportunity of development of Asacol, I have stated previously, it can be developed, as we have
shown on Lialda. These are products that have a low bioavailability and are challenging to develop, no question about
it. But with the generics companies today, the technical ability to develop this product is there. And obviously, the limit
of detections and how science has taken us forward has allowed the generic companies to develop these products today.
So, overall, I think it's possible. It's very challenging for sure, but I think our Lialda development speaks volume about
the opportunity that it is possible.
<Q - David George Buck>: Just a follow-up and any – for Fred, I guess, any thoughts on whether an actual generic
Asacol may be on the market in 2014 and do you expect the overall OC franchise to grow in 2014?
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: Firstly, we do expect the overall OC franchise to grow. We've modeled it that
way with the line-up of products we have. And regarding Asacol, if you've noticed, I mean we've kind of split the
business now between Asacol HD and Delzicol. Delzicol is a primary focus of the activities out there. We intend to
continue to grow them.

<Q - Liav Abraham>: Good morning. Could you talk a little about your expectations for longer-term double-digit
earnings growth? I'd be interested in additional color around where your assumptions are coming from? Is it from top
line growth, cost controls, taxes? If you could put some color around that, that would be helpful. Thank you.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure. I think that it's fair to say that we see growth coming from really sort of three areas.
Certainly, we've maintained and continue to maintain our objective of achieving organic double-digit growth. And that
organic growth will come from executing on the value of our R&D pipeline, both on the generic side as well as the
brand side, and taking those products, those product approvals and launching them in markets around the world and
driving additional value from those assets. So, it comes from R&D, and then the sales expansion. And then finally, we
have probably the strongest Paragraph IV franchise in the country today and it's – a lot of that growth – a lot of growth
is driven out of that Paragraph IV franchise. So we would expect to see those assets coming to fruition, some in 2014,
some in 2015, and of course, some in 2016 and beyond.
In addition to that organic growth, we would also expect growth from operational synergies. We'll continue to drive
operational excellence programs. We're going to continue to get the synergies from many of the acquisitions that we've
done. We continue to rationalize our global supply chain. We use our purchasing power to improve our purchasing
efforts, so that – there will also be growth driven from reduction in COGS and just overall rationalization of the
business.
And then finally on top of all of that, we would expect to allocate our cash to continue to help drive growth. That
growth, we will continue to look for opportunities that are in the generics sector, certainly around the world. We want
to improve some of our – and some of our commercial markets. We've talked about this a lot, looking in areas like
Southeast Asia and Russia and sort of those markets that have potential for significant double-digit growth, as well as
on the brand side. We now have opportunities that we're looking at in the GI and dermatology side. We have a very,
very strong women's healthcare pipeline, doesn't mean we won't look for other opportunities there, but it's a very strong
women's healthcare pipeline. We've got a good urology pipeline with the Udenafil product and a number of other
opportunities as we look at things in urology. So, it's really a combination of those three things, organic growth,
operational synergies, and then allocation of our cash will help us drive significant growth over the next three years.

Your next question is from the line of David Amsellem from Piper Jaffray.
<Q - David A. Amsellem>: Thanks. I just wanted to drill down on a couple of items on the guidance for 2014, on
Concerta, when you talk about additional competition, does that include competition from the Impax generic in 2014?
And then to be clear on the guidance, does that reflect any impact from a generic on Asacol 400 mg? And then if you
can, are there any possibility of disclosing some of these risk-adjusted Paragraph IV opportunities that you put into the
2014 guide? Thanks.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Hey, David. Let me start at least. So with regard to the guidance, we said we have built
in occasional competition on Concerta for 2014. We haven't gone so far to say who is going to get approval. I think that
probably isn't where we are, but overall, we feel that there could be approval that year and we have built that into our
guidance. With regard to the Paragraph IVs, we are not going to disclose that at this point in time. The reason is simply
that there are ongoing cases. We are working with the FDA. The closer we get to our Investor Day, we will have more
visibility. We are going to show you more into the guidance on what is included at our Investor Day in January of next
year. But overall, at this point in time, we are not going to give you any more details on the Paragraph IV on the risk
adjustment.
<Q - David A. Amsellem>: Okay. And the Asacol question?
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: Yeah, I mean actually, the Asacol franchise, we're focusing ourselves on
Delzicol 400 mg and Asacol HD. Those are the two growth items, and so that's entirely the focus of the promotional

pieces – promotional emphasis is to grow those two products. We are not done with the franchise yet. There are some
expansion opportunities that are in the R&D portfolio but that's the approach that we're taking today.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Yeah, I mean, and I would just take it one step further and say that would assume if there is a
generic Asacol 400 that would be part of the – that would be built in.

Your next question comes from the line of Louise Chen from Guggenheim.
<Q - Louise A. Chen>: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. The first question I had was on the – your guidance for
2014, the preliminary guidance, you obviously gave a wide range. I know you gave a lot of detail on the pieces, but I
was wondering if you could highlight the key swing factors to that range? And then the second was just if you could
provide an update on your generic Advair program and the timing around when you think generics will come to the
market, because I know there's some debate out there between the different companies. Thank you.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: There's a lot of debate about that, I think. With respect to 2014, I think some of the swing items
of course will be the extent to which we are successful in some of our Paragraph IV challenges. We obviously risk
adjusted some, put some in, left some out, and if we're successful at a higher rate than we've expected, then we would
obviously hit either the high-end or exceed the guidance that we provided. I think the other – well, some of the other
areas would be tax rate, as we – as Todd talked about earlier, as we think about and implement some of the tax
strategies we have, we hope to be able to bring down our tax rate and as that happens on the EBITDA numbers we're
talking about, it's going to have a significant impact on the overall earnings. So, those are probably the two big swing
factors. And I'll let Siggi talk about Advair.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yeah, Louise. On generic Advair, we're doing fine. We have identified our device. We
are working on the PK of the device at the moment. And hope to be getting into Phase III soon, although we don't know
the exact timing of that. With regard to the overall timing, I think the difference is how we assume the FDA is going to
improve on the approval time. I think we are not sure that the FDA is able to go down to nine months approval time by
2015. Based on the current 33 months average approval time, I think it's fair to say we would assume that generic
Advair would be on the market 2018. But if suddenly the PDUFA kicks in, I think there could be a generic competition
in 2016. But I think that's where the differences between companies lies. My overall opinion is that at least three
companies are at a similar place in the development of generic Advair.

<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: Hi. Good morning.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Good morning.
<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: Thanks for taking the questions. Paul, when you were talking about the pipeline, you sort of
passed over in terms of discussion, but it's on the slide, comments around development of additional mesalamine
products. I was just curious if you could provide a little bit more detail around that program and where – when we
could hear more about the timing and sort of strategy that you're taking in terms of that market?
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: Yeah. This is Fred. There are several projects that we're inheriting from the
Warner Chilcott development group. We've had a series of meetings as we start to rationalize the R&D portfolio.
Obviously, the GI line and the mesalamine line are critical to continue the development on. They have three or four

ideas that we are working on, but I don't think at this particular time we are prepared to really identify what those are
and the timing. Suffice it to say this is a critical franchise. There are some opportunities for product improvements that
we're chasing very, very aggressively and this is one of the areas where we intend to accelerate the good work that
Warner Chilcott was already doing.
<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: Okay, great. And then one final question on – in terms of the opportunity to optimize the tax
rate on your pipeline products, when we think about what – the – your – the legacy Actavis Phase III assets, are you
going to be able to sort of maximize the tax synergies with the Warner Chilcott platform now?
<A - Robert Todd Joyce>: Yeah. Yes. We will. One of the advantages of being – now being an Irish company or
having an Irish parent is that we avoid a lot of the restrictive U.S. tax rules, the Subpart F rules that limit our ability to
put IP offshore in certain circumstances. We've been employing a strategy over the past few years to develop IP
offshore in locations where we would also be manufacturing that IP, and that strategy will continue, but the new
platform being a – having a foreign parent gives us a lot more flexibility going forward to keep that IP offshore and to
have it permanently generated – those profits permanently offshore.
<Q - Douglas D. Tsao>: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.

The next question comes from the line of Gregg Gilbert from Bank of America.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hi, Gregg.
<Q - Gregg Gilbert>: Hi. Good morning. I'm sorry, if you covered some of this, Paul, already, but I wanted to pin you
down a bit more on the renewed commitment to the long-term double-digit organic growth off the new base.
Obviously, that's impressive given the size of the company now. Is that aspirational or does your long-term plan that
you share with the board actually include double-digit EPS growth and if so for how many years? And then, my
follow-up, I'll ask upfront. Can you talk about your confidence in ESTRACE exclusivity, whether that relates to
technical barriers or the follow-on program or some combination of those things? It's obviously a very significant EPS
contributor. So, curious if you could share some confidence-building comments there? Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure. You're trying to pin me down for multiple years, right. So, I think right now, we are
looking at double-digit growth for 2015 organically. We have shared that goal with the board. So, they do know that
that is our goal. I think we can get there provided that we can execute on the Paragraph IV challenges that we continue
to grow our – now our much expanded Specialty Brand franchise and we continue to drive growth in our ex-U.S.
markets as well. So, I do think that's what – that is our intention is to hit double-digit growth. If you want to call it
aspirational, I guess that would be one way to say it, but it is a number that we have consistently hit and consistently
striven – strived for throughout the time that I've been here.
As we look out over 2015 or beyond 2015 into 2016, it's going to get a – gets a little cloudy because we know we're
going to be allocating our cash to new things, to new business opportunities, to new business development
opportunities. So, otherwise, we will have no debt and a mountain of cash. So, we're going to find ways to put that cash
to work. So, I think that will help support that growth rate in the out years as well as the organic stuff.
Fred, I'll let you take the ESTRACE piece.
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: Sure. I think now you hit on couple of the core areas where we've spent a lot of
time looking how to accelerate a couple of the projects and emphasize them a little bit more. Obviously, ESTRACE
Cream is an important asset. There are again several product improvement opportunities within that line. There has not
been much done in that category in a while. And so, we've focused ourselves on a couple of those product
improvement. So, I think the confidence that we have on the line is really a combination of both the difficulty of
generics and the opportunities that we have through line extensions.

<Q - Tim Chiang>: Hi. Thanks.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Good morning, Tim.
<Q - Tim Chiang>: Paul, I know you highlighted the launches of Intuniv and OxyContin for 2014. Are those both
basically targeted for the fourth quarter of next year?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Intuniv is fourth quarter for sure. OxyContin, I think is a little bit earlier.
<Q - Tim Chiang>: And maybe just a follow-up, Paul. I noticed that you guys issued an 8-K, sort of amending Warner
Chilcott's arrangements with Sanofi. Could you talk a little bit about the significance of that because it looks like you
guys are – or Warner Chilcott is basically paying about $125 million to Sanofi, but does that basically, effectively
lower your SG&A costs for next year?
<A - Robert Todd Joyce>: Yes. It does. It takes out the royalty payment to Sanofi for 2014 that would be – that would
have been in SG&A.
<Q - Tim Chiang>: And after that – there is no more payments to Sanofi? Is that right?
<A - Robert Todd Joyce>: No. The agreement expires at the end of 2014; just to be clear, the agreement is still in
place for ex-U.S. markets and that will also expire at the end of 2014.

Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Finkelstein from Susquehanna Financial.
<Q - Andrew J. Finkelstein>: Thanks very much. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how we can look at the
performance of some of the brand products where you're most focused on driving volume growth and any factors we
might think about in terms of changes in net pricing as you've transferred the franchises over and we've gotten through
some of these product transitions. And then on the generics business, how we might think about the new ANDA filing
activity over the next couple of years, noting you have been in the lead recently and have the strongest Paragraph IV
portfolio. And then one specific product, if you could talk about the potential to launch an authorized generic to
NEUPOGEN under your deal with Amgen in 2014. Thanks very much.
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: So, let me start with the brands and I guess I'll start with the legacy Actavis
brands. Obviously, we had a nice year with growth of just about everything that we're promoting. We're real pleased
with the growth – continued growth of Rapaflo in year five after launch. It's got still a long life to it. We intend to grow
this brand and continue to accelerate the trajectory in the urology space.
Generess Fe continues to be one of the fastest-growing oral contraceptives out there. And it actually makes a nice
combination in our promotional activities with the Warner Chilcott line because it was one of the most actively
promoted chewable products out there and that's a line that we're going to be bringing Minastrin into and to help to
accentuate the benefits of that attribute of the OC.
Androderm is growing now with the 24 introduction and conversion. So, we're pleased with that. Crinone continues to
grow, and Trelstar, even though there's some difficult pricing arrangements, also continues to grow in units. So, we've
had a nice positive growth position out of what we think is probably one of the more effective sales groups out there in

the industry.
With the addition of the Chilcott line, obviously, we take a leadership role in the contraceptive space and we intend to
kind of build on that, so that we've got three good brands that we can grow. The urology space expands again through
the projects that are coming in from Warner Chilcott, so this will be a primary focus. It builds to where we were already
– we already had a nice market presence.
And then, picking up GI and dermal would be good for us, because these are two new therapeutic categories that have
nice growth potential. It's an area that Actavis or previous Watson has been in, in the derm space. And so, I think you're
going to see a little more activity from us in those areas as we go forward.
<Q - Andrew J. Finkelstein>: So, particularly in the oral contraceptives, is that something where we can see renewed
volume growth in some of the Warner Chilcott franchises?
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: Yeah. We believe so. I mean they've been working through some product
introductions, those product introductions and in some cases will cause kind of a diminution of the overall franchise. I
think they're through those now. It's a nice opportunity for us to pick it up and now start to grow volume and help build
out the whole franchise, so that's really the goals for 2014 is a focus now on growth in units and growth in overall
revenue.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Andrew, if I take the ANDA thing, as we mentioned earlier, we are over 190 ANDA
pending at the FDA and we have filed 32 ANDA this year with 16 of those 32 as possible first to file, so I think we are
firing on all cylinders. We have never chosen as many products into development. People are talking about the pipeline
cliff and the pipeline of generics as declining. So far, we haven't seen that. We are working very actively on the
pipeline, both in the U.S., but also for the emerging markets where we are branding our pipeline. That is a key thing as
we grow our pipeline in Russia, Southeast Asia. We are doing more filings in Japan than ever before. We are spending
more money on Japanese development because that's a special development. We are doing the same in Brazil in
preparation to have a sales platform in Brazil.
So, overall, we are spending more time, money, and resources on generic development than ever before, so going
forward, I don't see it short term changing. I think maybe in three to five years, there might be fewer opportunities, but
there will be more challenging opportunities, so I think we might not have 40 ANDAs per year that we submit, but they
might be in the 20s, but they would be much more valuable and basically products that our competitors are unable to
develop. So I think that will be the shift in the generic R&D pipeline would be it's not how many products, it's how
challenging on the return on that investment.
With regard to the NEUPOGEN AG, we obviously think this could be a great opportunity. We have mentioned this to
Amgen; no agreement has been reached, but keep in mind, we have a very strong infrastructure in the hospital setting
outside of the U.S., so this could be an opportunity going forward. But nothing is agreed.

on Advair about submitting a device to the FDA in advance, you get a termination on 505(j) eligibility. I'm just
wondering if you guys have had those discussions with the Agency and if not, sort of when in the process do you think
applicants will have that discussion and know that their product is 505(j) eligible? And then just my second question,

with Amphastar in the past? Thanks.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: So, let me take the Advair. Basically, we have had interactions with the FDA. We have
gone through – this has been a long-time development for Watson and then Actavis and now again Actavis, so it's not
like we started this year or last year. This has been a long development. We have a lot of knowledge in-house of this
development. I think for the final evaluation of the device, we feel it's important to have some PK data to show the
FDA, so the final meeting to evaluate the device would need to be supported with some PK data at that point in time.
So we are not at that point yet. As I mentioned, we are working on the PK parameters of the device. So far, we are not
there, but we have had multiple interactions with the FDA and other advisors on our development program.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Jason, as to the distribution agreements you talked about. We don't have built-in any sort
aspirational agreements. We either have identified agreements that exist, and we put them in or it's our own product
launches that affect 2014.

Your next question comes from the line of Ronny Gal from Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my question.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Good morning.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: Good morning. Two questions. First, regarding 2014 guidance, is Pulmicort in there, or if it is,
roughly what probability are you putting on it? And on mesalamine and ESTRACE, should we able to see some
development on clinicaltrials.gov in the next 12 months? And separately on the branded side, you've got a few nice new
launches in 2014, Diafert, Levosert, Progestin Patch, and Metronidazole. I was wondering if you kind of look three
years to five years out, if you can ballpark to us, what will be a good target revenue for you guys, essentially just like
all together $200 million, $500 million, $1 billion, just so we kind of know ballpark, what do you think those products
could do?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: I hope it's $1 billion, Ronny. We haven't actually done that work, but I'll let Fred take that.
<Q - Ronny Gal>: What are you going to hold Fred to?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Maybe $1 billion, I mean that's the answer. With respect to 2014, we're going to decline talking
about product opportunities for 2014. Suffice it to say, we have, as I said, I know that this is not optimum for you guys,
but the reality is there are a number of patent cases that we have risk-adjusted and put in the numbers for 2014. We feel
comfortable with those and we hope to be able to exceed that risk-adjusted contribution, but we're going to refrain from
getting into what's in and what's out. So, Fred, I'll turn it over to you for mesalamine, ESTRACE and...
<A - George Frederick Wilkinson>: So, Ronny, thanks for the commercial. I think the R&D portfolio is kind of
maturing nicely with a lot of launches reminding us that some of these came out of the Uteron transaction at actually
the beginning of this last year. The ESTRACE, I think there is some information on the clin – on the .gov website.
There were some Phase IIIs that were completed in 2012 and 2013. So, I think there is information out there; that is not
the complete program, so there will probably be some more things that will be placed on the website as we go forward.
And mesalamine, those projects may not be visible on the [ph] clinical.gov (sic) [clinicaltrials.gov] website, but we'll
follow back up with you and check on that. But they are very, very active projects, we intend to accelerate those so that
we make sure we take advantage of some of the good foundational work that Chilcott has already done.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: And then seriously on guidance for the brand franchise. We're going to save the revenue
guidance for our Investor Meeting in January. We will have a lot more visibility on timing and so we think that makes a
bit more sense to do it then.

Your next question comes from the line of Chris Schott from JPMorgan.
<Q - Chris T. Schott>: Great. Thanks. Just two questions here. First is on the biz dev side. Can you just talk about,
just with Warner having recently closed, how active is your business development activity at this point, and what size
of transaction would be your sweet spot at this point?
I guess I am just wondering following this deal, should we anticipate a period of digestion as you integrate Warner
before the company would be in a position to, for example, consider another larger branded deal? The second question
I had was coming back to, one of your competitors announced a JV with a major pharma company in Japan last year,
seems to leverage the branded company's market presence, the generic manufacturer's product portfolio. Do you think
that type of structure makes sense and do you see an opportunity for Actavis to look at these type of JVs as we think
about some of the emerging market opportunities? Thanks very much.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Sure, Chris. Let me start with the business development piece. We are very active on the
business development front and we remain – we haven't really stopped. We continue to keep looking for new
opportunities. With respect to the size of a transaction, I don't think we are limited by size right now. I don't think – I
think our – as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're sort of complete with the legacy Actavis, legacy Watson
integration and the Warner Chilcott integration is going very smoothly and we expect to be not hampered by that
integration effort in looking for new and potentially digesting new business development opportunities.
I think really the question is, what's available and what makes strategic sense? I think we have been very clear that we'd
look at strategic transactions that help grow our business in markets that we want to operate in and in categories – in
therapeutic categories that we are in. And so, it's a question of finding the right opportunity and then negotiating that
kind of arrangement that takes time and will lead to hopefully a successful conclusion, but we are, I would say very
active on the business development front even today. Siggi, you want to say something on the Japanese...?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Yeah. I think, Chris, we are doing exactly the same. We have a great joint venture with
a Japanese company called ASKA. This has been a joint venture in place for about three years. I think the reason why
companies are doing it through a joint venture is simply that to come in as a Western company into Japan, you need the
local regulatory experience, but also key to the Japanese market is the relationship with the wholesalers. So, overall,
our partner is absolutely fantastic. We have been working very closely with them. We also have a little bit of our own
quality franchise ourselves in the Japanese market, but overall, we feel that it's important to have a strong JV when you
take your first step into the Japanese market.
<Q - Chris T. Schott>: Can I just follow up on that. Just I was thinking actually more broadly than Japan, does that
type of structure, as we think about other markets globally, make sense or is that something that's very Japan specific in
your view?
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: I – my personal opinion, it's more Japan specific, because overall joint venture, there is
a lot of time. You need to monitor joint venture to make it work, joint steering committee. We have had great success
in joint venture. Obviously, let's talk about our biosimilars joint venture with Amgen, has been a great success. But
overall, marketing entry where you are entering a market, where you have the knowledge, you have the experience, you
have the supply, you have the regulatory knowledge, usually we don't rely very heavily on joint ventures, except in
cases where you basically the partners need each other. So, how we see it in Japan is we really need the local
knowledge and regulatory affairs, reimbursement, distribution, wholesaling, et cetera. What we bring to the table is an
extremely strong pipeline, strong R&D, strong supply chain, and together, we are much stronger than separately in the
Japanese market. If the case comes up in other markets, where this – we could build this win-win, there is nothing
against joint ventures, but there has to be a win-win for both parties.

Your next question comes from the line Jami Rubin from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Thank you. Maybe if I could just follow up on that last question, Paul and Siggi. Paul, you have
talked about legacy pharma as an area of interest with respect to M&A activities. I am just wondering if you could
elaborate a bit further on that. Are you talking about creating partnerships with established products or legacy pharma
companies? What kind of form would that take and what are you thinking in terms of timing?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Well, I mean – we have talked about this in the past. One issue for, I think legacy pharma, has
been what to do with those legacy brands as those brand products decline over time. And our argument has been, if
they're put in the hands of companies like us, we can help drive the overall growth of the franchise because we will –
we have the R&D engine that continues to supply new products to that market, grow – and have an opportunity to grow
those products across and then sort of turn the tide on them and make them grow. Obviously, that kind of deal would
require some creative discussions and creative activity and those kinds of things do take time, but we are open to
consider that and we've got to find the right partner to do it with. Jami, you there?
<Q - Jami Rubin>: Oh. Yeah. I'm here. Thank you. Thank you.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Okay. Okay.
<Q - Jami Rubin>: I just got to say, I got one on 42nd Street in Manhattan.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: If you have a phone number, I would like to call.

Your next question comes from line of David Maris from BMO Capital Markets.
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: Hey, David.
<Q - David W. Maris>: Good morning. Paul, could you talk a little bit about the complexity of the supply chain and
the overall business as you are growing relative to where it was two years or three years ago and how do you minimize
risk in that environment and how does that play into how you look at deals in Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia? As you
know, one of your competitors has tripped acquisition wise from a complex manufacturing problem. Give us just a
sense, investors are asking us – give us a sense of what you're doing to minimize that type of risk?
<A - Paul M. Bisaro>: I'm going to let Bob Stewart who runs our Operations team answer that, but I think, the single
most important thing we have the deal with, on a daily basis is quality and execution of our supply chain. And it often
gets overlooked, but it doesn't get overlooked by the people that are in this room because we think about it every day
and we deal with it every day. Bob?
<A - Robert A. Stewart>: Yeah. So, we obviously operate a lot of plants around the globe, very highly utilized
manufacturing facilities that can produce all of the myriad of pharmaceutical dosage forms and they're complex
operations, it's a complex supply chain. When you look at the 60 different markets that we're serving and look at just
the sheer volume of product that were moving around the world, we've spent a lot of time on managing it day-in and
day-out. We've spent a lot of time kind of asking the question around acquisitions and how has that kind of either
challenged us or complicated us.
What I would say is that all of the transactions that we've done have created complementary manufacturing strategies
and supply chain strategies to what we were trying to accomplish. And so, what I would say is that we spent a lot of
time during due diligence making sure that we are not walking into the same type of a trap that some of our competitors

have with recent acquisitions where they acquire something with a facility that a week later has a Warning Letter. We
spend a lot of time doing due diligence and quality, making sure that the assets that we are acquiring fit strategically as
well as can run compliant operations and I would say that the team that we have within our Global Operations group is
really, really strong in terms of running and managing a supply chain.
<A - Sigurdur Oli Olafsson>: Maybe, David, one data point for you to consider, the complexity in the supply chain,
prior to 2009, prior to the Arrow acquisition, we were dealing with between 1,000 and 1,500 SKUs in the overall
company. We are now over 15,000 SKUs. So, Bob was talking about complexity, but it's tenfold in three years and it is
so important. We could never deliver the results in the markets without a rock solid supply chain like we have.
<Q - David W. Maris>: Great. Thank you very much.
