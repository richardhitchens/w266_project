MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the AT&T First Quarter Earnings Release 2013
Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question and answer
session, and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] Also as a reminder, this teleconference is
being recorded. And at this time, I will turn the conference call over to your host, Ms. Susan Johnson. Please go ahead.
Susan Johnson
Thank you, Tony.
Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter conference call. It's great to have you with us today. I'm
Susan Johnson, head of Investor Relations for AT&T.
Joining me on the call today is John Stephens, AT&T's Chief Financial Officer. John will provide an update with
perspectives on the quarter, then will follow up with questions.
Let me remind you our earnings material is available on the Investor Relations page of the AT&T website. That's
www.att.com/investor.relations.
I also need to cover our Safe Harbor statement, which is on slide 2. This presentation and comments may include
forward-looking statements that are subject to risks. Results may differ materially. Details are on our SEC filings and
on AT&T's website.
Now before I turn the call over to John, let me quickly cover our consolidated financial summary, which is on slide 3.
Reported EPS for the quarter was $0.67. That's up more than 11% over last year's first quarter. Our results this quarter

include about a $0.03 help from an income tax settlement. When you exclude this, earnings per share were $0.64, or
about an 8.5% increase over last year's adjusted first quarter EPS of $0.59, which is adjusted to exclude our divested
Ad Solutions unit.
Consolidated revenues excluding Ad Solutions were up 0.9% year-over-year, thanks to solid revenue growth in
wireless, continued gains in U-verse services, and growth in strategic business services. Revenues were impacted
somewhat by lower regulatory fees this quarter. When you normalize for the difference in these charges, consolidated
revenue would have grown 1.3%. Consolidated margins were down slightly year-over-year, primarily due to wireline
pressure.
Cash flow started the year strong. Cash from operating activities for the quarter totaled $8.2 billion, and free cash flow
was $3.9 billion. And we continued buying back shares as part of our repurchase program. In the first quarter, we
bought back 168 million shares for $5.9 billion.
With that overview, I'll now turn the call over to AT&T's Chief Financial Officer, John Stephens. John?
John J. Stephens
Thank you, Susan, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for being with us today, and as always, thank you for your
interest in AT&T.
Before we get to the detailed results, let's start with a quick overview. Highlights are on slide 4.
First, we had a solid start to the year. Earnings per share growth was strong, adjusted consolidated revenues increased,
and cash flow continues to be a success story for us. We added more than 2 million IP broadband connections in the
quarter when you combine both wireless and wireline connections.
In wireless, it's all about the mobile Internet. Data growth was strong, smartphone sales set another first-quarter record,
tablets drove postpaid growth with an exceptional quarter, and customers continue to flock to our Mobile Share plans,
making it easier than ever to add new devices and drive further growth. This resulted in improved revenues, better
margins, postpaid ARPU growth, and lower churn.
In wireline, U-verse continues to shine. We had our best ever U-verse high-speed Internet sales in the first quarter. This
drove positive broadband growth. In fact, we had our best total wireline broadband growth in nine quarters. U-verse
video sales also were strong, as we added more subscribers than we have in any quarter over the last two years.
So the team is executing at a high level, and we have the right strategy. Our financial results are solid, our capital
structure sound. All in all, a solid start to the new year.
Before we move to operational results, I'd like to give you a quick update on Project Velocity or Project VIP. Details
are on slide 5.
It's still early, but we already have made tremendous progress with our LTE deployment. We are running ahead of
schedule, with nearly 200 million LTE POPs covered to date, and we expect to complete nearly 90% of our 300 million
POP LTE buildout by the end of this year.
The LTE network also is operating at high levels. First, our LTE network is the fastest in the nation, as supported by an
independent third-party testing group. Then on wireless network performance, including call, text, and data,
RootMetrics ranked AT&T number one or tied for number one in 14 of the 23 markets they have surveyed so far this
year. And this comes on top of ranking first or tied for first in more than 70% of the markets RootMetrics surveyed in
the second half of last year where we had deployed LTE.
Our U-verse VIP deployments will begin rolling out later this year, but the incredible first quarter U-verse results add
to our confidence in making this a larger part of our growth strategy. We had record high-speed IP broadband net adds
along with increasing U-verse video gains. We continue to gain market share in areas where we offer U-verse, and

Project VIP expands those areas even more.
The same holds true with out strategic business service revenue growth and our fiber build to business. Even in
uncertain economic times, we are seeing growing demand for high-speed connectivity and our advanced data services.
These results once again show that Project VIP is working, and the right strategy for AT&T.
Now let's move to our operational results, starting with wireless, where we had another solid quarter thanks to
continued growth of the mobile Internet. Revenue and ARPU are on slide 6.
Mobile data continues to surge. Revenues were up 21% in the quarter. That helped drive 3.4% service revenue growth,
and total wireless revenues were up 3.4%.
You will recall that we adjusted the way we book our data revenues, which no longer include text messaging. And as
you can see, this quarter mobile data continues to surge. It's now a $20 billion annualized revenue stream, growing at
21%.
You also can see the impact of data growth when you look at postpaid ARPU. Data ARPU grew 18%, and total
postpaid phone-only ARPU was up 2%. Total postpaid ARPU, which includes high-margin but lower-ARPU tablets
and other non-phone devices, also grew in the quarter, up about 1%.
Our postpaid smartphone base also continues to expand. Those details are on slide 7. Smartphone subscribers increased
by more than 1.2 million in the quarter, and by more than 7 million in the last 12 months. Overall, smartphones now
make up more than 70% of our postpaid phone base, and smartphones accounted for nearly 90% of postpaid sales in
the quarter, giving us even more room for smartphone growth.
These are the premium subscribers in our business. They have twice the ARPU of non-smartphone subscribers, and
much lower churn, so their conversion brings additional revenue. Another new first quarter smartphones sales record of
$6 million helped drive that growth. We had 4.8 million iPhone activations in the quarter, while our upgrade rate was
steady when compared to last year's levels.
The number of postpaid subscribers on usage-based data plans also continues to grow. Overall, almost 70% of our
smartphone base has moved to usage-based plans. Mobile Share plans continue to be popular. By the end of the first
quarter, Mobile Share accounts reached 3.3 million. These accounts include about 10 million subscribers or devices
such as smartphones and tablets. This growth is even more impressive when you remember that we give customers a
choice when picking a data plan, allowing them to pick the one that works best for them.
At the same time, take rates on the higher Mobile Share data plans, those that are 10 gigabits or higher, continue to run
above expectations, with more than a quarter of Mobile Share accounts on those plans. And we continue to see a steady
movement of subscribers on unlimited plans taking advantage of Mobile Share. More than 15% of subscribers have
moved over from unlimited plans, or about 1 million subscribers to date. During the quarter, we introduced larger
Mobile Share plans targeting businesses as well as consumers who need more data. These plans offer up to 50 gigabits
per month and provide an attractive revenue yield.
We also see the impact of the mobile Internet on our postpaid net adds. Details are on slide 8. We had strong gains in
tablets. This new growth area drove postpaid growth of almost 300,000 postpaid subscribers in the quarter. We also had
another solid quarter with our connected devices, adding 431,000 subscribers, primarily with security and tracking
devices. Reseller and prepaid impacted our overall net adds.
Reseller had a net loss this quarter, primarily due to resellers rationalizing their no or low usage accounts. These
disconnects had a negative impact of more than 600,000 on reseller subscriber net adds in the quarter and on total
subscriber net adds in the quarter. Although the reseller volumes involved were significant, it had little impact on
revenue. In fact, our reseller revenue is up more than 50% year-over-year. Prepaid sales continue to be impacted by
declines in session-based tablets.
We do see some changes across the mobile marketplace. As always, we continue to evaluate and look for opportunities
that take advantage of our network including new product offerings, bundling opportunities, and alternative forms of

distribution. But we also continue to see improvements in churn. Postpaid churn had another strong quarter, down
year-over-year and sequentially. And we had our best ever first quarter smartphone churn, which was less than 1%. We
did have a policy change with regard to third party retailers that had a small impact on churn. But with or without that
change, we saw a reduction in churn, and we continue to see year-over-year improvements in postpaid churn.
Now let's take a look at wireless margins on slide 9. Our wireless margin story continues a trend we've seen in recent
quarters. Smartphone sales continue to be strong. But even with increased sales, margins are expanding. The story is no
different this quarter. We set a first quarter record of 6 million smartphone sales, yet our wireless EBITDA service
margin was 90 basis points higher when compared to the first quarter of 2012, or 43.2%. Smartphone subscribers
continue to be a wise investment. You know the long-term value they bring: higher ARPU, lower churn, strong data
growth, driving growth in operating income, which was up more than 4% year-over-year.
We really feel good about our wireless position. Revenues continue to grow with expanding margins. The mobile
Internet continues to bring strong data growth, with more and more subscribers on usage-based data plans. Customers
continue to embrace our Mobile Share plans, helping drive tablet growth. And our LTE deployment is ahead of
schedule and winning praise as the fastest in the industry. So all in all, a really solid wireless performance that sets the
stage for a strong year in 2013 and beyond.
Now let's look at our wireline operations starting with consumer, which you can see on slide 10. Once again, we had
another impressive U-verse performance, with accelerating subscriber gains. The growth of our high speed IP
broadband has been nothing short of dramatic. We added more IP broadband subscribers this quarter than ever before,
more than 730,000, which helped drive our best total broadband net adds in two years. IP broadband now makes up
more than half of our total broadband base, with an ARPU growing at more than 9% year-over-year. Plus we are
gaining share against our competition.
U-verse TV also had a great quarter. We added 232,000 U-verse video customers, our best showing in nine quarters.
These gains helped drive overall consumer revenue growth of 2%. Adjusted for changes in regulatory fees, it would
have been nearly 2.5%, with U-verse revenues up more than 30% in the quarter off an ever increasing base. So once
again, another solid quarter in consumer, and we see more opportunity for growth with our increasing U-verse
penetration and planned Project VIP expansions.
Now let's move to wireline business, which you can see on slide 11. When you look at the three major components of
wireline business, you're seeing a similar story that we've talked about in prior quarters. The continued drop in small
business starts is still pressuring that part of the revenue stream. Wholesale and government solutions continue to be
challenged, and our enterprise revenues, after showing some positive signs last year, were challenged in the first
quarter. Combined business revenue was down sequentially and year-over-year, pressured somewhat by regulatory
fees. Adjusting for those fees, total business revenue was down 2.7%.
One bright spot was the strong growth in strategic business services. Those are products that are part of our Project
Velocity investment, including VPN, Ethernet, hosting, and other advanced IP services. These were up 10.8% even in a
very difficult economic environment. Expenses were down year-over-year to help offset some of the revenue decline,
but uncertainty with the economy continues to be the issue. Customers are delaying buying decisions, unemployment
improvement continues to lag, the business overhang from regulatory uncertainty persists, and government budget
issues are all having an impact on our customers and on our results.
But the most challenging aspect for us is trying to forecast the future in this environment. Like others, we are looking
for consistent signs of improvement. One thing that is not faltering in our confidence in the future is that it will be
driven by high bandwidth connectivity, mobility, and the cloud. Nobody is positioned better to take advantage of these
opportunities once the uncertainty passes and the economy turns.
Let me give you more detail on slide 12. AT&T is a recognized leader in solutions for hosting and cloud services. We
offer network-centric integrated solutions that provide value to customers on a global basis. The foundation for our
cloud services is having one of the world's most powerful and advanced global MPLS networks that span 187
countries. We operate 38 data centers that are fully integrated with that network, providing top of the line security,

reliability, and management.
We see a future where our wireline network assets and mobility come together in the cloud that will mobilize
workforces to access business information in a secure environment. AT&T's expertise in this area has been recognized
recently by industry analyst Gartner, who gave the company the highest rating for important capabilities for network
services. We have the network, the right tools, and the right products to win in the fast developing cloud market, and
we're best positioned to take advantage of the growing opportunities in this space.
Now let's look at margins and cash flow. Consolidated margin comparisons are on slide 13. For the first quarter,
consolidated margin was 18.9%, down slightly from the year-ago first quarter. Wireless margin expansion offset
wireline pressure. However, expenses from corporate and new business initiatives did impact overall margins. In
wireline, pressure from business, as well as success-based expenses in consumer, drove operating margins down
slightly. Helping offset this pressure were growth in consumer revenues, operational improvements, and solid
execution of our One AT&T cost initiatives. We continue to expect consolidated margins to be stable this year, with
growth in wireless offset by pressure in our investments in our wireline business.
Now let's move to cash flow, which continues to be a very good story for us. Our summary is on slide 14. In the first
quarter, cash from operations totaled $8.2 billion. Capital expenditures were $4.3 billion, with more than half of that
invested in the wireless business, which gives us free cash flow before dividends of $3.9 billion, more than $300
million improvement over last year's first quarter. Our CapEx expectations continue to be in the $21 billion range as we
ramp Project VIP throughout this year.
However, we are adjusting our longer-term capital spending expectations. We now expect capital spending to be in the
$20 billion range for both 2014 and 2015. That is down from the $22 billion level we expected when we announced
Project VIP last November. This reduction brings no slowdown in our Project VIP deployment. As we've refined our
VIP planning, we are seeing greater integration efficiencies in our spending curves. Our LTE build is accelerating into
this year's spending. That, along with additional savings in non-Project VIP spending, gives us confidence to revise our
expectations without changing our overall build targets. Post Project VIP, we expect capital spending to take a step
down to more normal levels.
Moving to dividends, payments for the quarter totaled $2.5 billion, and we repurchased 168 million shares for $5.9
billion. This makes our total return to shareholders in the first quarter more than $8 billion, and more than $30 billion in
the last five quarters. Plus, as we announced last month, the AT&T board approved an additional $300 million
repurchase authorization. The company expects to make future repurchase decisions opportunistically, which will
likely slow the pace of buybacks compared to recent activity.
In terms of uses of cash, total debt was up in the first quarter as we took advantage of historic low interest rates, with a
debt to capital ratio of about 46% and a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.68, well within our guidance in the 1.8 range or
lower. We also continue working with the Department of Labor on a plan that would contribute a preferred interest in
our AT&T Mobility to fund our pension plans. We continue to be optimistic on the strategy, and expect approval of this
proposal in 2013.
So all in all, another solid financial performance. Our balance sheet is sound, our debt metrics solid, and our strong
cash flow gives us the flexibility to invest in growth initiatives while returning value to shareholders.
Now before we take questions, let me close with a quick recap on slide 15. We're off to a good start to the year, and
what gives us a lot of confidence looking ahead is that we've built a strong – very strong foundation for growth for
2013 and beyond. Our sector position is solid. We're tracking ahead of schedule with our LTE deployment. Our 4G
LTE network is the nation's fastest, and winning quality awards across the country. Our capital spending is more
effective and efficient than we originally expected.
The churn is down and ARPUs are up, and our smartphone and tablet gains continue to be very strong. The number of
subscribers we have on usage-based plans is climbing fast, and on top of this, we had one of our best U-verse quarters
ever. And that's before our Project VIP wireline expansion really starts to ramp, which we expect will only make all of
these things stronger as we move into the second half of 2013 and beyond.

So we feel good about the foundation we've built, we feel good about the momentum we have. We're positioned to
grow even in this slow economy, and we're well positioned to continue returning substantial value to shareholders.
With that, Susan, let's go ahead and take some questions.
Susan Johnson
Thank you, John. Tony, we will now open up the call for our question and answer session.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Michael Rollins with Citi Investment Research. Please
go ahead.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Oh, thanks and good afternoon. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the
business revenue in more detail in terms of the implied erosion of legacy services relative to strategic? Is that being hurt
by the cyclical as well as the secular? And is that something that continues at this rate, or do you see some
improvement coming over the next 12 to 24 months in that segment? Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: So good afternoon, Mike. Real quickly, if you break down the three segments so to speak of
our business revenues into the small business side, we're encouraged by the acceptance of high speed broadband
U-verse type products, but the business is still challenged by a lack of starts. We're seeing some positive improvement
in our wholesale business, but in our government, education and medical are still being really challenged by the
economy and by funding. And enterprise is continuing to be challenged by uncertainty and if you will, delaying
decisions, even though they are spending on speed and advanced data services.
When we look at the overall business services, Mike, I think about it this way. It's hard to predict until we get some
economic clarity. Because while unemployment or regulatory concerns or government spending may be affecting us as
a individual company separately in different ways, it's definitely affecting our customers. And until we get some clarity
on that, it's hard to predict. But what we do feel good about is the position we're in when it turns because we can
provide that combination of integrated services like no other. Hopefully I've answered your question, Mike.
<Q - Michael I. Rollins>: Thanks, John.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Simon Flannery with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Thank you very much. Good afternoon, John. You had very good U-verse numbers. Can you
talk a lot – about what was driving that specifically? It doesn't sound like your footprint has expanded dramatically,
that's going to be later on. Was it promotional activity? I see you've got a few new offers out there. And do you think
that this is sort of a new kind of turning the corner as the DSL base becomes lower?
And then given your sort of leverage is moving up towards your 1.8, what's the latest thinking around potential for
asset sales or other monetizations? Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Thank you, Simon. And quite frankly, on our U-verse positive developments, both in small
business and in consumer, I would tell you that the simple answer is really, really quality execution by our people and
their teams. Certainly there were some promotions. Certainly there was good opportunities that presented itself from
existing assets, but I will tell you they focused on reducing churn, they focused on shortening installation times, they

focused on converting customers from legacy DSL services to the high speed U-verse services. It was really a whole
collection of really quality execution by the team. And I think that's what really drove it. As you can see, we still drove
revenue growth and we still are getting very good revenues on their triple play on the consumer side. So it wasn't just
incentive driven. It was really performance.
With regard to our balance sheet and our wherewithal, I guess the first item I'd point out to you, Simon, with regard to
your second question is as we've shown, we've got a great balance sheet, very strong, strong cash flows, very great
coverage of all of our responsibilities. So we feel good about where we're at. Clearly aware of what's going on in the
industry with regard to monetization strategies, we have a responsibility to look at all those because we're here to
monetize and maximize value for our shareholders. But with the strength of our balance sheet, we can be careful and
prudent with regard to taking those steps, and are not necessarily in a position where we need to do any of that.
<Q - Simon Flannery>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Philip Cusick with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Hi, guys, thanks. I'm thinking about the revenue sort of guidance that you've talked about in
wireless for mid single digits long term, and I'm struggling to figure out – and it sort of goes into subscriber and ARPU
side. As more of the subscribers come from tablets and assuming Digital Life launches fairly soon, we'd love an update
there, ARPU is slowing down. You did 3.5% revenue growth in wireless this quarter. Can that be sustained given sort
of where one, the industry is going and not growing by much, and two, coming to the other side of the smartphone
growth? Or do we really need to prepare ourselves for sort of lower ARPU, lower revenue growth in wireless going
forward? Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Thanks, Phil. First and foremost, we still feel good about our guidance about mid single
digits of revenue growth in the Mobility business. I would suggest to you a couple of things: one, we do still have room
to grow on the smartphones. As we mentioned, sales rates are at 90%. Current customer base is at 70%. That gives us a
lot of room to grow. Secondly, we continue to see the adding of tablets and other data devices, so that's going well.
Third, as we continue to complete our LTE deployment, we expect and we'll continue to see growth in other services
like video and so forth, so that should provide us with future growth opportunities.
And all of that is before we roll out things like Digital Life, the Connected Car, Mobile Premise Solution, and a lot of
the other opportunities that we have moving forward. So we still feel good about where we're at. We're opportunistic
and pleased about where we're going. I think we'll move forward with that. You specifically asked the question about
Digital Life. We're going to launch – I think we've announced we're going to launch 15 markets by the middle of the
year in the spring of this year. And so I think you'll be hearing more about that soon.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: If I can just follow up for a quick second?
<A - John J. Stephens>: Sure.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: It seems like the wireless industry this quarter, at least on a voice basis, is going to be fairly
negative, and it looks like you're negative on your own in terms of voice. Is that an acceptable situation for AT&T?
And can you continue to be sort of negative on voice over time as competitors sort of lose fewer subscribers, or do you
need to turn it up a little bit, and try and be positive there?
<A - John J. Stephens>: Well, I guess – let me make one other point that maybe I should have made sooner, and that
is, if you look at what our churn has done, and the fact that it's continuously going down, we're really optimistic about
growing revenues from that perspective. And as that happens, we'll see impacts on our total revenue base.
But if you're asking are we going to continue to see some form of conversion of revenue from voice to data, that would
not surprise us, but we are positioned well with usage-based plans to capture the revenue opportunity that that data
provides.

So I still feel good about all of those opportunities. We just need to continue to execute and continue to move forward
with our LTE build.
<Q - Philip A. Cusick>: Thanks, John.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from John Hodulik with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Yeah, thanks. John, maybe just a quick follow-up to Phil's question, really more focused on
the ARPU. You saw some deceleration. If you look at some of the components, I think – I believe phone-only ARPU
went from to 2.5% growth last quarter to 2% this quarter. And then the dilution from these other high-margin,
low-ARPU devices almost doubled from 0.6% to 1.1%.
I guess first, what is driving the phone-only deceleration? Is that just – you've still got a lot of penetration to go, but
maybe the incremental penetration from a smartphone standpoint is slowing.
And really if we put all these points together, I mean should we continue to expect to see deceleration going forward, or
is it more of an alternative subs sort of story, and less of an ARPU story?
And then one other thing – I don't know – you guys broke out home-phone customers last quarter. I'm wondering if you
guys are still giving out that number. Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Yeah, John, a couple of things. One, ARPU is always impacted by quarterly fluctuations in
the level of sales and so forth, but quite frankly, this quarter is impacted compared to prior quarters by the change in the
regulatory rates. There was a 10% change in the regulatory fee rates that are charged that are included in our revenues.
And so that I think explains a fair amount of the differentiation in some of the revenue growth. That's all it is.
So from that perspective, when you take that into consideration, still feel real good about where ARPU's going in our
phone-only ARPU and -
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Okay, so the regulatory fee did hit that phone-only ARPU number?
<A - John J. Stephens>: Yes, I mean...
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Okay, I got it.
<A - John J. Stephens>: The USF rates went down from 17.9% to 16.1%, about a 10% reduction.
<Q - John C. Hodulik>: Got it.
<A - John J. Stephens>: So that's impacting all of our growth-rate numbers. It's just part of the process.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Mike McCormack with Nomura Securities. Please go ahead.
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Hi, guys, thanks. John, could you just talk a little bit about the – again on the wireline
margin side, I know there's typically some first-quarter seasonality to that. Are there pieces there we should be thinking
about?
The Project VIP impact, I guess I was expecting more of a sort of a 14% impact on success base, so I'm assuming that's
been pulled forward. Maybe you can just give a little more detail around that?
And then lastly, any reaction to the upgrade policy change on wireless at Verizon? Thanks.

<A - John J. Stephens>: So on wireline margins, specifically with regard to U-verse, a couple of points, Mike, I think
you're hitting on.
One, our expansion of our footprint for U-verse services from Project Velocity is really a later-this-year and 2014 type
event. The sales and success in customer adds on both video and IP broadband was really great execution in this first
quarter. It was an expanded selling space. But with that, we still had success-based cost. And so we'll take those for
these long-term-valuable customers. So that's one aspect of it.
Two, I'd expect that as we expand the footprint and get additional coverage that we get out of Velocity, you'll continue
to see some really solid numbers and some pressure from the success of sales. I just believe the first-quarter results are
a real positive for going forward.
Second, you are right, we always have some first-quarter pressure with regard to margins. That's not unusual, but it's in
the comparison to last year also.
Third -
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Is this a run-rate we should be thinking about, John, as we progress through the next couple
of quarters?
<A - John J. Stephens>: Yeah, I would suggest at this point, we still think we're going to come in slightly below – we
won't change that guidance – slightly below last year's margins amount. But we feel good about the efforts the team has
gone through to manage the margins. And if you think about the challenges we faced in the business revenues, we're
really performing well on cost management.
Mike, on your question with regard to some of the changes going into the marketplace, absolutely, the marketplace is
dynamic and it's changing. And we're looking at those changes and evaluating them, and trying to stay current with all
aspects of it. Don't have anything to announce today, but we're respectful of our competitors in this environment. But
we're also pretty comfortable with the fact that we're going to be able to continue to compete at a very high level.
<Q - Mike McCormack>: Great, thanks, John.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question will come from Jason Armstrong with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jason S. Armstrong>: Hey, great, thank you. John, maybe a couple questions. First on tablets, you obviously had
a really good quarter. You had a partial subsidy model attached to that, and I'm wondering in thinking through that, is
the subsidy maybe something you use just to stimulate demand temporarily and sort of place these devices in the base?
Or is that more of a sort of recurring part of the model, as we go forward?
And then second question, just on leverage, the 1.8 turns – I think my understanding was to create room to invest in
Project VIP and to go through a big capital cycle over the course of three years, and still leave room to buy back shares
aggressively, if you wanted to.
With reducing the capital-spending targets here but still leaving the leverage target out there, it's sort of the same ratio.
Does that signal an intention to continue to tap that capacity for additional share buybacks? I know you said buybacks
are slowing from here, but it seems like you still have plenty of room, if that's the case. Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Okay, great, Jason. Let me cover your second question first.
With regard to the 1.8, it was a couple of things. Yes, it was a recognition of the fact that we're going to have some
higher capital spend. And two, it was also a recognition of historically low interest rates.
If you look at our interest expense, first quarter 2012, first quarter 2013, you'll see that even though our debt levels
have increased, our overall interest expense is down.

And that's really what we were trying to take advantage of is the fact that there is a lot of really inexpensive or
attractively priced debt capital. And with a company like ours who has a very solid dividend, we are trying to be
prudent in making the decisions about which capital to utilize. With that being said, yes, the reduction in the Project
VIP capital projection over the last two years will provide us additional flexibility, and that is very important to us.
With that being said, we're going to stick with what we guided in the presentation, and that is we're going be
opportunistic with the additional buyback. We'd expect to finish the $600 million share authorization in the second
quarter, and we will be opportunistic and potentially buy at a slower pace as we go forward.
The other question I think you had, Jason, was on tablets, and I would suggest to you that you've identified it right. We
put that in place to see how it would work to stimulate demand and to see what kind of – not only take-rates we get on
the tablets, but also what kind of ARPUs we would get.
After our initial testing of that in the fourth quarter, we decided to stay with it, because we have found that the
economics of it make a lot of sense. I won't suggest to you that it's a permanent offering, but I'll suggest to you that
we'll continue to monitor it and make our decisions as we go forward with regard to keeping it in place or adjusting it,
just like we do with all our product offerings.
<Q - Jason S. Armstrong>: Thanks, John.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Colby Synesael with Cowen & Company. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Colby A. Synesael>: Great, I have two questions. First on the regulatory fees both in wireless and wireline,
curious if those all begin on January 1 or if it happened mid-quarter and therefore, there's more of an impact to be seen
in the second quarter? And also how that relates back to your previous guidance of 2% – or greater than 2%
consolidated revenue growth?
And then my second question just has to do with M&A and what's the company's appetite for M&A, particularly
outside the U.S. and even more so in Europe? Has that increased or decreased perhaps over the last – I guess since the
beginning of the year? Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: So welcome, Colby. Let me – first thing I want to mention to you is that right now, we are
not changing our guidance with regard to greater than 2% revenue growth for the year.
We're certainly sensitive to the situation at hand with regard to the economy and the impact it's having on business
revenues. So we want to be respectful of that, and we understand those aspects. So the challenges of the economy and
the challenges it raises for business is something we follow really closely.
With regard to the regulatory fees, those rates were in place for the quarter. That differential was for the first quarter.
The new rates have been established for the second quarter, and I believe the differential year-over-year is about the
same. It's different rates, but it's about the same step-down. So some of that regulatory-fee pressure will continue
throughout the second quarter. We're aware of that, and so we're taking that into account in all of our planning.
With regard to M&A activity, we don't comment on any M&A activity, and I'm not going to do that now.
As we've said before, the real issues we find is that the U.S. marketplace that we operate in is well ahead of the – it
appears to be well ahead of the rest of the world in mobility and the developments around mobility. And as stewards of
our shareholders' assets, we need to see if we can provide and take advantage of the assets and knowledge we have, and
provide value for our shareholders based on what we've learned. But we don't comment on M&A activities, and I won't
comment on any now.

Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from David Barden with Bank of America. Please go ahead.
<Q - David W. Barden>: Hey, guys, thanks for taking the questions.
John, it looks like with the tax benefit in the income statement, and the deferred tax gain in the cash flow statement, it
looks like you guys got about $1 billion tax contribution positive to the quarter. Could you talk a little bit about how
you see that shaping up over the course of the year, contributing to the $14 billion free cash flow or better guidance?
And then obviously how the contribution of the wireless business is going to layer in over the course of the year on that
front?
And then a second question, if I could just kind of go back to this, I just want to be – kind of make sure I understand. I
think what you were saying is that from a competitive standpoint, from a wireless-subscriber-growth standpoint,
AT&T's satisfied with how it did this quarter. Stay the course in terms of general approach to the market, irrespective
of what's going on with T-Mobile. And then as the LTE business kind of ramps up, look to that for future
revenue-growth opportunities. Is that a fair assessment of what you said earlier? Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: Thanks, Dave. Let me take them one at a time.
First of all, on the tax side of the earnings, we recognize the fact that there was about a $0.03 benefit in the income tax
line, a reduction of expense, and that's what we've adjusted in our presentation. If you pull that out, that leaves us with
an effective tax rate just under 33%. And I think those of you follow us know that our kind of normal effective tax rate
is somewhere in that 33% to 34% range. I wouldn't expect that to be any different for the rest of the year.
Secondly, with regard to taxes and cash flow, first of all, we take into account an estimate of our cash tax payments as
we determine cash flow, and as part of our cash from operations, so that's all included.
And we continue to guide that free cash flow will be in excess of $14 billion this year. I understand people questioning
that number, based on the fact that we are $3.9 billion in the first quarter, and that's higher than last year. Understand
the question, but right now, we will continue to guide to greater than $14 billion.
With regard to our Mobility business, make sure I clarify the sense of – we follow the marketplace. We continue to
look at what others are doing, and what we are doing ourselves. And we continue to develop ideas, methodologies, and
processes to be more competitive. The best example I can give you is the Mobile Share plans as well as Digital Life.
So we're doing that all the time. We'll continue to do that. Don't have any new ideas or new product offerings or
bundles to announce to you today, but I don't want to suggest to you that there's any lack of activity on improving our
business or growing it more rapidly than it's growing today.
<Q - David W. Barden>: All right. And, John, just to follow-up quick on how the contribution of the wireless stake is
going to get flowed through the tax line – the cash-flow benefit for the rest of the year?
<A - John J. Stephens>: Yeah, as I said, we've taken into account any of the tax benefits, and cash or expense benefits
into account in our planning in the guidance we gave in January. And quite frankly, the cash flow guidance which I just
refreshed and the EPS guidance which we're also – which we're not changing, has already taken that into account.
<Q - David W. Barden>: All right, got it, thanks. Thanks, guys.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from the line of Tim Horan with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
<Q - Timothy K. Horan>: Thanks, guys, just two quick broad questions. Back on the wireless front, John, maybe to
delve into it a little bit more, do you think you have pricing power in wireless? Has it maybe improved versus where
you were a couple years ago, and do you think you can take advantage of that? And then secondly, maybe you can

delve into on the supplier side a little bit more, it sounds like the CapEx – obviously it's coming in below expectations
for the next couple years which is great, but is that – some of that coming from just better pricing that you're seeing on
the supplier front? And I guess back to the question I have almost every quarter, can we start to see the same thing on
the handset side? Do you think you have a little bit more leverage at this stage on the handset supplier front? Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: So, good to hear from you, Tim. Let me take a few things. One think I would tell you this on
the wireless side, the way I think about it is this improving network that we have and the recognition from RootMetrics
not only on the fastest but the highest quality, and this more rapid deployment than we expected – than I expected with
regard to our LTE, really gives us – gets us feeling good about the opportunities for the overall wireless business to add
more customers, to lower churn, retain more customers, and to generate revenue from usage-based devices. So I think
the – if you will, the powerful piece of our wireless business that's going on now is really this opportunity to utilize that
really powerful LTE network and grow the business. That's how we're focused on it.
With regard to CapEx, I would suggest to you that there's a couple of things going on. One, we got deployment out of
the LTE faster on an accelerated basis – even last year when we had guided to finish at 150 million LTE POPs, and we
had the earnings announcement, we were at about 170 million. And now we're guiding to be nearly 90% complete with
our 300 million POP by the end of this year. So that acceleration is taking some of the CapEx pressure off of 2014 and
2015.
Secondly, we're finding that the integration opportunities when we do – if you will, a bottoms up build plan analysis,
we're finding more integration efficiencies and opportunities than we had originally planned for, and that's driving a lot
of the savings. And third, the ability to get out there quicker is really taking off some of the pressure that we expected
to have on some of our core non-Velocity investments. So those are all combining. We're getting efficiency in the build
and effectiveness of build and pushing it that way. I would suggest that's where the capital savings are coming from.
The last thing, Tim, I would suggest to you is we're always looking at ways to improve the economics of the handset
model. We think that's certainly real important, and we continue to look for ways to do that. But I will tell you we
continue to do it with a focus on the customer, and making sure we develop ideas that are not only focused on
economic efficiency for us, but for customer satisfaction. We have to have – we believe we have to have both pieces of
that to really be successful long term with it.
<Q - Timothy K. Horan>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question in queue will come from Chris Larsen with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. And, Chris
Larsen, your line is open. Please go ahead with your question.
<Q - Chris M. Larsen>: Hi, yeah, I wonder if we could switch over to slide 12 where you talked about the cloud and
hosting there. And two questions specifically, first, if you could talk a little bit about what you've been seeing in terms
of pricing on cloud? There's been a lot made of the recent pricing declines out of Amazon and Rackspace and how that
has affected you? And then given the fact that you've dedicated a slide to it in your slide deck, maybe you can size up
that opportunity? How big does that have to become before it can begin to move the needle here on the top line for
wireline results? Thanks.
<A - John J. Stephens>: So a couple of things. One, with regard to how to move the needle on wireline results, as you
all know, our wireline revenue base is in that $60 billion plus range. So I'll leave it to your own judgment on how big it
needs to get to, if you will, move that needle. But we believe it's a real opportunity for us to help us growing that
revenue, and in also providing us the opportunity to continue to provide those network-based services. So keeping the
traffic on our services as well as providing the security and the other hosting services. So we believe that the
opportunity is strong for us. I would suggest to you even recent events will tell you that with regard to our managed
network and our security opportunities will provide an even better advantage for us. That's one.

With regard to recent pricing activities, I would suggest to you that I think there's going to be continued pricing
movement in this area. We're aware of that, we're prepared for that. But we feel long term we can provide a quality
product with good margins to generate returns for our shareholders, so we think it's very much worth our investment.
And specifically, we believe it because we have the – if you will, dual side of not only providing the cloud and the
hosting, but also being able to provide the mobility connectivity to that for a customer's employees base. So we feel
really good about both sides of it.
<Q - Chris M. Larsen>: Thank you.
<A - Susan Johnson>: I think we've got time for just one more question.
Operator
Thank you very much, and that final question will come from Brett Feldman with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brett J. Feldman>: Thanks for getting me in. So some of the earlier questions were sort of alluding to the fact
that your postpaid phone base slipped little bit in the quarter, and obviously the first quarter is seasonally slow, and so
it's hard to read into that. But if we put seasonality aside, what do you anticipate for your traditional phone base going
forward? Is this something that we should see outside of a seasonally slow period continue to grow? Or are you
somewhat indifferent now? Not because you don't care, but just because the real revenue growth driver going forward
is data volume on your network, and not necessarily the net change in your phone base quarter to quarter?
<A - John J. Stephens>: Yeah, so I think we do find it important to continue to, if you will, grow our phone base but
more importantly, convert our phone base. Because if you think about that, the differential between 70% of our
postpaid and the 90% sales flow, if you think about that on our base, it's 14 million customers. And when you convert
them to smartphones, you may think of them as a phone, but they're generating significant data usage on the network
and an opportunity for real revenue creation.
So we are focused on it, but we're also focused on growing our customer base. I don't want to leave you with the
impression that it's just conversion. It's both, and we believe we're positioned well to do that. So I think it's both aspects
of that. But when you've got the quality network like we do and great sales operations like we have and a
customer-focused approach, we're optimistic about our ability to be very successful.
<Q - Brett J. Feldman>: All right, thanks for taking the question.
John J. Stephens
With that, I want to thank you for being with us this afternoon. We've had a solid start to the year and believe we've
built a very strong foundation for growth going forward. Our momentum is solid, the balance sheet's strong, and our
Project VIP expansion is going to bring us even more opportunity. As always, we thank you for being on the call, and
we thank you for your interest in AT&T. Good night.
