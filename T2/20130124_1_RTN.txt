MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Raytheon Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. My
name is Chanelle and I'll be the operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being
recorded for replay purposes.
I would like now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Todd Ernst, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please
proceed.
Todd Ernst
Thank you, Chanelle. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our fourth quarter conference call.
The results we announced this morning, the audio feed of this call and the slides we'll reference are available on our
website at Raytheon.com. Following this morning's call, an archive of both the audio replay and a printable version of
the slides will be available in the Investor Relations section of our website.
With me today are Bill Swanson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Dave Wajsgras, our Chief Financial
Officer. We'll start with some brief remarks by Bill and Dave and then move onto questions.
Before I turn the call over to Bill, I'd like to caution you regarding our forward-looking statements. Any matters
discussed today that are not historical facts, particularly comments regarding the company's future plans, objectives and
expected performance, constitute forward-looking statements. These statements are based on a wide range of
assumptions that the company believes are reasonable, but are subject to a range of uncertainties and risks that are
summarized at the end of our earnings release and are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.

William H. Swanson
Thank you, Todd. Good morning, everyone. Raytheon delivered solid operating results in 2012. Our focus on lowering
costs and program execution drove higher than expected earnings and cash flow for the year. Demand for our broad
portfolio of cutting edge technologies and innovative solutions resulted in bookings well in excess of expectation, and
we ended 2012 with a record funded backlog. Fourth quarter bookings were strong at $7.9 billion resulting at a
book-to-bill of 1.23. International comprised a robust 40% of fourth quarter bookings.
When looking at the full year, our book-to-bill was 1.09 and was driven by strong domestic orders for missiles, radars,
training, communication and classified programs, as well as international orders for command and control systems,
precision munitions and sensors among a multitude of other awards. We also exceeded our initial bookings expectation
by about 6%, ending the year with $26.5 billion of total bookings with domestic demand a little higher and
international also strong. In the fourth quarter, international revenue increased 8% over last year and represents 27% of
the quarter's total revenue. For all of 2012, international revenue was 26% of our total revenue, setting the standard for
our industry and continuing to validate our international strategy.
As a technology and innovation leader, we continued our investment strategy to strengthen our capabilities, grow our
market position and better meet customer needs. During the fourth quarter, we completed two acquisitions. SafeNet
Government Solutions is a world-class provider of encryption technology that aligns well with Raytheon's advanced
strategic and tactical communications capabilities and enhances our position in these markets.
Teligy specializes in wireless RF communication, vulnerability analysis, reverse engineering, and rapid prototyping.
These acquisitions ensure that we are well-positioned in communications and cyber markets for the future.
Looking at the defense environment, the U.S. government averted the brunt of the fiscal cliff earlier this month.
However, the ultimate outcome for sequestration was delayed and not resolved and a new potential implementation
date for sequestration is now March 1. The government continues to operate under a continuing resolution for fiscal
year 2013 that runs through March 27, or roughly halfway through its fiscal year. It's important to remember that we've
been operating under various CRs and the threat from sequestration for a while now and the company continues to
perform well. This is a testament to the strength of our strategy and the operating talent across the company.
As we've discussed on previous calls, we're planning for potential various outcomes; regardless, our focus remains on
continually finding new ways to deliver world-class technology, while at the same time reducing our costs and
improving our efficiency, whatever the environment. With our culture of continuous improvement, it's how we manage
and run the company.
Our latest example of this is the formation of our Global Business Services Group or GBS that we announced last
week. GBS will leverage common systems across the company enabling simplified processes and increasing
operational speed and agility, while providing value to our customers. It brings together the best practices from the
company's supply chain management, finance, information technology and human resource functions to drive increased
customer satisfaction and improving efficiencies. And it will build on the continuing success of our ongoing enterprise
efficiency initiatives by applying proven service delivery practices more broadly across the company.
Before concluding, let me spend a minute on the strength of the Raytheon culture and some of the recognition we
received last year in 2012. Raytheon continued to deploy its best in class environmental health and safety programs and
the company had its safest year in its history. Our recordable injury rate improved 8.6% over 2011. These results are
industry-leading and are direct result of our world class processes and operating discipline.
I am proud of the team's achievement and we'll strive to build upon our success in the future. Further, the company
once again achieved a 100% score on the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index, marking the eighth
consecutive year we've achieved this recognition. Raytheon was also recognized as one of America's Most

use their time, talent and resources to improve the quality of life where they do business.
Collectively, these achievements reflect the strength of our vision, our strategy, goals and values, as principles that bind
each of us and our employees together with a common mission of customer success. In summary, Raytheon had a good
year. Of course, our solid operating performance in 2012 would not have been possible without the hard work and
dedication of the Raytheon team.
During a year with more than its share of external headwinds, the team remained focused and executed well. Together,
we're prepared for the future and stand ready to continue to deliver value to our customers and our shareholders.
With that, let me turn it over to Dave.
David C. Wajsgras
Okay. Thanks, Bill. I have a few opening remarks, starting with the fourth quarter and full year results; then I'll discuss
our outlook for 2013. And after that, Bill and I will open up the call for questions.
During my remarks, I'll be referring to the web slides that we issued earlier this morning, which are posted on our
website. So if everyone could please move to page three. We delivered solid results in both the quarter and the full
year. We booked $26.5 billion in new business, ending the year with a $36.2 billion backlog.
Our sales were up slightly compared with last year's fourth quarter and down 1.5% for the full year. Fourth-quarter
adjusted EPS was $1.60. For the full year, adjusted EPS of $6.21 was up 6%. For the quarter, our adjusted EPS came in
higher than the guidance we provided you in October, but below last year's fourth quarter. On a full-year basis,
operational improvements were relatively consistent in 2012 compared with 2011. However, you'll recall that in 2011,
operational improvements were heavily weighted toward the fourth quarter.
We also generated strong operating cash flow of $1 billion for the quarter and $2 billion for the year. We were able to
achieve very strong cash collections across all of our businesses. This strong performance allowed us to make a
discretionary pension contribution of $500 million in the fourth quarter of 2012. Additionally, during the fourth quarter,
the company repurchased 1.8 million shares of common stock for $100 million, bringing the full-year 2012 repurchases
to 15.9 million shares for about $825 million.
As we previously disclosed, in the fourth quarter 2012, the company issued $1.1 billion of 10-year debt at 2.5% using
the proceeds primarily to retire our 2014 and 2015 maturities. We have now lengthened our weighted average debt
maturity structure to about 13 years and locked in attractive interest rates over the longer term. The next maturity isn't
due until 2018. The company ended the year with a strong balance sheet and net debt of $687 million.
Turning now to page four, let me go through some of the details of our fourth quarter and full-year results. We had
strong bookings of $7.9 billion in the quarter and $26.5 billion for the full year, resulting in a backlog of $36.2 billion.
The book-to-bill was 1.23 in the quarter and 1.09 for the year, which exceeded the high end of our initial expectations
from back in January of 2012. The company ended 2012, with a record funded backlog of about $24 billion, an
increase of over $1.5 billion from year-end 2011. It's worth noting that both Missile Systems and Space and Airborne
Systems had outstanding bookings performance for the full year 2012.
In the fourth quarter, we had several significant international awards, including $650 million at NCS for a C4I program,
500 million of missiles for Paveway, $289 million at SAS for a sensor program and two contracts for about $300
million each at IDS. One was for an Early Warning Surveillance Radar and the other was to provide technical and
logistics support for a Hawk and Patriot Air and Missile Defense Program.
Other significant bookings included $332 million at IDS, for TPY-2 radars for the Missile Defense Agency, $251
million on the Zumwalt-class destroyer program for the U.S. Navy and $511 million at IIS on a number of classified
programs. MS booked $303 million for Tomahawk for the U.S. Navy and an international customer. Total company
backlog increased by more than $850 million over yearend 2011.

Page 4 of 15
Turning now to page five, we achieved fourth quarter sales of $6.4 billion, slightly higher than the comparable period
last year. Looking at the businesses, net sales at IDS were about $1.3 billion in the quarter, up 2%. The increase was
primarily due to higher sales on a TPY-2 radar program for an international customer.
Missile Systems' net sales were $1.5 billion in the quarter, an increase of 4%, primarily driven by higher sales on the
SM-3 and the Rolling Airframe Missile Programs. It's also worth noting that we've re-baselined the AMRAAM
contract with the U.S. Air Force. We now have an updated delivery plan. We are executing well with a qualified second
source supplying rocket motors, allowing us to deliver completed missiles to our customer.
Space and Airborne Systems had net sales of $1.4 billion in the quarter, up 3% as a result of higher sales on an
international tactical airborne radar program. IIS had net sales of $755 million and NCS had net sales of $1.1 billion,
both essentially in line with the same period last year. Technical Services had net sales of $831 million, down a little
more than $50 million from the comparable period a year ago, due to the completion of the National Science
Foundation Polar contract in the first quarter of 2012.
If you move to page six, we delivered solid operational performance in the quarter, and for the full year. When you
compare margins to our prior guidance, all of our businesses met or exceeded the range that we had provided in
October. As I previously mentioned, on a full year basis, operational improvements were relatively consistent in 2012
compared with 2011.
However, 2011 operational improvements were heavily weighted toward the fourth quarter. Further, as I discussed on
the October call, our results include the costs associated with ending a supplier agreement at NCS. As I stand back and
look at the year, we delivered strong margins. Our adjusted operating margin increased 20 basis points for the full year.
We continue to see meaningful contributions from our ongoing productivity efforts.
On page seven, you'll see both the fourth quarter and full year adjusted EPS. In the fourth quarter of 2012, adjusted
EPS was $1.60 and for the full year was $6.21, compared with $5.85 in 2011, an increase of 6%. The increase for the
full year was driven by strong results from operations and capital deployment actions, specifically share repurchases.
As I previously mentioned, the company generated strong operating cash flow of $2 billion in 2012.
Moving on to our 2013 guidance on page eight. We see sales in the range of between $23.6 billion and $24.1 billion.
As for pension, we see the FAS/CAS adjustment of $286 million, which reflects our investment returns in 2012 of over
12% and the December 31 discount rate of 4.15%. We expect net interest to be between $200 million and $210 million.
We see the average diluted share count to be between $324 million and $327 million on a full-year basis.
As for our effective tax rate, we expect it to be approximately 30%, which includes the R&D tax credit for both 2012
and 2013, which has an impact of about $0.15. The accounting rules required a full retroactive benefit from the 2012
R&D tax credit worth about $0.08 to be booked in the first quarter 2013.
In 2013, we see our adjusted EPS to be in the range of $5.65 to $5.80. In addition to the FAS/CAS adjustment, it's
worth noting that our 2013 adjusted EPS also excludes the $0.08 benefit of the R&D tax credit that relates to 2012. We
see 2013 EPS to be in the range of $5.16 to $5.31. Our operating cash flow guidance is between $2 billion and $2.2
billion. Lastly, I do want to point out that our initial 2013 guidance does not include the potential effects of
sequestration.
Continuing on to page nine, from a sales perspective, we see our domestic business down, offset partially by strength in
our international business. We expect 2013 adjusted margins to continue to be solid and in the 12.3% to 12.5% range.
Given the existing uncertainty that the industry faces and to give us flexibility, we've included 20 basis points of costs
in our 2013 margin guidance related to accelerating facility utilization improvements and operating initiatives.
We are continuing to take a number of actions to improve the operating structure of the company. We are accelerating
facility consolidations and as you are already aware, we launched Global Business Services. These, combined with our
ongoing enterprise-wide supply chain efforts, directly strengthen our competitive posture going forward. We've
included the cost of implementing these actions in our 2013 guidance.

If you would now turn to page 10, we've provided you with our 2013 outlook by quarter. You'll notice the improvement
in sales cadence as we go through the year which reflects program timing and the current environment. We expect
bookings to be back-half weighted, similar to last year.
And finally on page 11. As we've done in the past, we provided a summary of the financial impact from pensions in
2012, as well as the projected impact for 2013 through 2015, holding all assumptions constant. We believe this will
help you better understand our company over the next few years. I do want to point out that with these assumptions
held constant, we expect the FAS/CAS adjustment to significantly improve after 2013, turning positive in 2015. If
interest rates were to increase, we would see an even faster improvement in the FAS/CAS adjustment.
Let me conclude by saying then in 2012, Raytheon delivered strong operating performance, by focusing on program
execution and lowering costs, our margins, earnings and operating cash flow were all ahead of expectations.
Book-to-bill was strong, our backlog in total and our funded backlog increased year-over-year. Our international
opportunities continue to be robust. We have a strong balance sheet, and net debt of less than $700 million. We
continue to find new ways to deliver world class technologies, improve efficiency and drive productivity. We remain
confident in our future and in our ability to continue to create value for our customers and our shareholders.
So with that, Bill and I will open the call up to questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Joe Nadol, JPMorgan.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning, Joe.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Bill, could we go to the NCS segment? It looks like your guidance there is for margins
coming down a bit, and I know this is where a lot of the operational activity or operational tempo type of activity in
your business has been located, but you've been restructuring that business to some degree. Can you just give us an
update on what's happening there?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, sure, Joe. We feel confident that that business has stabilized, I guess a good way to
say it. As you know, part of the focus there has been to concentrate on the Network part of the business and show why
our customers need to be presented with accurate, actionable data on the move. And so for us, when we look at their
full-year sales and margin, they were consistent with the guidance we gave back in Q3. And in Q4, NCS had bookings
of about $1.5 billion, including a key international C4I win, which drove their full year book-to-bill about 1.13, in line
with guidance. And bookings increased about $500 million over 2011, positioning them well for 2013. So taken
together, I feel pretty good about where we're going and where we're headed in that regard.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: So, Joe, let me just add one thing. The 2013 guidance also includes about 50 basis points
related to the encryption acquisition that we made. So if you adjust for that, it's basically in line with 2012.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Got it, okay. And then, Dave, just on the cash flow and the pension, it looks like you guys
anticipate a positive variance in your cash flow of $600 million, I think, from pension from 2012 to 2013. Just looking
at the CAS going up and your contributions going down and your guidance calls for cash flow that's flat to slightly up.
What are the opportunities there? Are there or are there other headwinds that you're dealing with, such that your cash
flow wouldn't be a little higher?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: No, your math is right. There is a swing in the pension. There's a couple of things. We had
a very strong performance from a cash perspective in Q4, both on the collection side and with respect to

performance-based payments and advances. So as you look at 2013, there is about a $300 million swing relative to
timing between Q4 and Q1 from a cash standpoint. And we are continuing to post very strong cash performance of
between $2 billion and $2.2 billion, as we go into 2013. So there's nothing remarkable going on there. We continue to
perform well from that perspective.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay, thanks. And just finally, could you quantify when you get the question, if sequestration
as currently – as it currently looks – or is scheduled right now kicks in, what's the impact of sales in 2013, what's your
answer?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Joe, let me take a minute and say that we need to get focused on getting sequestration
fixed. It's the elephant in the room, it sucks all the air out of every conversation. And by postponing the debt ceiling, we
averted a government shutdown, which means federal checking or checks not going out to servicemen or people
operating in our government. It would have been a horrible outcome. Sequestration cuts deeply into areas that Dems
favor and cuts in areas that Republicans favor. And for me, I think sequestration sets the baseline upon which both
sides will do the budget. It puts the budget where it belongs. It's about making hard decisions that need to be made, and
we need to make them strategically and not across the board in a peanut butter fashion.
So having said all of that, I'm not sure what the outcome of sequestration is, since OMB and DoD have really not
passed any guidance down. But if I had to look into a crystal ball and use all the intelligence that I can think of and kind
of throw a dart at the wall, I would tell you it probably means an additional point or two to us, as we look at the
balance, and you have to remember, we have our strongest funded backlog in our history.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Okay. Thank you, guys.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Okay. I hope that helps, Joe.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Hey, Jason.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Dave, you mentioned that there's a 20 basis point headwind in the year from a margin
perspective, driven by some of these cost initiatives that you're engaging in. I was wondering if you might perhaps
describe to us what the eventual benefit you think will come out of those from a margin perspective. And when you
think we might see those benefits?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: So let me start by saying we are continuing to take a lot of productivity actions. And we're
accelerating these in a number of areas. Obviously, there are some implementation costs which you're addressing,
specifically with the utilization actions. And we expect more of these due to acceleration than in the prior years. I think
going forward, these actions position us more competitively. And with the environment that we expect to be seeing
over the next few years, it positions us well amongst the peer group.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Okay. And then on the CAS harmonization earlier in the 2012 year, you were able to begin
increasing your billing rates, and just want to get an update on how successful those increased billing rates have gone.
Have those stuck, and are we actually going to see the full benefits that you might have or you might be able to see in
the 2014 and 2015 timeframe from the harmonization efforts?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: That is playing out as we had anticipated about a year ago. And there's nothing new to
report from that perspective. We expect the cash benefit to start being realized as we move into 2014 and continue to
progress each year thereafter for about a three- or four-year timeframe. So there's nothing new there, and that's going

well on all fronts.
<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: Great, thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Yair Reiner of Oppenheimer.
<Q - Yair Reiner>: Yes, thank you. So given the strong bookings you've had in each of the last two years, is it
reasonable to expect that maybe next year bookings are going to be more on the order one-to-one or do you still expect
to come in above one-to-one?
<A - William H. Swanson>: We expect bookings around 1.0, as you point out. We had a good year. This year we –
when we look at the bookings for 2013, we expect those to be around $24 billion, plus or minus $500 million. We
expect about 28% to 30% of those to be international, which is strong for us and one-to-one or a little over one-to-one.
<Q - Yair Reiner>: Great, and then just a follow-up question on the operating margins. Even if I take account of the
20 bps of cost associated with the streamlining of the business, it looks like you're modeling quite a contraction in
profitability in the next year. Is there anything fundamental going on, or is this kind of the standard conservatism that
you have at this point of the cycle?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Right, I wouldn't characterize it as conservatism. There is some mix and timing impacts as
we go into 2013. There are some long-duration production programs that are ramping down. We have a number of
development programs ramping up, as well as some international production programs ramping up. So there is a mix
impact, and again if you add back the 20 basis points for the cost efficiency programs that we are implementing, and
roughly 10 basis points at the company level for the encryption acquisition, we believe that the margin profile is
resulting in very strong margin performance. So there's nothing, again, that's different there. We think as we move
ahead, we'll continue to post very strong margins and solid earnings.
<Q - Yair Reiner>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question comes from Carter Copeland with Barclays.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Hey, good morning, gentlemen.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: A couple of bigger-picture questions. This one for Dave. I know you guys have been pretty
consistent and balanced in your cash deployment efforts and in your strategy and both in your communications, but as
you think conceptually about this year, and as I look at where the balance sheet is now with the debt termed out, you'll
be in a kind of net cash position by, looks like Q3. The balance sheet looks the best it has in a long time. To Joe's point,
you're going to be generating a lot of cash this year. Presumably at this point later in the year, we'll have a lot more
visibility about where the budget is. Is there any potential that you'd give stronger consideration to returning more cash
to shareholders, or how does that thought process go given the progress you've made on the balance sheet and given the
cash generation you expect?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: We do not contemplate any wholesale changes with respect to our capital deployment
priorities. You're correct when you point out the health of the balance sheet and the strength of our cash flow. It does
give us an opportunity to be flexible with respect to importantly investing in ourselves, returning cash to shareholders,
investing in the pension, looking at niche acquisitions, but from an overall standpoint, I wouldn't suggest any
significant changes in the way we think about capital deployment.

<Q - Carter Copeland>: Okay, thanks. And one for Bill, just bigger picture – excuse me, we now have the election
behind us. We're contemplating changes around the Department. We obviously have some Congressional changes, but
given its importance to your international business, I wondered if you might speak to any potential changes you see for
the FMS process as we move into a second term administration, some Congressional changes, some changes at – at the
Department. Is there – is there scope to sell more goods internationally? Is there pressure in any way? How are you
thinking about that given its importance to your business?
<A - William H. Swanson>: You hit the nail on the head. One of the things that having – going into in my 40th or 41st
year here at the company, I've seen a lot. And one of the things that I'm really encouraged about is that the Department
and others see the importance of the FMS process. For us, we've got a robust pipeline here of activity that we're
working on, especially either here in the first quarter or throughout the year. And I would say that the Department,
State Department and the Administration understands that foreign military sales help us bridge the gap, as we go
through this – these headwinds in the sense that if we have these programs in our factories, they help keep our
overheads in control.
They help in some cases to lower them which allows the U.S. to make the decisions they need to be made and we're
working with the Department and I can say personally I am doing it in the sense of how we look at the timing of U.S.
orders versus FMS orders and how do we balance our factories that way? I am encouraged, the environment really
forces this, but people are listening and they are trying to help in the process and we have had a number of CNs go
through the building. And I expect the nice thing that Senator Kerry is confirmed, when he is confirmed as Secretary of
State, he really understands this because he headed up Foreign Relations on the Senate side. So I would say, it's bright
and not dim.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: Great. Thanks for the color, Bill.

Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein, Wells Fargo.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Good morning, Sam.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Just one question I just wanted to follow up on where I guess Carter started which is, if I
think about 2012, across the industry and to some extent Raytheon as well, there was a slowdown in the pace of using
cash, I want to say, hoarding some cash in advance of sequestration and continuing resolution. That situation hasn't
really changed. So, I guess, I am trying to think about, does that mean the pace of buybacks as we go forward in 2013
should also be relatively slow until we get some resolution?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Sam, the guidance that we provided with respect to the average outstanding diluted share
count, 324 million to 327 million, suggests a repurchase plan, directionally in line with 2012, and that's why I was
suggesting – when I answered the earlier question with respect to cash being returned to shareholders. We'll also be
addressing any change to the dividend as we move forward in the year. We're following the same cadence that we have
in prior years and will be discussing this with the board, as we do throughout the year and talking with the shareholders
as we likely close out the first quarter.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Thank you. And then, just if I look at the segment guidance for 2013 – why on a
year-over-year basis do you seem to have more of a decline in NCS and SAS than the other segments – are there certain
programs ending – is it an OCO assumption, really what's behind those two segments?

<A - David C. Wajsgras>: So with respect to NCS, the lower margin is driven by mix, primarily U.S. Army sensor
program is nearing completion, it's partially offset by a ramp up on new international programs, and again we do have
about 50 basis points of impact related to acquisition accounting for the fourth quarter acquisition in that group. With
respect to SAS, the operating income declines over 12 due to – again, the change in mix. Here it's primarily due to
international sales moderating slightly, specifically on long duration production programs, combined with higher sales
on new development programs. So, again, there is nothing too unusual happening from an SAS perspective.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn, Credit Suisse.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: You said, Bill or maybe Dave, you said this, that there is no sequester in the guidance, but
what level of cuts are contemplated in the guidance, and if we – you also mentioned, that if we do get a full sequester,
it's a point or two. How much worse is it in 2014, just given that it's going to be back end of the year timing?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yeah, as you know, we don't give any guidance in 2014, and that one's really hard to
figure out, Rob, because from a point of view of how are the cuts going to be made? I know there are many on the Hill
that are trying to give the Secretary and the Department the ability to line up their priorities with their strategies and
make the cuts. If they're forced into a peanut butter approach, where everything gets spread the same. Then different
outcomes happen. For us, I always think of Raytheon being different, when you look at 26% of our sales being
international and having a strong funded backlog, not being – or agnostic to platforms, I like to think we're going to
fare better than anybody else going into these headwinds. So I would tell you in 2014, I look for us to be better than
others.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Okay, and then just to follow up on that. Dave, in your revenue guidance, how should we
think about organic growth domestically versus international in 2013?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: So the range of international growth is 3% to 5% and from a domestic standpoint, we look
to be down about 3% to 5%. So net-net, that's – if you stand back, that's about 1% to 3% down overall from a company
perspective.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: Okay. And then just last thing, a clarification, what was the underlying margin at NCS when
you adjust for the supplier agreement?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: The supplier agreement cost us about $17 million to end that agreement. There is another
point I'd like to make here, we also had an inventory write down in that group worth about $14 million. So combined,
it's about $30 million.
<Q - Robert Spingarn>: That's pretty meaningful. Okay, thanks, Bill.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Okay.

<Q - Robert Stallard>: Bill, a couple of quarters ago, you commented that some of the acquisition targets that
[indiscernible] (40:11) were too expensive. You made a couple of small deals this quarter. Does that mean these prices
started to come down into your comfort level?
<A - William H. Swanson>: No, the small deals, we look at each one of them on an independent basis; the wireless RF
is a key capability and especially for vulnerability. I think people have heard me say anything that has an aperture,
meaning an antenna or something that takes in signals, is just a door we can knock on to open. And so we wanted to
have these capabilities even more so for our customers, because we think that's something our customers are going to
face as they go forward here. Right now, I can tell you I've not seen a reduction in market prices; everybody still thinks
they're beachfront properties.
And so for us, we're pretty disciplined here about how we go and do that, but as you look to the future here, people are
going to have to evaluate what they have and maybe the prices will get better. But right now, for us, they're really based
on the capabilities we need as a company, and then we draw a line in the sand on what we're willing to pay for
something.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Okay. And on the export front, you've clearly had several years now of good growth in export
bookings. How long do you think this trend is going to last? Do you think it's going to be strong enough to sustain you
over, say a three- or four-year period if the DoD budget's heading down?
<A - William H. Swanson>: I feel pretty good about the international. It's still a complicated world out there.
Everybody faces threats, whether you're in the Mideast or whether you're in Asia or other parts of the world. People
still want to know what's going on on their borders. So the surveillance or the ISR capability and once they know that,
they need to tie it into the command and control, and people are worried about missiles now, so missile defense is key
in that regard. And then cyber, being able to protect your assets and your communication in your nodes and country are
important. So I could go on and on, and I just – I'm encouraged as we go forward here that the international
marketplace is one that, from a strategy point of view, we saw it a number of years ago, and you see us constantly
getting our booking and our sales up on a year-over-year basis. So to answer to your question, I feel pretty good about
it.
<Q - Robert Stallard>: Okay. Thank you very much.

Our next question comes from Doug Harned, Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: I'm interested in – when you talk about bookings, a very good year this past year.
Backlogs are up – funded backlogs are up in every unit except for Technical Services, yet you're guiding to lower
revenues in 2013. Is this conservatism? Do you expect something different in terms of timing with respect to
converting these backlogs? What's happening there?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: So let me start by saying our international sales for 2013 are projected to be up 3% to 5%
and domestically down about 3% to 5%. You do need to consider program duration on our new awards and the general
headwinds in the environment. So you are right, we did see strong orders in 2012. We had a book-to-bill of 1.09, some
of which was accelerated from 2013. We had a couple of multi-year awards in 2012, specifically at Missile Systems,
that are longer in duration and normally would have been funded in annual increments. We also received some longer
duration awards at SAS. Our bookings in 2013 are down slightly with a book-to-bill of just around 1 or maybe 1 plus a
little bit. And the strength in international doesn't quite offset what's happening domestically.
<A - William H. Swanson>: And, Doug, I would add what Dave said that, one of the things that we're seeing and I'll
have better color on by midyear is some of our international customers are seeing what we can do to accelerate, which

could have an effect, but it's a little early right now. But a couple initial discussions are, can we pull some stuff to the
left here.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Well, and on that, could you talk about your expectations for some of these awards? In
particular, I know we've seen Turkey and Kuwait kind of slip and then out there is this – the DSCA notification on
Qatar which is quite large. Can you talk a little bit about the specific things you're looking at for the year?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Sure. I'd be happy to do it. It's – the nice part is, I want to put in perspective that we did
increase our bookings above our expectations. So even with the movement, we met what we said we were going do
plus a little something extra. And I really want to say that, because you know us long enough that, many years ago if
something slipped, that would be a huge disaster and that's not the case, because we have a super strong portfolio today.
So if you look at it, Kuwait, we might have expected that in the fourth quarter. We expect it this quarter. It's in-country,
just waiting for the signatures and they have a process there, so, we're forecasting that for this quarter. We expect it at
$750 million plus or minus, the award will be larger than that, but that will be the initial award, because services and
spares come a little bit later. We've got Oman in the GBADs, which is a ground-based air defense system. We expect
that decision in the first half of this year. Probably around the July timeframe, that's about $1.5 billion, could be $0.5
billion larger. Turkey, Patriot, clearly there, everyone knows it's no secret that they have Patriots on the line now that
they've gotten from NATO.
We expect a decision here on that in March, they were going to make it in January, but they went back to get some
more data that is competitive there, but from our standpoint we are doing everything to make sure it's in our
wheelhouse, that's a couple billion dollars. Qatar, as you mentioned, there is a CN approved in December, that's for 11
fire units and missiles. We expect an award in late 2013, later in the year here, that's a couple billion dollars. Then you
throw in $100 million here or there for Paveways, another $750 million or so for missiles internationally, our ATM
business is about $200 million this year for radars and systems and then we've got some airborne sensing programs
we're working on for about $1 billion. So that's just a few of the international things that are going on in the company to
give you an idea. I hope that helps.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: No, that's good. Thank you.

Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr, Cowen & Company.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Yes, thanks so much, good quarter, guys. So...
<A - William H. Swanson>: Thank you, Cai.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: I guess a follow-on to Doug; what about – I've been hearing about Saudi, are they potentially
in the market to buy anything from you?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Yes, they're one of our great customers. We've been there for 50-plus years and I would
say Raytheon's reputation there is about as good as it's ever been, Cai, and we feel good about it. They're going to –
they're looking at additional missile defense capabilities. They're doing an analysis of [ph] SNAP (48:28), which is the
Navy end of the business. So, we feel very good about what we're doing there and the kind of work we're doing for
them.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Could that result in any meaningful business awards in 2013?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Maybe at the end of the year, but definitely 2014.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Got it. And then you've been sort of complaining about mix going the wrong way. If I look at
IDS and add back the 20 bps, the margins are essentially flat with an admittedly good 2012, but isn't your mix maturing

there, more Patriots and then we have Zumwalt work that you've been going for a while, moves back up, so is there
opportunity for the margins to be better at IDS?
<A - William H. Swanson>: Cai, I think Dave did a good job, not because he is sitting next to me here. But I thought
he did a good job explaining the mix issue and you know as well as I do that when we start our international jobs, we
start them lower, because there is risk associated with it till we are able to get through the milestones, get our suppliers
going and everything. So part of that is the timing and as Dave would say, the mix. Zumwalt we feel good about, third
ship is nailed down here, we've got some of that awarded in December. But there is also some awards there that are tied
up in the continuing resolution because as you know and I know the CR won't let you release any funds higher than
what was obligated before. So, soon as the CR gets through then some funds will be released and we'll be off and
running. We expect Zumwalt to probably be in about the $300 million range on sales consistent year-over-year.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: And last one, as you look at your margin guidance, could you comment which areas do you
think maybe have the most opportunity to do better than you projected, and which are the ones where maybe you are
nervous you might have trouble hitting the numbers?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: So, Cai, that's an excellent question. And that's why we provide ranges for each one of the
businesses. We are obviously targeting internally for strength in every one of our businesses across the board. But at
this stage, late January, I think it's fair to say that we've provided the bookends and we see every one of our businesses
working through that, within those bookends throughout the year.

Our next question comes from George Shapiro, Shapiro Research.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning, George.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Dave, I – this is the first quarter you've had year-over-year decline in margin as well as
sequential in, I mean, an awful long time. Why shouldn't I conclude that effectively the margins peaked in 2012 and
your guidance, even though you're usually conservative for 2013, has them down a little bit more?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: George, I joined the company about seven years ago when people were suggesting our
margins peaked seven years ago. And...
<A - William H. Swanson>: And every year since...
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: And I believe – and I believe I've been asked that question about 111 times since then. And
every year we've continued to show improvement; it doesn't mean that that happens each and every quarter or each and
every year, but over time, we believe we'll continue to improve margins and returns. Now, 2012, the cadence with
respect to our operational improvements were weighted in the first nine months of the year. And comparing the fourth
quarter 2012 to 2011, the operational improvements or what some termed the EAC adjustments were weighted in the
fourth quarter of 2011 as opposed to the fourth quarter of 2012.
Moving forward we're continuing to take a lot of actions relative to cost and productivity improvements. We've talked
to some of those today. Our guidance includes about 20 basis points relative to implementing some of those actions, I'd
say over the longer-term, three, four, five years out, we would continue to see some upward movement from a margin
and return perspective.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: But, Dave, if I look at like EACs on average, I don't know what the fourth quarter was yet,
but have been incremental to the tone of 2 to 3 percentage points of margin and if you go back several years ago, that

was more like 1%, 1.5%. With some of these production programs ending – I mean why wouldn't those EAC levels go
back to where they were several years ago?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: So they do run on average in the mid 2% range. They are weighted toward fixed price
programs, obviously, as well as our production programs both domestically and internationally. As we continued to
expand our international footprint, we continue to see opportunities to drive productivity in those areas. So I would
suggest taken as a whole, the makeup of the backlog and the makeup of the pipeline from a growth perspective
suggests that we ought to be able to and we're confident in continuing to drive productivity improvements.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. And, and then I'll go back to my simple one that you probably have at your
fingertips anyway. Of the 3% to 5% domestic decline in 2013, what's the classified component of that?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Well, for 2013, what we're seeing is classified bookings and sales to be in the range of 14%
to 16% of the total.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Which would imply what kind of percentage increase over 2012?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Well, right now, you'd have to back into the range, but again, I think at this stage, the 14%
to 16% of the total is the best way to provide that information.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: And that was the same in 2012?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Well, in 2012, our classified sales grew 1. – well, let me step back for a minute. Classified
bookings for the year were 16% of total bookings and up 30% over 2011.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Classified sales for the year were 16% of our total sales and in line with 2011 – actually up
a little bit.
<Q - George D. Shapiro>: Okay. Thanks very much.

Sure. And our final question comes from the line of David Strauss, UBS.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Good morning.
<A - William H. Swanson>: Good morning.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Bill, I know you talked about the guidance not reflecting sequestration, but are you assuming
we actually get a budget this year, or are you assuming we have a full year continuing resolution?
<A - William H. Swanson>: For us, right now, it looks like the CR is scheduled at the end of March. My gut tells me
it's more like at the end of the May with everything lining up, and if I had to guess on sequestration and this is a guess,
I'll qualify it, that will probably end up touching the stove, and feeling the heat, which means it will happen, and then
people are going to work to put it back in the box.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay. So....
<A - William H. Swanson>: If that helps.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay, but so you expect ultimately we get a budget, but it's pretty late in the year.

<A - William H. Swanson>: That's the way I see it.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay.
<A - William H. Swanson>: We need to do it and to me the tone and tenor in Washington is people are starting to
think about how serious this is. And as I mentioned, both sides want some things and when you do that, you sit down at
the table and you work it out in a bipartisan way and that's what we need to do as a country.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay. Dave, couple of questions, EACs in the quarter and what is your assumption for cash
taxes in 2013?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Okay. EACs in the quarter were about 2.2% of revenue and again that's because they were
weighted to the first nine months of the year. With respect to cash taxes in 2013, we expect that to be about $650
million.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: What was the number in 2012?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Little over – about $840 million.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Okay. And then on the bookings versus sales question that has been asked a couple of times, I
guess, specifically, looking at missiles and SAS where bookings were up year-over-year yet you're forecasting sales flat
to down there. Is there anything – any specific reason as to why those businesses wouldn't be up given the bookings
trend?
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: No, again, there is nothing remarkable going on there. Sales are in line from a Missiles
Systems perspective, 2013 with 2012. There is increased production rates on Tomahawk, SM6, AMRAAM and some
other core programs, which are offsetting lower production rates across various Army programs. Again, this is the area
where we did have multiyear bookings and those are clearly longer in duration than you might otherwise expect.
<A - William H. Swanson>: And I would add in there, we expect missiles to probably have about 25% of their
business is international and about a third of SAS's bookings are international.
<Q - David E. Strauss>: Thanks.
<A - David C. Wajsgras>: Sure.
