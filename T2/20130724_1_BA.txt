ask that you please limit yourself to one question. As always, we provided detailed financial information in our press
release issued earlier today.
As a reminder, you can follow today's broadcast and slide presentation through our website at boeing.com. Before we
begin, I need to remind you that any projections and goals we included in our discussion this morning are likely to
involve risk, which is detailed in our news release and our various SEC filings and in the forward-looking statement
disclaimer at the end of the web presentation.
In addition, we refer to you our earnings release and presentation for disclosures and reconciliation of non-GAAP
measures that we use when discussing our results and outlook.
Now, I will turn the call over to Jim McNerney.
W. James McNerney
Thank you, Troy, and good morning, everybody. Let me begin today with a quick update on the ongoing analysis of the
787 incident at Heathrow earlier this month, followed by an overview of our business environment and some thoughts
on another strong quarter of operating performance. After that, Greg will walk you through our financial results and
outlook.
As all of you know, the safety of our passengers and crew members who fly on Boeing airplanes is our highest priority.
While we are limited in what we can say publicly by the rules of the investigation, we are working closely with the
U.K. Air Accidents Investigation Branch, or AAIB, and other parties to fully understand the incident and to address
recommendations in the AAIB's interim report regarding the fixed emergency locator transmitter, or ELT, a component
which is widely used across the industry and has been for a number of years on many different aircraft types.
In anticipation of planned action by the FAA and other regulators in response to the AAIB's recommendations, we have
provided customers instructions for the proper inspection and/or temporary removal of the fixed ELTs. While the
AAIB's interim report also noted that the history of this unit across the global airplane fleet suggests that an event of
this sort would be extremely rare, we agree that these are reasonable precautionary measures to take while the
investigation continues.
In sum, we believe good progress has been made in addressing this issue, and we remain highly confident in the future
of the 787 program and the integrity, safety and performance of the airplane.
With that, let's turn to the business environment on slide 2. Global customer demand remains strong for our
fuel-efficient and value creating commercial airplane family, and that is evident in the continued vigorous order activity
we are seeing. During the second quarter, we booked 481 net orders, which increased our record commercial airplane
backlog to nearly 4,800 airplanes, worth $339 billion. Our customers continue to replace older airplanes in favor of
new ones that offer compelling economics and increased fuel efficiency. Deferral request – requests remain well below
the historical average, and requests to accelerate deliveries continue at a healthy pace.
We continue to see relatively balanced demand geographically, and our backlog remains evenly split between airplanes
used to support traffic growth and fleet replacement. Passenger traffic trends are healthy, and have grown even stronger
in the past few months. While we continue to see near-term pressure in the cargo market, we are pleased with the recent
747 freighter order activity, highlighting the superior value proposition of our airplane and its competitive position in
the market.
Strong customer interest in our future new airplanes has fully affirmed our product strategy, and the market leading
position it has earned us. Our airplane families produce – provide the most comprehensive value in the market, with a
product strategy that is customer-driven, customer-focused and customer-generated, and touches every market segment.
Last month, we launched the 787-10 with 102 orders and commitments, including 50 firm orders from five of the most
prominent customers in the industry. The -10 further strengthens our unmatched twin-aisle lineup and leverages prior
technology investments. It is a win-win approach that allows us to provide our customers an airplane with unparalleled

economics while minimizing business risk to deliver increased shareholder value.
The business case for the 777X is maturing as planned as we gain further insights from our customers and develop our
design and production system strategies. We continue to target the launch for later this year, and entry into service for
the 777X around the end of the decade.
Airline interest in our new fuel-efficient 737 MAX remains significant, as we now have booked more than 1,400
cumulative orders to date and have effectively bridged production from the NG to the MAX. Today, 737 airplane
continues to attract strong customer interest, with performance that exceeds the competition in their segments. We
remain on track to increase 737 production to 42 per month in the second quarter of next year. Further, we are
positioned to match production with additional demand as our customers require it.
Turning to Defense, Space & Security, the U.S. fiscal year 2014 budget deliberations are well underway, following the
release of the President's Budget Request in April. While it's still early in the Congressional process, the defense and
space markups appear neutral to Boeing at the top level. That said, neither the President's request nor the Congressional
bills reflect sequestration level spending limits. We remain concerned about the impact that sequestration targets will
have on our customers, military readiness and the industrial base. Within this context, our relative strength stems from
a portfolio that is reliable, proven, affordable, that is being delivered on-budget and on-schedule.
Despite budget pressures, growth is still emerging in those areas we have been targeting with investment and
innovation, such as commercial derivatives, space, unmanned systems, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance
and cyber security. Growth in international markets continues to help us mitigate domestic market pressures.
International Defense, Space & Security business represented 23% of our revenue during the quarter and remains
approximately 40% of our current backlog as we continue to expand our share in addressable international markets.
We also continue to strengthen our competitive position in U.S. and international defense markets by driving further
efficiency and productivity to our long running market-based affordability effort and our Partnering for Success
initiative that we began last year. As many of you recall, Partnering for Success is a long-term, team-oriented approach
that examines opportunities across the supply chain in design, production and support to drive significant
improvements in quality, flow and efficiencies.
It is an enterprise-wide one Boeing effort, responding to customer demands for increased productivity and lower costs
in our products and services. We are pleased with the initial response from numerous suppliers that recognize the
growth opportunity they will have working with us, and we expect the full benefits to our customers and suppliers to
accrue over time, in line with the long cycle nature of our business.
Now, let's move to a summary of the second quarter on slide 3. Both businesses reported strong results during the
quarter as we generated healthy revenue, higher operating margin and significant operating cash flow. Revenue in
Commercial Airplanes was $13.6 billion, and operating margin grew to 10.7%, resulting from lower R&D, higher
volume and strong program execution. Marking our highest output level in nearly 15 years, we delivered 169
commercial airplanes in the second quarter, including 16 787s. During the quarter, we completed all of the 787 battery
system enhancements on previously delivered airplanes and returned the full fleet to service. 787 production is
progressing smoothly at a rate of seven per month, and we remain on track to increase the rate to 10 per month by
year-end.
With 787-9 progressing through final assembly, we are now focused on achieving first flight later in the year, and
production remains on track to support the first scheduled customer delivery next year. Our discipline gated
development process has been instrumental in the successful development of the airplane. This same process allowed
us to accelerate the expected 787 MAX entry into service and is also being applied to other programs.
Turning to the Defense business, Defense, Space & Security generated revenue of $8.2 billion in the second quarter,
and increased operating margin and operating profit. Numerous important contract awards were captured during the
quarter, including five commercial satellite orders and a strategic international helicopter support contract. We also
finalized Chinook and Osprey multi-year contracts that totaled more than $10 billion.

Noteworthy program milestones achieved during the quarter included the successful test flights for Phantom Eye,
EMARSS and our hypersonic X-51. We also began assembly on the first KC-46 tanker. In partnership with the U.S.
Air Force, we successfully conducted the critical design review on the KC-46 tanker program in July, which is a major
milestone conducted well ahead of the contract schedule.
During the quarter, we delivered the first of 15 CH-147F Chinook helicopters to the Royal Canadian Air Force and
delivered for launch the sixth U.S. Air Force Wideband Global SATCOM satellite.
In summary, our team delivered another strong quarter of financial results in both businesses, captured orders totaling
$40 billion, made good progress on our Partnering for Success and other productivity initiatives, and as Greg will
discuss, returned increased value to shareholders through share repurchase and dividend.
Now, I will turn it over to Greg to discuss our financial results and our guidance. Greg?
Gregory D. Smith
Thanks, Jim, and good morning. Let's turn to slide 4 to discuss our results for the quarter. Second quarter revenue
increased 9% to $21.8 billion, driven by strong commercial airplane deliveries. Core operating margin increased to
9.3% in the quarter, primarily driven by higher commercial deliveries, lower R&D and solid productivity gains at both
businesses.
Core earnings per share increased 13% to $1.67 a share in the quarter on higher revenue and continued strong operating
performance, again, in both Commercial Airplanes and the Defense business.
So let's discuss Commercial Airplanes now on slide 5. For the second quarter, our Commercial Airplane business
reported revenue of $13.6 billion on 169 airplane deliveries and strong operating margins of 10.7%. Higher
Commercial Airplane operating margins were driven by increased 737 and 777 deliveries, strong core operating
performance and lower R&D, partially offset by the dilution of higher 787 deliveries in the quarter.
Gross inventory for the company included $30.3 billion related to the 787 program, an increase in the second quarter of
approximately $1.5 billion. This increase was primarily driven by higher inventory in support of the planned production
rate increases later in the year and the introduction of the 787-9 program. Included in the work-in-process inventory are
the deferred production costs. The deferred balance for the 787 program was $18.7 billion at the end of the second
quarter and includes approximately 64 airplanes still in process.
The deferred production balance is still expected to peak at slightly over $20 billion and then decline as the program
achieves the planned rate of 10 per month and stabilizes at that level. The launch of the 787-10 did not result in a
change in the 787 accounting quantity, revenue or cost estimates during the second quarter, although we do expect the
787-10 aircraft to be incorporated in these estimates later in the year as we firm up customer orders.
Commercial Airplanes captured $28.7 billion of orders during the quarter and increased backlog to a new record of
$339 billion for 4,757 aircraft. Customer demand for our game-changing fuel-efficient airplanes remains strong as
illustrated by the additional 246 737 MAX orders and 50 787-10 orders in the quarter.
Turning now to Defense, Space & Security results on slide 6. Second quarter revenue for our Defense business was
$8.2 billion and operating margins grew to 9.5%, again driven by strong core operating performance across the
business. International customers accounted for 23% of our Defense revenue in the second quarter and we continue to
drive towards our goal of 30% of revenue going forward.
Our focus on affordability continues as we remain committed to our market-based affordability efforts where we've
already captured over $3 billion in savings. We're on track for further lowering our cost structure in an effort to
increase productivity and strengthen our competitive position in this challenging environment.
Revenue at Boeing Military Aircraft was $3.9 billion in the second quarter, primarily driven by lower F-15 and
AEW&C volumes. Operating margins was 9.6% in the quarter. Network and Space System revenue of $2 billion

increased 5%, primarily driven by improved volume on commercial satellites and the space launch systems program,
operating margin of 6.7% in the quarter.
Global Services & Support had second quarter revenue of $2.2 billion and operating margins of 11.8% on strong
performance at our integrated logistics business. Defense, Space & Security reported a solid backlog of $71 billion and
international business was 37% of our current backlog, representing customers outside the United States.
Turning now to slide 7, the BCC net financing portfolio declined to $4.1 billion on normal run-off that exceeded new
aircraft volume. Unallocated expense from our core operations of $177 million was higher, primarily due to an increase
in deferred compensation expense, driven by our higher stock price and overall stock market performance.
Turning now to cash flow on slide 8, operating cash flow for the quarter was $3.5 billion. The strength of our cash flow
was driven by improved performance and favorable timing of receipts and expenditures in the quarter. As a result, our
strong performance in execution of our balanced cash deployment strategy, we repurchased 10.2 million shares for $1
billion in the quarter and we also paid a 12% higher dividend to shareholders compared to the same quarter last year.
As we continue to execute to our plans, we remain focused on investing in key growth areas of our business and
returning cash to shareholders.
Moving to cash and debt balances on slide 9. We ended the quarter with over $14 billion of cash in marketable
securities. Debt levels increased slightly to support aircraft financing at Boeing Capital and our cash position continues
to provide a solid liquidity and positions us well going forward.
Turning now to slide 10 to discuss our outlook for 2013. Due to the strong performance in the first half and the outlook
for the balance of the year, we're increasing our 2013 core earnings per share guidance to be between $6.20 and $6.40
per share. Revenue guidance for the year increased to $1 billion to now be between $83 billion and $86 billion,
reflecting higher expected volume driven by international revenue and mix at our Defense business. As a result,
Defense revenue guidance increased to be between $31.5 billion and $32.5 billion.
Commercial Airplane revenue guidance of $51 billion to $53 billion remains unchanged and continues to reflect higher
expected deliveries in 2013. We still expect 787 deliveries to be greater than 60 for this year and deliveries relatively
evenly spread over the remaining two quarters.
Total Commercial Airplane deliveries remain on track to be between 635 and 645 for the year. Boeing Commercial
Airplane operating margin guidance is increased to be greater than 9.5% on improved performance and lower R&D.
With our continued focus on development program execution, we now expect total research and development spending
for 2013 to be approximately $3.3 billion; $100 million lower than our prior guidance. Due to the ramp-up of 737
MAX and 787-10 investments, we do expect second half of 2013 R&D spending to be slightly higher than the first half.
Partially offsetting the favorable performance of the businesses and our higher un-allocated costs and other costs, total
core un-allocated expense is now forecast to be approximately $600 million for the year, driven largely by deferred
compensation expense, again, due to recent share price and stock market increases. Furthermore, our tax rate is now
expected to be approximately 31%, driven primarily by lower than expected manufacturing tax credit in 2013.
Operating cash flow before pension contributions guidance for the year is unchanged at greater than $8 billion. We
continue to plan to make a $1.5 billion discretionary pension contribution in the third quarter. Overall, second quarter
performance was strong at both businesses as we further improve productivity, continue to execute on our new airplane
development programs, successfully navigated the difficult defense environment and efficiently deployed cash to
shareholders. We expect a strong operational performance to continue throughout the balance of 2013.
With that, I'll now turn it back over to Jim for some final thoughts.
W. James McNerney
Thanks, Greg. With a strong first half behind us and a successful launch of the 787-10, we remain committed to the
goals we initially set for 2013. They include continued conversion of our record backlog into deliveries through strong

core operating performance that allows us to return cash to shareholders while investing wisely in our products,
technologies and people, to sustain our growth and competitiveness.
Our priorities going forward remain clear. The profitable ramp-up in production of our commercial airplane programs,
executing on our commercial and defense development programs, driving productivity, affordability and safety
throughout the enterprise, continuing to strengthen and reposition our defense business with investments in growth
areas amid further international expansion and, importantly, providing increasing value to both our customers and our
shareholders as we do it.
Now, we'd be glad to take any questions you might have.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, in the interest of time, we are asking that you limit yourself to one single-part
question. [Operator Instructions] And first, we'll go to the line of Joe Nadol with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning, Joe.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Good morning.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: I'd like to ask you about – a little bit more about 787 productivity and the learning curve,
understanding that the -9 had an impact on your results in the quarter or the introduction of the -9. Is there any way to
strip out just the -8 to think about what's going on there from a unit cost standpoint relative to the last couple of
quarters? And then on deferred production costs, Greg, I heard you say or reiterate that slightly over $20 billion is
where you expect it to peak. It's eight point – it's $18.7 billion here at the end of Q2. If you add another $1.6 billion
next quarter, you could be over that level. So any more color you can give on the profile, when you think it will peak,
what quarter even, and where above $20 billion? Is it $21 billion? Is it $23 billion, that sort of thing? Thanks.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Is that it, Joe?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: No, let me – on the unit cost progress we – to your point, we certainly had 787-9 in there
and we also had an inventory build-up as we plan for, as you know, getting to 10 a month by the end of the year. So
that's what you're seeing there in the inventory build-up quarter-over-quarter. If you strip that out, you would see the
normal progress that we've seen on a unit cost basis on the -8. And I think, as you've heard me say before, if you kind
of just go back to unit 8 to around unit 100, we've seen anywhere from 55% to 60% reduction. And so we're continuing
to see progress on a unit-by-unit basis as the production system stabilizes and we get ready for the next rate break.
We're also seeing improvement on the overall kind of operational metrics around traveled work, improvements in
quality and reductions in flow time. So I'd say it's progressing very well. And again, if you stripped out those unique
items, you'd continue to see the progress there on a unit basis.
With regards to deferred production balances going forward, we're still comfortable with that peaking at slightly over
$20 billion. And again, think of that as we reach 10 a month and stabilize at that level, that's when we'll see that turn,
which roughly is about early 2015 timeframe, mid-2015 in that area. But the planned inventory build-up obviously is in
the support of our rates as we get, again, prepared to go to 10 a month. But that's kind of basically how you'll see that
profile going forward.
<Q - Joseph B. Nadol>: So clearly deferred production build per quarter will have to slow dramatically before the
peak?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Well, yes. But don't forget you've got increased deliveries as well. So the increased
deliveries are help offsetting the growth as we build up for rate further in the year.

Next, we go to Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Good morning.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Morning, Doug.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: On your margins at BCA, so you took those up to greater than 9.5%. Presumably now
you have the full bridge of the 737NGs in your accounting block, which I would expect would be a little more pressure
on price. And you've got the early MAX production in there as well. Also I would expect some more pressure on
margin. So can you talk about how you've kept margins up or even taken margins up here, given that trajectory? And as
you look forward and when this block moves out to later production of the MAX, should we expect those to be higher
margins – higher margin airplanes, which would actually help this number?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Well, to answer your first question, Doug, it's just back to basics on improving productivity
across the operation. And as you know, on the 737, they have continued to come up with ways to do that whether it's
the horizontal wing line or other opportunities within the final assembly area and then Partnering for Success and
working with the supply chain. So all of that in combination really kind of helping us navigate through those early
blocks on the MAX and the later blocks on – or later airplanes on the NGs, and that's going to be the focus going
forward. And again, it dovetails right into the Partnering for Success and the goals that we establish internally on
year-over-year productivity gains, work in Lean Plus and work in flow time, quality, et cetera.
But the program is obviously performing very well as it stabilized at 38 a month. We're at record low shortages. And
again, the core operating metrics are performing extremely well at those levels and getting ready to go to 42. So
overall, it's just a very solid, disciplined focus on productivity on all aspects of cost.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: But have you incorporated assumptions around Partnering for Success into this? My
understanding was that you had been looking more at normal productivity improvements and that Partnering for
Success was potential upside to your margin here.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, that's how we're playing it out, Doug. That's how we're working it. What you're
seeing up to now is the productivity gains that we see in the factories and within the supply chain, but then on top of
that, working Partnering for Success moving forward.
<Q - Doug Stuart Harned>: Okay. Thank you.

<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Greg, just I wanted to clarify something in your answer to Joe's question then Jim on
defense. On the unit deferred, given the fact that there's not that much left to build, should we expect a step-down in
unit deferred in this next quarter, I guess based on the mix of -9s and -8s, or when should we return back to
step-downs? And then, Jim, I wanted to ask you about defense. Obviously, you've raised your BDS revenue targets for
this year. It sounds like that's driven by international. But given the late timing on the $37 billion in cuts which you
referenced in your monologue, is it simply that we just don't see that this year and would you expect that to develop
into a headwind next year? I'm sure you've got guys working on this. And then, of course, we might have another $52
billion behind it. So how do you think about revenues from a slightly longer-term trajectory since we really haven't
seen any impact yet? Thanks.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yeah, I'll answer the second part first. It's a good question. I think you're right. The
upside we've seen this year is for two reasons. One, we've gotten after our costs very aggressively and very early, our
market-based affordability initiative that Dennis has been driving over the last couple of years. And secondly, mixing
up on international orders, which our company is, in many ways, uniquely positioned to do given our global footprint,
which is a shared enterprise effort between our defense and commercial business. And so – but I think we've seen some
impact of sequestration, but we have not begun to see most of it yet. And so we remain cautious. We think there's more
to come on sequestration, more than we've seen so far. We are prepared for it margin-wise, anticipating some pretty
draconian kinds of scenarios and we are not out of the woods at all. We're just entering the woods.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Okay.
<A - W. James McNerney>: And then, Greg...
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: Yeah, Greg, just on the deferred...
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: On your deferred per unit, you're going to see some bouncing around a little bit in the third
and fourth quarter, again, as we introduce more -9s into the line and come down that learning curve and then get to the
10 a month and stabilize at that level. But, again, after that you're going to see the normal progress on equivalent unit
costs going forward. But I would consider it a temporary disruption here again as we have the blanks firing into the line
and the -9 making its way through the production system, which by the way is making great progress through our
factories and progressing very well.
<Q - Robert M. Spingarn>: That's helpful. Thank you both.

And next go to Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Thanks so much. So your Commercial margin was 70 bps lower than the first quarter even
though R&D was lower and I know mix was really not for you with more 87s. But it looks like the margin on the 777
and 37 were down sequentially and can you also comment on the level of period expenses versus the first quarter?
Thank you.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, Cai, margins were solid in the quarter. The biggest driver in there is the dilution on –
of the 787 deliveries within the quarter versus Q1. That's the biggest differentiator. On a period expense, stripping out
R&D, pretty much flat quarter-over-quarter.
<Q - Cai von Rumohr>: Got it. And then can you comment on the -9? You've obviously had very strong demand there
and your thoughts about when and if you might raise the production rate above 10, what would you have to see to do

that? And given that it should be substantially more profitable than the other eight, at what point could that encourage
you to raise the accrual rate on the program?
<A - W. James McNerney>: I'll take a swing at that one, Cai. There is no question, number one priority is to get to 10
a month and do it well. And we're well on our way to executing that. But there is pressure beyond that to raise
production rates and it is led by demand for -9s and -10s. So the mixing up into larger, longer-range models is correct
and mixing up on pricing and therefore profitability is also – it wants to move in that direction as well. So I think we'll
make the call on going beyond 10 once we've settled in at 10 and have a very firm foundation. And I think if I were a
betting man, I'd think that the marketplace demand could move us in that direction over time and that would all be good
from a volume and profitability standpoint.

<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: Good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Morning.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Morning.
<Q - Sam J. Pearlstein>: I was wondering if you could talk about cash a little bit, just because even if you deploy 80%
plus of your free cash to buybacks and dividends, that $14 billion you have on the balance sheet is going to continue to
grow. So I guess can you just talk a little bit about how you're thinking about that cash, what would make that cash
balance come back to maybe a single-digit billions and where are acquisitions, why don't we see more than $1.5 billion
to $2 billion in buyback this year? Just talk a little bit about that.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, well, Sam, as I think I've mentioned before, think of our deployment this year as
really being the start. As we've de-risked the company and executed to our production rates, navigating through the
challenging DOD environment, we've started to execute the deployment plans with the repurchase and the dividends.
So I would view that as a start. It's certainly something that we're continuing to monitor and look at going forward as
we continue to make progress at BCA, making our rate breaks and executing in defense. So the 80% is plus or minus.
It's going to vary over time and we're going to continue to look at that as we have on a very active basis and deploy our
cash going forward in a balanced fashion as we've described with certainly returning cash to shareholders being a big
priority for us. So I'd say stay tuned. We're going to continue to execute. We're going to continue to focus on deploying
and as we make progress throughout the year, we'll make adjustments accordingly.

impact on the program financials this quarter. Is it your expectation that the inclusion of the -10 will have a material
impact on the program margin or the accounting quantity? And I guess to that point, can you clarify what the right
measure of materiality might be?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, so I think to answer your first question certainly -9 and then think of it as investments
in inventory to de-risk as we get up to 10 a month. So that's really what's driving that. And as I said, if you strip that
out, you would see progress on the -8 as we have seen. So on a unit-by-unit basis we're continuing to see improvement
there. And again, I would think of this as being temporary as we come down the learning curve on the -9 work through
flight tests, ramp back up in production and deliveries and you'll see us make progress through that period.
With regards to the -10, just like we have with other derivative programs, as we make progress on firming up orders,
we'll look at extending the blocks – the accounting blocks. I see us doing that. Again, it depends on how we firm up our
orders, but some time later this year and that would be favorable to the booking rate and – but at the same time would
also include the upfront investments on the -10. So net-net would be an improvement.
<Q - Carter Copeland>: But that's a 2013 decision, not 2014?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Again, it depends on how the orders progress. If they progress as they have, I see it later this
year.

<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Hey, Howard.
<Q - Howard A. Rubel>: It's very clear you've made a lot of progress introducing the 787 into the market, yet you've
only delivered a high-teens number to date with a target of over 60. Greg, there's a lot of airplanes on the tarmac. How
– why are we not yet at the point where we would probably see more than those 60 delivered?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Well, I think, Howard, when you kind of – you look at the balance of the year and there is
airplanes on the tarmac. Some of those are still have to require going through change incorp. and some of them are
coming out of it. So if you look at the deliveries for the year, about 15% of those are coming out of change incorp. and
then about 20 coming out of Charles – 20% coming out of Charleston and the balance out of Everett. So certainly, in
July here and then moving forward, you'll see deliveries picking up through the balance of the year. But we're still
comfortable with about 60, Howard, and certainly if we can do more, we will. But the team is very focused on
delivering the units that are committed to through the balance of the year.

<Q - Rob Stallard>: Thanks very much. Good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Morning.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Morning.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Jim, just a quick question on the 737. Your competitor has so far achieved a better market share
than you on its re-engined variant. I was wondering if you think it's realistic to expect a 50% market share at some
point in the future for your 737 MAX and how you expect – you expect to get there? Would that require more
aggressive pricing or perhaps raising the narrow body rate a bit further?
<A - W. James McNerney>: I think I understand where the question comes from. I think the answer is pretty
straightforward, however. They introduced their new narrow-body a year-and-a-half before we did. I think if you look
at relative orders along a similar point in time, you'd see that we're at or slightly ahead of where they were as we
penetrate our customer base. We're both producing at roughly the same rate. As I said in my remarks, we're ready to go
higher if the market demand is there. So I fully anticipate about a 50/50 when it all sorts out when we're at equal points
in customer penetration, when we're both fully ramped up to rates that we've targeted.
And as I also mentioned in my remarks, we're moving the schedule actually of early initial deliveries to the left. I mean
we're going to be in pretty good shape here. So I'd be very surprised if it was any noise – it would be noise level around
50/50. Where we are going to end up with a higher market share, however, is in wide bodies. I think if you look at the
lineup, you look at current order trends, if we end up at a Kentucky windage 50/50 in narrow bodies, I think the
difference makers, the difference maker overall will be in wide bodies, where we've got five relatively new offerings to
their three when they get the A350 variants introduced. And on top of an already strong wide body position, I feel very
bullish. I don't want to give you a specific market share number or target in wide bodies, but I think it's going to be
greater than our competitors.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Yeah, just a follow-up on the narrow bodies, though. Based on your view that it's timing, should
we therefore realistically expect maybe a few hundred more MAX orders over the next 12 months or so?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Well, I think if you follow my logic, yes.
<Q - Rob Stallard>: Great. Thank you.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yeah.

And we go to Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Yeah, good morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Just following up, I think, on Rob's questions, a follow-on question and a half, I guess. When
you mentioned that you're prepared to meet customer demand if it arises for more than 42 a month, translation, is the
company seriously considering going to whatever the 45 a month and in what timeframe? And then that begs the
question, kind of there's a piece – an additional piece to this. Then, how do we think about the transition to the MAX
from the NG if you're at a higher rate?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Well, I think the spirit with which I made that comment was we will get to 42 next year.
We will go through a transition of NGs to MAXs during a period not soon thereafter that. And I think it's at that stage
that most likely and I don't want to offer guidance here. I mean I'm just saying that as we're assessing market demand,
we're seeing some time around then or after then pressure possibly if the world economy holds and all the rest of the
variants are in place to go higher. And we can do that. Rate breaks are never easy. But we see a clear path to execution
there I mean, we're assessing the scenarios right now of how and where we would do that.

<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Okay. And then just a natural follow on.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Sure.
<Q - Ron Jay Epstein>: Maybe a very high-level management question. Is market share a proper metric to think about
when you're thinking about this market? I mean, ultimately, Jim, right it's a duopoly of sorts. I mean maybe a sort of
different flavor duopoly but duopoly. Is market share really what anybody should be thinking about? I mean because
that could potentially have negative implications.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Sure. I think it's a mistake to only think about market share when you think about this
business. I think because of what you alluded to, you either can take too much risk if you're reaching too high or if you
go too low, you can get off a learning curve relative to your competition. So the way to think about market share is
there's a corridor you want to be in and then within that corridor, you want to have a better product produced at a lower
cost. And so it – so operating margins become the metric. And so – and cash flow becomes the metric. So think about
market share as a corridor you want to be in. After that, it's all about operating performance.

<Q - John D. Godyn>: Thanks for taking my questions, guys. Jim and Greg...
<A - W. James McNerney>: Sure.
<Q - John D. Godyn>: ...both of you made some positive comments on Partnering for Success and we've heard from
other companies that have already reported earnings that the tempo of some of the Partnering for Success conversations
and activity continues to quicken. So I was hoping you could just elaborate on what's changing incrementally from your
perspective, if anything? And are there any particular milestones that we should be thinking about? Or are the benefits
just going to be seen gradually?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yeah, I think, John, I think it will – they will be seen over time. What you're hearing,
probably, is our increased engagement and our sustained engagement. And the proposition here is Boeing as the
aerospace leader, if you work with us, there is a chance to increase volumes significantly while helping us work, flow,
cash and margins. And I think lots of folks are engaging constructively. There are some that are more hesitant. And it
will take time for us to work out business equations that make sense for both of us. But we are determined and
committed and the reason we are is that we are facing a more-for-less world in our own markets.
We talk about sequestration, we talk about Europe. You talk about the expectations of our Commercial Airline
customers as they compete aggressively with one another. And as that industry consolidates and globalizes, we need to
be out in front of these more-for-less market trends with the partnership of our suppliers and there is room for us
together to improve our value proposition. And for those that work with us aggressively, there's an opportunity for
them to grow disproportionately. So it will be over time. We're in the second inning.

<A - W. James McNerney>: Morning.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Hi, Noah.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning, Noah.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Jim, two things that have happened recently from a macroeconomic perspective that I wanted to
take your temperature on. First, we've seen a little bit of slowing in some emerging markets, China stands out, other
parts of Asia. And that's clearly become a huge part of your business. And the second is we've seen rates start to
increase a little bit and clearly, there are a number of drivers of demand for your aircraft. But I think financing,
availability and ease has played a little bit of a role there at least. And so clearly there hasn't been any recent impact to
demand. We see orders continue to roll in. But I just wanted to ask you how worried are you about those two things, if
at all? And have you started to have that conversation pick up with the customer or with your sales force in any way
that you can share with us?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Well, I think I would categorize them both as watch items that we pay attention to. Am I
concerned about either right now? No. I mean I think – but it is part of the more-for-less world that I anticipate. And
we've got to be competitively ready for not very negative scenarios but turbulence. And China is – we don't see any
pullback really on their investment in infrastructure-related activities. They remain very committed to that. I think they
are having difficulty transitioning their economy right now. And there's all kinds of names for what they're doing, but
it's more of a demand-driven, consumer-led, domestically driven economy. And that transition is not easy to make from
a external investment, FDI kind of led economy. And so I – quite frankly, I expect this kind of turbulence as they try to
manage that.
And so – and rates remain very low historically. There was ample financing at rates much higher than where we are
today. If they keep going and get way, way high against historical levels, sure, we'd have to manage it. And one of the
reasons we've managed Boeing Capital Corporation down significantly over the last number of years is so if we ever do
get to that point, we'll have some room to help. And – but we're nowhere near that point yet.
<Q - Noah Poponak>: Fair. I appreciate the color.

<Q - Jason M. Gursky>: ... 2014, 2015, 2016 from a cadence perspective?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, when you look at the back half of the year, Defense right now looks about flattish. So
you'll see the kind of normal run rate that you've seen in Q1 and Q2. And as I said in Q3 and Q4 with BCA, you're
seeing the ramp-up of the MAX and the 10X. And then with the -9 starting to obviously taper off. So that's really what
you're seeing there. As far as going forward, at this point, I think as I mentioned before, we're seeing kind of flattish
R&D going into 2014 and we're continuing to work that and refine our estimates from there going forward. But that's
what we're seeing right now.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yeah. I would just add one other thing, the 10 through the factory, end of the year. And
the other point I'd make, just on the Defense R&D is that, that team has been able to increase research and development
funding in some key elements of innovation, relative to our competition. And I think we've been able to do that because
we got after the cost issue faster and more aggressively so that we can both grow margin and increase investment in
R&D. And I think history tells you in the defense and space business, if you can hang on to your innovation during
these downturns, it's going to pay back. And it may not be for a few years, but we're absolutely convinced it will pay
back. Sorry, I interrupted you there.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: No, that's a great point. Yep.

<Q - Jon Ostrower>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Morning.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Morning. Good morning, Jon.
<Q - Jon Ostrower>: A question about the overall 787 learning curve and really the rate of cost improvement that
you've already achieved on both the growth in inventory and your unit cost where you are today.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yep.
<Q - Jon Ostrower>: As you look at that rate of improvement, do you need to increase the rate of improvement from
here? Does it need to be steeper? Does it need to be shallower compared to where you have come thus far from the first
batch of airplanes?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Well, I think it depends on what starting point you're coming from, but certainly as we look
at the units to be produced going forward, we still see a learning curve that continues on a pretty steady trajectory
similar to what we've experienced on other programs. But again, the differentiator on the 787 is how we have some of
these supplier agreements time phase, but net-net, you're going to see improvement on a unit-by-unit basis going
forward. And a lot of that is, again, production stability and getting stability in the production system, getting to 10 a
month and holding there. And as I mentioned, we are seeing improvement unit-by-unit whether it's quality or flow time
or jobs traveling outside of the factory out in the flight line. All of that on a unit-by-unit basis is improving, and that's
driving the unit cost.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yeah. And, Jon, I would just add that the compounding effect of just staying on our
current curve is significant year-over-year.
<Q - Jon Ostrower>: And just kind of on that note as well, just sort of with the 787-9 schedule, as you kind of look at
the introduction of that into your learning curve and kind of the bounce back up on just the overall higher costs of a
new derivative, can you first talk about, number one, where you are on the schedule with that airplane, when you
expect to fly more specifically and kind of where you are on entry into service? I know there was talk about early 2014,
now you're just saying 2014. Can you guys just put a little bit more clarity on that?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah. Well, as I mentioned, it's – we're in final assembly now with the first airplane. It's
progressing well, getting ready to move to – into flight tests and in – right now, we're looking at mid next year

continuing to get orders in the middle of a downturn, which is where we are today. So as the market normalizes over
the next year or two, which is what we expect, I – normalizing will put more, an additional tailwind behind our order

experience. So I think the point here is how well we're doing during a downturn.
<Q - Julie Johnsson>: Okay. And then on the 777X, I know launch looks like it's going to be later this year. Is it too
early to start talking about where the wing will be built and who's potentially in the running for that?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yeah, I think it is. We – the normal timing for deciding on production placement would
be, if we did introduce launch in the back half of the year, would be anywhere from two to six months after that.
<Q - Julie Johnsson>: Okay. So those decisions will be made, it sounds like...
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yeah.
<Q - Julie Johnsson>: Late this year or early next year?

And next we'll go to Dominic Gates with The Seattle Times. Please go ahead.
<Q - Dominic Gates>: Good morning, guys.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Good morning, Dominic.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Good morning.
<Q - Dominic Gates>: In the first half of the year, as you began to increase production and looked ahead to new
development programs, there was a certain amount of surprise here. Certainly, I was surprised by...
<A - W. James McNerney>: Dominic, we didn't hear the first part of your question, sorry.
<Q - Dominic Gates>: I'm sorry.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yeah, yeah, just start again.
<Q - Dominic Gates>: Okay.
<A - W. James McNerney>: There we go. There we go.
<Q - Dominic Gates>: At the beginning of the year, there was – given the increases in production that were happening
and the projections for starting new development programs, there was a certain amount of surprise in the Puget Sound
region when we got some negative employment news. And so there was news of cuts in both engineering and cuts in
the production workforce and as well as that, we had some IT jobs moving – news of IT jobs moving. So now at the
midpoint of the year, I'd like to ask for an update on how you see all that falling out and how it may change for the rest
of the year? How do you see employment in the Puget Sound region?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah. Well, Dominic, as you mentioned, that we've seen – the head count has declined there
primarily around the support on the 787 as we've made progress coming down that learning curve and transitioning in
rates, transitioning out, obviously, through the development phase into higher production rates. So the efficiency of the
production system is driving that. And then in some of the other areas you've mentioned, it's really been about
productivity and cost opportunities that we talked about as far as the productivity overall in defense and in BCA. And
we've made choices there to go to more affordable areas within the business to, again, drive productivity and
profitability, and as Jim noted, a more-for-less world that we're faced with.
<Q - Dominic Gates>: All right. When you say go to more affordable areas within the business, what did you mean?

<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Sites and areas with – where we see lower costs, overall costs rates and able to capture those
costs and get those into our productivity. And, again, as we're faced within a defense environment which is certainly
very challenging, and then on the commercial side, we're looking at every opportunity we can to continue to drive
productivity and profitability throughout the programs.
<Q - Dominic Gates>: And so how do you see the – can you just update on the projections ahead for employment in
Puget Sound?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Yeah, I think at this point – I mean I think what you've seen today is we peaked out last year
and we're starting to come down this year. And we'll continue to assess that going forward as we increase rates and
continue looking for productivity improvements.
<Q - Dominic Gates>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question is from Josh Freed with the Associated Press. Please go ahead.
<Q - Josh Freed>: Hi, there. On the Heathrow 787, can you say whether Boeing is going to pay for that warranty and
conduct a warranty repair, pay for the repair under warranty and pay for it? And then more big picture, can you say sort
of where that fits in with your kind of readiness to carry out repairs like that? I mean, is that something that you guys
are figuring you'll do in-house? Is that more of a contractor thing? How should we think about how future hull repairs
will be done on 787s?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Well, any hull has – gets dinged up, okay? With lots of customers over – and we do have
warranty programs that cover a lot of this. This specific incident you're talking about, I assume, was Ethiopian.
<Q - Josh Freed>: Yeah.
<A - W. James McNerney>: And, yeah, and we're in discussions with them right now about how to handle that. We
want to make sure they are in agreement with our approach. We have – for the last five or six years, we've thought
about how to repair composite structures when they are damaged and we will obviously honor any and all warranty
obligations as we do that. And typically both we and the carrier have insurance that back this up. So this – if the
question eventually gets to a financial impact, there will be very little.
<Q - Josh Freed>: Sure. And is that a repair that you folks would typically carry out in-house? Or does that – or do
you expect that future hull repairs would be done more by third parties?
<A - W. James McNerney>: I think typically as we introduce new airplanes, we disproportionately do the repair. But
over time, the industry learns how to do the repair, and we work with other maintenance and repair operations because
it benefits our customers to have decentralized capability around the world. I think in this case, we will have, I think,
Ethiopia in this case because it's a very new model, very new airplane type, who rely on us disproportionately for the
advice on how to handle it.
<Q - Josh Freed>: All right. Thank you.
<A - W. James McNerney>: You're welcome.

<Q - Andrew Parker>: A couple of questions for you, Mr. McNerney, please.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yes.
<Q - Andrew Parker>: First off, could you respond to Airbus's John Leahy, who, in the wake of the Heathrow fire,
said that the Dreamliner was quote not reliable and suggested it was rushed to market. And he said just to quote him
precisely, it's pretty obvious this airplane is not reliable and does not have mature systems, he said. And also could you
just give a view you had at least two fires with the Dreamliner this year, the one at Boston and then the one at
Heathrow. Do you think if you had another fire incident, you could avoid a crisis at least in public confidence in the
plane?
<A - W. James McNerney>: I think – as to your first question, I think even John felt that he was – you'd have to ask
him, but my guess is John would feel that he was – got carried away with himself which can happen, but you have to
ask him. As to your second question, the reliability of this airplane is about the same as the reliability that we've had
introducing new models, including the most successful wide body we've ever introduced, the 777 or about at the same
kind of dispatch reliability levels that we have then, and there are a lot of things that happen early. When you look at
the data, the – and we monitor public opinion, working with our airline customers as to how they feel about Boeing and
the 787.
The support for this airplane remains high and as we go through these issues, which, admittedly, I'm not trying to say
we want to go through these issues, Andrew, we don't at all. But our customers have shown an ability to appreciate the
game-changing nature of this airplane also to appreciate that safety has been something that has increased overall in
this industry dramatically in the last 10 years. It's up 10 fold in the last 30 or 40 years. And I think the public knows
that. And the regulatory regimes that we go through and the amount of time and effort we invest in safety and
redundancy on these airplanes so that even when there's a point of failure, there's two or three other systems to back it
up. I think the public has – it seems to understand and appreciate that. And so it gets them through some of these
well-publicized events that really are roughly the same kind of events we had when we introduced new airplanes over
time, other times, other places.
<Q - Andrew Parker>: Okay. And just one quick separate question. You were asked about whether you want to get to
market share parity on A320neo versus MAX.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yep. Yep.
<Q - Andrew Parker>: You obviously expressed the view that you think you can achieve that. Can you achieve 50/50,
though, without a price war?
<A - W. James McNerney>: I think the quick answer is it's – I cannot predict the future, point one. Point two, we have
a lot of value in this airplane, and quite frankly, we are getting very responsible prices from our customers because
we're delivering lots of value here. This significantly improves the operating economics of our customers, which is not
to say that they don't compare and ask for better pricing in every campaign. They do. But in a sense that you asked the
question, I think which is pricing to the place where it destroys or significantly impairs our economics, I don't see that.
<Q - Andrew Parker>: Okay. Okay. Thanks very much.
<A - W. James McNerney>: You're welcome, Andrew.

And we'll go to Veronique Dupont with AFP. Please go ahead.
<Q - Veronique Dupont>: Good morning. Still on the 787, I wanted to know when you expect to reach profitability,
when you think you're going to break in on this plane. And could you give some details on how the discussion for
compensations for the earlier this year problems with the batteries of the 787 are going with ANA and with JAL and

with other customers. Thank you.
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Well, to answer your first question, the program is profitable today and we continue to drive
profitability going forward through a lot of things we talked about, Partnering for Success and in increasing
productivity inside of our factories.
<A - W. James McNerney>: And then compensation on the battery, there were some instances where we had
obligations to customers and those have all been satisfied. And you can see by our quarterly results that there was no
significant impact to our operations as we work with our customers to remedy the situation.
<Q - Veronique Dupont>: And those are all behind you by now? Or there are still some matters to be finalized?
<A - W. James McNerney>: We think they are all behind us now.

And that will be from Alwyn Scott with Reuters. Please go ahead.
<Q - Alwyn Scott>: Hi. Can you hear me?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yes, yes.
<Q - Alwyn Scott>: Okay. Thanks for taking my question.
<A - W. James McNerney>: Sure.
<Q - Alwyn Scott>: What is the estimated timeframe for repair of the Ethiopian Airlines jet to actually get it back in
the air? And how does that compare with the repair time for the Japan Airline 787 at Logan in Boston?
<A - Gregory D. Smith>: Well. Yeah, I mean these are very, very different situations. I mean I think the retrofit time
on the battery was a couple of days, okay?
<Q - Alwyn Scott>: But wasn't there some damage, fire damage to the hull there too in Boston?
<A - W. James McNerney>: Yeah, there was not significant structural damage to that hull, okay? So that was not
something that required a lot of time and effort. I think the – obviously, we had to inspect and check, but when you got
down to the effort, I don't recall – I think – I'll make sure that we get back to you if I'm a little bit off with this answer.
But I do not recall a significant amount of structural repair, if any, okay? Now, the Ethiopian airplane, it's a little
premature to project what the timing might be. We are in discussions with Ethiopia. We want them to be completely
comfortable with our approach and those discussions will take another few days, weeks. And then we'll be in a better
position to give you an estimate.
<Q - Alwyn Scott>: Okay. How much of the repair do you anticipate would go beyond what has been the repair
processes that have already been sort of certified as part of the development program of the 787?
<A - W. James McNerney>: It's a little early to speculate. We just – we obviously invested a lot of time and effort in
repair processes as we developed this new composite technology. We feel comfortable that we know how to address
this issue and most other structural issues as they arise. But I don't want to get out ahead of discussions that are going
on with a very fine customer of ours, Ethiopian, and project exactly the repair they're going to be comfortable with or
the time it's going to take.
