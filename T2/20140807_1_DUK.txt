addition to being available on the company's website.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Lynn.
Lynn J. Good
Good morning and thank you for joining us today. Earlier today, we released the results of another strong quarter. As a
result of our financial performance for the first half of the year, we have increased our 2014 adjusted EPS guidance
range by $0.05 to $4.50 to $4.65 per share. I'm very pleased with how we're executing our growth strategy, delivering
on our commitments, and building positive momentum for the future.
July marked the second anniversary of the merger between Duke and Progress. As a result of great focus and
teamwork, we have exceeded expectations from the combination. After two years, we have achieved 45% of our total
five year fuel and joint dispatch savings commitment for Carolinas customers. We've exceeded our original non-fuel
O&M savings target and we've recently completed the eight required transmission projects, ahead of schedule and
under budget.
We believe, the combination continues to deliver significant value for customers and shareholders, as we leverage our
scale in operations and in capital deployment. This morning, I would like to update you on the progress of our growth
projects, our efforts to maximize value from our commercial portfolio, and the status of our efforts around coal ash
management, and the operational performance of Edwardsport. Then I will turn the call over to Steve to discuss the
specifics of the quarter.
First, growth. For the five year period, from 2014 through 2018, we are targeting between $16 billion and $20 billion of
growth investments. These investments include new generation, infrastructure projects, and regulatory compliance
initiatives, all of which underpin our 4% to 6% long-term earnings per share growth rate. The investments as outlined
on slide four, allow us to meet the needs of our customers, and grow the company well into the future. We have made
significant progress to advance our portfolio of new generation projects including gas fired generation in Florida and
South Carolina and renewable generation in our commercial and regulated businesses.
In mid-May, we announced plans for three major construction projects in Florida as outlined on slide five. These
projects represent a total investment of about $1.9 billion and include a 1640-megawatt combined cycle plant in Citrus
County, two new combustion turbine plants at our existing Suwannee plant and an uprate project at our Hines Energy
Complex. These projects are expected to be in service by the end of 2018.The Florida Public Service Commission will
hold hearings on these projects later this month with an order anticipated this fall.
Next turning to South Carolina, we received commission approval in April for our proposed 750-megawatt Lee
combined cycle natural gas plant. The plant is expected to be operational in late 2017 and Duke's share of the
investment is expected to be approximately $600 million.
Turning to slide six, I'll provide an update on our renewable growth investments. Through 2018, we are targeting total
investments of around $2 billion in our regulated and commercial renewables businesses. We presently have 400
megawatts of wind and approximately 100 megawatts of solar under construction in our commercial businesses.
In our regulated business, we were encouraged by the strong response we received to our solar RFP in North Carolina
and are presently negotiating power purchase agreements and ownership options for approximately 300 megawatts of
regulated solar generation. We're also pleased with progress in South Carolina, where the state recently passed
comprehensive solar legislation to encourage the development of renewable generation. This legislation followed a
year-long collaborative process with important environmental stakeholders. We expect to invest in or incentivize
renewable generation of up to 3% of our peak load capacity by the end of 2021, representing approximately 150
megawatts.
The law also establishes the process for the commission to review net metering rates, which we expect to occur over
the next 9 months to 12 months. We will continue to work collaboratively with all interested stakeholders as this

legislation is implemented.
As summarized on slide seven, last week we announced an agreement to purchase the North Carolina Eastern
Municipal Power Agency's minority ownership in certain existing Duke Energy progress plants. In all about 700
megawatts of nuclear and scrubbed coal generation that we already operate.
The asset purchase price is $1.2 billion and we would also enter into to a 30-year full requirement, wholesale contract
to supply power to NCEMPA. This agreement provides benefits to both the customers of Duke Energy Progress and
the members of NCEMPA. If approved, this transaction would be one of the largest municipal power plant transactions
on record. Under the agreement, we are required to close the transaction by the end of 2016. This project is incremental
to the capital plan that we shared with you in February and provides additional support to our long-term earnings per
share growth objective of 4% to 6%. The ultimate annual earnings contribution from this investment will be dependent
upon the timing of closing, appropriate regulatory treatment, and how the company chooses to finance the transaction.
We currently expect a full-year earnings uplift of between $0.05 and $0.10 per share. There are a number of important
regulatory milestones that are critical to the successful execution of this purchase. We expect to start this process with a
FERC filing at the end of this month and we'll provide updates as the approval process progresses.
Let me also highlight a couple of the infrastructure investments that we are developing. As you know, last year, Indiana
passed Senate Bill 560, which was designed to streamline implementation and recovery for transmission and
distribution infrastructure needs. We plan to make a filing this year resulting in potential investments over seven years
of between $1.5 billion and $2 billion.
And in April, Duke Energy and Piedmont Natural Gas jointly issued a solicitation for a major new natural gas pipeline
into North Carolina. We received initial bids in June and expect to announce the winner within the next several weeks.
Our Carolinas utilities expect to enter into a gas transportation contract with the pipeline and we are pursuing an
ownership interest in the pipeline underpinning the project's financial viability.
The RFP has an initial capacity of at least 900 million cubic feet per day with a targeted in-service date of late 2018.
We continue to made progress with initiatives related to our non-regulated commercial portfolio. As outlined on slide
eight, the exit of the Midwest merchant generation business is progressing. We are in the final phases of due diligence
and expect to announce the winning bidder in the next few months. The closing of any transaction is likely to occur in
late 2014 or early 2015.
Use of proceeds for this transaction are under evaluation and could include a combination of funding growth
investment opportunities, avoiding future holding company financings or a stock buyback. We are committed to
redeploying the proceeds in a manner that maximizes shareholder value and expect the transaction will be accretive to
our adjusted earnings per share, beginning in 2016. We're also making meaningful progress on the evaluation of our
international business. We're considering a wide range of options, including opportunities for growth, as well as tax
efficient strategies for utilization of our $1.7 billion in offshore cash. We expect to complete this review late this year
or early 2015.
Next turning to slide 10 let me provide an update on Dan River. As you know, we've taken responsibility for the
accidental discharge of coal ash in early February and have been working on cleanup activities at the site and the river.
Our work at the site and the river has been under the direction of the EPA. Last month we announced that we have met
the EPA's requirements to-date, but we'll continue to monitor the rivers water quality. Our overall goal is to ensure the
long-term health of the river.
Costs incurred on cleanup activities were approximately $20 million of the first six months of the year. We do not
expect total cleanup costs related to the Dan River incident to be material. We're cooperating with and defending the
company in ongoing investigations resulting from the Dan River accident. We have also made progress on our
comprehensive plans around the near-term and longer term management of each of our coal ash basins. We are
committed to developing a scientific engineered solution for each site that will protect the environment and allow us to
continue to provide safe, reliable and cost-effective electricity for our customers.

We expect to finalize the development of comprehensive closure strategies by year-end. Ultimately, our plans will need
to be in alignment with any final legislation in North Carolina and upcoming Federal rules for coal ash, which are
expected by the end of the year. Our ash basin closure costs will be dependent upon the methodology selected and
approved for each site. We will continue to refine our projections for closure costs and provide updates as our plans are
finalized. We believe the recoverability of coal ash basin closure costs will be determined by the Carolina's
Commission.
Next, let me provide a brief update on the recent legislative session in North Carolina, where the General Assembly
introduced legislation addressing the management and closure of ash basins. The legislature did not come to an
agreement on the compromised bill and adjourned last week. The adjournment resolutions contemplate the coal ash
legislation could be considered during a reconvened legislative session later this month or later this year. It's important
to highlight that this delay will not impede our actions or our commitment to working constructively with all parties to
continue advancing our comprehensive plans for the long-term management of coal ash in North Carolina.
Next, let's turn to slide 11 and our Edwardsport plant in Indiana, which achieved commercial in-service in June of last
year. Because Edwardsport is a large and complex project [audio gap] (13:09-13:11) that it would build up to its
long-term level of availability over 15 months. I was at the site last month and I'm pleased with the progress as well as
the dedication of the plant staff. Plant output and overall performance have steadily improved since early this year
when extreme [audio gap] (13:27-13:29) caused operational challenges. May was the strongest month we have seen for
gasification output to date and June was not far behind. In fact, gasification availability during the second quarter was
around 75%. July's results were also favorable with gasification availability coming in around 80%. We have
completed GE's rigorous performance testing protocol and have validated that all major technology systems are
working. We are reviewing the test data received from GE and preliminary results are positive. During testing, we
achieved the nameplate capacity of 618 megawatts and had encouraging preliminary results on heat rates.
The right side of the slide outlines the status of the regulatory proceedings associated with the plant. The Indiana
Commission has combined two semi-annual rider updates, IGCC-12 and IGCC-13 and will hold hearings in November.
IGCC-11 is fully briefed and we are awaiting a commission order. The commission will examine the operational
performance of the plant in the normal course of reviewing our semi-annual rider filings, while any replacement power
costs resulting from the operational performance of the plant are reviewed in connection with the quarterly fuel clause
proceedings. We will continue to update you on our operational progress and these important regulatory milestones.
Now, I will turn the call over to Steve to discuss our financial performance for the quarter.
Steven K. Young
Thank you, Lynn. Today, I'll focus on three primary areas. First, I'll discuss at a high level, the primary drivers to our
second quarter results and update you on the status of our earnings guidance range for 2014. Second, I'll discuss our
volume trends and the economic conditions within our service territories. Finally, I will close with our progress toward
achieving our overall financial objectives.
Let's start with the major second quarter earnings per share drivers as outlined on slide 12. This morning, we
announced 2014 second quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.11, which exceeds 2013's second quarter
results of $0.87 per share. We saw higher quarterly earnings at each of our three business segments.
As expected, quarterly results were supported by revised customer rates, growth in our regulated wholesale business,
and higher PJM capacity prices. We also experienced favorable weather and a lower effective tax rate during the
quarter. As Lynn just mentioned, due to the strong results experienced through the first half of the year, we have
increased our 2014 adjusted EPS guidance range by $0.05, to $4.50 to $4.65 per share.
I will discuss more details on our revised guidance range at the end of my presentation. On a reported basis, the
company earned $0.86 during the quarter compared to $0.48 in the second quarter of 2013. A reconciliation of reported
results to adjusted results is included in the supplemental materials. Adjusted earnings at our regulated utility segment,

increased by $0.13 per share during the quarter. We continue to benefit from increases associated with our 2013 rate
cases in the Carolinas and increases from newly contracted wholesale customers.
We experienced favorable weather this quarter, compared to below normal weather last year. In the Carolinas cooling
degree days were around 10% higher than average. The utilities experienced a lower effective tax rate during the
quarter, driven by a state tax settlement that resulted in a favorable adjustment to deferred taxes.
O&M costs were also favorable during the second quarter, partially driven by a prior year donation, associated with
Duke Energy Progress' rate case and benefits from nuclear outage cost levelization. Absent these drivers our cost
control efforts have helped us maintain flat O&M compared to last year's quarter. We continue to drive cost out of the
business through our merger related initiatives and our targeting flat O&M costs through 2016.
International Energy's quarterly results were $0.09 per share higher this year, primarily driven by a $0.07 favorable tax
benefit resulting from a reorganization of the company's operations in Chile. As a result of this benefit, we are lowering
our overall consolidated adjusted effective tax rate assumption for 2014 to between 32% and 33%. National methanol's
contribution for the quarter was $0.02 higher than last year, primarily due to an extended maintenance outage that
occurred in 2013.
Commercial powers adjusted earnings were $0.02 higher, supported by increased wind and solar volumes from new
projects coming online and higher output from existing projects. Higher PJM capacity prices drove increased results
from Midwest generation. More detailed quarterly earnings drivers for each of our segments are included in today's
presentation materials and press release.
Before moving on, let me briefly update you on hydro conditions in Brazil. We continue to closely monitor reservoir
levels as we have significant contracted hydro capacity. During the second quarter, the rainy season came to an end and
reservoir levels remain low. In order to help preserve reservoir levels, Brazil's regulatory authorities continue to
dispatch thermal generation. In anticipation of below normal rainfall and challenging reservoir conditions, we reduced
our contracted capacity levels for 2014. This reduction in contracted levels along with higher short term pricing has
helped us mitigate significant negative financial impacts from the drought so far this year.
Slide 13 highlights our retail customer volume trends for the quarter and the economic conditions within our service
territories. Overall, weather-normal retail customer load for the quarter was 0.4% higher than 2013. This was in line
with our overall expectations for the year.
We evaluate the economic growth of our service territories over longer-term periods on a rolling 12-month basis.
Weather-normal retail customer load was 1.6% higher. We continue to be encouraged by broad trends in the economy
such as higher median household income levels, lower unemployment rates and new customer additions. We remain
confident in our longer-term growth expectation of around 1%. Economic activity is expected to continue expanding
over the remainder of the year. In fact, consensus estimates expect GDP growth to be around 3% in the second-half of
2014.
Employment activity in the states we serve continues to improve with unemployment percentages at or below the U.S.
average in four of the six states we serve. In June, approximately 20% of total U.S. non-farm job growth was from
states served by Duke Energy.
Next, let me highlight some of the trends we are seeing in each of our customer classes. First, our residential customers,
where quarter-over-quarter growth was essentially flat. Household income and available credit heavily influenced this
customer class. While these indicators have not yet recovered to pre-recessionary levels, they have shown improvement
over time. During the quarter, we continued to experience positive growth in the number of customers at our regulated
utilities of around 1%. However, usage per customer was unfavorable during the quarter largely offsetting the growth
in the number of customers.
Next, our commercial class experienced quarterly growth of 0.5%. Office vacancies and unemployment rates continue
to improve leading to growth in retail sales. Continued higher sales were seen in education, healthcare, and hospitality
sectors when compared to last year.

And finally, the industrial sector experienced growth of 0.8% in the second quarter. We continue to see encouraging
strength in the automotive, construction and metal sub-sectors. Economic development within our service territories
remains active. Our affordable electricity rates help attract businesses to our service territories.
Our economic development teams are actively pursuing potential projects within our six state footprint, which could
represent up to $10 billion in new investments and over 20,000 jobs. So far this year, several new business relocations
and expansions have announced in our service territories, representing around $2.5 billion in investments and more
than 5000 new jobs. We're optimistic about the sustainability of the economic recovery across our service territories
based on the growth that we've experienced over the rolling 12-month basis. Individual quarters may vary, but the
longer term economic trends are generally favorable.
I will close with our financial objectives for 2014 and the longer term as outlined on slide 14. These financial
objectives have remained consistent over time. We have an established track record of achieving each of these
objectives. I'm very pleased with our financial performance through the second quarter. To date we have benefited from
revised rates in the regulated businesses, favorable weather, solid growth in sales volumes, and favorable impacts of tax
rates.
Additionally, we continue to drive more efficiencies across the company. We still have our third quarter ahead of us,
which is historically our most significant quarter. In July, we experienced mild weather, and do not yet know if that
trend will continue into August. We also expect to accelerate the recognition of certain expenses into 2014, primarily a
coal unit outage in the Carolinas, as well as some costs to advance our coal ash management work.
Despite uncertainty with the weather for the third quarter, we are pleased with the strength of our results to date, and
are increasing our 2014 adjusted EPS guidance range. We will update you on our progress when we report our third
quarter results in early November. The balance sheet remains strong. This strength affords us the flexibility to invest in
our business and grow our dividend without the need for new equity issuances through 2016.
We are focused on growing the dividend, which is central to our investor value proposition. In June, our Board of
Directors approved an approximate 2% increase to our quarterly dividend. This marks the seventh consecutive year of
annual dividend increases. We expect to move into our targeted long-term dividend payout ratio range of 65% to 70%
in 2014, allowing greater flexibility in future dividend growth.
Finally, as Lynn discussed, we are focused on executing our growth initiatives as well as our cost management efforts.
We're well positioned to achieve adjusted earnings per share growth within our 4% to 6% target through 2016.
Additionally, some of our growth investments provide support for growth beyond 2016. Now I'll turn it back over to
Lynn.
Lynn J. Good
Before closing, I thought I would briefly comment on the EPA's recently proposed rules for regulating carbon dioxide
emissions from existing power plants. Since issued in June, we've been evaluating this complex rule and engaging with
our state regulators. We intend to remain actively engaged in this rule making process. We support policies that will
result in reasonable decreases in greenhouse gas emissions overtime, while balancing impacts to our customers' rates,
the economies of our service territories and reliability that our customers count on.
We have made significant progress over the last decade in reducing the environmental impact of our generating
facilities. We have invested over $9 billion in new generation, allowing for the retirement of over half of our coal fleet.
In our remaining coal units, we've invested over $7 billion on environmental control equipment. As a result through
2013, we've reduced our carbon emissions by 20% from 2005 levels, while also achieving SO2 reductions of 84% and
NOx reductions of 63%, during the same time period.
As we engage in this proposed regulation, our comments will focus on ensuring that this progress is recognized and that
these investments continue to deliver value to our customers over their remaining useful lives. It's important that our
customers receive the full benefit of our early actions, not just actions since 2012. The treatment of nuclear, both new

and existing is also a clear area of focus for us.
The complexity of this rule requires careful study and evaluation, not just of each potential building block, but the
interaction of all elements together. We expect significant comments as well as legal challenges to the rule and we will
remain engaged throughout the development of this important rule making.
In closing, we're executing our strategy in a thoughtful and disciplined way that continues to build momentum and
deliver value for our customers, communities and shareholders. And we are developing growth opportunities as we
position the company for the future.
Now I'd like to open the line up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from Greg Gordon from ISI Group. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Hi, Greg.
<A - Steven K. Young>: Good morning, Greg.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: So – a bit of a strategic question rather than focusing on the quarter because it was – clearly it
was a great quarter for you guys. Congrats on that.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Thank you.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: There's always been this issue with strategic review of Latin America, which is really like, okay,
well what are we going to do with the money if we bring it back. But now you've got the power plant consolidation
investment, potential for an investment in a major pipeline, the potential for the necessity of incremental major
investments to remediate your ash ponds. So can you talk about how the sort of the burgeoning necessity for capital in
your core business might change the way you're looking at your Latin American business?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Greg, the way I would respond to that is we've had growth aspirations in the range of the $16
billion to $18 billion to underpin our 4% to 6% growth rate for some time. And so we have been analyzing all of our
strategic evaluations in the context of positioning the company to grow. And so when we talk about the strategic
analysis of international, when we look at the decision to strategically exit the Midwest generation all of that review has
been within the context of better positioning the company to grow and deploy capital in a way that adds value. So, you
know, I would think of all those things together and we will provide you with further updates on our thinking and
progress on these initiatives as they occur.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Can you refresh our memories as to your last public comments on the tax efficiency of bringing
back the $1.7 billion?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: We haven't made any specific comments, Greg on that item, but let me just maybe give you a
little bit of background. We did bring home $700 million, in a very tax efficient format in December of 2013. So that
was $700 million, basically a basis reduction initiative. We now have $1.7 billion offshore, and we are continuing to
look for ways that we can put that cash to use in a tax efficient manner, so that study is underway as part of the strategic
analysis. So you can think of cash utilization, support of the dividend, and growth as being the three primary objectives.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Okay, my last question. When you gave the range $0.05 to $0.10 as the annualized earnings
impact of the power plant consolidation, what are the financing assumptions that underlie that? Is that, does that assume
a sort of debt and equity at sort of a, consistent with the balance sheet of the Progress Energy Carolinas or some other

variable?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Yeah. So depending on financing structure, it would fall within that range, Greg, depending on
how much equity is included and how much is debt finance, Steve, how would you add to that?
<A - Steven K. Young>: Yes I would point out that roughly one half of the purchase price would be financed through
OpCo debt. So we're talking about roughly $600 million that would be, of the equity piece, that could be financed
through cash or through HoldCo debt. I don't envision the need to issue common equity to deal with this.
<Q - Greg Gordon>: Great. Thank you guys.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Thanks Greg.

<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Hi, good morning guys.

<A - Steven K. Young>: Good morning.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Just extending maybe a little one on Greg's line of questioning, but when we think about the 4%
to 6% earnings growth range through 2016. I guess, A, when do you think you're going to maybe reevaluate or maybe
put more time horizon on that number? And then, B, with the pipeline out there with kind of the redeployment of the
moneys from NCEMPA and selling commercial generation that sort of stuff, what's going to swing you within the 4%
to 6% as you see it right now?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: To take the two questions, Dan we will continue to follow our traditional approach on guidance,
and updated in February, I think we've been in the three-year range for the last couple of years, so that we have
provided capital for a five-year period, so we'll continue to update that. I think the drivers for growth include capital
investments in both the regulated business as well as load growth, cost efficiencies, additional renewable growth, which
would be both regulated and non-regulated. And so, as I think about variables that can impact earnings over a short
term or long term period, load growth comes to mind, ability to control cost come to mind, and the efficiency and
magnitude of capital deployment.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. And then I guess on the coal ash issue, with the EPA rule sitting out there and kind of a
variety of different fingers in the pot, when do you think we're going to finalize some visibility into your full capital
obligations or capital expenditures and kind of the timeline for putting that capital to work?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Right. The EPA rule that would be probably most relevant here Dan is expected in December.
The designation of hazardous or non-hazardous, I believe the timeline for that remains. The plans that we have put
forward at this point have us in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion for ash basin closure that's consistent with our
historical range of waste disposal updated for the comprehensive plan that we put forward in March.
So I think there are a couple of things to watch in terms of refinement of those numbers. One being, we will continue to
develop our strategic approach for closure of all of the basins and we're targeting the end of this year. We also have the
delay in the legislation in North Carolina, which could be finalized this year that would also impact that. And then I
would expect all of these plans to come under review by the regulators in North Carolina over the years to come, which
could continue to refine it. So I think we'll reach milestones over 2014 and 2015 for our plants here in the Carolinas and
then we will of course keep you updated as those milestones occur.
<A - Steven K. Young>: And I would also add that the expenditures related to this activity span many, many years.
This is well over a decade to deploy these funds.

<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Okay. Great. And I guess last question just kind of on load growth. I felt like the last couple
quarters there is more optimism that maybe demand growth is going to sneak above the 1% target you guys have talked
about. This quarter seemed a little less enthusiastic not only for you guys, but across the industry. Can you just talk
about trend line what you're seeing? And if you think the second quarter is more indicative or if what we saw in the
preceding quarters is maybe where trend was?
<A - Steven K. Young>: Well, Dan, you've hit on the challenge of looking at quarterly data. Certainly, the first quarter
of 2014 was probably heavily influenced by weather. We tried to pull the impact of weather out, but that's as much art
as science. The second quarter, the results were lower in line with our forecast. But when you look at a 12-month
rolling average, you see that we're around 1.6% growth. The broad economic indicators continue to improve and we
look at unemployment, number of customers added in our service territories, household, median household income,
those kind of things. Overall, we do feel like – it is improving, but given the volatility that we continue to see
quarter-to-quarter, we're not ready to move beyond the 1% long-term growth. We will be updating our forecast
formally in the fall and see what it looks like then.
<Q - Dan L. Eggers>: Great. Thank you, guys.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Thanks, Dan.

We'll now take our next question from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Yeah. Good morning, guys.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Hi, Jonathan.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Can I – one firstly, just one question on what you said about the drought in Brazil.
Steve, I believe you said – you've taken down the sales commitments and that has substantially mitigated what would
have been more negative impact. But what – can you give us a sense of how much of a residual negative that still is in
the 2014 number, as you see it now, if any, and just a bit more kind of some more numbers around, what you said
there?
<A - Steven K. Young>: Well our contracting strategy has paid off benefits so far in the first two quarters of 2014, as
we mentioned. We're not in a position to predict how the final two quarters will come out. We're out the wet season, the
reservoir levels are low, they're in the low 30%s and this is the time of the year, where they will decline. We'll come
into a new rainy season in the fall and that will be critical to the final results for the year. The contracting strategy of
lowering should benefit us as well throughout the year. But again, it's hard to say where those reservoir levels are going
to be and what hydro capacity is going to be available to serve the commitments we have at this time. We'll just have to
wait and see.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: but through the first two quarters, is it fair to say your actions mitigated any negative
impact, although there's still some drag embedded in numbers?
<A - Steven K. Young>: Well, the first two quarters certainly our contracting strategy was beneficial to us and
perhaps, I'm not understanding your question. I don't know enough to predict the final two quarters.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: And Jonathan, what I would add is, we were in line with our expectations for the first two
quarters for Brazil and it's the items that Steve talked about, the lower contracting gave us the ability to take advantage
of the higher spot prices in the first two quarters. It's difficult.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: And then that, you kind of ended up about on plan and your comment is you avoided
what would otherwise had been a loss.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: That's correct...

<A - Steven K. Young>: That's right.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: ...or a reduction in earnings. Yes.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Yeah. And then secondly, could you comment at all about the recent reports that
you're involved in the late stages of the Isagen sale in Colombia, just in the context of your comment about being
focused on potential growth avenues in the international business?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: You know, Jonathan, we are not involved in the late stages of bidding for Isagen.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay. Thank you for that. And I think, oh one other thing I just want to clarify, you
mentioned that NCEM, the NCEMPA transaction is incremental to the 4% to 6%, is that more in the sense of yeah its
incremental beyond 2016 or is there – is that statement more that you – this could push you above the rate, the growth
rate in 2016. How should we kind of interpret that?
<A - Steven K. Young>: I would think about the NCEMPA investment as giving us confidence in the 4% to 6%
growth rate. It's the type of capital, the discretionary type capital projects that we are pursuing. And certainly, this will
provide earnings over its life of the wholesale contract with municipalities beyond 2016, but I'd say it gives us
confidence in the growth rate.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Jonathan, the incremental comment that we made is incremental of the capital that we shared
with you in February.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Okay.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: We've been trying to increase that growth from the $16 billion to the $20 billion by identifying
and pursuing these growth initiatives. So, this is one of the key ones.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: So that whole slide seven should be seen as sort of the difference between $16 billion
and $20 billion effectively?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: That's correct.
<A - Steven K. Young>: That's correct.
<Q - Jonathan Philip Arnold>: Thank you.

<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Hi. Good morning. It's Julien here actually.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Very good. How are you Julien?
<A - Steven K. Young>: How are you Julien?
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Good. Excellent. I wanted to follow-up on a few items here. First, with regard to the
pipeline RFP, could you talk a little bit about potential ownership interest and also talk a little bit about how that might
be structured to what level you might take that ownership etc?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Hey, Julien. It's premature to go into any more specifics on this, as we pursue the solicitation we
did pursue of course options to, we were looking for transport capacity for the utilities, but we were also looking for an
ownership interest and so that will be a part of our ongoing discussions as we finalize the solicitation. But I don't have

anything more specific to share at this point.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Fair enough. And then moving onto the coal ash side, could you give us a sense, one,
where the conversation is today with respect to the total spend versus what you disclosed previously? And then
secondly, as you think about that how does it compare -what are the key moving parts here as we look towards
negotiations in the back half of the year for total spend?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Yeah. So Julien, you may recall it's actually in this slide deck as well in the appendix, that we
put forward a range of spending for North Carolina around the ash basins that began on the left hand side of the chart
and I am referring you to slide 40 at this point. On the left hand side of the chart, representing our historic numbers for
waste environmental spending updated for the plans that we put forward in March of this year following Dan River. On
the right hand side of the page would be a full excavation of all ash in North Carolina as well as conversion to
Zero-Liquid Discharge. So our expectation is that we will end up somewhere in between those two numbers over time
and as I shared in the comments earlier in the call, those final estimates will be revised as closure strategy and the
methods are developed and approved. Right now, based on the commitments that we've made, I would say we're in the
range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion, but those numbers will be refined as additional work, engineering, science approvals
et cetera proceed.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: All right. Thank you. And then moving back to the international side, if you don't
mind, could you talk a little bit more about how to make any potential transaction, accretive. And specifically what I'm
getting is how do you think about potential partnerships and driving synergies out of any deal, perhaps is there an
opportunity to use the offshore cash back to invest into growth as a way to perhaps transform the business?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Julien, I would say all options are on the table, when we do a review of this sort, looking for
ways that we can streamline the business, looking for ways we can drive growth, optimize cash et cetera. So I would
say all options are on the table at this point. And as we progress and reach final conclusions, we'll of course provide an
update, we're targeting end of 2014 early 2015 at this point.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: And just to clear, a little nuance there, does the current hydrological situation drive
timing or consideration of transaction et cetera?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: No.
<Q - Julien Dumoulin-Smith>: Okay. Excellent. Well, thank you very much.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Thank you.

We'll now take our next question form Michael Lapides from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Yeah. Hey, guys, just a couple of questions.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Hi, Mike.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Hi, Lynn. Just couple of questions about the good old fashion regulated side of the house.
When you think about rate cases over the next or year or so, what new ones do you anticipate filing across the system?
<A - Steven K. Young>: Michael, in terms of looking at our rate cases, we had a lot of activity in 2013 in the
Carolinas and Ohio as well. So we don't have any base rate cases planned for a while. Our settlement in Florida sets up
a lot of trackers for a significant cost, but keeps us out of base rates for a while. So we don't have any plans through
2016 for base rate increases. We may look at our Duke Energy Progress South Carolina jurisdiction as a potential area.
We'll keep an eye on that. But nothing in the near-term given all the activity that we concluded in 2013.
<Q - Michael J. Lapides>: Got it. One other question. There's – and this is about the potential new projects you would
develop down in Florida as well as the NCEMPA acquisition you've disclosed. On the Florida one, there's a lot of

opposition to those developments, because there still is Florida is one of the states where there's still a lot of
non-regulated or merchant, combined cycles and peakers kind of hanging around, guys who are obviously willing to
sell into a utility, either RFP or actually sell the asset to a utility like yours. Just curious in terms of how you think
regulators will look at that option, the kind of a cost benefit analysis? And also if you can address on the NCEMPA
process, there was a lot, going back to the Progress merger, there was a lot of back and forth with the FERC about
potential market power issues in the Carolinas. How would this acquisition kind of screen in terms of market power, in
the Carolinas?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Taking both of those, Michael, on Florida, I think you've raised a key question on whether or not
the investments that we've put forward represent the lowest cost option for customers. And that will be centerpiece of
the regulatory review in August. We believe that the process that we've undertaken, which included an RFP for the
Citrus County combined cycle will support that what we've put forward is the lowest cost option, but I think that will
be the centerpiece of the regulatory proceeding that will occur this month continuing through the final approval
process.
On market power, we've of course looked closely at this. We do not see a market power issue with the NCEMPA
transaction, a couple of things I would note, is we're acquiring generation and load of a comparable amount. So, we're
not acquiring excess generation. And the fact that we already operate these units has us in a position where the dispatch
of the units will not change as a part of the acquisition. So those are both, we believe key considerations in the market
power analysis.

[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Jim Von Riesemann from CRT Capital. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jim D. von Riesemann>: Hi, Lynn. Hi, Steve.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Hi, Jim.
<A - Steven K. Young>: Hello, Jim.
<Q - Jim D. von Riesemann>: How are you?
<A - Steven K. Young>: Good.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Good.
<Q - Jim D. von Riesemann>: I've got a couple of simple questions. One is on the dividend, I know you have this
targeted 65% to 70% payout ratio. But as I do some of the math, it seems like you still have a little bit of room to grow
at above the 2%. What do you think about raising the dividend better than the 2% that you have been doing thus far?
<A - Steven K. Young>: Well, as we have said, we understand the value of the dividend to our overall proposition. We
are now moving into our target range. We have been above it for a while.
<Q - Jim D. von Riesemann>: Right.
<A - Steven K. Young>: That gives us as we've said as time goes forward if we continue to earn as we should, that
should give us more flexibility and we will certainly be looking at increasing the dividend growth rate. Ideally, we
would like to get it more in line with our earnings growth rate, but it remains to be seen when and how that happens.
<Q - Jim D. von Riesemann>: The second quick question is, on the 4% to 6%, thank you for the answer. The second
question is on the 4% to 6% growth rate, can you just refresh our memory as to what is the base year on that? Is it
2013?

<A - Steven K. Young>: Yes. It's the midpoint of the projected earnings range for 2013.
<Q - Jim D. von Riesemann>: Right. Okay. Okay. And then the last question is on your slide number four, you talk
about the new growth investments of $16 billion to $20 billion, over this period through 2018. One of which of the
buckets, is new generation at $6 billion to $8 billion, but if I just add the numbers up on the Florida combined cycle,
Lee and the renewables and everything. I come up to a number that's less than $6 billion. How should I think about that
remaining $2.3 billion or so to get to the high end of that $8 billion range? Are those placeholders that you're just not
ready to talk about publicly at this point in time?
<A - Steven K. Young>: Well, I think you can think about our business as a whole and kind of zero in on some things.
We're going to need to build some new facilities in the Carolinas to meet load...
<Q - Jim D. von Riesemann>: Okay.
<A - Steven K. Young>: ...growth in the back end of the year. Even at 1.5% peak load growth, you're going to be
growing, 300 megawatts, 400 megawatts in the Carolinas every year. So every couple of years, you're going to need
combined cycles or at least simple cycle CTs in the Carolinas. So there's a fair amount of generation that's going to
come in that area as well. So that will fill in a lot of that gap there.
<Q - Jim D. von Riesemann>: Okay. So the gap is accounted for, it's not something that we should be looking for in
subsequent announcements, is what you're saying?
<A - Steven K. Young>: That's correct.
<Q - Jim D. von Riesemann>: Okay.
<A - Steven K. Young>: And also some other categories of spend that are in the total number, compliance with EPA
regulations, a lot of MATS work to be done in the next few years and a lot of nuclear-related expenditures, particularly
related to Fukushima. So there's a number of those types of investments that help fill out the portfolio.
<Q - Jim D. von Riesemann>: Yeah. Understand. Thank you.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Thank you, Jim.

We'll now take our next question from Kit Konolige from BGC Financial. Please go Ahead.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Good morning, Lynn and Steve.
<A - Steven K. Young>: Good Morning.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Couple of kind of scattered questions. First, the sale of Midwest gen, you're obviously aware that
DPL withdrew their plants from the market. Does that affect what you're doing at all?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: No. Kit, our process has been part of a strategic evaluation that we undertook at the end of last
year continuing into this year and so we are moving forward with our decision and don't have any specific milestones
to announce except to say the process is continuing and we expect to close later this year or early 2015.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Right. And how about on the North Caroline pipeline, can you give us any details of timing on
that?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: No. We expect to finalize the review of the solicitation within the next few weeks Kit and would
make an announcement at that time.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: Okay. So that's obviously near-term. And how should we understand Lynn, both with regard to
the pipeline and to renewable investments? How should we access Duke's degree of interest in either of those, I mean,

are either of those areas going to become a major business segment or are these one-off type of investments?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: No. I would think about the pipeline into North Carolina as a very strategic investment for the
company Kit. We see it as being strategic to not only the state of North Carolina, but to electric supply in the state of
North Carolina as we continue to add gas. I think, this will give us an important entry into pipeline and if you think
back to the Spectra spend, Duke has had a history of interest in pipeline investment, but I'm not foreshadowing any
strategic shift. What we're focused on at this point is the North Carolina investment.
I would say that renewables have been a part of our story for some time. We continue to add to our commercial
renewable business as well as introducing renewables in our regulated jurisdictions. We see that as an increasingly
important part of the portfolio and I think we mentioned in the call that we have 400 megawatts of wind and 100
megawatts of solar under construction right now in support of our commercial businesses; another 300 megawatts of
solar that we're negotiating under an RFP in North Carolina. So I would expect to see additional renewable investment
in the years to come.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: All right. And finally, in Florida, Steve you were talking about no rate cases in the near future and
so on. What, I assume you're keeping an eye on the political situation down there. What would it do for your regulatory
outlook in Florida if Charlie Crist made another stunning comeback here and became Governor again?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Kit, that's difficult question. We have to work with all stakeholders and all legislators, governors
in our jurisdiction. So, we're focused on running our business as well as we possibly can. We're also focused on making
investments for the long-term value that we can deliver to our customers and we watch politics much like you do.
<Q - Kit Konolige>: As a spectator sport.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: I would say...
<Q - Kit Konolige>: That's how I watch it. I don't know about – obviously it's more important for you.

<A - Lynn J. Good>: Yeah. We don't have a specific project that we'd point you to. One of the underpinnings of the
strategic review is we see headwinds in Latin America from currency and potential re-pricing that puts us in a position
where the growth rate isn't as strong as we'd like it to be. So, we're taking this – undertaking this strategic review to
look at all elements including growth and efficiency and utilization of cash, but don't have any specific project that we
would draw attention to today.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay, and then with respect to the coal ash legislation. There seem to be two sort of competing
bills that were sort of vying against one another. And I was just wondering if there was any sense, that we might have
in terms of – and I realize that obviously those are two potential outcomes and there could be obviously, another
outcome, that could happen or no outcome I guess. And I know you guys are working at it, regardless and you guys are
sort of aggressively pursuing the coal ash situation. But, how should we think about those potential outcomes I guess
and what potential impact it may or may not have on your projected growth rate and earnings?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Paul, what I would say is that the legislature has been delayed. I think it's difficult for us to
speculate at this point about either the timing of reconvening or the scope and approach the legislature would take. I do
think there's a strong commitment on the part of the general assembly to get the legislation right and so they're being
deliberate and thoughtful in their process. And we have given you some broad parameters around how we think about
the potential costs. And the other thing that I would indicate, that you should keep in mind, with all of the ash, is this is
going to play out over a number of years.
So even if you look at the existing profile of the senate and house bills, they were targets over 5 years and 10 years and
15 years. Total deployment would be over a very long period of time. So that's all I would say at this point and we'll of
course keep you informed, as progress occurs.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: But is it safe to say, perhaps that, that within the earnings range that you have given that these
outcomes would probably be within that range, regardless of which one would happen or does that make sense? Do you
follow what I'm saying?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Paul, I think getting back to this range of cost that we've included on slide 40.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Right.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: So we have $2.5 million and this is just North Carolina, $2.5 million on one end and $10 billion
on another end. So the more excavation of ash that could arise will increase the cost. Again, timeframe is important 5,
10, 15 years to accomplish that. So I don't think, based on where we are right now, we can't give you any more
specifics on where we think it will end up. The legislation's been delayed and we'll have more to report as it progresses.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Fair enough. And, I don't – I don't mean to focus too much on it but it seems to me that a
lot of these costs would be rate oriented costs. Right?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: We believe that cost recovery for ash is under the purview of the Carolina's Commission. But
that again is something that would be addressed over time.
<Q - Paul Patterson>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Thank you.

<Q - Ali Agha>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Hi, Ali.
<A - Steven K. Young>: Good morning.

<Q - Ali Agha>: Hi. And then Steve just wanted to clarify a couple of comments you'd made earlier. First off, Steve
for planning purposes that 32% to 33% tax rate in 2014. Should we assume roughly the same in the next couple of
years as well?
<A - Steven K. Young>: No. I wouldn't try to be that precise as we go forward. We'll have to take a look each year at
what's in front of us in terms of our tax optimization strategies and we'll give that year-by-year as we have in the past.
<Q - Ali Agha>: I see. So directionally, though it could go up or down, is the way to think about it?
<A - Steven K. Young>: Well, it could. Yes, it could. It could move, I don't think it would move dramatically either up
or down. But I don't have any insight as to which direction it might move at this point.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Got it. And Lynn just to be clear, maybe you've said that and I may have missed that, but in your
international review of the all the options you're looking at is a complete exit from international one of the options or is
that off the table?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: I said it before Ali that all options are on the table, but as we approach the strategic review, we
did not approach it with exit in mind. We approached it with an objective of trying to optimize the portfolio, pursue
cash, a more efficient use of cash and growth. So we always look at everything, but more to come as we complete our
work and targeting end of this year or early next.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Got it. And my last question also just to clarify when you talk about exiting the merchant and using
the proceeds and so net impact being accretive, is that net impact embedded in the 4% to 6% or could that be upside
assuming everything goes as planned?
<A - Lynn J. Good>: So it's contemplated in the range, Ali. If you look at, I believe, it would have been in first
quarter. It's also on slide 45 of this quarter's deck, you will see sort of the makeup of how we get to 4% to 6% and
redeployment of proceeds is a potential item to consider.
<Q - Ali Agha>: Got it. Thank you very much.
<A - Lynn J. Good>: Thank you.
Operator
I will now turn the call back to Lynn Good for closing comments.
