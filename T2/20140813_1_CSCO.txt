Throughout this call we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. The matters that we'll be
discussing today include forward-looking statements and as such are subject to the risks and uncertainties that we
discuss in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, specifically the most recent reports on the Form 10-Q, 10-K and
10-Q and applicable amendments in which we identify important risk factors that could cause actual results to differ
materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.
Unauthorized recording of this call is not permitted.
All comparisons throughout this call will be on a year-over-year basis unless stated otherwise. As in the past we will
discuss product results in terms of revenue and geographic and customer segment results in terms of product orders
unless specifically stated otherwise.
I will now turn it over to John for his commentary on the quarter.
John T. Chambers
Mel, thank you very much.
I am pleased with our solid performance in Q4 with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.55 on revenues of $12.4
billion, exceeding the guidance we gave you and representing a record quarter for non-GAAP earnings per share and
our second highest quarter in our history in terms of revenue. We generated over $3.6 billion in operating cash flow and
returned approximately $2.5 billion to our shareholders through share buybacks and dividends.
FY 2014 was a year with many big wins and several challenges. Our fiscal year began with a number of external
headwinds including the federal government shutdown and the possibility of a U.S. default combined with significant
slowdown in emerging markets. Even with this backdrop, FY 2014 ended with revenues of $47.1 billion representing
the second strongest year in our history and record non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.06 per share. We maintained
our non-GAAP gross margins, generated strong non-GAAP operating margins and exceeded our capital return target,
returning 120% of our free cash flow to shareholders. Our innovation engine dramatically accelerated this year as we
brought new architectures to the market for the next generation of networking, security and collaboration. At the same
time, the journey we began three years ago to transform Cisco continued at a rapid pace.
Let me take a step back for a moment. In 2011, we saw how rapidly the market was changing and understood that
would require transformational change in our company. We saw these market changes earlier than our peers and
understood the market dynamics were not unique to Cisco. We required a strategic approach, not tactical responses, to
the coming transactions. That is the core of what you have seen from Cisco over the past several years. Even in 2011,
we saw a much bigger picture.
We rolled out our transformational plan with two principal objectives: first, drive innovation, speed, agility and
efficiencies in our business and second, to transform the company to move from selling boxes to selling first
architectures then solutions and now outcomes. Operationally, we've done a very good job against those objectives
which has afforded us flexibility today in how we go after market opportunities. Our results are evident. We've created
significant operating leverage. In the past three years revenue has grown nearly $4 billion while our absolute
non-GAAP OpEx expense is virtually unchanged. That is very good execution, especially with compared with many of
our peers.
During the same time period, our U.S. commercial and U.S. enterprise business grew orders over 37% and 28%
respectively over these three years. They grew double digits this last year and closed with a very, very strong in Q4
with both segments growing orders over 15%. These are the segments that have seen the early stages of our
transformation meaning these segments are most successful at selling integrated architectures, solutions and outcomes.
Those of you who follow us closely and talk with our channels and our customers hear firsthand that our strategy is not
just gaining traction, but most importantly, getting results. The changes we've made over the three years have enabled
us to bring innovative products and solutions to market while at the same time growing non-GAAP earnings per share

to record levels and returning $25.2 billion to shareholders including $16.7 billion in share repurchase at an average
price of $20.58. Our innovation in this period has secured as the leadership position in cloud and hybrid cloud, made us
the recognized leader with our customers in SDN [Software-Defined Networks] and has driven new opportunities with
customers embracing the Internet of Everything.
But we're far from finished. As we head into fiscal year 2015 and beyond we will continue to lead our industry with
innovation. The results over the past three years represent significant forward progress and you should expect that we
will continue to take actions to transform Cisco in every possible aspect from how we're organized to how we develop
products to how customers buy from us. Looking specifically at FY 2015 we executed well in Q4 and expect our
revenues for Q1 of FY 2015 to range from flat to up 1%.
While we are pleased with our improved performance I would not extrapolate our improved performance into a more
aggressive assumption for what we're likely to do for the next several quarters. Our focus is on executing through our
transitions in the manner that appropriately sets us up the long-term. We are assuming that SP [Service Provider]
weakness continues for the next several quarters and are not expecting any material rebound in emerging market
conditions. I think the best way to characterize this next year is that I fully expect that will exit Q4 in a stronger
position than we are in today. As we see changes in that view, we will tell you how we see it, as we always do.
Consistent with our disciplined approach to growing resources in an important area while managing cost, when Frank
details guidance later in this call we will announce our plans to do a limited restructuring across several areas of our
business. These actions are focused on investing in growth, innovation, and talent while managing costs and driving
efficiencies. We expect to reinvest substantially all the cost savings from our restructuring actions in our key growth
areas such as data center, software, security, cloud and others.
While there are tremendous opportunities for our business and we are moving the resources to capitalize on them there
is also significant risk as we discussed. This is the technology industry and change is constant and accelerating. We
have navigated this industry successfully for almost three decades while nearly every competitor we faced 10 to 20
years ago has either exited our part of the market, stalled in terms of market share or has gone out of business. Our
vision is clear and our strategy is working and it has largely played out as we expected. In 2011, I said customers will
view the network as the most strategic asset not just in communications but in IT and this would enable us to become
the number one IT company. I am confident that we can make this aspiration a reality.
Now let me move on to business momentum. And specifically, in terms of our geographies and customer segments. As
a reminder, geographies are the primary way we run our business. In these areas, I will speak in terms of product orders
year-over-year unless otherwise noted. We finished the quarter with product orders up 1%, product book-to-bill
comfortably above 1, and a product backlog of $5.4 billion. Our business in Americas grew 2%, U.S. grew 5%, with
U.S. commercial and U.S. enterprise continuing their strong growth, up 17% and 16%, respectively. I think, Rob, those
are the highest numbers I can remember in many years, so just a nice job by Alison and Brian.
We are seeing the continued strength in large deals. As an example, looking at deals in our U.S. Enterprise pipeline, the
number of deals over $1 million increased by 22%, and deals in the pipeline over $5 million increased by over 70%. As
we continue to engage strategically with our customers on their business opportunities, our enterprise customers are
making more and bigger investments as they partner with us.
U.S. Public Sector, Pat Finn's group did a very good job. They grew over 6% in the quarter with state and local up 3%
and U.S. Federal up year-over-year 10% in terms of orders. U.S. Service Provider declined 9%. Latin America declined
6% with ongoing pressures in some of the largest emerging countries including a decline of 13% in our business in
Brazil.
EMEA grew 2% as we see continued relatively stabilization across Europe. In EMEA, Enterprise business grew 8%
and Commercial grew 7%. Leading the way, the U.K. grew at 6%, and within the U.K., Commercial was up 18% and
Enterprise was up 19%. Germany in this most recent quarter grew 16% and again within Germany we saw the same
characteristics. Commercial was up 13% and Enterprise was up 17%. In the U.K. and Germany, we've seen similar
success in these marketplaces as we begin to move to selling architectures then solutions then business outcomes. This

is the transformation we are working on to drive more broadly. Just to give you a sense of an emerging countries
impact on EMEA, as an example, and its growth, excluding Russia, which declined 30%, EMEA would've grown 4%
instead of 2%.
Asia-Pacific, Japan and China, was down 7% with China down 23% and India up 18%, while the remaining emerging
countries in Asia actually declined 34%. Those are countries that do not include China and India. Overall emerging
countries within the three geographies declined this quarter by 9%. We saw the impact of economic and geopolitical
challenges in China, Brazil, Russia, Argentina, Turkey and Thailand, and a number of emerging markets that many of
our other peers are seeing. These declines are reducing our growth by several points from what we've expected and
typically seen.
Though the trends were looking better in Q2 and Q3 for emerging markets, the emerging countries lost momentum in
Q4. The BRICM [Brazil, Russia, India, China and Mexico] continued in double-digit declines, and the next 15
emerging countries went from positive growth in mid-single digits in Q2 and Q3 to a 9% decline in Q4. Unfortunately,
as we look out, we don't see emerging markets' growth returning for several quarters and believe it possibly could get
worse. When we see these markets coming back, we will share that with you, as we always do.
Moving on to our customer segments, as we've been indicating earlier, we saw strength around the globe in our
Enterprise business, up over 9% and similar strength in Commercial, up over 8%. Public Sector on a global basis was
flat. The same challenges continue in the Service Provider market, which declined 11%. Within the Service Provider
market, the largest impacts came from continued decline in SP Video, with orders down 13%, and the ongoing decline
in emerging markets, where Service Provider is a higher mix of the business. Our Service Provider customers are
dealing with transitions in their own business and have been aggressively consolidating, with the transaction volumes
of these consolidations over the last 12 months, about as much as we've seen in the past four years combined.
Let me now move on to products. I'll discuss our product momentum in terms of year-over-year revenue, but will share
order information where it adds important color. Routing declined 7%. We saw continued strength in the ASR 9000
growing in double digits with strong penetration among the Web 2.0 customers, offset by softness in [ph] mob (13:16)
and optical and mobile business.
Our new product platforms, the NCS 6000 and the CRS-X, continued to ramp, with each of our products crossing $100
million in orders for the year, with approximately half of that coming in Q4. In these markets where a relatively small
number of customers do the majority of the volume, we added nine new customers for our NCS product line and 39
new customers for CRS-X during the last two quarters of the fiscal year.
Switching, overall switching declined 4%. Similar to the last quarter, our campus switching business declined,
specifically at the high-end, with the notable exception of the Catalyst 3850, continuing to grow very well at over 80%
growth.
In the data center, our momentum with the Nexus 9000 and application-centric infrastructure continues to be very
strong. Since the end of last quarter, the number of customers have tripled to over 580 customers. Last quarter, it was
over 180 customers. We continue to deliver on our application-centric infrastructure roadmap. And during the quarter,
we began shipping the Application Policy Infrastructure Controller, which we call APIC. This industry-first innovation
provides a central place to configure, automate and manage an entire network based upon the needs of applications. In
less than one month of availability, we have over 60 paying customers using the APIC with very positive feedback.
We continue to see the strong growth of the Nexus 9000 and our application-centric infrastructure portfolio with key
wins across all major verticals including cloud providers, hosting, financial services, and technology providers. We
believe we are leading this SDN transition, and you will hear the same from many of our customers. As we discussed,
we are continuing to manage the transition with the Nexus 7000 and Nexus 9000 and we are seeing some impact on our
numbers. As we said last quarter, we expect the negative impact to continue for a few more quarters.
Data Center, Data Center continued to be very strong. Growth of over 30% year-over-year demonstrates that customers
continue to embrace our architectural approach in this critical space. I am very proud of the success we've driven in the
Data Center market. In 2009, many questioned why Cisco was entering the traditional server market. UCS was far from

a traditional server. And while we've displaced many of our traditional competitors, we did it with an innovative
architectural approach to the market.
This quarter Cisco UCS grew 30%, with more than 36,500 UCS customers. And this quarter we grew our repeat
business by 49%. In a market many thought we would exit, we gained share for the 18th consecutive quarter to gain the
number one position in revenue share for the x86 blade servers in the U.S. with 41% market share, six points above our
nearest competitor. And currently we have the number two position worldwide, which I expect us to close to the
number one if we execute the way I believe we can, Rob.
Our UCS business now has a run rate of over $3 billion and we continue to lead the converged infrastructure market
with FlexPod with NetApp, and with Vblock with VCE. The innovation pipeline is very strong and you should expect
to see announcements in the fall that will continue to accelerate our momentum with UCS and add to our competitive
advantage.
Wireless. Wireless grew 1% with orders up 8%. While we experienced softness in the Service Provider segment, we
saw continued adoption of 802.11ac portfolio in both our Enterprise and cloud-managed network business. In this
business, Meraki had another amazing quarter with growth of 116% year-over-year and subscriptions growing
approximately 80%, accelerating our software and reoccurring revenue business.
Collaboration declined 4% as we transitioned our portfolio in this space. We saw declines in TelePresence and Unified
Communications as we introduced additional new products, including our cloud family of solutions, DX70 and DX80,
which are incredibly cool desktop collaboration endpoints at dramatically lower price points. Collaboration remains a
top priority for our customers wanting to drive employee productivity. We're confident our new portfolio will drive the
next phase of productivity that has yet to be delivered by collaboration to this market.
We did see continued strength in conferencing and an increased customer shift toward software-based models, with
enterprise licensing agreements, ELAs, for our Collaborative Solutions, up 42%.
SP Video revenues declined 10%. Video Software and Solutions grew, driven by deployments by satellite customers
and growth in the control plane business. But this was offset by a decline in video infrastructure due to lower CPE
business and consolidation among our major service providers. We have made key, top leadership changes in both of
these areas.
Security grew 29% driven by strength across our product portfolio with network security up 35% and content security
up 12%. Product orders grew faster than revenue as we continue to see solid momentum with our advanced threat
solutions including Advanced Malware Protection Everywhere, Sourcefire and ThreatGRID.
Additionally, we also saw improved growth from our core business including our high-end firewalls and ASA. A key
part of our software growth strategy, security ELAs grew by 250% year-over-year.
We are pleased to see revenue from our Sourcefire acquisition accelerate even faster than before they were acquired
which speaks to the power of our combined security architecture in the marketplace today. We have taken security
from a low single digit growing business to business that we expect to grow comfortably in double digits going
forward. Chris Young, that one's yours but I know you'll bring home for us. A little bit of pressure, Gary. Do you think
that's okay?

It's perfect.

Services revenue grew 5%, up from 3% last quarter and it is trending very well. Strong renewals, large multiyear
service wins, strong technical services performance and growth in new businesses such as consulting, cloud and
managed services and security services drove our growth in the quarter. We continue to deliver our strong gross
margins in this business, well above the industry norms. We are focused on the continued integration of our services
and product sales teams to accelerate our ability to drive integrated solutions and business outcomes. We are also
investing with more focus on our renewal engines. While these multiyear journeys, we see both efforts as creating more
opportunities over the long term.
There is strong interest in our Intercloud approach which we've asked Rob Lloyd to lead for the entire company.
Customers and partners view our approach to the cloud as differentiated and unique recognizing that we offer the only
solution to federated private, hybrid and public clouds that enable them to move their cloud workloads across
heterogeneous private and public clouds with the necessary policy, security and management.
Over the last quarter, we expanded our Intercloud ecosystem with partners who are embracing the Cisco ACI vision
and Cisco's open approach to differentiating their cloud offers through the value of the network. We announced that
NTT, Dimension Data and SunGard Availability Services will both use Cisco Intercloud architectures to deliver cloud
services to customers and resellers. You will see us announce additional partnerships soon.
In the quarter, we entered into a three-year go-to-market program with Microsoft to build Intercloud ready integrated
infrastructure solutions leveraging Cisco's UCS, Nexus switching and the Microsoft Cloud Operating System. We are
also growing a developer network to build applications on top of Intercloud and that work is gaining momentum.
We believe we can grow DevNet developer community to at least one million developers by 2020. We feel that our
focus on delivering enterprise class hybrid cloud solutions along with growing Intercloud ecosystem is resonating with
customers and our partners around the world.
Cloud is an example of an area where we were making significant investments to fuel our future growth. In FY 2014,
we allocated over 2,000 employees to our Intercloud organization including several of our top leaders. These
investments will drive our leadership and opportunity to the results – though the results will not show up in our
numbers in a meaningful way for a number of quarters.
I'd now like to turn the call over to you, Frank, for additional financial detail.
Frank A. Calderoni
Thank you, John.
John T. Chambers
You're welcome.
Frank A. Calderoni
I'll start with Q4 results and later discuss our full fiscal year results.
In Q4, we continue to manage through the transitions in our business and markets resulting in our financial
performance at or above our expectations. From a top and bottom line perspective total revenue was $12.4 billion, flat
on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP net income was $2.8 billion and non-GAAP EPS was $0.55 per share. Our
GAAP net income was $2.2 billion and GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis was $0.43 a share.
Product revenue declined 2% and service revenue increased 5% with product book-to-bill comfortably above one. We
ended the year with product backlog of approximately $5.4 billion as compared to approximately $4.9 billion at the end
of fiscal 2013. Overall, non-GAAP operating margin was 28%.

In Q4, our total non-GAAP gross margin was 61.8%. Non-GAAP product gross margin was 60.3%. As compared to
Q3, product gross margin was negatively impacted by pricing and product mix, partially offset by productivity.
Non-GAAP service gross margin was 66.8%, consistent with historical levels. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were
$4.2 billion or 33.8% as a percentage of revenue compared to 33.9% in Q4 of fiscal year 2013. Operating expenses
were up 5% quarter-over-quarter due to seasonality and down 1% year-over-year. We ended the year with our head
count at 74,042, an increase of approximately 200 from Q3.
For the full year, head count decreased by approximately 1,000 from a year ago, which is net of an addition of head
count from acquisitions during the year of approximately 1,300, 1,300. As we outlined in our head count actions last
year, we realigned and reinvested in talent to drive key priorities, such as cloud.
We continue to execute consistently with our portfolio approach to acquisition aligned to driving long-term return. We
announced and completed three acquisitions during the quarter. Tail-f, ThreatGRID and Assemblage, to bolster our
innovation and long-term growth opportunities in key growth areas such as software and security.
Looking at our geographic segment results, in terms of total revenue on a year-over-year basis, the performance was
relatively balanced across segments with the Americas and EMEA both down 1% while APJC was up 1%. Total gross
margin for the Americas was 62.3%. EMEA was 63.5% while APJC was 57.1%.
Moving on to our full year performance, our total revenue was $47.1 billion, a decrease of 3% from the prior year as
we worked through the challenges in emerging markets and service provider as well as several product transitions. We
were disciplined with our cost structure during the year as we addressed those areas. We held our non-GAAP net
income flat at $10.9 billion and grew our non-GAAP earnings per share on a fully diluted basis 2% to $2.06, delivering
profitability which was slightly above our expectations for the full year. GAAP net income was $7.9 billion, or $1.49
per-share on a fully diluted basis.
We generated strong operating cash flow of $12.3 billion, free cash flows of $11.1 billion, and returned a record $13.3
billion to shareholders through both the buyback as well as the dividends. This represented 120% of our free cash flow.
We are firmly committed to continuing our capital allocation strategy, returning a minimum of 50% of our free cash
flow to shareholders annually. Looking back on this past fiscal year, we effectively managed our portfolio and
investments which enabled us to invest in our key long-term growth areas, such as cloud, data center, software, and
security.
From a balance sheet and cash flow perspective of total cash, cash equivalents, and investments were $52.1 billion,
including $4.7 billion available in the U.S. at the end of this quarter. We generated operating cash flows of $3.6 billion
during the quarter and in Q4, we returned $2.5 billion to shareholders that included $1.5 billion through share
repurchases and approximately $974 million through our quarterly dividend. Our balance sheet continues to be an area
of strength, with DSO at 38 days and non-GAAP inventory turns at 12.1.
Deferred revenue was $14.1 billion, up 5% year-over-year. Product deferred revenue grew 12%, driven by
subscription-based offerings and deal related deferrals while services deferred revenue grew 3%. We continue to make
progress in driving a greater software mix and higher recurring revenues.
Let me now provide a few comments on our outlook for the first quarter. Let me remind you again that our comments
include forward-looking statements. You should review our recent SEC filings that identify important risk factors and
understand that actual results could materially differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements. And
actual results could be above or below our guidance. The guidance we are providing is on a non-GAAP basis with also
a reconciliation the GAAP.
As John mentioned earlier, we expect total revenue to be in the range of flat to up 1% on a year-over-year basis. For the
first quarter, we anticipate non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 61% to 62%.
As we have said in the past, forecasting non-GAAP gross margin has always been challenging due to various factors
such as volume, product mix, cost savings, as well as pricing. As a result, non-GAAP gross margin may vary
quarter-to-quarter by a point in either direction of our guidance range.

Our non-GAAP operating margin in Q1 is expected to be in the range of 27.5% to 28.5%. Our non-GAAP tax
provision rate is expected to be approximately 22% in the first quarter. This is up one point from the prior fiscal year,
largely driven by the expiration of the R&D tax credit. This represents approximately $0.01 of impact to EPS. If the
R&D tax credit is reinstated, we would reflect that benefit in our effective tax rate. Our Q1 FY 2015 non-GAAP
earnings per share are expected to range from $0.51 to $0.53 per share.
As John also discussed earlier, we will be taking a restructuring action in FY 2015 that will be focused on continuing to
invest in growth, innovation, and talent while managing costs and driving efficiencies. These actions will impact up to
6,000 employees, representing approximately 8% of our global workforce. We expect to take these actions starting in
Q1 FY 2015 and currently estimate that we will recognize pre-tax charges to our GAAP financial results of up to $700
million. We expect that approximately $250 million to $350 million of these charges will be recognized during the first
quarter of FY 2015 with the remaining amount recognized during the rest of the fiscal year.
We expect to reinvest substantially all of the cost savings from the restructuring actions in our key growth areas. We
anticipate our GAAP earnings to be lower than our non-GAAP EPS by $0.14 to $0.18 per share in Q1 FY 2015. Please
see the slides that accompany this webcast for further details.
Other than those quantified items noted previously, there are no other specific differences between our GAAP and our
non-GAAP guidance. This guidance assumes no additional acquisitions, asset impairments, restructurings, and tax or
other events which may or may not be significant.
We are executing well in a rapidly transforming market. As we've mentioned, we are not expecting a significant
improvement in the emerging markets or the service provider segment in the near future. With all of these types of
uncertainties in mind, we will continue to provide our guidance with all the appropriate caveats one quarter at a time.
We encourage our shareholders to have these same considerations.
As a reminder, Cisco will not comment on financial guidance during the quarter unless it is done through an explicit
public disclosure.
John, I will now turn it back over to you for some summary comments.
John T. Chambers
Thank you, Frank.
The dynamics in our business and market continue to play out as we said they would. Our management team is
executing well, driving innovation and discipline across the entire company to disrupt our industry and our sales when
necessary. I am pleased with our leadership position and the strong receptivity we are getting from customers as we
become the company that delivers architectures, solutions, and finally, business outcomes. We have transformed Cisco
over the past three years and remain as focused as ever on the future, moving to become the number one IT company
our customers turn to, to enable their innovation, drive their growth, cut their costs and mitigate their risks.
What does that mean for our investors? First, we remain focused on shareholder value creation by maintaining the
flexibility to make the right long-term strategic decisions for the business, driving efficiencies in our cost structure and
returning capital through dividends and share repurchase to our shareholders.
Second, investors need to remember that change is nothing new for Cisco. We embrace it. We see opportunities for
disruption all around us, and in nearly every case, Cisco is positioned extremely well. In this environment, companies
who use technology for speed and innovation will differentiate themselves. You see it in places never imagined and it
happens quickly. Things like a new business model, delivering through a network application that disrupts the [ph] taxi
(33:13) industry.
Every company is becoming a technology company, and the common element is the network at the center, driven by
applications, allowing for rapid introduction of new business models, disrupting old models in record time. We've

talked about this opportunity for a while, and now you're seeing it play out. Every company is increasingly dependent
on the network, not just for communications but for how they run, analyze and grow their business and disrupt their
competitors.
In this paradigm, the reliability, scale, speed, and application centricity of the network is even more important. And this
is where our unique strength lies. As the leader trusted by business and governments with 17,000 salespeople,
approximately 70,000 partners and an install base of approximately $200 billion, Cisco is very well positioned to
capture this opportunity. And I am more confident than ever that we're doing just that.
As always, we have to deliver the innovation, the new business models, and value to our customers to win in the market
and that requires continually reshaping how we operate. If we do not disrupt ourselves, if we don't have the courage to
change, if we don't lead the change, we will get left behind. Disruption is happening amongst our peers and throughout
our customer base. Management teams are being tested every day. The question is whether they will make the right
investments and take the bold action in order to move forward.
At Cisco, we are making these tough choices, transforming our company at rapid pace. Whether it is introducing
revolutionary new platforms in our core and at a speed where we knowingly disrupt ourselves, or making long-term
bets like we did with UCS and Internet of Everything and are now doing with Intercloud and ACI, Application Centric
Infrastructure. We are investing in our leadership for years to come. We understand that the results of our strategy and
many of the decisions we make may not be evident in a single quarter. And, in fact, at times will create volatility to our
results from time to time. We also know that some of the investments we are making today will take several years to
pay off.
Taking a multiyear view, I am confident that when we look back in time, this transformative period will be a
distinguished part of Cisco's history; where we made bold choices, moved aggressively, and ensured our long-term
strategic value for our customers, shareholders, partners and employees.

Okay. Thanks, John. We'll now open the floor to Q&A. We still request that sell side analysts please ask only one
question.
Operator, please open the floor to questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. And our first question comes from by Brian Modoff with Deutsche Bank.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Hey, Brian.
<Q - Brian Modoff>: Hi, John. So let's talk a little bit about switching. It's 30% of your revenues. You're talking about
this transition to the Nexus 9000 and then you've also got the Catalyst 3850 and, from what we understand, you're
bringing forward the 802.11ac wave to APs [Access Points] later this year. That, because of the change in voltage
requirements and higher data rates, may create an uptick or a desire to upgrade switches on the campus side in the back
half of the year. Can you talk about how you see the switching market doing in fiscal 2015? Can we see transition? Do
you see growth in the market? Do you see a better 2015 in that area than perhaps 2014? Thanks.
<A - John T. Chambers>: The answer is absolutely yes. If you watch, we disrupted ourselves at the high-end segment
of the switching market. The way I look at it and what we said last quarter: that will take several quarters more to work
out and in today's market, the Nexus 7000 was down in the mid to high teens and the Nexus 9000, obviously, was

growing very, very well overall.
So I consider those two products together and our entire Nexus line. You'll begin to see us switch over in Q2 and Q3 in
terms of this transition, and with all the appropriate caveats, I feel good about growth, late Q3 and Q4 with good market
leadership. So I do see our high-end switching and switching as a whole growing. We are positioned extremely well.
And if I can, just a note on our competitors, our competitors are coming at us with box solutions. And we're going to
approach them with an architectural play that includes software and hardware and that wins. We've been in 580
accounts, as I said earlier, and we've also taken back a number of one of the startup's key flagship accounts again and
again in multiple areas. So I think we're positioned well and, yes, it is a great market. And the transition is more 10-gig
to 40-gig that I think will help drive this, volumes as well.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great. Thanks, Brian. Next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Simona K. Jankowski>: Hi. Thank you. I wanted to put your guidance in context a little bit. So you're guiding
for 0% to 1%. First of all, that's a bit narrower than it has been in the past few quarters. So I just wanted to understand
if there is better visibility, or what's driving that? And then secondly, it's a lot lower than your product deferred has
actually grown. I think you indicated something like 12% as a result of the transitions of software. So can you just
expand on that a little bit? It seems like that's something that's taking place at a relatively rapid pace.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Okay. The visibility is improved in most of the areas, the two wild cards we talked about.
As you come off of a very solid book-to-bill in Q4, which is normal and we did a high end of normal book-to-bill, and
as you said, we exited with $5.4 billion in backlog. I think last year was $4.9 billion. So the visibility for Q1 is pretty
solid, and I like how we're positioned on that. We want to also realize we still have some headwinds we've got to get
through. So I think we're just being our normal conservative self, Simona. I'm not signaling any unusual lack of
confidence on it. I like our hand a lot, and we actually did something several of you suggested, we put our negatives at
the front of the call, and the positives afterward so we don't get you excited on the front end and then say here are a
couple of challenges.
But I think we're positioned extremely strong. Our switching play, as I said to Brian, is very solid. We've transitioned
the high end routing well. The outcomes are selling. If you look purely at commercial and enterprise, these are the best
numbers we've seen worldwide in a very long time, even when the economies are struggling. So I think we're doing
very well in a tough market and I feel very good about our future here and very good about a Q1 in the tight range that
we did give you.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: You want to touch on the deferred?
<A - John T. Chambers>: I did a little bit. Oh, the deferred revenue, do you want to comment on, Frank?
<A - Frank A. Calderoni>: No, just pretty much what I said in the script. The deferred revenue is up 12%. Primarily
that's product deferred revenue, mostly driven by product subscriptions, so that shows that the WebEx products like the
Meraki as well as the collaboration enterprise license agreements are really showing some traction and they provide us
with a stream of revenue going forward. The recurring revenue increased as well, as far as going into the year, so all
good signs from that perspective. But again, we have to put it in the context of, John, what you just said as far as some
the other factors that we're considering.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Yeah, if you watch, we are making that transition. And Gary, you've seen it from the
General Motors of the world to others, we're starting to accelerate with the enterprise license agreements and, just using
security an example, the security orders were dramatically higher than the revenues. And so you begin to see both us
filling up our recurring revenues as well as the deferred revenue. Thank you, Simona.

<A - Melissa Selcher>: Thanks, Simona. Operator, next question, please?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Sue with RBC Capital Markets.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Hey, Mark.
<Q - Mark Sue>: Hey, John. How are you? I just want to have a larger discussion, John, on just your stock price and
the stock multiple. And when we talk to investors, the worry is that despite the consistent free cash flow, we might see
a drop-off in the future cash flow and then you will not be able to the grow your dividends. Is there is a way we can
convince investors that Cisco can consistently generate $12 billion to $13 billion of free cash flow each and every year
and continue to grow their dividend? And subsequently, should M&A be more about cash flow contributions so
investors can worry less about that?
And could you also may be, Frank, if you want to chime in, explain why the weaknesses in emerging markets and
service provider orders does not really impact annual free cash flows?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Okay, so do you want to give me one or two questions? Let me address the cash flow
question a little bit and then a comment on tax policy. And, Frank, keep me honest on this one. I feel very good about
our cash flow. We are committed to the dividend and the share repurchase. We see no indication of ever changing our
direction to you of a minimum of 50% free cash flow return to our shareholders. And as Frank said, that was 120% this
last year. We obviously were pleased with the share repurchase. When we started down the dividend path, we knew
that there would be periodic raises expected and we have full intention of at the right times raising the dividends as we
move forward, so not changing that at all.
Frank, any additional comments?
<A - Frank A. Calderoni>: No, again, we've been down this path the last couple of years thanks to a lot of feedback
from the investors in support of both the dividend and the buyback. Clearly, we've had a very active year in both. We
continue to support the dividend over the longer period of time, and I think as you said, John, we're generating the cash.
We are very pleased about the ability to generate that cash. Our cash flow has been fairly consistent even throughout
this past year and the assumption going into the next year is about the same.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Okay.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great. Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question?
Operator
One moment, please. Your next question comes from Amitabh Passi with UBS Securities. Your line is open.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Hey, Amitabh.
<Q - Amitabh Passi>: Hi, John. Thank you, and thank you for the question. Excuse me, I'm losing my voice here.
John, I understand and realize that workforce restructuring decisions are always tough decisions to make. I just wanted
to better understand the context of why now? And if you can give us any – shed any light in terms of the areas where
you might be de-emphasizing? And should we think of the 6,000 employees as a net reduction or is it simply a
reallocation of resources into some of the other areas?
<A - John T. Chambers>: In reverse order, reallocation of resources is the way you should address it. It is an
investment in our growth areas that we felt strongly we needed to do quickly.
In terms of right now, it's the uncertainties in the market, you are seeing a few headwinds and a lot of tailwinds. The
pace of change is accelerating and we felt we had to move with tremendous speed on it. We are going to be putting

these investments into our growth areas such as cloud, such as software, such as security, and these are often skill sets
that you have in one element of engineering that have to move to another. Pankaj has been planning that, Rob, I think
for almost 10 or 11 months in terms of how to do this smoothly, focus more on the customers, and then you have the
same issue in your markets.
Some of our markets are slowing down and unfortunately, you can't move sales reps from one country to another with
different language characteristics. And Gary in services, it's hard to move a person who feel good about installing
networks to business outcomes on the manufacturing shop floor where with deep security experience.
So the why now is if we're going to become the number one IT player, which we are going to do, our ability to move
requires decisiveness and it requires investing in this growth and it really keeps this innovation engine and while this
last year was our best innovation engine ever, new high-end routing, new high-end switching, new security moves, new
collaboration moves, aggressive moves on wireless, Internet of Everything took shape, architectures moved into
solutions, we think we have to move even more rapidly and get these groups coordinated so we focus the whole
company horizontally on getting business outcomes.
And so you're right, it is the most difficult decision we make as an operating committee but it's one the market waits for
no one and we're going to lead this market and we're going to be decisive in it.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Thanks, Amitabh. Operator, next question?
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.
<Q - James E. Faucette>: Thanks very much. I just wanted to touch base quickly on the emerging markets. You
suggested that they had slowed down in the most recent months, et cetera, and weren't willing to talk about when you
might see a recovery. Can you talk a little bit about what you think contributed to that slowdown and clarify when you
talk about not wanting to talk about a recovery, are you talking about when you – like you don't want to speculate as to
when they'll stop declining or should we expect a baseline but you don't want to expect to talk about when they would
expect to return to growth?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Thank you. Sure. If I could predict when the emerging markets were up or down, I would
love to do that for us all. We tend to be a very early indicator and just kind of taking a step back to a year ago or 15
months ago, we saw the emerging markets, the BRIC slowdown first and then one quarter later, the rest of the
emerging markets slowed down. They felt like they were turning around in Q2 and Q3, and our numbers instead of
being in double-digit declines were in the mid-single digits. We saw this last quarter, the BRICs plus Mexico stayed at
about 12% but it was the next 15 countries that in total balanced out.
Now these can turn up or down rapidly, and so what we did today was to share with you that they had declined more
than we anticipated and that we weren't sure when you'd see a turnaround in Russia and the Ukraine and Middle East
opportunities and challenges in China, Thailand, obviously, key issues we're all familiar with, an election in Indonesia.
There are some bright spots for the first time in a while. I think Modi in India is going to turn around that country. You
can see the enthusiasm, both the citizens and the businesses there. If I were betting on a single emerging market I'd bet
on India right now in a big way.
And if you watch, we've navigated through challenges regardless of whether they're in China or Russia pretty smoothly,
and so you'll see us continue to stay focused on emerging markets but we just wanted to level set you that we saw this
problem at the present time, and we're not sure that we continue to decline or not, but again, they can turn very rapidly
possibly. So we just wanted to give you the exposure on that.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Great. Thanks. Next question?

Thank you. Our next question comes from Jess Lubert with Wells Fargo Securities.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Hey, Jess.
<Q - Jess I. Lubert>: Hi, John. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you could provide some additional details
in the U.S. federal vertical, orders picked up there so I was hoping to understand if you're seeing signs of a fiscal
year-end flush, how you're thinking about the federal market moving forward. And then if you could also touch on the
wireless business, how fast the non-carrier segment is growing, what the impact of Meraki is on overall growth? And
perhaps comment on the competitive environment as it seems like some of your competitors are growing a little faster
there. Thanks.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Okay. So I think our federal team and our state and local team have done very, very well.
Pat Finn has done an amazing job and, Pat, if you're listening, congratulations. I do not think it was a one quarter
phenomenon. Too early to call and Mel will probably kick me if I get into too much detail. But I feel good about how
we're positioned both in federal and state and local as we go into this next year and I feel very good about obviously
U.S. Enterprise and Commercial, and they'll normally be in the 8% to 12% range.
I think this last quarter they just did an amazing job on big deals and they had a lot of financial incentives working for
them at the end of the year. But I feel good about the U.S. economy. We got to do better in service provider and that's
why you saw us change everything: change our engineering organization, change our global go-to sales marketplace,
took one of our stars, Rob, out of your and Chuck's sales team and Nick Adamo, he's leading that globally. You'll see
Pankaj literally within the engineering team; had Kelley Ahuja lead service provider across the whole team, so we're
now organized around our customers as opposed to selling them routers and switches and wireless and direction on it.
So I think you will see us move well on commercial and enterprise globally as long as the economies continue to do
okay. I think we need to do better in service provider. As I said, that's a couple of quarter phenomenon if we execute
right and then it's what does the service provider spend? So we have a little bit of headwinds there. But if you were to
say how do I feel going into Q3, Q4 of next year I think if we execute well you'll see us in better shape on the service
providers and then it's more a matter of the CapEx spend as you go forward. And you had one other question, Jess,
which I'm excited to answer but I can't remember what it is.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Meraki growth.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Oh. Meraki growth has been outstanding. I think there's an example of taking an
architecture and a play, combining it with collaboration and just literally expanding it in security and expanding it
across our whole base and blowing it through our channels. I don't know, Rob, if you'd add anything else to that? I
haven't done the math on the question you asked within that, come to think of it, but I'll see if by next call we can think
about how to answer that. Oh, we're good. Okay. Next question. Thank you, Jess.

made on some price pressures and mix? How those are impacting especially as core products including switching and
routing start to rebound. Should we expect an improvement from a gross margin perspective?
<A - John T. Chambers>: I'm looking to see whether Frank wants to do it or I want to do it. We're seeing no abnormal
gross margin pressures. We compete aggressively in the market but we hold our gross margins pretty well. It's normally
more of a mix issue.

In terms of the switching I like our switching gross margins and I think contrary to some of the comments that are
being made out in the markets, you're going to see our new switching product gross margins be extremely good and
that's the advantage of selling architectures that lower your customers' operating expense and gives them solutions as
opposed to selling boxes which I think time has come and box competitors are going to face white labels guys that are
tremendous pressure. Something we called out 3.5 years ago and moved to overall.
You still have the mix going on. I love how fast our UCS is growing and when you're in a $3 billion market growing at
30% or 30% plus I think bookings are even a little bit above that you will see pressure from that side. But to your point
as we move into software and as we move into high-end switching coming back growth wise, that balances it.
So no, I would not model an increase. There'll be pressure on gross margins. Gary, you and Frank are owning that
across the company for us. Just, Gary, you might spend a moment because I know it's important to the audience talking
about how we're going after this in every aspect of our business even more aggressively than last year.
<A - Gary B. Moore>: Yeah, I think this last year we had tremendous performance out of the teams and I think we
focused the entire company on gross margins. It's not just the engineering team or supply chain. It's the entire company.
A lot of the work – some of the systems we put in place to help the sales force have better visibility, better control on a
deal by deal basis to see what discounting we're doing as well as the pricing in the market, understanding our
competitors better in that landscape while continuing to do the value design, value engineering work and the continued
investments that Frank and I have funded off the top, if you will, to allow that work to continue.
So we're very comfortable with what has happened and our ability to manage this going forward. We've asked the
teams to step up even more significantly as we go into next year and we're going to give them a lot of help to do that.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Now Mel's probably going to lecture me after I make this next comment. For those of you
out there who think SDN is going to drive down our gross margins, in my opinion, you're just wrong. You're going to
see us embrace SDN, you're going to see us implement it for the value it has. We not only will lead with this
implementation it will allow us to get higher gross margins on our switching and architecture. And we'll do it off of an
open standard and end results. And different than our peers, when we talk about 60 paying customers, we mean 60
paying customers, not taking an enterprise license and spreading it thin across the group.
So we're going to take it to our competitors big and small. Doesn't matter if you're a major server player, we're going to
gain share on you. It doesn't matter if you're new start up and one of the nice things about Cisco is our barriers to entry
are very low. They're very open. So we love taking on the competitors big or small and I feel very, very good about
how we're positioned there. And Rob, unless you're seeing something different than I am, I see SDN actually being
something we'll embrace and get the benefits out of. And I see almost no gross margin negative implications from it.
<A - Robert W. Lloyd>: Yeah, John, we clearly are the only company out there talking about connecting applications
to the infrastructure. And we're the only company talking about the applications not only in the context of the data
center network, but the entire network, including at the wide area and at the access layer. So we've got more work to
do. We're seeing customers every day. Our partners are embracing this. Cloud providers are embracing this.
So when we talk about one of our competitors being a great underlay to another company's overlay, it kind of feels like
being the foam pad between the hardwood floors and the carpet. And we are not going to leave that alone. We're going
continue to drive the integration we have. And we're going to compete very hard.

<Q - Benjamin Reitzes>: Hi. Yeah, thanks a lot. I appreciate it. A lot of good questions asked about margins and
emerging markets. So I wanted to ask about carriers. There's a lot of debate about what the spending patterns are and
what consolidation is doing to the marketplace and what are you seeing and what's embedded in your guidance for
carrier? I know you said you're assuming Service Provider doesn't get better, but what do you think is going on, and
how does it get better? What is your thinking as we go throughout the year? Thanks a lot.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Sure. Service Provider, just to give you context, if you look in today's market, Service
Provider, Enterprise and Commercial are all about 25% to 27% of our business. And so it gives you an idea of kind of
the things that drive it, and Public Sector is down about 20%.
In terms of where we see Service Provider overall, there are some headwinds there. And so let me talk first about what
we're doing differently. We have focused our company on becoming entirely solutions and outcome-based selling
including our consultancy. We're moving to where we used to sell to the Service Providers, we'd go say: what your
business objectives? And then we sell them a router or a switch. We're now saying how do we sell you solutions? How
we help you go to market? How do we lower your operating expense? That's a transformation in the field. Some of our
fields are well on the way to doing that, Rob, other areas have a ways to go.
We also have completely changed engineering, to while we look horizontally across engineering, on how we go to
market. The Service Provider customers love the approach. It makes all the sense in the world to them. Only comment
I've got, Gary, was why didn't you do it earlier? And so you will see us as we get our arms around this, make a pretty
good transformation. And now, Mel, I'm defining an A job in the next year to two, just like we did on enterprise.
Because two and a half, three years ago, we were just in great shape on Service Provider and, candidly, we were
starting to lose our lead on Enterprise. And what you've watched over the last two years, we went with architectures.
We combined the Data Center with cloud with security with mobility. We talked about operating cost savings. We
talked about outcome-based savings. Our number of big deals have increased dramatically and we're selling to the
business unit more than we are the CIO now, when we do our job right, with the CIO's support in terms of direction.
In terms of a SP services gain, you're beginning to see a global delivery of that type of capability. And Gary, that's
where you've got heads aren't really hitting all cylinders on our consultancy. And you haven't asked the question, but
we feel good that Service is at the 5% level. So you can feel that starting to gain momentum again and we're finally
looking at a global delivery as opposed to, candidly, being organized by geography, which is not how our customers
want us to be organized.
There absolutely is, when you have two major combinations, Time Warner and Comcast just being one of them, and
when you have more combinations, dollar volume-wise, in the last 12 months than you had in four years – there are a
lot of these going on – those tend to have temporary slowing effects, not shutting off, but slowing effects until they get
their decisions together on how the networks come together, where they make investments and then over a longer-term
period, if we do our job right, there are actually increased opportunities for us in that market.
And then they're struggling with their own business models. They're having fits making money, which means there's
squeezing the vendors as hard as they can. Having said that, that's why you move to an architectural sale and
value-added sale as opposed to stand-alone boxes, which I do think will be ugly.
So that's why I think if you look out, probably going be tough for a little while. I'd like to see us make steady progress.
I'd like to see us exit this next year in a lot stronger position than we are today and do an instant replay of what we did
in the Enterprise and Commercial market.

<A - John T. Chambers>: Sure, Kulbinder.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: My question is – hello, can you hear me?
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Yep. Yes, we can hear you.
<Q - Kulbinder S. Garcha>: Oh, yeah. Great. Sorry. Yeah, so my question is maybe for John, how you actually see
the year playing out from a revenue perspective? It sounded at the beginning the call like you said don't extrapolate the
near-term revenue visibility and strength you have. On the other hand, you're very excited about some of your new
products. And I thought we were going to see a – you're coming up against a period of easier compares, so I'm just
trying to think, as we go through this year, is this the year that Cisco will return to growth, do you think, meaningfully
at some point? How do you see that playing out?
And then the other question I have is that with the Nexus 9000 being out for a while and the APIC control now being
out, why doesn't the share and the value that you are saying that that can drive through your business, and does sound
meaningful at some point; isn't that a very positive driver six months out? Or am I thinking about the timing of this
transition to be much longer? Thanks.
<A - John T. Chambers>: Okay. So if I gave yearly guidance, Frank would trade me in. And we knew we'd get asked
a number of different ways on that. I feel good about where we are. You should read into my comments today, very,
very positive on what we can control. And even on issues we don't control as well, I see us exiting the year in a
stronger position and potentially a fair amount stronger than we are today.
Therefore, let me answer your question about the Nexus 9000 and ACI. It's on fire, guys. The key is, once you get it
into account, they're going to put the pilots in. You've got to get the controller in place. You've got to then begin to
scale. I've been through this with the team just this last week. We looked at the crossover points based upon forecasts
for when the Nexus 7000 and the Nexus 9000 get to a growth that Rob and I will do backflips over. And you could
argue which quarter that will occur in the year but somewhere in the middle to toward the end of the year that will
occur if we do our job right.
And the acceptance from customers is really good. I have not missed on a call on that, when we outline our architecture
and our whole approach to the market and where we're going on it. So it's really going very well. I have almost no
criticism. If I look at the number of customers and the growth quarter-to-quarter, we're growing dramatically faster than
start-up is growing. In five years we're at a run rate and in one year and it gets very exciting in this next fiscal year.
So I would challenge a little bit the data about where we are. It is going extremely well and, candidly, I expect very big
things from it this next year. Going from 180 customers to 580 in a quarter is off the charts in terms of direction. But
then you've got to scale. You've got to get ACI and the controller working in volume and ACI implemented across it.
So I look for that, those type of crossovers in Q2, Q3 to be meaningful.
Rob, what else would you add?
<A - Robert W. Lloyd>: I'd just add, John, that in some of our conversations with cloud providers who are really
focused not on chasing the commodity cloud business but are focused on enterprise workloads, they love the APIC
controller. They love the scale. They love the integration we can deliver. They love the automation. So we're seeing
that as a key building block of our Intercloud conversations, and when we build that APIC controller into so many
public clouds, we're really going the nail the hybrid cloud marketplace, which is where we see all the growth and it'll
augment the growth we're seeing right now with our UCS.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Thanks, Kulbinder. Operator, next question?

Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Silverstein with Cowen & Co.

<Q - Paul J. Silverstein>: Thanks. John, two clarifications if I might. One, I think you touched on it earlier on
services. This was the first quarter in the past seven or eight where there was a turn up in the growth rate. The obvious
question being is that a one off or should we start to see that either stabilize or improve from here with a meaningful
improvement over the past trend?
And then the clarification: on your Wireless LAN business, if we ex'ed out the small cell business and we just focused
on the Wi-Fi piece, what would the growth rate look like?
<A - John T. Chambers>: Got you. I'm going to verify numbers on it. The first part of the question was on services. I
feel – I nominate Gary to brag about it. Go ahead, Gary.
<A - Gary B. Moore>: Thanks, John. So, look, I mean, services revenue did grow 5%, up from 3% growth last quarter.
I think the trend is it's trending well. I think we had in Q4 very strong renewals. We had some very large multi-year
service wins. We had very strong technical support services as well as advanced services in the quarter, and I think
some of that growth is coming from our new businesses that we've been investing in: consulting, cloud, managed
services, as well as our security services offering, not only security services and consulting, but the new Managed
Threat Defense service that we've launched. And I think all of those things contributed to growth in the quarter, and as
John pointed out during the call, we're very confident in where we're at with services. We have not only a great team,
we have a great installed base, and we're doing things to continue to optimize that and bring value to our customers.
<A - John T. Chambers>: And I don't have the individual Wireless LAN data in front of me. I'm not dodging the
question, but by definition, Meraki was strong; that was a little bit weaker than what we would liked to have seen
overall on it, Paul. And I think you'll see us address that appropriately in terms of getting back on track on the Wireless
LAN capability.
Next question, please?
<A - Melissa Selcher>: Thanks, Paul.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question coming from Jeff Kvaal with Northland.
<Q - Jeffrey Thomas Kvaal>: Yes. Thank you all very much. I was hoping to get a little bit more color into the
trajectory that the recurring revenue is on. Could you tell us a little bit about how much of a percentage of sales that is
growing and how quickly that's growing year-over-year? And then also to what extent that costs you on your topline
growth? Thank you.
<A - Frank A. Calderoni>: So the recurring revenue is about slightly under about $2 billion if you look at it from that
perspective. It's been growing, I would say, in the range of about $100 million per quarter, and as far as I mentioned
before, it's a combination of looking at WebEx, some of the security products that we have that's recurring,
collaboration, enterprise license agreement and it's also the Meraki. There's a portion of the Meraki was part of the
recurring, so that's been added to it since we've done the acquisition. So it's a big piece of the product descriptions in all
these categories that's adding to it and that gets, as I said, recurring revenue over a period of time.
<A - John T. Chambers>: So if you look at it, we're going to move faster and faster in this area. We understand fully
that when you do recurring revenue, deferred revenue, pay-as-you-go services, subscription as opposed to one-time
fees, you have all the expenses up front, and you don't get the payback on that. And that is probably one of the reasons,
six or seven reasons why we're moving our expenses so aggressively on the limited restructuring. If we didn't free up
resources and move them over, 2,000 people went into Intercloud and clearly it will be a number of quarters before we
start to get to payback there. On these recurring revenues or many of the deals we've done on enterprise licenses and,
Gary, you don't get your revenue upfront before you do much better over two, three, and four years but we get all the
expenses up front.

So that's why we felt we had to move, one of the reasons we had to move aggressively to position ourselves for the
future, and you're going to see us move aggressively. The market doesn't wait for anyone. We're going to lead it,
period. And the ability to do that requires making some very, very tough decisions but it will be about growth for us,
innovation and at the same time focus on our own talent. And we will manage our costs very aggressively and drive
efficiencies which really if you think about engineering, that's what Pankaj is doing, probably, Gary, more than
anything else is driving efficiencies across than freeing up the resource for the new areas.
So, Mel, I think that's a pretty good one to end on but it's your call, if you want to do anything else.
<A - Melissa Selcher>: No. I think we want to – I think we can end there if you want to...
John T. Chambers
Yeah, I think if you were to take a step back, we executed very well in a tough market. I feel stronger now than I did a
quarter ago about where we are today. You're going to see us lean in and drive on transformation. Any time you do
restructuring that hard on the leadership team, I don't want to mislead you, but we will always make the decision what's
right for our shareholders, our employees, our customers in the long run and partners. The results look very good. I like
what I see in front of us. I think the challenges are largely ones that are more external. They're hitting us with
headwinds. That doesn't mean we shouldn't do better in certain areas and I feel very strong going into fiscal year 2015
in terms of where we're positioned.
Melissa Selcher
Great. Thanks, John.
