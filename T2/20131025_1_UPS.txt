Andy Dolny
Good morning, and welcome to UPS' third quarter earnings call. Joining me today are Scott Davis, our CEO; and Kurt
Kuehn, our CFO; along with Chief Operating Officer, David Abney; International President, Jim Barber; President of
U.S. Operations, Myron Gray; and UPS Chief Sales and Marketing Officer, Alan Gershenhorn.
Before we begin, I want to review the Safe Harbor language. Some of the comments we'll make today are
forward-looking statements that address our expectations for the future performance or results of operations of the
company. These anticipated results are subject to risk and uncertainties, which are described in detail in our 2012 Form
10-K and 2013 10-Q reports. These reports are available on the UPS Investor Relations website and from the Securities
and Exchange Commission.
In our remarks today, all quarterly and full-year comments and comparisons to 2012 will refer to adjusted results. In
addition, we will discuss UPS' free cash flow, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The webcast of today's call
along with the reconciliation of free cash flow and adjusted results, are available on the UPS Investor Relations
website. Finally, our goal is to allow as many as possible to participate on today's call. So, please ask only one
question, and then get back in the queue. Thanks for your cooperation.
Now, let me turn it over to Scott.
D. Scott Davis
Thanks and good morning. Our third quarter results improved from the first half of the year, even though our business
faced similar market dynamics. Customers continue to streamline their supply chains, allowing UPS to meet their needs
with our integrated solutions and logistics expertise. The U.S. Domestic business continues to benefit from
e-commerce, while international experienced strong demand for UPS deferred products. Performance in our Supply
Chain & Freight segment improved, primarily from ocean forwarding, brokerage and North American air freight
results. Regarding the global economic environment, forecast for growth in EU have been revised upward as it begins
to recover from recession.
However, Asian economic projections are mixed, as expansion in Japan has been offset somewhat by slowing China
growth. Here in the U.S., uncertainty created by the partial shutdown of the U.S. government has created some anxiety.
While the impact to UPS on the surface appears to be minimal, some experts predict the shutdown will be a drag on
fourth quarter GDP. Though the shutdown is behind us, temporary solutions like sequestration and government
furloughs only delay the inevitable. Hitting the snooze button on our fiscal problems only extends uncertainty and
dampens economic growth. No business could survive without carefully managing its resources and our country can't
either. Now is the time for the government to fix the debt and put America's house in order.
Although our political leaders struggled to effectively implement economic policy, companies worldwide are
successfully adapting to evolving market conditions and evaluating all options to improve their bottom lines. And UPS
can help with our comprehensive portfolio of capabilities. We're built to meet the needs of business, whether it's via
ground, air or ocean. An integral part of developing these solutions is listening to our customers. For example, when
Latin American executives told us they expected strong growth in the region, we took action.
During the quarter, UPS launched the industry's first guaranteed standard service from the U.S. to Mexico. By
leveraging our extensive network and brokerage expertise, UPS now provides a seamless delivery experience for
southbound shipments. The company also expanded our preferred LCL Ocean product to serve the Asian and Mexico
lane. In addition, UPS has opened new express service centers to serve the fast-growing region of Northern Mexico.
Continuing our commitment to invest across the portfolio and around the world, we opened distribution facilities in
Chengdu and Shanghai, China, further expanding our capabilities.
Now I want to take a moment to update you on our labor negotiations. As we announced back in the summer, our
employees approved the National Master, which covers the key elements to contract, wages, pension and healthcare.

Work continues on the open supplements. In the last month, progress has been made, with majority receiving approval.
This includes the largest area, the central region, and other large areas like New York. The remaining supplements will
go out soon, and we are confident in their approval. UPS will continue to work to expedite ratification, so our
employees can start receiving improved wages and benefits in the new contract. Until then, the current agreements
remain in place.
Now let me turn it over to Kurt to provide more insight into UPS' third quarter results.
Kurt P. Kuehn
Well, thanks, and good morning, everyone. As Scott noted, while supply chains are becoming more and more efficient,
they are increasing in their complexity. UPS' third quarter results reflect the company's ability to adapt to the shifting
demands of our customers around the world. Earnings per share improved 9.4% on revenue growth of 3.4%. These are
solid results, considering market trends and the global economic environment.
Now let's review the segment results. U.S. Domestic had a good quarter. Operating profit climbed 16% and margin
expanded 140 basis points to 14.4%. Volume growth improved efficiency, including savings from UPS safety
initiatives, and one additional operating day contributed to the success. In addition, while the fuel surcharge lag was a
slight drag for the quarter, on a year-over-year basis it was a benefit.
Revenue was up 5% on a daily package volume increase of 2.3%, as e-commerce continues to thrive. B2C shipments
were up 5% during the quarter, and we saw an increase in B2B volumes also, mainly from retail shippers. Looking at
the product level, daily Ground volume was up 3% and deferred Air improved 2.3. Next Day Air volume declined
3.3%, reflecting losses of letter volume.
Further contributing to slower Air growth, some shippers have moved their distribution facilities closer to their
customers, enabling the greater use of UPS Ground to obtain shorter time in transit. Revenue per piece increased 1%,
reflecting base rate increases that were offset by lower fuel surcharges, lighter average weight and changes in product
and customer mix.
UPS Next Day Air yield was 3% higher, while Ground was up 1.9%. Deferred yield declined 2%, primarily due to
significantly lower average weight. We were able to create operating leverage and lowered our cost per piece by
effectively managing the UPS network. Our typical cost metrics of miles driven, direct labor hours and block hours, all
contributed to productivity.
Now for some details on the International results. Total segment revenue increased 2.5% on strong volume growth of
6.5%. Operating profit declined 7% to $417 million. Operating margin and profit were lower as savings from network
adjustments and cost initiatives were offset by $75 million in headwinds from currency and fuel. Without these two
items, operating profit would have been up approximately 10%.
In addition, the segment continued to be impacted by shifting customer preference for deferred products. Currency
neutral yields dropped 4.3%, driven primarily by a 5% decline in export product yields. Shippers continued to use
non-premium UPS products like Worldwide Expedited and Transporter Standard, both of which increased 11%. In
addition, our premium products were up 1%.
Growth in shorter trade lanes and lower fuel surcharges also contributed to yield declines. UPS daily export volume
increased by 6.7% in the quarter, driven by faster growth from Europe, Canada and Mexico. Intra-Europe volume was
up more than 10%, while Asian exports were flat with last year. Non-U.S. Domestic products climbed 6.3% per day,
led by strong gains across Europe and Canada. The developing economies of Turkey and Poland were both up
approximately 20%.
So, we saw good growth in the quarter, but overall, our results were a little by the less than we expected. Rest assured,
UPS is building on our in-country cost initiatives and will make the necessary network adjustments to ensure that we
continue to generate the industry's highest margins.

Now, regarding Supply Chain & Freight, the segment demonstrated improvement this quarter, with operating profit up
almost 7% on flat revenue growth. Top-line gains at UPS Freight were offset by declines in forwarding. Operating
margins expanded 60 basis points to 8.9%, matching our previous high for the segment. The weak demand in the Asia
forwarding market continues to put pressure on rates. International forwarding revenue declined due to lower tonnage
and revenue per kilo, both down about 3% to 4%. But solid performance from our ocean, our brokerage and our North
American air freight sectors enabled the business unit to expand operating profit and margin in the quarter. And in
addition, our international air freight made good progress in adapting to these market conditions.
In distribution, operating profit improved and generated a margin of approximately 9%, though revenue growth was
relatively flat to last year. Revenue gains in the healthcare and mail services were offset by some declines in the
high-tech sector. And remember during 2012, the unit did benefit from UPS' participation in the London Olympic
Games.
Turning now to UPS Freight, LTL revenue increased 5.5%, driven by shipment growth of about 4% and improvements
in revenue per hundredweight. Operating margin for the business contracted slightly as wage and benefit increases
were not fully offset by productivity improvements.
Now let's review our financial strength. For the nine months ended September 30, UPS generated $3.6 billion in free
cash flow after capital expenditures of $1.6 billion. So far this year, UPS has paid $1.7 billion in dividends, an increase
of almost 9% per share. In addition, we've repurchased 33 million shares for approximately $2.9 billion, well on our
way to our guidance of $4 billion for the year. Our cash position and balance sheet remains strong. The first priority
always is to use it to grow the business, then to reward our share owners, and finally, to seek opportunities to mitigate
risk and volatility to our balance sheet.
I do want to highlight that our Q3 tax rate increased to 36%. This was partially due to an increased mix of profits from
the U.S. compared to the rest of the world. We do expect a rate of 36% for the fourth quarter also.
Now for a bit more color on fourth quarter guidance for the business segments. In U.S. Domestic, we expect daily
volume to grow by 3% to 4%. Revenue is expected to be up about the same as volume. Base rate improvements will be
masked somewhat by lower fuel surcharges as well as changes in mix and package characteristics. We expect operating
profits to grow in line with revenue. Reflecting back to 2012, remember that our domestic margin benefited from the
nearly 8% growth in Next Day Air, something we don't expect to see this year.
Looking forward, the wild card will be the opportunities and challenges of a compressed peak season. For the
International segment, we expect volume growth of 3% to 5%, although product mix and currency will continue to
weigh on yields. We expect high single-digit profit growth, with operating margin around 16%. These expectations
include a negative currency impact of approximately $30 million to $40 million. At Supply Chain & Freight, we expect
revenue growth to be down somewhat as freight forwarding continues to experience lower demand and yield. Despite
the challenging conditions in the international air freight market and continued investments in healthcare, we expect
operating margin to expand to about 8%.
So overall, we remain confident in our full year earnings per share guidance in the range of $4.65 to $4.85 per share.
We're looking forward to the fourth quarter, and of course, the holiday season.
And now Alan Gershenhorn will share with you some thoughts about the upcoming peak. Alan?
Alan Gershenhorn
Thanks, Kurt, and good morning. The holiday peak season is always an exciting time at UPS and this year will be no
different. Consumers around the world count on us to deliver their holiday gifts on time and in perfect condition. For
2013, the National Retail Federation expects holiday retail sales to increase 3.9%. More importantly for UPS, online
sales are expected to rise between 13% and 15%. At UPS, some of our retailers are cautious in their holiday outlook.
However, they go into the season with more flexible supply chain options than ever before.

Retail customers are focused on managing inventory levels and providing the right customer experience to drive
growth. This includes working with UPS on omni-channel strategies which help to create better touch points for
consumers, improve utilization of brick-and-mortar square footage and to ship inventory directly from stores, all
enhancing the overall customer experience. Retail customers also talked to us about having a flexible supply chain so
they can respond quickly to market changes. At UPS, we expect this year's holiday season will be another for the
record books, as we pick up more than 34 million packages on our peak day.
As Kurt mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we expect package volume to grow 3% to 4%. However, with the later
Thanksgiving this year, there are six fewer shopping days from Black Friday to Christmas, and as a result, we expect
daily volume over this shortened window to be up 8%.
UPS is continuing to make the holidays easier for consumers too. Our industry first solution UPS My Choice has now
exceeded 5 million subscribers. Recent enhancements will provide subscribers the ability to organize their hectic
holiday schedule by managing their online orders with the UPS delivery calendar. In addition, UPS My Choice
consumers can choose to receive their UPS SurePost shipments earlier by upgrading to UPS Ground. And by the way,
UPS My Choice services are now available on Facebook, the online home to more consumers.
Peak season does not end for us at Christmas. The rapid growth of e-commerce has created a third peak for UPS that
starts after the holidays and keeps us bustling into the middle of January. During this period consumers are taking
advantage of gift cards and retailer year-end closeouts, as well as returning gifts received during the holidays. The UPS
returns portfolio offers several solutions that help shippers control return goods and provide their customers with a
hassle-free returns experience.
As you can see, there's a lot going on at UPS to prepare for the high demands for service. I want to wish you and your
family a wonderful holiday season and, of course, order early, often and, most importantly, have it shipped UPS.
And now I'll turn it back over to Kurt.
Kurt P. Kuehn
Well, great. Thanks, Alan, and we're ready now to open up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Our first question will come from the line of Nate Brochmann of William Blair. Please go ahead.
<Q - Nate J. Brochmann>: Good morning, everyone.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Good morning. How are you doing?
<Q - Nate J. Brochmann>: I wanted to talk a little bit – I mean, obviously if you go back to last quarter, we had a lot
of disruption in terms of kind of like shifting around some assets to account for where the freight was coming from and
a lot of the customer preferences on deferred. Clearly you guys have done a pretty quick job of that and obviously that's
a benefit of the integrated network. As we go into the holiday season and you talk about the flexible solutions that Alan
just mentioned, how do you continue to reallocate assets based on where the freight's flowing to maintain the most
flexibility for your customers, while maintaining the most profitability for you guys?
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Well, that's certainly something that UPS has been working on for many years, and we think it's
a benefit of us being able to have one integrated network where we can shift capacity. Having a ready fleet of aircraft
we can adjust to and certainly having the ability to move those quickly is important.

One area, though, that clearly we do this time of year, especially, is we spend a lot of time talking to our major shippers
about the holidays, and that helps us get a little bit of a shape for the peak season anyway. And, Alan, maybe you could
talk a little bit about our approach of preparing expectations for peak?
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Yeah, so the – as I said in my opening comments there, some of our retailers are a bit
cautious, but they're ready more than ever with the execution of these omni-channel strategies that we're helping them
with. And really what that does is it helps these retailers better optimize, minimize and better utilize both their in-store
and their DC inventories so they're prepared for any online growth acceleration. It obviously also helps them maximize
the price they get for their goods by avoiding markdowns, and it also creates that seamless in-store and online
experience for the shoppers. So, we're pretty excited about the solutions that we have in place for our retailers this year
to adjust for any eventualities.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Yeah and I guess the other component in your question there is the International component.
And, Jim, maybe you can talk a little bit about the flexibility that we try to build and react to customer demand this
time of year.
<A - Jr. James Jay Barber>: Sure, no problem. Obviously, the base network, I think you would know as you said in
the open, we've done a pretty good job over the years to balance that and utilize that. I think the other capabilities that
we have in our forwarding unit go down to charters, the ability for our large customers to flex when they need it so we
can bring charters into the network or not. And then the other advantage that we have with our networks is the ability to
flex it with extra rotations at peak capacity. So at that time, we feel like we've got the baseline and the foundation, and
we have the ability to optimize the network at the same time.
<Q - Nate J. Brochmann>: Thanks.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Ken Hoexter of Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.
<Q - Ken Scott Hoexter>: Great. Good morning. Great job on the Domestic side, so let me kind of focus a bit on
International. And, Kurt, if I heard you right, I think you said, margins might rise to about 16%. And seeing as they
were down year-on-year, if I heard that right, in this quarter just want to know what you're doing there in order to get
that margin up? And is there a cost-cutting program? Are you taking more assets out, just given that International
looked like a little disappointing in contrast to the strength you saw on the Domestic side?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah, Ken, thanks for the question. No, they're – we are feeling very good about the activities
in International. I'll let Jim talk a little bit about it. But you saw the very strong growth that we had in the quarter. We
think that momentum is going to continue. And also the headwind of the fuel and the currency did offset a lot of the
hard work. So, Jim, maybe you could talk a little bit about why you have increasing confidence in our International
sector?
<A - Jr. James Jay Barber>: Sure. So, obviously, this quarter we're down $32 million, we had $75 million in
headwinds going against it. We talked about the headwinds coming, but at the same time, beneath that – when you get
beneath that and you look across the geographies, you can see increasing momentum quarter-over-quarter-over-quarter.
And right now, we've got very, very good growth and capabilities in Europe and our Americas business, and you've
heard some of the comments, in the opening lines of the transborder network. So we're – as Asia continues to struggle a
bit, in the middle of that we adjust, we go forward. And you heard a couple other comments about some of our new
integrated networks in Turkey and Poland that have great 20% growth year-over-year. So we're confident in the
forecast and we're confident when some of these headwinds get behind us, you'll see that as well.
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Yes, and again, Kurt mentioned that fundamental, we really grew profits 10% and we did
take care of the currency in the field. So we feel good about the fundamentals of the business. As you look to 2014,
again, we think the currency will not be the issue we saw in 2013. So that will eliminate one of these headwinds as we
move into next year.

Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Tom Wadewitz of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Yeah, good morning. I wanted to ask you a little bit more about International. I guess
it'll probably be a popular topic today, but can you give us a sense on what pricing conditions are? And then I guess, in
terms of if there is some weakness in pricing, you've got the trade down, how much of a headwind is that to margin
when you look at 2014? Or is it something that, given the ability to adapt the network, that it's really not a big issue for
you when you look at kind of profitability in International in 2014? Thanks.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Yeah, Tom, the issue in International, even though I know the currency adjusted yields for
exports look very weak with a negative 5%, the vast majority of that impact is not pricing pressure. It is the trade lane
mix and the use of deferred products. As we said, our deferred products grew by 11% and a very strong growth, the
continent of Europe showed a 10% growth in shipments. So packages moving around Europe have substantially lower
revenues, but also a lot less cost. So we feel very comfortable that the market is competitive, but stable on the price
side. And as we adjust and adapt, and it's great to see Europe picking up steam, I think part of that is the economy
getting a little firmer. But most of it is company specific, and as we had talked about early this year, we felt that as we
focus back on our organic growth strategy, you'd see the results of that. So, we're pretty comfortable that the pricing
environment is rational.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Okay, great. Thanks.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of William Greene of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.
<Q - William J. Greene>: Hi, there. Good morning.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Good morning.
<Q - William J. Greene>: Hey, Kurt. Kurt, I'm wondering if you can provide us with a little bit more color on the
fourth quarter? You gave a lot of details around each one of the operating segments, and that was helpful. But I think
there might be some puts and takes here that I'm not fully grasping. And when I look at sort of the normal sequential
change in the earnings, typically I think it's up in the fourth quarter about 14%, 15%, but the midpoint of the range here
would be closer to 29%, 30%. Is it all currency that's kind of driving that? It feels like that's not enough. So I'm not sure
what else I'm missing that would kind of get us more to the midpoint? Or is it just the economic assumptions that really
justify the top and low end of the ranges there?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: So you're talking for the business in aggregate rather than just International?
<Q - William J. Greene>: Yeah, more like an EPS comment, just because when you take the midpoint it seems like
it's a pretty big step-up and I'm not sure I have all the pieces.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Well, we – I don't think it's a huge gap against the historical trends anyway. We are seeing good
positive momentum in International and gave you the guidance on that. International, we're looking for profit growth.
Although, frankly, there are both great opportunities and also some risks of a compressed peak season that Myron will
certainly talk about in a little while. As you compress the holidays into less days, if things go smoothly and the weather
is positive, then there's good opportunity. On the other hand, it does create some challenges. So we're comfortable that
we can deliver in the range that we've given, and I think the parts of the puzzle that we gave will help to back that up.
<Q - William J. Greene>: Okay. Thank you.

Our next question will come from the line of David Vernon of Bernstein Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Good morning, guys. A quick question on the Domestic competitive dynamic, in the
last couple of quarters Next Day Air volume you noted that the letter traffic is down. You're seeing some things about
sort of one-rate pricing, stuff like that, coming out. How do you feel about the Domestic sort of priority market and the
competitive dynamic there?
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Yeah, well, certainly, the market's continuing stable. We did show some improvements, but I'll
let Alan talk a little bit about some of the other issues.
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Yeah, certainly we had strong growth in our Ground and our deferred product. Speaking
specifically to the Next Day Air, certainly the – it's – our letter volume was down and that's tied to professional services
with a slowdown in the financial services sector, as a result of interest rates climbing a bit, and we did see a few losses
from some of our large banks.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: And the corresponding uptick in the Next Day Air yield is that sort of a positive mix
shift or better pricing in there?
<A - D. Scott Davis>: That'd be more packages versus letters would help drive that.
<Q - J. David Scott Vernon>: Okay. Great.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: I guess one other point just to remember, on the Air is, we did have a very strong Air quarter last
year. I think our Next Day shipments were up 7%. So part of that is a much tougher comp.

<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Hey. Good morning, guys.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Good morning.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Morning.
<Q - Justin B. Yagerman>: Wanted to dig in a little bit on the Domestic side. I mean, it looks like you guys got some
good pickup on efficiency gains, and I know you've got some pretty major initiatives with ORION and the SurePost
redirect pieces of the business going on. So maybe you could talk a little bit about where you are in ORION
implementation, and how many miles you've gotten out of your network? And on the SurePost redirect, how much of
that e-commerce traffic that you're moving is being leveraged by the UPS network now instead of handing off to
USPS?
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Great. No, we're glad to. I'll turn that over to Myron to fill you in a little bit. But, no, we were
pleased clearly with the Domestic for the quarter, I did mention though, we had an extra working day, which also helps,
and we had some safety benefits. But, yeah, Myron's people have been very business rolling out some of these new
applications. Myron?
<A - Myron A. Gray>: Good morning, Justin. We continue to take advantage of a healthy pipeline of technology
deployments. Throughout the year, however, to answer your question specifically, we have been able to redirect
approximately 20% of our SurePost volume back into the U.S. Domestic delivery network by improving our delivery
densities. And as a result of that, we've been able to control the number of direct miles driven. Simultaneously, we've
also taken advantage of leveraging our Worldport operations by reducing domestic block hours by over 3.7%. And if

you would also recall, we've fully deployed telematics only six months ago, so we expect to get continued upside from
that. And we've only deployed about 13% of our U.S. drivers on ORION right now and early results have been
extremely positive. So, we believe that there's more there for us.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Yeah, I do remember though that the ORION is a multi-year rollout. It's a very deep integrated
expansion that has to be route-specific. But thanks.

Our next question will come from the line of Kelly Dougherty of Macquarie. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kelly A. Dougherty>: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to stick with you U.S. Domestic. It was
nice to see you specifically to call out B2B volumes during the quarter. So just wondering if you can kind of give us a
sense of the magnitude and whether we may have turned a corner from the B2B perspective, and then how we should
think about that leveraging into the network? You had strong margins during the quarter. Can B2B help sustain levels
like we saw in the third quarter going forward?
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Well, I think the B2B did show modest growth. Really B2C continues to outperform. I don't
want to put too positive a spin on it, I guess. It was really the retail sector, especially with the omni-channel and us
moving goods between stores and retailers adjusting their supply chains that drove up the B2B component. The rest of
the sectors were fairly flat, maybe slightly negative.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Yeah, we're still looking for that pickup in manufacturing that's been called for. It's been slow
all year long, but hopefully if we can make some decisions in Washington, we'll get the manufactures going again.
<Q - Kelly A. Dougherty>: And then can you help us just think about whether these margin levels – it was very strong
in the third quarter. How can we think about that going forward maybe?
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Well, we've given you some pretty good sense for fourth quarter anyway and both the
opportunities and the challenges. We'll be talking a lot more about 2014 next quarter anyway, so we're really not at a
point to give any guidance going forward. But rest assured we're working hard to keep our customers satisfied and
manage our costs.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: And if we keep being successful on projects like ORION, that certainly bodes well for Domestic
margins. And Jim talked about where we're going internationally and we'll tell you a lot more in January.
<Q - Kelly A. Dougherty>: Thanks very much.

Our next question will be from the line of Chris Wetherbee of Citi. Please go ahead.
<Q - Chris Wetherbee>: Thanks. Good morning, guys. Can you talk a little bit about international capacity? Just
curious kind of how you think about the pace of activity internationally, and whether there is really the need to do
anything more with capacity. Sort of where you stand in the quarter as well would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Let me start off with David Abney talking about their air network and utilization and how we've
reacted there.
<A - David P. Abney>: Well, we have continued to match network capacity to volume trend. For International for the
third quarter, block hours were down 1% while our export volume was up 6.7%. For the fourth quarter, the truck routes
from Asia to the U.S., we will fluctuate between the 7.5% and 8%. We'll probably be down about 4% total International
block hours from last year. So that's where we sit and you have to remember that we have significantly cut Asia to U.S.

Our next question is from the line of Scott Group of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Hey. Thanks. Good morning, guys.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Good morning.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: So want to just drill down on the Domestic package margins a little bit again. Is there any way,
Kurt, to just put some numbers around how much you think that the operating day benefits you? The safety
improvements, is there any number around that and do you view that as ongoing or one time-ish? And then I'm just
curious, in this interim period without the labor contract, are you still accruing for the wage increases?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah, I guess to what we have, I think, pretty consistently estimated that an extra working day
usually gives you about $50 million, maybe $60 million depending on when it hits anyway. So that's something we
anticipate and plan and forecast for. Third quarter every year is a year usually where we make entries for workers'
comp and safety. Actually, last year there was a little more of that in the fourth quarter than the third, so that gave us a
little bit of a boost, but not material. And, yeah, we are accruing for the contract as it stands and as Scott said, we're
working through the details on that and are looking forward to getting that wrapped up pretty soon.
<Q - Scott H. Group>: Do you have a number on the accrual for the safety?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: No, I don't. It's a little bit in multiple sectors.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: But it's something like, as Kurt said, over the last 10 years pretty much every third quarter we do
an actuarial valuation and we've done a great job on safety, and every year we see benefit.

Our next question will be from the line of Ben Hartford of Baird. Please go ahead.
<Q - Benjamin John Hartford>: Hey. Good morning, guys. Jim, could you provide some context I guess to the
forwarding dynamics? I know you guys have been managing your capacity tightly in the International trade lanes. I
know Asian volumes are still a little soft or at least growth is decelerating. But it sounds like capacity has been taken
out in that market, and pricing dynamics within the forwarding market are still pressured. Do you get the sense that
there is still lingering margin – gross margin pressure within forwarding, given the pricing dynamics in the industry
plus underlying rates firming up or being rational?
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Well, I guess before I turn it over Jim, in our guidance, we do expect to see modest revenue
declines, although the unit's done a good job of adjusting. But, Jim, maybe you could fill us in a little bit more on the
view of the market.
<A - Jr. James Jay Barber>: Yeah, I guess over the last couple of days, and about the last week or so, some
information has come out that actually contradicts that, in that there's some backlogs out in Asia coming out. Quite
frankly, the way we look at it right now is that there are some upticks in volume, obviously, which would obviously
coincide with some rate issues. But we plan for that and we know there's some capacity reductions in the market, as
well, that kind of go in hand-in-hand.

But I think, over the next couple of weeks, we'll ultimately see what happens with the demand side. But we think we're
– at UPS, we're in good shape to handle that, obviously, with the way we run the network. But the other side about the
forwarding business is, it's a pretty volatile market all the time. You have to adjust to it, and we feel like, in the last
couple of years, we have invested nicely in some technology to help us to do that in the years to come. So we're pretty
comfortable with where the rates are going.

Our next question will come from the line of Art Hatfield of Raymond James. Please go ahead.
<Q - Art W. Hatfield>: Hey, morning, everyone.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Good morning.
<Q - Art W. Hatfield>: Real quick, on the fourth quarter, and you have made some comments regarding the shortened
holiday season. It would seem to me that given your flexibility and all the different services you can offer customers,
the potential benefits would outweigh the risks. But it sounds like you're focusing on the potential incremental costs or
the risks associated with the shortened holiday season. Can you kind of help me understand that a little bit better?
<A - D. Scott Davis>: I'll take a shot at that. I think Kurt used the term wild card. And frankly, a compressed holiday
period, if weather is perfect, it's good, probably will benefit us because we are going to be able to move our volume
through our network efficiently in shorter days – shorter hours. The question is, if you get an ice storm in Louisville,
one of those days, it's going to be hard to make up for it. So I think it's one of those things that, Scott, it's kind of a
risk-reward type deal. If weather is great, we'll probably get rewarded. If weather is bad, it will be a challenge for us.
<Q - Art W. Hatfield>: All right. Thank you.

Our next question comes from the line of Brandon Oglenski of Barclays. Please go ahead.
<Q - Brandon Robert Oglenski>: Yes, good morning, everyone, and congrats on the Domestic results this quarter.
When I go back to your 2011 Analyst Meeting, and you laid out the growth targets of 10% to 15% for EPS, you guys, I
think, were assuming a U.S. economy of 2.5% to 3.5% at that time. Have you gotten to the point where you've
transitioned the business to reflect the slower environment, where you think you can get back on track for some of
these longer-term earnings growth targets?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: We've made pretty good progress on our Domestic business, with the margins steadily
improving and moving forward, and so we feel that clearly we've done a lot of adaptation, both the product shifts and
economic changes. International clearly with the headwinds in global trade that we saw for the last couple of years has
probably been the bigger surprise, and that's one where Jim and the network people have been very busy adapting to
that, and hopefully you get a sense that we think we're making progress on that. But that's really been the bigger
probably difference since the investor conference a couple of years ago.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Yeah, and looking at this year, we weren't very far off those goals when we set our guidance at
the start of the year, taking out the currency and the fuel impact and pension particularly. So, hopefully if interest rates
stay where they are, pension will not be a headwind next year. We think currency will not be a headwind next year. So
we'll be positioned better to get closer to those targets.

Our next question is from the line of Thomas Kim with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Thomas Kim>: Thanks. What's the organic growth rate you're seeing out of the European operations on a
same-store basis?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: That 10% growth in exports is purely organic. Now some of that, Turkey and Poland came
from acquisitions several years ago, but I think we feel particularly gratified that we're seeing, as Jim mentioned, this
extension that we've done to the periphery markets around Europe succeeding. Jim?
<A - Jr. James Jay Barber>: I guess really both in Europe I think we're pretty proud of the last couple of years. We
had some acquisitions in Poland, in Turkey, in the UK, all those integrations are done, behind us, and all of those
markets quite frankly, are all growing double-digits. So that – that the combination of the transborder network over
there and the Express network, it's a really good story for us right now. So everything for the most part is good.
Obviously we – our next step was TNT. That's behind us now and now we kind of turn our focus of our people and all
that UPS has to offer the customers to emerging markets and some of the other places that we're now going. So we
think the future is bright.
<Q - Thomas Kim>: And if I could ask, what's the – what is the sort of key end markets that the growth is occurring?
Is it more intra-Europe or is it actually transatlantic, and if you could just maybe add a little bit more detail around that,
that would be helpful. Thanks.
<A - Jr. James Jay Barber>: Well, right now if you stand inside of Europe, from that geography, obviously our
intra-European growth is very good. You've got a double-digit growth in the inside because of the great network we
have there. We got some lanes depending on where you're going. Our U.S. lane continues to grow nicely across the
globe. And then again we're pretty proud of being able to offer domestic customers in geographies from Turkey to the
UK to Germany, across the world, and that piece of the world some great opportunity and they grow at double-digit as
well, so it's growing in many facets.
<Q - Thomas Kim>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question is from the line of Allison Landry of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
<Q - Allison M. Landry>: Just following up on the European business, you've talked a lot about double-digit growth
in the intra-European geography. So I was wondering if you could comment on the relative profitability of regional
package flows versus more intra-country, and then also your thoughts on whether European margins can ultimately
reflect those in the U.S.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah, in general, we do have higher margins in our export business than the Domestic business.
The benefit of our Domestic business is they give us a decent margin, but they also create the density that allows this
UPS-integrated network to create the returns, so that you guys enjoy so much. So as far as the targets, certainly the
priority is growth in export. And Jim's people balance them what the appropriate amount of Domestic business is
country-by-country to create infrastructure. Beyond that our – what we really look at is return on capital, and so we
make sure that those products that drive the most assets, those flying across oceans and those things generate the higher
margins. But beyond that, we don't really open up the can of worms.

<Q - David G. Ross>: Yes. Good morning, gentlemen.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Good morning.
<Q - David G. Ross>: I wanted to talk about UPS Freight. Yields declined a little bit, partially due to the higher
average weight per shipment. Could you comment on kind of what's going on with the average length of haul in that
division that may have also impacted the yields? And then any update you have on the new union contract with the
UPS Freight Teamsters would be great.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah, first, let me correct fact. Yields were up in the quarter, so they weren't up quite as much
as in previous quarters, but we still – we showed a 2.2% increase in revenue per hundredweight so there's no – that's
not an issue.
<Q - David G. Ross>: Okay. In the Excel sheet I got, 21.94% versus 22% a year ago, so it had actually a decline of
0.03% in LTL revenue per hundredweight?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Maybe. I don't know what you're looking. We'll have to take it off-line.
<Q - David G. Ross>: Okay.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Go ahead, Myron. Maybe on the business progress, and what you guys are doing.
<A - Myron A. Gray>: Yeah, I think our progress is in line with what we told you guys at our Investor's Conference in
2011 would expect margin improvement, while revenue did improve over 5%, and revenue per ton went up over 4%,
they were somewhat offset by not being able to get the kind of productivity improvements that we look for out of our
Freight operations, and we'll continue to deploy small package like productivity improvements with the use of
technology in Freight in the coming months, and would expect to perform better.
<Q - David G. Ross>: Thanks.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: As far as the contract, I think, we're making progress. I think we spend a lot of time between the
UPS teams and union leadership, really communicating and educating the people about the new contract. There were
changes in healthcare that were confusing to people. We've done this process in the package side and the master, have
had good results when we communicated the new contract. We expect the same on the Freight side. Hopefully we'll get
it out for a vote here in the near future.

Our next question will come from the line of Scott Schneeberger of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.
<Q - Daniel E. Hultberg>: Good morning, guys. This is Daniel Hultberg filling in for Scott. When touching on the
buybacks and the use of capital, can you please clarify is the $4 billion is still the target for 2013? And if you can help
us understand how you think about the use of capital in 2014 as well. Thank you.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah, well, certainly, as we've said, we remain on target to deliver the redistribution with the
share repurchases. We've purchased just a little shy of 3 – spent a little shy of $3 billion year-to-date on that front. So
we're moving along as said, and we tend to set a target each year, and complete what we do. So barring any unusual
market conditions or something, we expect to continue the remainder of that. The higher priority always is to invest in
growth, and certainly we've got the balance sheet to do it, although we've been targeting more smaller acquisitions,
things like CEMELOG in Eastern Europe to expand our healthcare network, and other targeted acquisitions. So, we'll
continue following that path, and also continue to support a very strong dividend. So we're looking for opportunities
and application of capital, plus we'd always use capital in some case to reduce the risk and volatility to the balance

Our next question comes from the line of Jack Atkins of Stephens. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jack Atkins>: Hi, thanks for the time. Just to dig here – just to dig in again here on the forwarding business, just
curious if you could maybe comment on the competitive landscape, the competitive dynamics really within the
forwarding industry, and if you have seen any improvement there as we move through the year with regard to just
competitive pricing pressures. And then secondly, when you think about the slate of tech launches that a lot of folks are
expecting to see over the course of this quarter, what type of volume trends would you expect to see in your forwarding
business out of Asia to the U.S. in the 4Q?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah, I'll start off at least with kind of the trends. Clearly, as Jim has mentioned, we are seeing
some pickup in demand. That's typical for the beginning of peak season. And there are some launches that'll give a
boost. And Jim any thoughts or comments on that competitive environment?
<A - Jr. James Jay Barber>: Well, as I said a minute ago, over the last couple of days some of the competitors have
seen what appears to be some pickup in demand that's matched against the capacity constrictions. But from our
perspective, we feel like we're in good shape. We – as I had said last quarter, we feel like we're a bit too concentrated in
some areas in forwarding that we'll move in the next quarter to work through that. But we know that based upon the
charter activity we're being asked to perform right now in the next – in the previous couple of weeks and going
forward, we know there's demand out there, and we need to fulfill that. So we feel like we're pretty confident with that.

<Q - Jeffrey A. Kauffman>: Could you – most of my questions have been asked at this point. Could you give us an
update on UPS Access Point? How that's performing in Europe, and if there are thoughts that that product could
eventually be rolled out in other global markets?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah, we'd be happy to talk about that. That is clearly a big initiative for the International
access. So Jim, do you want to talk a little by the about the rollout and where we're heading on that?
<A - Jr. James Jay Barber>: Sure. I think we have to remember when we bought Kiala, they had about 6500 access
points in France and the Benelux. We've rolled that out now and expanded into the UK and Germany. By the middle of
next year, we'll have 2,000 access points to 3,000 access points in each of those countries. The rollout's going just as we
thought it would. In a second, I'll turn it over to Alan with respect to going forward to some widening of what we see.
But we also like the combination of access points and what it can do for our delivery network. We're already expanding
it into the use of drivers and alternate delivery. We also like the power of the access points to create cross-border traffic
in the single market of Europe. So we're pretty pleased with where we are and Alan, if you want to add anything?

<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Yeah, I think to that point, Jim, it's a Swiss Army Knife really because we're changing
residential into high-density commercial stops. We're using it for these not-in-one alternate deliveries back to these
access points. We're using it for e-commerce returns and prepaid drop-offs, so we're really excited about what it's
enabling us to do to penetrate the B2C market in Europe cost-effectively. We're over 10,000 access points now. So
we're now in the UK and Germany. Those were our expansion plans and we're continuing to grow in France, Benelux
and Spain. And we're serving about 450 retailers at this particular point right now in Europe, so we're really excited
about the opportunity it's creating for us in the European environment.
<Q - Jeffrey A. Kauffman>: Do you think the bigger opportunity is more with customer penetration because you have
more convenient access points, or is there a cost saving side where you are reducing the amount of redeliveries or just
making it easier to get packages to customers?
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: It's actually both. So we're – as you know in the United States we're very big in retail.
Retail has not been our focus really in the past in Europe from a B2C perspective. So this is a big opportunity for UPS
to penetrate the retail market throughout Europe with better solutions than are available in the market today. And to
your point do it in a way that is profitable because of the density that we can create. And the other point I'd just make is
that, many of the consumers in Europe really prefer getting their deliveries at these access points versus at home and
some of our retailers have over 50% of their packages being delivered to these access points versus their residential
homes.

Our next question will come from the line of David Campbell of Thompson, Davis & Company. Please go ahead.
<Q - David P. Campbell>: Yes, thank you very much and good morning. I heard you say that your International block
hours would be down 4% in the fourth quarter, which is apparently more than they were down in the third quarter.
Given this pickup in demand in the Asia-Pacific region, how is that going to help your company International revenues
and forwarding profits in the fourth quarter?
<A - D. Scott Davis>: That's a good question, David. We certainly have some flexibility. Maybe, David, you could talk
about that.
<A - David P. Abney>: Yeah, and what I said was that it'd be down 4% from last year in the fourth quarter. And one of
the things that we look at very closely is how the calendar falls and where we can cut flights on an ad hoc basis and we
make those decisions. We continue to monitor the capacity and we have the ability to ramp up flights if we need to and
add those rotations but we can also cut back. So we have the flexibility. We have the network in place and we've been
doing this for years. In fact, if you look since 2008 our International block hours are down almost 5%. Our export
volume is up almost 20%. So we have this thing fine-tuned and we can make the adjustments we need no matter which
way it may swing throughout the quarter.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah, David...
<Q - David P. Campbell>: Okay. Thank you.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah, one of the other real value creations that we're being working on the last few years is to
take advantage of both our forwarding network and our owned fixed assets and having that flexibility to move volume
and freight especially in and out of both of them.

<Q - Helane R. Becker>: Thanks very much, operator. Hi, everybody. Almost all my questions but one have been
actually asked and answered. Thank you very much. As we look ahead, Kurt, to 2014 and we think about some of the
changes in healthcare laws and so on, how should we think about compensation as regards to healthcare? And I know
you've made some changes earlier this year to your plans, but what healthcare cost increases are going to look like.
Thank you.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah, hi, Helane. Unfortunately, you may help us wrap this call on a down note.
<Q - Helane R. Becker>: I'm sorry.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Healthcare expenses continue to be a challenge. We've made some modifications to our plans
to help to manage cost, but still the Affordable Care Act is continuing to add a burden to us. The transition tax per
covered life is a big deal for us. We think there's over $100 million of expense all in all that is a headwind that'll be in
the healthcare for next year on that.
<Q - Helane R. Becker>: Okay. Thank you. And you can repeat something positive if you want.
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: No, that's okay. That's okay. It's an important issue, and certainly we're eager to find solutions
to it.
<Q - Helane R. Becker>: Thank you.
Operator
Our next question will come from the line of Anthony Gallo of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.
<Q - Anthony P. Gallo>: Good morning. Thank you. You mentioned continued efforts with omni-channel retailing. I
am curious if you could bring us up to speed on where some of the retailer efforts are with ship-to-store activity; it was
sort of a hot topic earlier this year. Is it experimental now or is traction being gained? And has there been any benefit
on the margin front from the density that you gained from that?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Well, it's certainly beyond experimental. Alan can fill you in on some details on that.
<A - Alan Gershenhorn>: Yeah, I would say that initially the retailers were really looking at it to optimize their
inventories by better utilizing their in-store and DC inventories, shifting inventories sometimes all the way across the
United States, if in fact the goods weren't selling in one part, but they could still get the list prices in another part of the
country. Now what it's shifted to is how to compete in the local markets, so they're enabling – we're doing some things
with late pickups in the evenings for these clients and enabling next-day fulfillment in the local territory by utilizing
our night sorts. So they're really using it in a wide variety of ways to both become more effective with their inventory
as well as serve the consumers in a better way to compete with other retailers in the marketplace. We've got probably
about 25 large retailers underway today and they're using it to ship to and from stores, store-to-store, returns to the
store, and obviously some of those create even more B2B moves, which Kurt talked about earlier.
<Q - Anthony P. Gallo>: Is it starting to move the needle in margins or volume?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Well, it's certainly a part of the B2B retail uptick that we've seen, yeah.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: Yeah, I think clearly, anything we do to help density helps margins in the long term.
<Q - Anthony P. Gallo>: Thank you.
Operator
Due to time constraints, our last question will come from the line of Mr. Tom Wadewitz from JPMorgan. Please go
ahead.

<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Great, yeah, thank you for giving me a chance on a follow-up. I wanted to see if you
could give us a little more data on the comment of the flat export out of Asia. That was, I guess, flat package out of
Asia. And was there trade-down within that where you had premium down and deferred up? Or was the kind of 11%
growth in International deferred really a phenomenon that is taking place in your European business?
<A - Kurt P. Kuehn>: Yeah, Jim can give us certainly a little color on that.
<A - Jr. James Jay Barber>: Yeah, it is. I mean, the network has more expedited in it this year than last year, but
that's something we have to adjust to. And the network essentially is flat. It's got a different type of product in it this
year, but that's not just with UPS. The whole supply chains across the world are moving that way, and it doesn't mean
it's going to stay that way in the future. But as it exists right now in the flat discussions we've had, it is flat and it's also
got some down trade in it, but we have to then, back to David's comments, adjust the network the right way to be able
to keep it going forward for the customers and shareholders.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: And, Tom, I said earlier that I guess the fact is, the export market is not shrinking, it's growing
at a slow pace.
<A - Jr. James Jay Barber>: Yeah.
<A - D. Scott Davis>: The reality is, expedited is growing at a fast pace right now. So again – and as we get more
innovation development, more technology products and the economy gets a little bit better, I would expect to see some
better growth in Express going forward.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Okay. But that mix effect is true in Europe and Asia?
<A - Jr. James Jay Barber>: It's a little bit – I mean, Europe, frankly, you've got obviously big strong ground [ph]
train (59:18) networks that are a little bit different but you've got – I think the trade expedite is more predominant in
Asia obviously because of the length of supply chains. So it's more predominant there from my perspective.
<Q - Thomas R. Wadewitz>: Okay, great. Thank you.
Operator
And I'd like to turn the conference call back over to Mr. Dolny. Please go ahead, sir.
Andy Dolny
And I'll turn it over to Scott for some closing comments.
D. Scott Davis
Thanks, Andy. You all know that shippers and consumers around the world have come to depend on UPS to successful
deliver the holidays. Peak season UPS is a culmination of months of planning, training and preparation for the ultimate
test, the timely delivery of almost double our normal day's work. In advance, I want to thank the more than 400,000
dedicated UPSers around the world who will put in the long hours and go the extra mile for our customers this year.
And I also want to thank all of you for taking part in today's call. Thanks.
