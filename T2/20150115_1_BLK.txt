MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Good morning. My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference facilitator today. At this time, I would like to
welcome everyone to BlackRock, Incorporated Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2014 Earnings Teleconference.
Our hosts for today's call will be Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Laurence D. Fink; Chief Financial Officer,
Gary S. Shedlin; President, Robert S. Kapito; and General Counsel, Matthew Mallow. All lines have been placed on
mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer period.
[Operator Instructions] Thank you.
Mr. Mallow, you may begin your conference.
Matthew J. Mallow
Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. I'm Matt Mallow, the General Counsel of BlackRock and before Larry
and Gary make their remarks, I want to remind you that during the course of this call, we may make a number of
forward-looking statements and call your attention to the fact that BlackRock's actual results may, of course, differ
from these statements. As you know, BlackRock has filed reports with the SEC, which lists some of the factors that
may cause the results of BlackRock to differ materially from what we see today. And additionally, BlackRock assumes
no duty and does not undertake to update any forward-looking statements.
So with that, let's begin the call. Gary?
Gary S. Shedlin
Thank you, Matt, and good morning, everyone, my pleasure to be here to present our fourth quarter and full year 2014
as adjusted results.

Overall, 2014 was another strong year for BlackRock's clients, shareholders and employees. We continued to drive
shareholder value by generating consistent organic growth, demonstrating the benefits of scale through our operating
leverage, and systematically returning excess cash to our shareholders even in an increasingly volatile macro
environment. As Larry will discuss in more detail, our 2014 results highlight the stability and diversification of our
business model and evidenced the significant investments we've made in recent years to enhance the depth and breadth
of our global platform.
For the fourth quarter, BlackRock delivered earnings per share of $4.82 and operating income of $1.2 billion. Full year
earnings per share of $19.34 was up 17% compared to 2013 and operating income of $4.6 billion was 13% higher.
Non-operating results for the quarter reflected a $2 million decrease in the market value of our seed and
co-investments, down $63 million year-over-year, driven primarily by a reduced economic investment portfolio and
lower gains from investments in our hedge funds and fund-to-funds vehicles.
Our 25.4% as adjusted tax rate for the fourth quarter benefited from $39 million of nonrecurring items. While we
continue to estimate that 30% remains a reasonable projected tax rate for 2015, the actual effective tax rate may differ
as a consequence of additional nonrecurring items that arise during the year. BlackRock's fourth quarter results were
driven by $88 billion of long-term net new business, our highest-ever quarterly net flows, representing an annualized
organic growth rate of 8.3%. For the full year of 2014, BlackRock generated total long-term net new business of $181
billion, representing an organic growth rate of 4.5%. Together with net flows from our cash management business,
BlackRock generated over $200 billion of net inflows for the year.
During 2014, we achieved organic asset growth of 11% in iShares, 11% in Retail, and 1% in Institutional, in line with
the growth targets we outlined at our June Investor Day. This resulted in organic-based fee growth in excess of organic
AUM growth, as we benefited from positive mix change associated with our faster growing, higher fee, Retail and
iShares businesses. Equally important, net long-term flows were diversified by asset class and region with positive
flows across all categories for both the quarter and the full year.
Fourth quarter revenue was flat with the year ago as growth in base fees and revenue from BlackRock Solutions was
offset by a decrease in performance fees. Full year revenue grew 9% from 2013, driven by growth in base fees and
revenue from BlackRock Solutions, both of which reached record levels in 2014.
Fourth quarter base fees rose 5% year-over-year as average AUM increased due to organic growth and market
appreciation. However, base fees were down 3% compared to the third quarter due to a lower fourth quarter AUM
entry rate, the continued impact of divergent beta and ongoing dollar appreciation against foreign currencies. While the
S&P 500 was up 2% on average during the fourth quarter, the MSCI World was down 2%, with emerging markets and
natural resources indices lagging even further, down 8% and 12% respectively. Such divergent beta impacts our
financial results as only 34% of our equity base fees are generated in U.S. markets. In addition, ongoing dollar
appreciation led to a $59 billion decline in the long-term AUM in the quarter.
Performance fees for the quarter were $144 million driven by a broader suite of single strategy hedge funds, real estate
and hedge funds solutions offerings. Performance fees decreased $124 million from the fourth quarter of 2013, which
included a large fee associated with the partial liquidation of a closed-end opportunistic fund. The decline also reflected
relatively weaker performance across a variety of hedge fund products, in line with broader industry trends.
BlackRock Solutions revenue of $170 million for the quarter was up 8% year-over-year and 3% sequentially, due to
increases in both Aladdin and FMA revenue. Our Aladdin business, which represented 75% of BlackRock Solutions'
revenue in the quarter, grew 9% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. We completed a number of large global
implementations in 2014 and expect continued business momentum from trends favoring global investment platform
consolidation and multi-asset risk solutions. Our FMA business ended 2014 with $161 million in revenues. While
revenues benefited from meaningful transaction-based disposition activity during the year, our business model remains
well-positioned to help clients navigate and implement requirements attendant to CCAR and the new ECB's Single
Supervisory Mechanism.

Total expense for the fourth quarter was flat year-over-year as increased direct fund expense was offset by decreased
levels of G&A expense. Full-year compensation expense increased $273 million or 8%, reflecting higher head count
and higher incentive compensation driven by higher operating income. Importantly, our compensation-to-revenue ratio
declined 30 basis points in 2014 to 34.2% driven by continued reshaping of our employee base and the benefits of scale
across our platform. Fourth quarter G&A expense decreased $23 million year-over-year, or 6%, reflecting lower
professional services and other G&A expense and various lease exit costs included in the fourth quarter of 2013.
Sequentially, quarterly G&A expense increased $61 million primarily due to volatility and FX re-measurement, the
planned seasonal uptick in yearend marketing and promotional spend and closed-end fund launch costs associated with
the $437 million BlackRock Science and Technology Trust. Overall, total expense for 2014 increased 6% from a year
ago compared to a 9% increase in revenue over the same period, resulting in an as adjusted operating margin of 42.9%
for the full year, a 150-basis-point increase over 2013 levels.
Since closing the BGI merger at the end of 2009, we have expanded our operating margin by over 450 basis points,
while also significantly reinvesting in our business. In line with that commitment, on November 5, BlackRock entered
into an agreement to acquire certain assets of BlackRock Kelso Capital Advisors, the external investment advisor to
BlackRock Kelso Capital Corporation. This transaction enhances our fixed income platform through the addition of a
middle market private credit capability. Pending BDC shareholder approval, we expect the transaction to close in the
first quarter of 2015.
During 2014, we returned approximately $2.3 billion to shareholders through a combination of dividends and $1 billion
in share repurchases, representing a total payout ratio of 71%. As we enter 2015, we remain committed to a predictable
and balanced approach to capital management. Consistent with this, our board of directors has declared a quarterly cash
dividend of $2.18 per share of common stock, representing an increase of 13% over the 2014 level. Since instituting a
dividend in 2003, BlackRock has grown its dividend at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 22%. Our
board has also authorized the company to repurchase an additional 6 million shares under our existing share repurchase
program, giving us authorization to repurchase a total of 9.4 million shares including 3.4 million shares which are
remaining under our prior program announced in January 2013.
Our consistent earnings growth and stable financial results reflect the benefits of our differentiated global business
model. Fourth quarter net flows were positive in both our active and index franchises, as well as in each of our
geographic regions with $62 billion from the Americas, $15 billion from EMEA, and $11 billion from APAC.
BlackRock's global retail franchise saw long-term net inflows of $23 billion during the fourth quarter, bringing
full-year inflows to $55 billion, representing 11% organic growth for the full year. As usual, fourth quarter retail flows
reflected seasonal impact of reinvested capital gains distributions.
Fourth quarter U.S. retail flows of $21 billion were driven by strong fixed income flows across a diverse set of
products, including our top-performing total return and high yield franchises and our flagship Strategic Income
Opportunities fund. SIO was the leading unconstrained bond fund in the fourth quarter with nearly $5 billion of
quarterly net inflows. Our Multi-Asset Income fund or MAI continued its momentum with nearly $2 billion of flows in
the fourth quarter, making it the top multi-asset income fund in the industry ranked by 2014 flows.
Fourth quarter international retail net inflows of $2 billion were driven by BlackRock's fixed-income, multi-asset, and
index capabilities, which more than offset headwinds and ongoing outflows from our European equities franchise.
Global iShares generated over $44 billion of net new business in the fourth quarter and approximately $101 billion for
the year, representing full-year organic growth of 11%. iShares once again captured the number one share of global
ETF industry flows.
During the fourth quarter, iShares' record fixed-income flows were broadly diversified by asset class, duration, and
geography. We continue to aggressively target growth in the fixed income ETF market, and we're the global leader in
fixed income inflows in 2014. Fourth quarter equity iShares flows of $24 billion were driven by flows into the Core
Series with particular demand for U.S. equity exposures. The Core segment remains an important growth channel for
iShares, posting an organic growth rate of 30% in 2014.

Our Institutional business generated approximately $21 billion of long-term net inflows for the quarter and $25 billion
of net inflows for the year, representing the highest quarterly and annual institutional flows we've seen in the past five
years. The investments we've made in our diverse global platform position us well to meet the ever-changing needs of a
sophisticated institutional client base and we expect this momentum to continue in 2015.
Barbelling continues to be a key theme as institutional clients pair cost effective beta exposure with alternatives and
other high conviction alpha solutions to achieve uncorrelated returns. We continue to see sizable asset allocation driven
flows both into and out of institutional index products resulting in net inflows of $20 billion in the quarter. Institutional
index equity flows were driven by clients looking to increase risk exposure while fixed income inflows reflected asset
allocation decisions and solutions-based LDI activity. Institutional active net inflows were paced by positive flows
from fixed income, multi-asset, and alternatives.
Fixed income net inflows of $3 billion were diversified across exposures, and we continue to see institutional demand
for our unconstrained strategies. Multi-asset net inflows of $2 billion were highlighted by solutions-based wins as well
as continued demand for our LifePath target-date suite. Excluding approximately $600 million of returned client
capital, institutional alternatives generated nearly $2 billion of net new business, led by hedge fund solutions and
private equity solutions. In addition, we had another strong fundraising quarter for illiquid alternatives raising nearly $3
billion in new commitments, reflecting ongoing momentum in infrastructure, debt, and renewable power.
Over the last two years, we've raised more than $12 billion in commitments and have nearly $9 billion of committed
capital to deploy for clients. While return of capital impacts our net flows immediately, committed capital only
translates into flows in AUM as those dollars are invested. Outflows from both scientific and fundamental active
equities continued in the fourth quarter. Despite strong performance, client demand for scientific active equity remains
muted. Fundamental active equity outflows continued in products with historical performance issues. However, these
flows were partially offset by select wins in categories where our new managers are building strong track records
including large cap growth.
In summary, in a year marked by periods of increased volatility, our diversified business continued to deliver solid and
consistent financial results. We remain confident that our differentiated business model is well positioned to meet the
needs of our clients and shareholders in the year to come.
And with that, I'll turn it over to Larry.
Laurence Douglas Fink
Thanks, Gary. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining the call.
2014 closed with heightened volatility due to political and social instability. And that volatility obviously is continuing
today and in the new year. However, markets proved resilient in 2014 and the fourth quarter marked the eighth straight
quarterly rise for the S&P 500 with data suggesting a rebound for the U.S. economy.
As Gary discussed, the U.S. equity markets outperformed emerging European and Asian markets and certainly
outperformed natural resource markets. And the U.S. dollar continued to appreciate relative to other currencies. This
market divergence is likely to persist in 2015 creating both large challenges and large opportunities for our investors.
Anemic global growth has led to an over dependence on politicians to implement reforms to rebuild the global
economies. But we've seen limited action globally from politicians. And as a result, we continue to rely on
accommodative central bank policies whether we're talking about Europe, China, Japan, and even at this moment, even
the United States.
This will also put more pressure on the U.S. dollar as it will rise higher, as well as a mixture of regional policy
successes and failures, again, increasing more global volatility. The technology revolution that most people always
underestimate is so evident in the oil industry. And through this technology, the growth and supply of oil is outpacing
demand, which has led to a period of volatile price discovery in the petroleum markets with greater than a 50% drop in
oil prices.

This is leading to a global redistribution of wealth, which people underestimate how this is going to transform the
world. With the high-cost energy production, the economy is experiencing major headwinds. Countries like the U.S.,
like China, like India will be seeing huge benefits and stimulus. In countries that have seen currency devaluations, such
as Europe in recent months will experience only modest and moderate gains.
We see more shocks as production decisions in the demand side equilibrium. But overall, this oil-price movement
should be of great benefit for the global economy. With a backdrop of divergent market performance, volatility,
regulatory reform, persistent low rates, our clients' near- or long-term investment challenges are becoming more
complex, but our goals at BlackRock steadfastly remain the same. We are a fiduciaria and BlackRock is well positioned
to address our clients' needs and deliver returns for our shareholders in all market environments.
The combination of our global multi-asset platforms, our insight and thought leadership in Aladdin, our unified
technology and risk management platform, has resulted in a more deeper client interactions than we've ever seen
before. It has also enabled our investment team to collaborate ahead of key macro events to both protect assets and in
most cases generate alpha for our clients. In the fourth quarter, BlackRock generated $88 billion of long-term net
inflows, the strongest quarterly long-term flows in our history. And for the full year, BlackRock saw long-term net
inflows of $141 billion. And together with the net flows from our cash management business, we generated more than
$200 billion in net inflows in 2014.
But I want to emphasize one important thing. It's not about the magnitude or the scale of the assets that we've raised,
but I want to emphasize the composition of the flows, which we believe is much more important. For the year, we saw
$35 billion in active and $146 billion in index flows. We saw a $52 billion in equities. We saw $96 billion in fixed
income, $29 billion of flows in multi-assets and $4 billion in alternatives where we put the money to use. We saw $55
billion of flows in Retail, $101 billion of flows in iShares, and $25 billion of flows institutionally. And we saw these
flows in all regions from all investor types, and importantly, in the face of a wide range of economic and investment
conditions.
One thing I'd like to highlight is there were more than – there were 13 countries where we had net inflows of excess of
$1 billion in 2014. We now manage assets in excess of $1 billion for clients domiciled in 41 countries, demonstrating
the increasingly global and differentiating nature of a BlackRock platform. In addition, we added our first Aladdin
client based in Latin America, and now have clients actively using the Aladdin system in 47 countries around the
world. As the nature of our clients' investment challenges change, so does the nature of the solutions they require. More
and more, a single investment product, asset class or style, does not provide a sufficient long-term solution.
BlackRock's business model which was deliberately built to deliver a multi-faceted solution to clients and BlackRock's
ability to leverage these capabilities across our truly diverse global platform of active and index, equities, fixed income,
multi-asset, and alternative strategies, all backed by Aladdin analytics and risk management, has resulted in continued
organic growth and revenue growth for the firm. BlackRock saw 27 distinct Retail and iShares products, each
generating more than $1 billion of net flows in the fourth quarter. For the year, 56 individual Retail and iShares
products generated more than $1 billion of net flows, compared to 43 such products in 2013.
The breadth of our platform is resonating with clients as they continue to seek a diverse set of global investment
solutions. As Gary mentioned we made significant long-term investments over the past few years in our people, our
process, and our platform, and those dividends and those investments have paid off in 2014. And I strongly believe this
will continue to differentiate BlackRock over time in an increasingly competitive industry.
The strength of BlackRock's fixed-income business is an area where past investments are translating into differentiating
results for our clients and for our firm. BlackRock was built on a foundation of superior fixed-income performance, and
now we have 91% of our active taxable fixed-inc platform outperforming the benchmarks or peers for the three-year
period. And no single category was the primary driver of the $96 billion inflows we gathered this year.
Active and index flows were diversified across high yield, unconstrained, and core bond offerings, and positive across
all client businesses, and we saw several key buy list adds across categories in 2014. Our flagship, Strategic Income
Opportunity (sic) [Opportunities] fund or SIO raised more than $13 billion in 2014 and we now manage more than $31

billion across our unconstrained fixed income franchise for both retail and institutional clients.
BlackRock saw increased client interest in our Total Return fund which is in the top 3% of our peer group for one-year,
for three-years, and for five-years. Total Return generated $2 billion of net inflows in the quarter and represents a
meaningful long-term opportunity for us. Fixed income is also a core strategic priority for BlackRock's iShares, which
led the industry in fixed income ETF flows for the quarter and for the year, driven by iShares constituting 15 of the top
25 fixed income ETFs by net flows in 2014. Assets across classes, BlackRock's iShares franchise, as I said earlier,
generated more than $100 billion in net flows this year, and was the industry leader inflows in the United States,
inflows in Europe and inflows globally.
We continue to focus on growing global iShares market share and driving global market expansion and we expect
client and product segmentation to drive the next wave of our iShares growth. We saw $32 billion inflows in our global
Core Series in 2014 as buy-and-hold investors are increasingly turning to iShares for efficiently constructing larger
portions of their portfolio. iShares are used as financial instruments where ETFs are providing a compelling alternative
to individual securities, to swaps, to futures, and we're seeing a lot of strong initial progress in this newly formed area
of the marketplace. And clients are also using iShares as precision exposures to express targeted investment viewpoints
to generate alpha with efficiency.
In the fourth quarter, BlackRock kicked off iThinking, an innovative new initiative designed to help distill market
insight into clear actionable ideas for our clients and matching them with different iShares solutions. We continue to be
– product innovation was evident in December when we launched our CRBN or our Low Carbon Targeted (sic)
[Target] ETF, designed for individuals and institutions who were focusing on environmental sustainable activity. The
United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund and the University System of Maryland Foundation provided the initial
funding for this ETF. And BlackRock now manages more than $250 billion in socially responsible strategies across our
global platform.
2014 was a turning point for our institutional business and as we enter 2015 with substantial momentum. Our scale and
our global presence enables BlackRock to interact with our increasingly sophisticated client base in a highly specialized
manner, and our financial institution group business is a great example. In 2014, BlackRock was selected to manage
mandates spanning multi-assets, fixed income, infrastructure debt and full balance sheet outsourcing for global
insurance clients driven by regulatory changes by M&A and investors are looking for better ways to navigate in this
low interest rate environment.
In conjunction with asset management mandates, many of these clients also chose to partner with BlackRock and
Aladdin on evaluation, on risk and advisory services, on even acquisition support through our BlackRock Solutions
business. BlackRock is the only firm in the industry that can bring all of these components together to meet the needs
of our clients, and we do this with dedicated relationships and with investment teams who speak with our clients in
their own language, we understand their industry, and we could partner with them to create their needs, to provide the
most proper solutions to their issues.
Another area where we are creating tailored outcomes is in the alternative space, particularly in the emerging
alternative solution business where BlackRock is building a holistic, multi-dimensional solution portfolio leverages our
full global platform. We've seen strong fundraising across our illiquid alternative product set as the targeted strategy we
laid out on Investor Day unfolds. BlackRock raised nearly $6 billion in new commitments in 2014 across a variety of
strategies including private equity, hedge fund solutions, opportunistic credit, renewable power and infrastructure debt.
We recently completed our annual institutional clients rebalancing survey which indicated that institutions are looking
to significantly increase allocations to real estate including infrastructure. In the fourth quarter, BlackRock closed our
second renewable power infrastructure fund, positioning us as one of the leading global renewable platforms in the
industry. 2014, BlackRock raised commitments of nearly $800 million in renewable power and $1 billion in
infrastructure debt. Momentum in this space demonstrates BlackRock's proprietary transaction sourcing capabilities
and ability to act as an extension of our clients' internal teams. The tangible impact of the investments made to-date in
our renewable power fund is also being felt by providing energy and electricity to more than 100,000 households.

We continue to make progress on the reinvigoration and globalization of our fundamental active equity business and
have seen meaningful impact on performance for some of our clients. We've seen a major improvement in the end
performance of our UK equity strategies. We generated top-quartile performance as we hit our three-year anniversary
in our new management team in Asian equities. And our European equity strategy has posted a leading market share
and solid broad-based three-year and five-year investment performance.
The most recent leg of our investments in this area was focus on U.S. equities. We've hired a world-class group of
investors with strong processes and track records for generating alpha. We're now in our second year of the investment
and seeing good progress. And hopefully, we will improve on our investment performance, although we have a lot of
work to do, and quite frankly, we're not at the space where I would like to be at this moment.
2014 was a challenging year for our active managers, with only 20% of the industry U.S. active equity funds
outperform their benchmarks. We saw a significant rise in volatility in the fourth quarter, but it was encouraging to see
many of our active teams deliver stronger performances in the environment, especially in December.
Our basic value strategy achieved top-quintile performance since the new manager inception. Our Large Cap series,
this strategy has improved to a second-quartile from a fourth-quartile. And our U.S. opportunity strategy is in the top
quintile over three years.
While our active business continues to feel the impact of clients balancing high-conviction alpha strategies now with
index exposures, the breadth and diversity of our platform and the presence of the only scale player in both active and
index of around the world will differentiate us in the ability to give our clients the full menu of solutions they need. We
expect investor preference to vary over time and BlackRock's ability to evolve alongside our clients is critical in the
future for our success.
Before I open it up for questions, I'd like to take a moment to thank our employees for their hard work, incredible
dedication in 2014, and helping our clients in the most complex investment challenges in the world by helping them to
provide solutions.
I'd like to thank my entire management team, many of them who are thriving in their new role, following successful
organizational changes earlier this year. And I'd like to recognize some of the milestones that BlackRock achieved in
2014.
In Retail, we crossed over $500 billion in assets under management. In iShares, in 2014, we closed with more than $1
trillion in assets under management. In Institutional, we garnered the best close that we've seen in over five years.
Since the financial crisis or essentially since the end of 2007, the final year of the pre-crisis earnings, BlackRock has
grown EPS by 142%, versus the S&P 500 growing at 76%, and the S&P Financial Index growing at only 9%,
highlighting both the differentiation of our business model and our ability to execute on key growth strategies. All of
the areas I've spoken about, whether it's fixed income, iShares or Financial Institution Group, alternatives,
infrastructure, our active equity platform, all are areas where we made significant strategic investments over time and
we'll be seeing the impact of those investments over time to our shareholders and to our clients.
We will continue to make investments in BlackRock's future and keep very high margins and utilize the full scale of

<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Hi, Luke.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks. I think obviously some unusual dynamics have been
helping the institutional fixed income ETF usage, but it's a question really about the long-term opportunity. You've
been adding talent to the sales force there. And I think given the need for customized portfolios and immunization of
specific liabilities in that context, how do you envision fixed income ETF shares fitting into institutional portfolio
construction? I think it's a question about how you characterize the valued proposition rather than any liquidity
challenge that they might help address in a fixed income market.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Yeah. That's a good question. I'm going to let Rob Kapito answer that.
<A - Robert S. Kapito>: So, the fixed income ETFs have been in increased demand as people are learning about the
product. We are still in the early stages, not only of institutions using the product, but Retail using the product as well.
So, there are three segments, there is the buy-and-hold segment where people are using ETFs as a part of their fixed
income portfolio for the beta and fixed income. And we have products that are focused on that.
The second thing is that as the financial markets change, ETFs are a surrogate for many financial instruments that have,
because of regulatory reasons and liquidity reasons, become very expensive. And there are surrogates, for example in
swaps and futures where ETFs are now being used in fact more than futures are being used, and as people learn about
that they had that into their portfolios.
On the other side of that, they're also being used as, we call it, precision instruments where people are looking for a
specific allocation and ETFs provide that specific precision tool for them to be invested in. So, this is just the beginning
of where fixed-income ETFs go. And as you know, the fixed-income markets are much larger than the equity markets
are. So, we just see continued growth in that.
So, for Retail, we're attacking that by adding on to our Core Series where we are adding products that can offer the full
suite to what a retail investor would need over the long term in ETFs, whether that be in high-yield, in corporates, in
treasuries or just generic fixed income. And then on institutions, because they're looking for more of a trading vehicle
and they're looking for the transparency and they're looking for the liquidity, we're adding more specific type of
precision instruments for them.
So, I would tell you that the demand to learn about ETFs grows and grows, and we're just – we just think this is a
market that we're very positive on going forward. And also for portfolio managers that are managing large portfolios,
getting the beta exposure from ETFs is cheaper. It's more diversified, and it's more liquid than the alternative. And I
might add that's really important when you're in a low interest rate environment like we're in. So, we look forward to
more growth in the fixed income and to be the leader in the ETFs in that area.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: And one other point, fixing ETF utilization is far less than equity utilization and the
opportunity is for that to converge quite a bit.
<Q - Luke Montgomery>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Thanks, Luke.

Your next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Hey, Dan.
<Q - Daniel T. Fannon>: Good morning. I guess kind of building upon that and just thinking about your comment
about substantial momentum in the institutional business heading into 2015, outside of what we just talked about there
with the fixed income ETF, can you get a little more specific about where you see that demand and kind of maybe a
way to characterize it versus previous periods in terms of either size or opportunity?

<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Well, the momentum is, as I said, carrying on into 2015. We are seeing – I think much
of it has to do with the continuation of performance that we've generated with some top-decile performance in our core
business, our leading performance in our unconstrained fixed income, our top-quartile, maybe top-decile performance
in high yield. So, across the board, the performance in all of the different fixed-income products continues to be quite
large. And we are seeing more and more clients are just also using beta products for fixed income.
So across the board, we are seeing that. But in terms of where we are seeing clients looking to put more money to work,
we are seeing increased activity in the defined contribution area where we've had some rather substantial wins. We
continue to see – in terms of insurance companies, always at the beginning of the year, they get big infusions of cash.
This is one of the fundamental reasons why we thought that rates would be going down in the first part of the year.
Obviously, we didn't expect some of the activities that occurred. But fundamentally, you'll always see some very large
activities from insurance companies because of the beginning of the year. So, it's across the board and it's
geographically diverse, too. So, we think this is going to continue.
But I must say, with where rates are at this moment, more and more clients are going to be looking for different types
of expressions of exposure that – I do believe with where rates are, it's going to lead to more and more clients searching
things like infrastructure debt, other activities like that, and this is one of the reasons why we have so heavily invested
in our infrastructure teams. We will continue to see clients reaching for yield and high yield, whether that's a good
strategy or bad strategy. I mean, I specifically believe rates are going to stay lower longer, and I think the activity that
you're seeing in Europe, whether the court's approval of the OMT for the ECB and the possible – greater possibility of
QE from the ECB, but continual easing in Japan. And importantly, as Chairwoman Yellen has said she's going to be
very data-dependent related to what the Federal Reserve does. So, I actually believe this creates more money in motion
and more opportunity for BlackRock, especially with our flows.
<Q - Daniel T. Fannon>: Great. That's helpful. And then, Gary, if you could please just characterize kind of the
budget and how your outlook for 2015 with regards to the kind of core expense growth.
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: I would say, well, let's break it down. I mean I think that in terms of G&A, I think when we
look at the fourth quarter on G&A, I mean, obviously it was slightly elevated by virtue of some closed-end fund, launch
costs, and obviously, some FX re-measurement. But I think once you kind of exclude those two items, I think the fourth
quarter is generally a decent run rate for the year in terms of G&A.
And then more broadly, as, you know, we think about margins obviously notwithstanding some of the seasonality that
we have in our own margins especially in the first quarter, you know, margins, more broadly, are dependent on lots of
things, especially the beta environment, the future business mix, the various reinvestment opportunities that we see in
our business, and obviously, the competitive compensation environment.
So, I don't – our margin guidance really hasn't changed. As you know, we don't manage the business to a specific
margin target and we're – remain ever committed to generating operating leverage. We're also reinvesting in the
business.
<Q - Daniel T. Fannon>: Great. Thank you.

Your next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Credit Suisse.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Good morning, Craig.
<Q - Craig W. Siegenthaler>: Thanks. Good morning, Larry. First, I was wondering if you could provide a quick
update on SIFI from new commentary from both the SEC and FSOC, especially related to some of the activities that it
seems like they're targeting, like ETFs, alternatives, derivatives, securities lending, with those being pretty relevant to
you guys.

<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: I don't think they're targeting any one product. I think they're investigating products
where there's obviously large growth and where there's areas where you may have mismatches of liquidity and/or you
may have a need for greater disclosure.
So, a, there's nothing new from our point. We are – if a regulator asked us to provide information, we do that
worldwide. We are embracing in a very positive way the movement towards the review of activities. We will be the
largest beneficiary. If the market is perceived to be stronger, more transparent, easier to understand by more investors,
we will be one of the largest beneficiaries of that event. And so we are embracing the concept of a better financial
ecosystem for our clients. And if that means greater disclosure, greater transparency, we will embrace it.
But I think it's incorrect to say they are targeting because I don't think they are targeting at all. The conversations we're
having are – they are open dialogs, they're expressive. We are providing information as asked. Obviously, the dialogues
are one-dimensional. They ask a question, we provide information. And that's all we know. We presume these
questions are being asked by – asked with dozens and dozens of different managers. And – but we are – we're
welcoming this process. And we will all wait and see alongside with you what the outcomes will be. And I think this
will be quite granular. I think we will see how this plays out. And – but unquestionably, you're going to see probably
different disclosure requirements or different liquidity issues in some products and, you know, by and large, we're in
support of that.
<Q - Craig W. Siegenthaler>: Thanks, Larry. Very clear. Second question. 2014 was a year where we saw a big
pickup in pension risk transfers, pension closeouts. I was wondering if you have any thoughts on how this could trend
2015 given some of the drivers like the change in mortality tables. And given that BlackRock is a large manager of
assets for sort of clients on both sides of the aisle, pension plans, insurance companies. You know, really, maybe kind
of share some perspective here.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: I don't know how this is going to play out with where rates are today going forward. I
mean, I think it's very hard in most cases to be closing up pension funds, but let's step back for a second. Why have we
seen elevated pension closeouts? Because you've had significant rallies in U.S. equities over the last five years.
Companies have been closer to meeting their liabilities and they have a desire to minimize income statement volatility
because of the issues related to the pension fund. So, we are in dialogues with many people. Some of the firms have
used annuities, working with insurance companies. As we said, we are in dialogue with many organizations. Some of
the organizations are transforming their DB plans to DC. As I said, we're seeing elevated growth in our DC business in
the fourth quarter and we expect that in the first quarter. And we are having dialogues with many, many institutions
worldwide about these – about the possibilities. But I would just caution that with rates being so low, unless you see
significant equity rallies, it becomes a little harder to do that or the companies are going to have to infuse some type of
money to making sure that they're matched.
But I would say unquestionably, BlackRock's global platform, the ability of having – our strength in target-date and in
terms of DC plans and having LifePath on the DC side, we have a lot of components in working with our clients,
whether it's LDI products, which obviously will create a de-risking, and obviously, we could help quite a bit in helping
them think about how to – how can a pension fund ultimately transfer some of the risks.
But I don't – I'm going to call it unified across the board. I do believe depending on where each company is related to
their liability, and as you suggested quite correctly about the elongation of age, these are all big issues. We've actually
had conversations with organizations that did LDI years ago, and now how do they factor in this elongated aging
process and are they properly matched? So, but one thing is very clear to companies that have done the de-risking, it is
not a static one-time event. They have to be constantly monitoring this dependent on how their liabilities are changing.
And as I said earlier, we're very involved in these dialogues. And I do believe this plays really well with our global
platform of having great analytics and helping companies think about it over a long period of time of being involved
with insurance companies and doing a lot of liability-matching type of products for insurance companies. So that plays
really well into LDI and other areas for us.

Your next question comes from Robert Lee with KBW.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Hey, Robert. Good morning.
<Q - Robert Andrew Lee>: Hey. Good morning. Good morning, Larry. Good morning, everyone. I guess my first
question I'm just going to capital management. You guys have certainly been very clear on how you think about capital
management and you had the dividend increase that you just announced. But I'm just curious, I mean, if we look at the
$250 million commitment to share repurchase per quarter, I mean, that's been in place since the beginning of 2013 and
I think since the end of 2012, earnings are up maybe about 35% or so. So is it reasonable to be thinking that that kind of
$250 million base commitment may be subject to some upward revision too as we continue to kind of scale the
company?
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Let's see if Gary can answer this question.
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: Let's see if Gary can. Hey, Rob.
<Q - Robert Andrew Lee>: Hey, Gary.
<A - Gary S. Shedlin>: So, I think, broadly, we remain committed to consistent capital management. I think that we
spoke last year a little bit about some of the uncertainty in the environment, which I think clearly is still out there.
Though, I think Larry commented more broadly on it. So, I think consistent with that and as we've seen the earnings
trajectory increase, we did obviously increase the dividend at our board meeting yesterday by 13% to $2.18.
Our buyback program is clearly a function of a number of things. We've already mentioned beta and other reinvestment
opportunities that we see. I mean, as Larry likes to say, it's data dependent, I think he mentioned that earlier. But our
expectation more broadly is that for the year, the buyback program would be greater than the $1 billion that we
repurchased last year. But obviously, we're going to watch markets as they evolve during the year and plan accordingly.
<Q - Robert Andrew Lee>: Great. Thank you. And maybe just a follow-up, and Larry, I know you did mention you've
had some nice wins in the DC space. And this is I guess the inevitable question about money in motion in fixed income,
but where do you think we are in the kind of the DC replacement cycle? I know you had talked about that in the past
given strong performance you guys have had. And how well entrenched or ubiquitous maybe one of your competitors
has been. Do you feel that that's still in the early stages, that 401(k) replacement cycle, or is that kind of well
underway?
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Well, I truly believe the successes we had in 2014 will continue in 2015. The
composition of our successes in fixed income across so many different product, whether it's unconstrained, high yield,
total return, MAI, is a great indication of the breadth of our platform and importantly where we believe continual flows
will be. And DC, specifically, I think we're in the early component of that. We're in dialog with many different defined
contribution platforms.
And I do believe in the DC side, one of the reasons why we have this dialog is our strength in our beta products in fixed
income, our strength in our index equity, our target date products, and because of the large in-depth conversations we
have with our clients, it's giving us a great avenue to help them think about how they're going to be thinking about the
DC business.
As I said, our Total Return product in DC is in the top 3% for 1-year, 3-years and 5-years. So, you come across whether
as I said, target date or other products, we're in a very good position to win our clients' pool of money as that money
remains in motion.
<Q - Robert Andrew Lee>: Great. Thanks for taking my questions, guys.

Your next question comes from Bill Katz with Citi.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Hi, Bill.
<Q - William Raymond Katz>: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Thank you very much for taking the question. Larry,
you went through just a ton of things that are working very well for BlackRock, but one area that seemed to not get that
much attention was active equity. And so I'm curious just stepping back may be for BlackRock and for the industry at
large, where are we in terms of investor appetite for coming back into that type of product versus, as you mentioned
earlier, the barbell dynamic?
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Yes. Well, the one area that I'm having – I had a large amount of dialog most recently
is in factor-based equity investing. That's the biggest most recent type of dialog. So, the one area where we've done
quite well is in the model-based equities and we're still not seeing really any flows. But we have had now five years of
great success there.
I do believe the traditional fundamental equity business is alive. It's not well. It had poor performances in industry and I
think that's what you're alluding to. We have seen great movement as an industry movement out of maybe more the
fundamental investing into index. But I would say now, Bill, if you believe in a greater divergent market, a more
volatile market, I have been asked many times questions related, should I be in an index product with that great
divergence because I can't capture some of the great opportunities that are going to be masked by the great failures. So,
when you think about the energy market and if you think about an emerging market world context, China, India, is
going to be hugely benefited by this. Countries like Russia and Nigeria, potentially Brazil are going to be harmed by
this. How do you play that? And so, this is why more and more of our clients are asking about things about smart beta
factors. And so, I do believe we're going to need to capture different ways of finding alpha.
But importantly, in our actions related to fundamental equities, we've always said this is a five-year project. 2015
begins the third year. We are committed to this. And if you do believe in the world of great divergence, if you believe
in a world that one day you will have – whenever that day will be – higher rates, it generally mean – historically, you
would think this is a better environment for stock picking in fundamental equities. So, our model is purposely built and
positioned to benefit on this active and passive world. But the one thing that I am going to be pretty loud about, I do
believe the most neglected component of equity investing is basically model or factor-based investing where we have a
great platform. We've had great returns, especially overseas. And I am very bullish on building this out as a component
of our active equity area and I'm quite frustrated, to be frank, that we haven't seen the momentum that I would thought
we would. But this is an area where I'm – in my most recent meetings last week in Asia, every client asked me about
factor-based investing in a divergent world. And so, we'll see how this plays out, Bill, but I do believe in this divergent
world and the way we are – built the model of BlackRock we'll be a beneficiary of that.
<Q - William Raymond Katz>: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.

Our last question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank.
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: Hey, Brian.
<Q - Brian B. Bedell>: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Larry, if you can just – Larry or Rob, I
guess, just comment on the inflow situation from the money in motion at PIMCO and other competitors in terms of
your fixed income franchise and do you think a lot of that went into the ETF component and may shift over as those
investors reallocate throughout the year and do you still see that as a "tens of billions" opportunity next year?
<A - Robert S. Kapito>: Yes. So, we see – because of where rates are and the expectation of where rates might go, I
think people are focused on having a higher allocation to fixed income ETFs than they are at the generics. And there is
a lot of money in motion because of people's plans for fixed income and rate views for fixed income this year, and
certainly because some money is flowing from various competitors. And I think that money, because of where rates

are, because of where fees are in general in the asset management business that ETFs will see a larger percentage of
asset management [indiscernible].
<A - Laurence Douglas Fink>: I would just add one thing. There's so much noise about our West Coast friend and
competitor. Much of the money in motion is totally unrelated to what's going on there. I think there is more dialog
going on because of this low-rate environment and how should that be played out. And I think that's the compelling
story. How does an income-oriented investor, whether it's an insurance company, a retiree who is struggling to meet the
income needs of the – this is where we're in much greater dialog. I've had great dialog on where interest rates are and
what does it mean for some of the larger sovereign wealth funds.
So, I think the dialog starts with the macro environment and how to play it. And that is the most forceful reason why
there's so much money in motion. Obviously, you have cyclical changes in one manager versus another, but that's
always evident in the marketplace. And I think there's just way too much commentary related to that, and it's masking
what low rates are doing related to clients' needs.
Operator
Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for questions. Mr. Fink, do you have any closing remarks?
Laurence Douglas Fink
Yes. Let me just touch on one more thing. Our fourth quarter and full year results as I think we have kind of expressed
in our formatted speeches and in the Q&A truly highlight the diversity and the differentiated platform of BlackRock.
And we are seeing the impact of our large-scale investing that we've made over years, and we're continuing to make
those large-scale investing in infrastructure, in equities. We're going to continue to make these investments. And those
investments are going to pay off in the next few years, and I think it's vital to understand that we believe this
differentiated platform is the key component of what has been delivering this type of compounded growth that we have
had on behalf our clients for our shareholders, and I think that will continue.
And most importantly, what I'm proud of, as an organization, we're able to deliver these investments. And I'm not here
to tell you all investments paid off. But we've been able to continue to deliver these investments, and at the same time
as Gary discussed, we saw a consistent increase in our margins over the course of the last five years. I think this is what
differentiates BlackRock, and I'm certainly not suggesting that will continue forever. But I do believe that continual
investment in people. I have to remind people three years ago we had less than 10,000 employees. Today we have
12,000 employees. This is just an investing in our platform, investing in our client connectivity and investing in
products. And in most cases, we're delivering. And this is something that really has given us that differentiated business
model. And I do believe it's going to continue to drive our future at BlackRock.
So, I just want to thank you everyone for taking the time this morning and thank you for your interest in BlackRock.
Have a good quarter and hopefully the next few weeks are going to be little less volatile than the last few weeks, so
enjoy.
