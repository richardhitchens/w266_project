And now, I'd like to introduce the Priceline Group speakers for this afternoon, Jeffery Boyd and Daniel Finnegan. Go
ahead, gentlemen.
Jeffery H. Boyd
Thank you. Welcome to Priceline's first quarter conference call. I'm here with Priceline's CFO, Dan Finnegan. I will
make some opening remarks and Dan will give a detailed financial review. After the prepared portion, we will take
questions.
The Priceline Group reported consolidated gross bookings for the first quarter of approximately $9.2 billion, up 36%
year-over-year. Non-GAAP net income was $297 million or $5.76 per share, up 35% versus prior year. First quarter
results surpassed FactSet consensus estimates of $5.27 per share and our guidance for the quarter. Worldwide hotel
room night reservations were 63.2 million for the quarter, up 38% year-over-year. Our international business recorded
43% gross bookings growth on a local currency basis, consistent with Q4's growth rate. Hotel room night growth rates
in the latter part of the quarter were better than expected as our forecast for deceleration proves conservative.
Growth rates benefited from good results in Europe and continued high growth rates in Asia Pacific and the Americas.
International gross bookings also benefited generally from growth in hotel supply and strong results at rentalcars.com.
Booking.com's platform now has over 295,000 hotels and other accommodations, up 40% over last year.
Booking.com's growth in Europe has held up well despite the weak economic conditions, particularly in southern
countries and negative new cycles relating to the politics of the debt crisis.
Absolute transaction in the local currency growth rates in Europe and non-euro markets were steady on average in Q1
leading to no deceleration in room night growth for the consolidated group, and we believe market share gains.
Booking.com continued its aggressive development of markets outside Europe. These markets continue to grow faster
than the core European markets contributing more to overall growth as they become a larger percentage of the whole
business.
Investment in this effort includes people to build that hotel supply and marketing spend, including Booking.com's
offline marketing experiment in the United States. We are pleased with the results of these efforts to date and with the
resulting levels of room night growth we have sustained over the last year.
Agoda delivered good room night growth in the quarter and is building a leadership position in many of its Asia-Pacific
markets, particular – particularly for Asia-Pacific bookers, with Agoda and Booking.com whose APAC business does
particularly well with international bookers, we believe the group has built a valuable franchise in this part of the world
with attractive prospects as the region grows.
Priceline's domestic gross bookings grew 9% in the first quarter due to growth in domestic rental car reservations as
well as improved hotel room night gross bookings aided by growth in the Express Deals of service. We are pleased
with Priceline.com's progress building Express Deals and the response to its new ad campaign featuring William
Shatner and Kaley Cuoco.
Merchant gross bookings growth of 27% continues to reflect growth at Agoda and Rentalcars.com. Growth in rental car
days increased sequentially from 37% to 43%, driven by strong growth at Rentalcars.com and improved results at
Priceline.com. While the first quarter is seasonally the smallest earnings quarter for Rentalcars.com, the business
continued to perform well as it builds out its international footprint.
We have now received the necessary approvals for the KAYAK transaction and currently expect to close the
transaction on May 21. As we have said before, consistent with our history with Booking.com, Agoda and
Rentalcars.com, KAYAK will be operated independently by current management and we are excited to welcome them
to the group.
The group's business performance exceeded expectations in the quarter. And pressure on operating margins in the first
quarter did not materialize to the degree forecast. As you know, it is difficult to forecast future marketing efficiencies,

given changing business mix and competitive and seasonal factors. However, it is important to keep in mind that this
quarter-to-quarter variability in operating margins is not reflective of any change in our philosophy of building our
business and brands by investing in geographic expansion and supply, product and service innovation, and customer
acquisition or in how we carry out that philosophy.
I want to thank our employees around the world for their hard work and dedication. I will now turn the call over to Dan
for the detailed financial review.
Daniel J. Finnegan
Thanks, Jeff. I'll discuss some of the highlights in operating results and cash flows for the quarter, and then provide
guidance for the second quarter of 2013. Growth rates mentioned in my remarks are in relation to the prior year
comparable period, unless otherwise indicated.
Q1 was a strong quarter from a top-line perspective. Hotel room nights booked grew by 38% in the first quarter,
consistent with the unit growth rate achieved in Q4. Our international business saw solid growth rates in all our key
markets. Our Priceline.com business achieved accelerating retail and opaque room night growth in the quarter. Average
daily rates, or ADRs, for Q1 2013 were up on a local currency basis by about 1% for the consolidated group.
Rental car days booked were up by 43%, accelerating compared to the Q4 growth rate of 37%. Rentalcars.com and
Priceline.com's rental car services both posted strong quarters. For the first quarter compared to the prior year, the FX
rate for the euro to the U.S. dollar was favorable by less than 1%, and the FX rate for the British pound to the U.S.
dollar was unfavorable by about 2%. As a result, currency exchange rates did not have much impact on our
year-over-year growth rates expressed in U.S. dollars for gross bookings, revenue, gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and
net income. In summary, strong unit growth rates drove Q1 gross bookings growth of 36%.
Our Q1 international gross bookings grew by 43% in U.S. dollars and on a local currency basis. Gross bookings grew
by 9% for our Priceline.com brand business in the U.S. Good performance in both retail and opaque reservation
services contributed to year-over-year growth. The acceleration in growth compared to the 4% growth rate for Q4 was
driven primarily by hotel and rental car reservations.
Non-GAAP gross profit for the quarter was $1.03 billion and grew 39% as compared to prior year. GAAP gross profit
for the quarter was $1.01 billion and grew 36% as compared to prior year. GAAP gross profit includes an accrual in Q1
in the amount of $20.5 million for travel transaction taxes, primarily related to unfavorable rulings in the State of
Hawaii and the District of Columbia. Non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP operating income, adjusted EBITDA and
non-GAAP net income are adjusted to exclude the impact of the charge.
Consistent with past practice, we exclude significant charges and credits for judgments, rulings and settlements related
to travel transaction taxes, because the amount and timing of these items are unpredictable, not driven by core operating
results and render comparisons with prior periods less meaningful.
Year-over-year gross profit growth was helped to an extent by Easter falling on March 31 this year, which resulted in
some revenue related to the holiday shifting into Q1.
Non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of non-GAAP gross profit amounted to 35.1% for Q1 compared to
35.8% for the prior year Q1. The operating margin declined by 70 bps compared to prior year, but was better than our
guidance forecast. Margins were impacted mainly by de-leverage in advertising expense. Online advertising grew faster
than gross profit due to lower year-over-year advertising ROIs and the continued mix shift in our business to our
international brands, which drive their business to a greater degree through online advertising. In addition, we continue
to experience faster growth in pay channels for certain of our brands.
We launched our first Booking.com TV advertising campaign in the U.S. in Q1, which also contributed to the pressure
on operating margins versus prior year. On the positive side, operating margins were better than our forecast due to less
online advertising de-leveraged and forecasted and some favorability in other operating expenses.

In addition, the aforementioned shift to some Easter gross profit into Q1 benefited operating margins in Q1 and will
exert pressure on operating margins inQ2, in each case compared to the prior year.
Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 amounted to $368 million, which exceeded our guidance range of $316 million to $346
million and represents 36% growth versus prior year. Non-GAAP net income grew by 35%, including a higher
year-over-year cash tax rate due to growth in our international operations relative to our U.S. business, which has a
lower cash income tax rate due to our U.S. NOL. In terms of cash flow, we generated approximately $183 million of
cash from operations during first quarter of 2013, which is about flat with last year.
We pre-paid income taxes of $224 million in the quarter for Booking.com in return for an early payment cash discount.
We made a similar prepayment last year in the amount of $166 million. These taxes would otherwise have been paid
monthly over the year and so subsequent quarters of the year will have a lower payment burden as a result. We spent
about $15 million on CapEx in the quarter. Our cash and investments of $5.2 billion as of March 31, 2013 is available
for general corporate purposes including share repurchases, acquisitions and debt repayment.
Now, for second quarter 2013 guidance. We are forecasting total gross bookings to grow by 30% to 37% and to grow
on a local currency basis by approximately 27% to 34% with U.S. gross booking growing by 5% to 10%. We expect
international gross bookings expressed in the U.S. dollars to grow by 36% to 43% and to grow on a local currency basis
by approximately 33% to 40%.
Our Q2 forecast assumes that local currency ADRs for the consolidated group will be up less than 1% compared to
prior year. Our Q2 forecast assumes that foreign exchange rates remain at the same $1.32 per euro and $1.56 per
British pound at yesterday's closing rates, which would result in average exchange rates that would be stronger by
about 3% for the euro and weaker by about 3% for the British pound as compared to the prior year.
We have hedge contracts in place to substantially shield our second quarter EBITDA and net earnings from many
fluctuations in the euro or the pound versus the dollar between now and the end of the quarter. But these hedges do not
offset the impact of translation on our gross bookings, revenue, gross profit and operating income and do not hedge our
earnings beyond the second quarter. We expect Q2 revenue to grow year-over-year by approximately 15% to 22% and
gross profit dollars to grow by approximately 26% to 33%.
We expect 400 bps to 500 bps of de-leverage in non-GAAP operating income as a percentage of gross profit compared
to prior year. We assume that margins in Q2 will again be impacted by de-leverage in online advertising expense due to
lower year-over-year ROIs, business mix continuing to shift to our international brands and to pay channels for certain
of our brands. We will also continue our investment in TV advertising in the U.S. market for our Booking.com brand.
Although this spend contributes to the pressure on operating margins in the near-term, we believe that investing in the
growth of our biggest brand in such an important market will yield a healthy return over the long-term. Our forecast
reflects growth in personnel and other expenses as we continue to make the investments necessary to keep up with
current and future growth. As I mentioned a moment ago, Q2 margins compared to prior year are expected to be
slightly impacted by the shift of some Easter gross profit into Q1 in 2013.
Adjusted EBITDA is expected to range between $560 million and $595 million, which at the midpoint represent 17%
growth versus prior year. We are targeting non-GAAP fully diluted EPS of approximately $8.87 to $9.45 per share,
which at the midpoint represent 17% growth over prior year. Our non-GAAP EPS forecast includes an ex – estimated
cash income tax rate of approximately 16% comprised of international income taxes and alternative minimum tax and
state income taxes in the U.S.
Our non-GAAP EPS guidance assumes a fully diluted share count of 51.6 million shares based upon yesterday's
closing stock price of $735.27 per share for the stock. We forecast GAAP EPS of $7.87 to $8.45 per share for Q2. The
difference between our GAAP and non-GAAP results is driven by non-GAAP adjustments that are detailed in our
earnings release. As Jeff mentioned, we received final regulatory approval of the KAYAK acquisition earlier today.
Our guidance for Q2 does not include KAYAK or any related deal costs. We will include KAYAK in our consolidated
results from the expected May 21 closing date forward. We believe that the impact of the KAYAK acquisition on our

non-GAAP EPS for 2013 will be de minimis.
We're pleased by the strong set of unit growth the group has delivered over the last several quarters and that is inherent
in our forecast.
Our guidance reflects our expectation for sequentially decelerating growth rates for a very large business comparing
against high transaction growth rates. We are still concerned about economic conditions on a worldwide basis and in
Europe, in particular.
Our forecast does not assume any material change in macroeconomic conditions in general, and conditions in the
consumer travel market in particular. Given the uncertainty surrounding worldwide economic conditions, particularly
in Europe where much of our business is concentrated, we believe the variability around our guidance is elevated. We
will now take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Eric Sheridan of UBS. Sir, your line is open.
<Q - Eric J. Sheridan>: Thanks, guys. I wanted to talk a little bit about Booking.com in the United States and sort of
early days what you're seeing there from your experience and how you're measuring the return on the advertising
spending in that market and how you think about that type of brand advertising offline on a global basis going forward?
Thank you.
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: Thanks. Eric, we're looking at this as an experiment where our approach will be to very
carefully measure what the impact of the spend is not only on direct business to Booking.com, but in the performance
of the brand and all the other channels in which it advertises aggressively. The, you know, results of that process of
evaluating the data, will take place over the course of the year and how we will proceed afterwards is will be driven by
the data.
Obviously, the group has very substantial experience advertising in the United States on the priceline.com brand and I
think the team here has done a good job of very efficiently using a mix of offline and online to drive brand awareness
and really effective online advertising and that ultimately it's – the goal is to try to demonstrate that the Booking.com
spend offline will have a positive ROI.
But we haven't taken any decisions about that given the sort of stage of the process that we're in, but as Dan and I both
mentioned, we were happy with the results that we've seen in the Booking.com business outside of the core European
market including North America and we're excited to continually experiment.
<Q - Eric J. Sheridan>: Great. Thanks.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Fitzgerald of Jefferies. Your question, please.
<Q - Brian P. Fitzgerald>: Just consistent theme, there is a de-leverage yourselves and other people in the industry are
seeing across the advertising. If you had to hang your hat on, is it impacted more by perhaps Google or other intra
industry competitive pressures, there's more the secular shift into emerging markets and you want to get in front of
branded out there. And so that's a more costly advertising dollar?
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: I know it would be a mistake to try to attribute it to more or less to any one we do. We have a
competitive marketplace and that certainly reflected in competition for clicks and keywords in some of the biggest and
most popular travel markets that we operate in. We have other markets, where there is pressure on hotel average daily

rates, where there is a lot of competition by local players, where your brand may not be as strong and so conversion is
not as strong as it is in other markets where you have been operating for a longer time. So all those things have an
impact as well as the unique competitive behavior of each player in the space who's got their own approach and their
own specific goals that they are trying to accomplish with their marketing spend.
<Q - Brian P. Fitzgerald>: Great. Thanks, Jeff.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Naved Khan of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.
<Q - Naved A. Khan>: Thanks. So, just a couple of questions. First in the U.K., is there any tough comp because of
the Olympics last year? And then I have a follow-up.
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: The – I think the – it's always very difficult to assess the impact positive or negative of an
event like the Olympics or World Cup Soccer. So I think it's fair to say that we haven't, in preparing our guidance,
made any real account for the fact that the Olympics were last year.
<Q - Naved A. Khan>: Okay. Thanks. And then – and just on mobile, can you talk about how your different brands
are performing relative to each other in terms of the full penetration in the mobile channel and basically what you see
out there?
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: I think that our brands are doing a good job in mobile. I think that the level of progress is
different at different brands depending on the markets that they're primarily operating in, in the United States and
Western Europe, in particular. I think we have outstanding apps and mobile functionality, and the share of the business
is being transacted and mobile channels has been growing very steadily and I think compares well to some of the
numbers that have been published out there by others in our space and in similar spaces.
We feel like we're pushing out distinctive functionality that that's attractive to users, and it's still relatively new markets
where we're working very hard to try to figure out what the most efficient distribution methods are and so forth. The
hotel space is typically is first in line here and I think relatively more advanced than the area of the rental car space, and
I don't think that's vastly difference between us and our competition, and obviously, we're primarily focused on the
hotel space because that's our most important market.
<Q - Naved A. Khan>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Heath Terry of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Heath Patrick Terry>: I was wondering if you could give us a sense of where as booking grows outside of
Europe and particularly grows in the U.S., sort of how your macroeconomic exposure is changing because obviously
with booking growing in the U.S. that's still sort of falls under at least as we see it international revenue. Has that
shifted enough that maybe there is a difference in where your real macro exposure lies versus the way things are
presented in the financials?
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: All right, thanks, Heath. Our ultimate goal is to have the broadest possible diversification
of macro with risks which you can have with a truly global business. Our more specific issue over the last couple of
years has been the relatively high concentration of the Booking.com business in Europe as Europe has gone through its
issues concerning sovereign debt. And we have consistently said and shown that the percentage of the business of
Booking.com that is in Europe is shrinking every quarter just because its business outside of that region is growing
faster than Europe business and that condition and circumstance remains true for the first quarter.

I think it's a harder – it's a hard question to say are we therefore exposed to different macroeconomic risks as our
exposure in the United States grows and as a pure statement of fact, the answer to that is, yes, we have greater risk in
the United States as our business in United States grows, but I am much, much happier and I think it's much better for
the business as a whole to have a business that is ultimately as broadly diversified as the travel market that we serve
and I think growing our business in the United States is necessary to accomplish that goal.
<Q - Heath Patrick Terry>: Great. Thanks. And just one other question. With the increase in marketing spending that
we're seeing, we're also seeing an increase in the rate of growth in bookings and wonder to the extent that all of this
focus around de-leverage on the advertising line has been there. Should we continue to expect over time that, that we
do see more of a top-line benefit from these investments being made, even if it's on a delayed basis particularly around
some of the off-line advertising spend like the television campaigns?
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: I mean, Heath, the way I would answer that is, I think that we have gotten a very good
performance from our colleagues who are managing the advertising both online and offline for our brands around the
world. You look at the absolute size of our business, and to date I think what we could fairly describe is pretty modest
deceleration of a very big business. I think the business as a whole is performing very, very well and balancing the
desire to build the franchise and drive high levels of growth on the one hand and deliver operating margin and profit to
shareholders on the other hand.
If we could be criticized for how we are balancing that, I think the only fair criticism would be that we're not spending
enough money and that we're pushing much towards the margin side. I am very comfortable with the balance we are
striking and I am – try to make it clear in my prepared remarks that neither the results that we're reporting, nor what
we're guiding to is representing any change of philosophy on our part, we are, we're current course and speed continue
making the investments that we think will pay off not just in terms of growth today, but in terms of earnings down the
road. And I think we're doing a decent job of striking that balance.
<Q - Heath Patrick Terry>: Great, thanks. Thanks, Dan. Thanks, Jeff.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray. Your question, please.
<Q - Mike J. Olson>: You indicated in your comments that you continue to see economic uncertainty in certain
regions and that could result in variability in results and that makes sense, but would you say that your level of concern
related to economic uncertainty is higher than what it was when you reported Q4 three months ago or is it a level of
uncertainty consistent with what you felt over the last three months. And I guess to add on to that is similarly you have
a Q2 comp for international bookings growth that's significantly easier than Q1. Based on that, other than kind of the
large numbers, what are the reasons that you anticipate a deceleration in international bookings growth for Q2? Thanks.
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: So on the first question, the best way I can answer that is to say that we have been pleasantly
surprised with the resilience of the traveling consumer that we serve really in all our markets through times of
economic uncertainty. Travel is or leisure travel guise and its compelling activity and people are – they are traveling
and booking hotel rooms and rental cars and airline tickets despite some fairly shaky economic circumstances.
I don't think it would be fair to say that I feel differently about that then – or Dan feels differently about that than we
did three months ago. I think it's about the same and the language that we read in the scrip is exactly the same as what
we read three months ago. So I think we feel the same, but we're gratified by the resilience of the traveler worldwide.
With respect to the second quarter comp, we look at the performance of business in the second quarter last year and the
absolute growth rates that we achieved were, in our opinion, pretty impressive. And we also delivered strong operating
margins, which represented an improvement year-over-year. And so we feel like that that's a very solid comp against
which we have to perform this year.
<Q - Mike J. Olson>: All right. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Tom White of Macquarie. Your question please, sir.
<Q - Tom Cauthorn White>: Question, so you guys have talked now about lower advertising ROIs year-over-year for
the past few quarters. Independent of kind of geographic mix, has there been any change in kind of the trajectory of
those ROI declines? Are they worsening? Are they stable? And has there been any significant recent changes to kind of
what goes into that, say, between cancellation rates, the bidding environment or your conversion rates? And then just
quickly, offline advertising, it looks like there's a little over $20 million in incremental spend versus 4Q, is that kind of
the new run rate that we should think about going forward? Thanks.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: The online advertising ROIs, Tom, we didn't call out any significant change in trend there.
Jeff pointed out last year, we had a very strong operating margin, we had decelerating growth rates last year. So that
typically drives favorability in the margin, because you've got check-outs that were booked in prior strong growth
quarters and then deceleration generally ties together with lower spend in that quarter. So I think that's more of a driver
together with – we talked about a little bit of shift of Easter gross profit out of Q2 and into Q1 this year. Those would
be the bigger factors in terms of the margin de-leverage from Q1 to Q2. And in terms of offline advertising, we said
that the run rate would be similar to what you've seen in the past for Priceline and so that would a good guide to look at
there.
<Q - Tom Cauthorn White>: Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Sandler of Deutsche Bank. Your question please.
<Q - Ross A. Sandler>: Thanks, guys. I just had two questions. One I'm going to follow-up from the TV campaign and
then one on search marketing. So on the TV campaign, do you guys have any idea of how Booking.com's brand stacks
up against some of the other brands in Europe from unaided awareness perspective, given that you have chosen not to
do brand building in those markets? And then on the search question, are you testing the new Google enhanced
campaign in any of your markets yet and could this change from Google have any impact on ROIs and what percent of
your transactions are coming from tablet? Thank you.
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: So with respect to the Booking.com brand awareness in Europe and other markets outside the
United States, I don't have that data with me. It's something that we track. And I think Booking.com has done a great
job of building awareness through its online campaigns in Europe and by virtue of the quality of its user experience and
repeat customers.
And I think it's safe to say that the awareness that Booking.com enjoys in Europe, especially in the markets where it's
been operating for a long time is certainly ahead of what it is here in the United States. And the question as to whether
there is an opportunity to take steps to try to further improve that brand awareness is, is something that we continually
think about. But I think we're approaching it in a thoughtful way to use a television market that we are very familiar
with here in United States in a very big homogenous advertising environment where you can just very, very efficiently
get your message out and see what that does as I discussed before.
With respect to Google enhanced campaigns, we typically are very active in advertising in and testing and
experimenting with all of the new opportunities and tools that Google provides to advertisers. I don't have anything
quantitative to say to you about how much that is and whether it's good or bad, but we certainly are working with it and
that's just part of our everyday work with Google.
<Q - Ross A. Sandler>: Thank you.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Thanks. Two questions, please. First, on the rental cars business, I know you probably won't
quantify the contribution, but could you provide anymore color around that business, the economics of that business,
how it compares to some of the other products that you sell or any particular geographic regions where that
rentalcars.com property is doing better?
And then secondly, you recently put out a press release that indicated that mobile will, as a channel be something like
mid-teens of your total bookings. It's a pretty large number. Does that have any material impact one way or another on
your advertising ROI, does it increase – does it mix shift towards the mobile channels, negatively or positively impact
that in any material way? Thank you.
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: Hey, Danny, why don't you do the first one and I'll do the second.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: So on the rental cars business, Mark, we don't disclose a lot of data on that. But what we've
said in the past is that our merchant businesses are typically kind of high-teens margins and rentalcars.com is also a
very healthy margin and a profitable business for us. It's still particularly concentrated in Europe. But the team has done
a great job in expanding the business outside of Europe; they're expanding into U.S., Australia. So they continue to just
expand into additional markets and perform very strongly and grow well within their core European market as well.
And as the business grows as we've seen with our other businesses, typically there is room for margin expansion
together with that, and we're pleased with the margins that the business has delivered to date.
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: And, Mark, with respect to mobile, I'm not sure about the press release that you quoted. But I
think we are – we certainly are driving substantial share of the hotel business in particular through mobile and we're
very excited and pleased by how that's going with respect to the impact on advertising and maybe I can address a
question that Ross also asked that I didn't really cover in my answer to his question.
The search advertising in particular on mobile devices is in its very early days, and I think you've heard from others
that when you look at a tablet as a mobile device, it tends to look an awful lot like a desktop in terms of who is using it,
where and what the experience is. And so we're probably seeing much more integration of search marketing programs
that we're already involved in on tablets today. With respect to the handsets, on the other hand, I think search marketing
is still very much in its early days, like everybody else we're investing in it, but I don't believe that what's going on in
the mobile market right now is in anyway a prime driver of our broad experience in terms of advertising efficiency.
<Q - Mark S. Mahaney>: Thanks, Jeff. Thanks, Dan.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Your question, please.
<Q - Justin Post>: Two questions. First, I don't know if you comment on this, but does your outlook assume any
deceleration in bookings growth or conversion rates on ad spend in the last two months of the quarter, we know it's a
very backend loaded quarter? And then secondly, on cash flow, uses of cash, post KAYAK you're going to have
several billion dollars of cash. Maybe if you could tell us the amount you'll have? And are there some strategic
opportunities that you see, Jeff, looking forward in international markets to kind of deploy that cash over time,
obviously you can't tell us what you're thinking about but do you see opportunities to use that cash or do you think
about returns to shareholders? Thank you.
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: Dan, why don't you answer the first one and I'll answer the second.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: We're not going to parse it month-by-month for you, Justin. We did say that our guidance
does assume sequential deceleration, that's generally been our mindset, it's just – it's a big business, it's posted strong
growth rates in the prior year and so we assume sequential deceleration. We don't talk about what we're seeing in – for
conversion, so we didn't give any guidance there and I can't really help you further with that other than we gave you the
broad advertising efficiency guidance.

<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: And with respect to cash use, we do believe that there will be opportunities in the future to
deploy our cash and our international cash in particular either through investing in the business and growing the
business or in acquisitions and as you mentioned, I can't get specific with that, but we do believe there are attractive
businesses out there. We've been reasonably acquisitive as a company. We haven't done a ton of them, but we're always
very active in the market. And with respect to other uses of cash as we've said before, we've been buyers of our
common stock and repurchase from time-to-time. We have an authorization outstanding that is a matter of public
record and that will continue to be the case that that's something we evaluate from time-to-time.
<Q - Justin Post>: I appreciate it.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Ron Josey of JMP Securities. Your line is open.
<Q - Ron Victor Josey>: Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to switch topics a little bit, and talk a little about
Asia and South America, particularly as we exited summer travel months in those geographies. And I'm wondering if
you can talk a little bit about maybe what you saw this past summer season down there versus the prior year maybe in
terms of like share gains and growth? Thank you.
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: So I think those markets continue to be very, very attractive markets as Internet penetration
grows and as they benefit from fundamental economic growth and gaining affluence. Couple of comments, I think we
did well in both markets based on the data available to us in terms of market share, we're comfortable with how we're
proceeding. There are a couple of specific challenges in those markets that we and I think everybody else has to deal
with in Asia Pacific. It's a very, very competitive market. And as we've said in previous calls, the absolute economics in
terms of the pricing of hotels and the competition down there makes it potentially more expensive to build your brand
and we're happy and prepared to bear that expense, but that's definitely a condition in the marketplace. But as I've said
in my prepared remarks, I think between Agoda and Booking.com we're building an outstanding franchise in that
region.
And with respect to South America, there are unique operational issues that are brought to bear there particularly in
Argentina, where the government policy is very, very disruptive to international businesses, makes it very, very
difficult to bring people into the country to help build your business. Obviously, it makes it very difficult to repatriate
earnings. It's just a very challenging environment for businesses in Argentina and, and that's something that we all have
to deal with. Having said that, we are working very hard to build our business there, we have a very natural position
from which to build because so many customers both in Europe and in North America who will have logical links and
travel to South America and that's a great footprint from which we can build to go in there with really great market
share of international travelers who are in the region and I think that's been an advantage for us, but those operational
challenges are there.
<Q - Ron Victor Josey>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Devitt of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
<Q - Scott W. Devitt>: Yeah. I was wondering, Jeff, if you could talk about the – any greater competition from
Expedia that you're seeing as it relates to the agency program they have launched in Europe and any affect that could be
having on CPCs in Europe?
And then secondly, I think you referenced multiple times on the call to strengthen the rental cars business and Expedia
had noted some weakness due to supply constraints. I'm wondering if you had any view on the differences there and
your business versus what they experienced in the quarter. Thank you.

<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: For, Scott, on the competition question, Expedia is a very strong company and they have been
competing very aggressively against us for quite some time. Their agency program dates back to the acquisition of
Venere which is many years ago now. So we think we have been doing a decent job in the face of very robust
competition from Expedia.
With respect to Expedia Traveler Preference, the – that program even though they've been at it for a while in terms of
hotels that are fully involved in it. It's still a pretty small number. So they've got a lot of hotels that are providing
agency, but the number there providing both and offered on a combined basis is still relatively small compared to
295,000 hotels that Booking.com is operating with.
We have experience with that product here in the United States, because we offer it on priceline.com. We think we
understand how it works and we're comfortable that we've got the product and the service to compete very effectively
with that going forward.
I can't answer the question as to whether that particular programs have any impact – having any impact on how they are
behaving in online marketplaces. Even if – we don't know that, it just can't ascertain that based on the data that we have
in the marketplace.
With respect to rental cars, we're operating a different business from Expedia Rentalcars.com is a little bit of different
animals than Expedia or Hotwire, although I do know that Expedia owns Carrentals.com, but I think that the market
footprint of Rentalcars.com is quite different and has been on a very nice consistent growth path since we acquired
them and we are happy with what we're seeing there.
With respect to the domestic rental car market, we've had good results in the quarter, as Dan mentioned, for domestic
rental car and we can really only speak for ourselves and what we're seeing, but we did – we had a good quarter. The
performance of the domestic rental car business actually improved sequentially and we were pleased with what we saw.

Thank you. Our next question comes from Douglas Anmuth of JPMorgan. Your question, please.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Quick question, I just wanted to ask at a high level how you would think going forward
about the margin compression once you start to lap your increased levels of spending? Thanks.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: Well. Doug, Jeff said, I think, in our last call and I'll say it again. Just mathematically as we
start to comp against Q3 and Q4 where our ROIs were under pressure and we saw our margins coming down
year-over-year. That will provide an easier comp. So we're not going to give guidance beyond this one quarter but just
from a mathematical perspective, that's clearly an easier comp for us.
<Q - Douglas T. Anmuth>: Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Sena of Evercore Partners. Your line is open.
<Q - Ken Sena>: Hi. Thanks. Jeff, in your prepared remarks, you talked about room night growth and you believe that
you were gaining shares. And I was just wondering if you can provide a little bit more about your confidence in that?
And also any specific territories where that might be happening more than others? Thank you.
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: Our share gain comment is based on best information we have at the highest level. We see the
absolute growth rates that our competition is reporting, and we see our growth rates being higher and at the very
highest level, we say, okay, we probably took some share there. Our folks out in the field have their own data. But we

Thank you. Our next question comes from Aaron Kessler of Raymond James. Your line is open.
<Q - Aaron M. Kessler>: Yes. Hi, guys. A couple of questions. First, can you comment a little more just on the
Express Deals? It looks like you may be pushing that a little more on your site, just may how you view that versus kind
of Name Your Own Price going forward? And just in Europe, maybe just curious, your thoughts maybe on the vacation
rental market, how your – how you view that market and that it looks like you may be going downstream to more a bed
and breakfast to add more inventories that way. Thank you.
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: So why not? Dan, I'll hit the Express Deals question, and you can talk about the vacation
rentals? So we have definitely worked hard to find the optimal way to promote Express Deals on the website. And that
is a function of sort of continuous experimentation to see what gives us the best conversion. We have a fabulous group
of really loyal Name Your Own Price customers who want to use that product, who are comfortable with it, who feel
they can find the best savings and we want to make it as easy as possible for them to find, what they want to. So we've
got a very strong desire to serve our Name Your Own Price loyalists, but we also want to make sure that a new
customer coming into the website understands where to find Express Deals, and that's especially the case for somebody
who may not be comfortable bidding. So it's really – it's a process of experimentation and what you see today is going
to be different a month from now. And hopefully, we'll be engaged in a process where we're just constantly making that
presentation better and more engaging for the consumer.
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: And in terms of vacation rentals, Booking.com has done a great job over the last few years
of – it changed our language a little bit. We used to talk about hotel count and now we talk about hotel and other
accommodations. So they've been fanning out and padding bread and breakfast in hostels and guest apartments to the
website. And our hope over time is that we would continue to add all types of properties that our customers are
interested in staying in, and can be booked over the Internet. So I think we'll continue down that path and they've done
a great job till now.
<Q - Aaron M. Kessler>: Great. Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Stephen Ju>: Jeff, interested in what you said earlier about not spending enough. Do you feel like the markets
globally are ripe enough that you might be walking away from some of your long-term growth potential but not
grabbing land fast enough?
And Dan, I think you said in your prepared remarks that you paid $224 million in taxes for Booking.com versus $166
million last year. So if I'm doing my math correctly, it's implying an FX impact at 35% growth rate, and operating
profit dollars assuming no material change to tax rate. So this implies about north of 40% on an FX-neutral basis for
Booking.com, is it somewhere in the ballpark? Thanks.
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: So I'll let Danny answer the cash flow question, why don't you do that first?
<A - Daniel J. Finnegan>: I wouldn't necessarily assume that, Stephen. So the amount that we pay is subject to what
the tax authorities ask us to pay. The growth in the amount certainly is because the business is growing and the tax
liability for the year will grow. But you can't – it's not that clear-cut that you can draw that relationship.

<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: And with respect to the comment on not spending enough, as I've tried to – try to say, I think
we are trying to strike the right balance here. And certainly, the opportunity that, that we have in front of us especially
in a lot of the new markets where we are spending is just so attractive that I think it would be a mistake for us not to go
at that aggressively or to be timid about it because we are worried about a few basis points of margin de-leverage. And
so I think we're doing a good job of striking the right balance. So I think if you look at our growth numbers and how we
are performing vis-à-vis share against the other players in the space who by the way are also investing aggressively to
try to penetrate these markets. I think it's demonstrative of us doing a decent job of striking that balance.
<Q - Stephen Ju>: Okay, thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Lennan of Monness, Crespi. Your line is open.
<Q - Bill J. Lennan>: Thank you. On the margin compression topic, which seems to be top of mind for everybody. We
talk a lot about the cost side and efficiencies, a little discussion about pricing. So if you talk to hotels, you talk to a 100
and it's a small sample size for what you've signed, but there is a perception that there is a gap between what you
charge and what your biggest competitors charge. So I have just a couple of questions on that. One, what is your price –
how is your pricing behaved over the last year or so on an apples-to-apples basis? Are you taking it up at all? And two,
if you did choose to raise price, how would you assess your pricing power, specifically if you told a typical hotel we are
taking you from X to X plus 2%, what would their alternatives be, where would they go?
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: I think the short answer to that is to we are not looking to try to drive higher margin through
increasing cost to hoteliers. That is not part of our strategy at this time. I think it is true that some other players in the
space charge hotels more. When that's the case, we'd like to take advantage of that disparity so that we can compete
aggressively for availability and rooms at times of high occupancy. If – we have significant market share and I think
with that comes a responsibility to be good partners with our hotels and I don't think it would be consistent with that to
think that it would be a great idea for us to do some sort of across the board price increase just because we were
worried about our margins coming down a couple hundred 100 basis points.
<Q - Bill J. Lennan>: Then on more cost, if I might. Also we focused a lot on online advertising, which of course is a
huge piece of it. But I wonder, if in aggregate some of smaller costs, I'm just wondering how they are behaving? I'm
thinking what you pay people occupancy? What's the upward pressure on those costs or your opportunity to realize
some margin from, say, not the top five costs, but cost number five through 20 in the bucket?
<A - Jeffery H. Boyd>: I think we've done a pretty good job over the last number of years in scaling versus our
non-advertising costs. We have had quarters where the non-advertising operating costs go up a little bit, because we
need to staff up in advance of high season growth, customer service requirements, aggressive hotel supply, goals that
we've set for the teams and we're prepared to do that, but over the long-term, those costs have scaled nicely for us and
should scale nicely in the future. The very substantial part of that is, its personnel and we think that to the extent that
we're going to be looking for scale there it's not going to be by trying to put pressure on compensation to our
colleagues. I think we have the best people, we want to have the best people and we want to pay them well. So it's
really more about efficiency and how you do your business.
<Q - Bill J. Lennan>: Okay. Thank you.

Thank you. And our final question for the evening comes from Kevin Kopelman of Cowen. Your line is open, sir.

percentage point currency benefit on bookings growth in Q2. Are you expecting a similar currency impact on gross
