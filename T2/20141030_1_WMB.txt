In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This
disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation
materials are various non-GAAP measures that we've reconciled to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those
reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials.
So, with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.
Alan S. Armstrong
Great. Good morning. And thank you, John. Thanks, everybody, for joining us today. As usual, we have got a lot going
on as we continue to pursue this tremendous growth that our strategy continues to deliver.
We are coming off a quarter here that was in line with our expectations, but much lower at WPZ due to Geismar's
extended outage and a continued heavy capital investing period, all as was expected. But certainly we're looking
forward to a much better quarter coming here in the fourth quarter, as some of our major projects start to come online
and we see some dramatic improvements in volumes in the Northeast.
A major change is afoot as we combine both WPZ and Access into the large-scale natural gas infrastructure MLP. The
team here at WPZ is very energized right now, as we're on the verge of a major $1 billion boost in our annual cash
flows that we expect to come from three major projects, Geismar, Gulfstar and the Keathley Canyon Connector, all
which have reached the commissioning stage here in the fourth quarter. We also are very excited to see volumes and
profits beginning to rapidly escalate in the Northeast operating area, as many projects have been commissioned here in
October, and I'll provide a little more detail on that later.
The Access team continues its great performance as we have all come to appreciate this team's ability to steadily grow
its volumes and cash flows, as it connects gas supplies in some of the most prolific basins in the U.S. And we also are
continuing to see major potential Transco projects coming our way as a result of Transco's competitive advantages.
These new prospective projects include the Appalachian Connector and the Diamond East projects. Both are major new
projects that connect the burgeoning supplies from the Marcellus and Utica directly to growing demand on Transco that
is anxious to see the supplies coming their way, as those markets strive to grow as well.
And of course, we continue to have a long stream of projects that are under construction that will keep this
well-identified fee-based cash flows continuing to grow throughout our guidance period and beyond.
The major changes that will be occurring within the new merged partnership are exciting in many ways. First, we will
have the highest forecasted distribution growth rate of any of the major MLPs. Second, our coverage will be above
average for the same peer group with an expected $1.1 billion of excess cash flow coverage through 2017. And the
Access cash flows along with our major new fee-based projects continue to dramatically reduce exposure to commodity
prices.
The Access LP holders are about to see a 50% step-up in distributions to $3.65 in 2015 versus the forecasted $2.42 per
LP in 2014. So, truly, a very exciting time here as we merge these MLPs and really turn this into the MLP and the
major integrated group, and particularly one that's well-positioned, as we've talked about before, with a strategy that is
so focused on natural gas.
So there are many changes occurring as these major tailwinds form, and this first big tranche of capital finally begins to
bear fruit in a very game-changing manner against the traditional WPZ assets. But what has not changed is our
commitment to a strategy that we strongly believe will be the most enduring growth model amongst the infrastructure
MLPs.
We've worked in a very disciplined manner to have this strategy of connecting the very best natural gas supplies to the
very best natural gas markets at the center of all of our portfolio and capital allocation decisions. So we continue to
stick with the strategy that we're very proud of and we think has positioned us for a great long-term growth.

The strong and undeniable fundamentals of low-cost clean energy and the cheapest petrochemical feedstocks in the
world will prevail, we believe, and we are seeing the demand pool beginning. We've continued to position ourselves in
a way that will catch this very sustainable and fundamentally supported wave of volume growth and, at the same time,
help our customer base achieve their lofty goals of growth as well.
We appreciate all the support and patience from our investor base, as we've had some bumps and bruises along the way
getting to this as we pursue this very ambitious plan. And we are thrilled that many of you are well-positioned to catch
this next big wave of valuation growth at both WMB and at the partnership level.
So, now, let me quickly point out a few things in the prepared slide deck here beginning on page 2. You can see here
just an overview of what we'll hit on today, most of which I've touched on already. So let's move on to slide 3.
On slide 3, as I mentioned in the opening, WPZ's DCF was low, but was in line with our expectations. Major drivers of
the lower DCF was a missed opportunity on Geismar of over $200 million. So, that's the number, if we would have
been up and running, that we predict here in the third quarter. And higher maintenance capital, as expected, and was
forecasted for the quarter.
So this is really the time of the year that a lot of our maintenance capital gets done. As you know, we had
lower-than-expected maintenance capital for the first half of the year and we started to catch-up with that, as we usually
do during the third quarter.
Also, we had some outages in Canada, particularly from some Suncor outages. And we also had a planned turnaround
at our Redwater facility, where we made a lot of the significant tie-ins for our CNRL Horizon project, which lowered
volumes there in our Canadian assets as well.
Also, we had slightly lower than last year adjusted segment profit plus DD&A was just off of last year. This was driven
by lower NGL margins and this was really driven as the result of a loss of the keep-whole processing contract up at our
Opal facility. And thankfully, though, this was largely offset by about $36 million in higher fee-based revenues in the
quarter on our consolidated assets and operated assets.
And we got the same kind of very positive move in our equity investments in both Discovery and Laurel Mountain
Midstream. You should really continue to expect a lot of great things coming from these equity investments across the
board, really, here in the fourth quarter.
Blue Racer Midstream is continuing to see great Utica volume growth. Our Discovery system gets the Keathley
Canyon Connector started up. And the Laurel Mountain Midstream benefits from our increased ownership, which has
now moved up to 69% versus 51% in the third quarter.
Also, as you can see on this slide, ACMP's adjusted DCF was up by an impressive 42%, driven by 20% higher
fee-based revenues. And so this all combined for WMB, these partnership holdings now produced a segment profit plus
DD&A of $838 million, which was 36% higher than the third quarter of 2013. So, really starting to see some great
distributions out of PZ as always and now an increasing amount coming from Access.
Moving on to slide 4, you can see some of the operational highlights here for ACMP, and starting with a big milestone
of 6 Bcf a day of gross gathering volumes, which the team hit in September, and also ACMP's 49% interest ownership
in UEO continues to increase in importance.
And this really well-placed infrastructure that's referred to as UEO is serving the rich Utica volumes, and the volumes
continue to expand rapidly up there. And now two new trains planned. One planned to start up later this year and one
planned to start up at the end of next year. And also, great work by our Access teams getting the Bucking Horse plant
started up in Niobrara. That's planned for later this year.
And I'm really proud to see the way our Williams and Access teams are working together. As you know, we have very
substantial processing operations at Williams in Wyoming and very thankful to see our teams working so well together
to help bring up the Bucking Horse plant up there to serve the Niobrara.

So, overall, net volumes on ACMP are up 9%. And as you can see where the high performers are in this list that drove
that growth, with of course the Utica being the star of that.
Moving on to slide 5, looking forward a little more now. And we expect to see the fruits of Williams' major capital
projects really starting to kick-in here in the fourth quarter of 2014 and in a very powerful way in 2015. In fact, these
three projects alone are expected to produce nearly $1 billion in 2015 cash flows. And to put this in perspective, these
three projects should drive a 33% improvement over WPZ's expected segment profit plus DD&A for 2014 and during
2015. So, huge driver coming from these three big projects.
And we'll also have an even larger impact on DCF because a lot of the financing, of course – the financing costs have
been carried for a large portion of 2014 on these projects, as these have been very long-dated capital projects, and these
assets have had really very little – they've had very little planned maintenance capital for 2015. So, a huge driver of
DCF in 2015 as well.
We also have several other recent milestones and achievements listed. All of these would normally be big deals, but we
have so many developments, it really is getting hard to give them all their due bandwidth. But just to provide some
details on a few of these items, the Geismar rebuild and expansion project is complete and we have begun to bring
hydrocarbons into the plant this week and start-up operations, including the final dry-outs of the primary systems. And
then, once those dry-outs are completed, the actual cracking processes will be initiated later.
I certainly want to just take a moment and thank our team there at Geismar for their intense focus on doing this project
safely. It's been a very large and complex project and they've remained very focused on, no matter how much the
pressure is, to remain safe and keep that first and foremost. And I'm thankful for both their leadership and our
management there at Geismar for keeping that front and center.
On Gulfstar, we are complete with our work, and Hess is now running the spar. They announced yesterday that they
plan to have first oil within the week. And this project team also achieved first quartile safety performance on that
project. Tremendous effort to bring so many different skill sets and capabilities together to get that project delivered.
And we're very thankful to be getting to work with Hess and Chevron on delivery of this major asset as well.
And then the Keathley Canyon Connector has been fully hydro-tested and is now in the dewatering mode. Anadarko
will control the timing of this first production, which they and we still expect later this quarter.
Our Constitution project reached a major milestone last week, and this was the receipt of the final environmental
impact statement for this project from the FERC. And this gives the Commission the green light to approve the project
as designed, and we are pushing for a November order from the Commission. And of course, they certainly understand
how important it is to get this project up and moving so that we can reduce some of the bottlenecks and constraints of
getting gas supplies up into the New England states for the winter of 2015 and 2016.
Our Transco team has just continued to knock it out of the park in the areas of business development. And we had two
very successful open seasons in the period. And we continue to string together both important base hits, which we just
continue to have a number of laterals and expansions off the systems, and the occasional grand slam, like the Atlantic
Connector project that is significantly larger than even the massive Atlantic Sunrise project. And I'll hit on that a little
bit more in a minute.
On slide 6, you can see the continuing list of projects that we continue to click off on the left. And on the right,
potential projects are being added so quickly, it's really getting hard to keep this slide up-to-date.
You'll note that we had to move the Rockaway Lateral into the first quarter of 2015 due to some construction
environment's difficulty that we faced there. However, even more offsetting this, we expect to place portions of the
Leidy Southeast and the Virginia Southside project into service earlier than planned. So, great job there of the team
continuing to be innovative in ways to bring some of those projects on earlier where the environment allows us to do
so.
We also expect to be able to move our Canadian PDH project into the firm category later this month. We'll still have a
few contingencies related to third parties on that, but we will have our feed study completed for PDH 1, and we'll be

going for final board approval here in November. So, great progress being made on moving those projects along as
well.
On slide 7, we're going to provide some detail now here on the really exciting Appalachian Connector project. And
we're not disclosing the actual capital on this project at this point, but we do expect this to be at least 50% larger than
our Atlantic Sunrise project, so very large-scale project.
It involves a major greenfield line that you can see coming out of the panhandle of West Virginia – the northern
panhandle of West Virginia, down into a connection there in Virginia, and then a major expansion along the system to
be able to move those supplies into the various markets, both to the north and to the south, actually all the way to
station 65, which is Zone 3 on Transco. And, of course, from station 65, you have access to both growing industrial
markets as well as access to many of the expanding LNG facilities in the area. So, really, that is coming together. And
that really helps us be the supplier for the LNG projects that are being developed along the coast as well on Transco.
So the support from these shippers has really been tremendous, as this is one of the few projects that delivers gas to the
actual markets. And so this really gives an ability to a producer or a supplier to really go get the highest price because
they have so many options of where they can sell their gas, and they can really go to the highest bidder for their gas by
having so many multiple market options along the Transco system. Really, this is a tremendous value proposition to
have all these – the direct access to all these growing markets on Transco, not just existing, but really growing markets.
And we also are excited to see the confidence that the producers behind our Ohio Valley Midstream system and our
investment in Blue Racer, the great confidence we're seeing from producers there in growing their volumes out on the
system as well.
And so that connection that we like to really stress about being able to connect the very best supplies to the very best
market outlets, this is just another great example of that. Of course, you saw that with Atlantic Sunrise coming out of
the Susquehanna County area, and now we're able to basically do that in the same way coming out of the Southwestern
Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Southeastern Ohio area.
So, our gathering business really benefits from this, because it has now – would have the best market outlets out of the
area. And of course, our market end customers get access to these great prolific upstream supplies. So, really, a
win-win-win and really shows the strength of our strategy.
Moving on to slide eight here, really exciting drivers for getting the merged MLP into the very, very strong and
offensive posture, and getting our 2015 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $5 billion, as I mentioned earlier, a 50%
move up in the distribution for ACMP unitholders from the 2014 guidance and a 30% increase over the 2015
distribution guidance.
So, we will have the best-in-class distribution growth at 10% to 12% through 2017 and with a very strong coverage
ratio at or above 1.1x and about $1.1 billion of excess cash flow through 2017 that we expect to generate off of this
strong business growth. We also will enjoy strong investment-grade credit ratings and very limited equity needs up
against this current business plan, because our cash flows continue to grow, continue to expand our debt capacity very
rapidly.
So, really, excited about how we've got this merged MLP positioned. It is strong from a strategy standpoint. It's very
strong from a capability standpoint and now financially extremely well positioned for the environment that we're in.
Just to talk very quickly about a few of the synergies that we're seeing, one of the things we're really excited about is
really looking for the very best capabilities exist between the two companies. One of the areas that we're really seizing
on very quickly is Access's well-honed modular compression design. And so, we are looking at that to be a major
savings for Williams here as we look to see the cost and the scale, frankly, that we gain by having all of the
compression, installation that both parties do and being able to really be the low-cost provider of getting into field in a
very quick way that serves our customers. So, great capabilities there by Access that Williams is very rapidly adopting.
Likewise, up at the Bucking Horse Plant, as I mentioned earlier, Williams, of course, has great strength in the
operations of processing facilities, and we're very rapidly bringing those alongside Access and helping them get that

plant up in a safe and reliable manner.
And then, one other area that, I think, is really impressive for us is the Access North Victory system that lies just to the
north and east of our OVM system, is going to be the beneficiary of – provided that the transaction goes through, of
Southwestern Energy's acquisition of Marcellus acreage in that area. And we think that bodes very well in terms of
having a new buyer in the area that's very excited about that acreage and has got the capital to bring to that. And of
course, that system ties into our OVM system and, ultimately, then would have access into the great Appalachian
Connector Project. So, great example of how we're stringing together the synergies of our assets up there.
Moving on to slide nine, this is really impressive picture of valuation here at the new merged MLP. And so, what you
have here is regression analysis between the distribution growth rates. And so, we've got the merged MLP here marked
at 11% and then on the Y-axis you see the current yield. And of course, this shows that on a regression analysis basis
that the merged MLP should ultimately trade out at a sub-4% yield. Even at that yield then, you would see – on this
line, you would see a $94 unit price for the merged MLP.
And frankly, we think, given the coverage ratio, which is just above the average for this group, the strong credit rating
that we have and the tremendous strategy and clear line of growth, we think we actually ought to be trading below this
line on the regression analysis.
So, really excited to see this valuation coming through, and we think the market is waiting to see some of these things
like Geismar and Gulfstar get done and those start to cash flow. And so, we think we're just on the verge of realizing
this kind of value at our MLP.
Moving on to slide 10, a tremendous opportunity here with Williams. We just couldn't be better positioned right now.
Very excited to have delivered a 32% raise in our WMB dividend and following that with a 15% dividend growth rate
through 2017. So, tremendous value that we're able to deliver for our shareholders.
And I don't think anybody doubts the amount of growth that we have out in front of us. And I do think, obviously,
there's been concerns over our ability to execute and bring some of these major projects online and we're just on the
verge of passing that stage. And then, we continue to have a number of very large-scale projects going forward.
Also, very excited to see the very strong capabilities of Access and Williams coming together from a leadership
perspective and from an operating capability standpoint. Very solid alignment, I would tell you, between the values of
both of these companies. And I want to take a moment and thank Mike Stice for his tremendous leadership at building
such a great organization with great values.
And we're just very thrilled to be able to be working up alongside Access and taking some of the best ideas that they
have to offer and bringing those in to Williams and as well excited to have the new team there at Access, all pulling on
the same rope.
So, with that, we'll turn it over to questions. Thank you.

Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go to our first question, Shneur Gershuni with UBS.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Good to see the progress that you've made with respect to coming to an end and putting
forward the Geismar project and in closing up the merger. I was wondering if we can sort of transition on some
questions more on a go-forward basis. With the merged ACMP/WPZ combination, you've sort of mentioned in the past
about a high percentage of EBITDA coming from fee-based source of revenue. When you think about the 2015
guidance, can you share with us some of the sensitivities around NGLs and ethylene margin that you have baked in, in
terms of both the low and the high end of guidance in terms of how we should be thinking about the commodity
environment that we're currently in?

<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Shneur, this is Don. Good morning. The combined MLP will be more than 80% fee based
since all of the Access business is in fact fee based and much of it under cost of service or MVCs. There's really no
direct commodity exposure there. So, I think you can look solely at the Williams. And if you look in our Data Book on
slide 85, you can see the sensitivity of the price changes on commodities. Again, I think we're fairly diversified on the
commodity front. And again, it will represent less than 20% in 2015 and that percentage will likely continue to
decrease as we grow the fee-based business much more rapidly than the commodity side of the business.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Great. And as a follow-up, I recognize the fact that you're expecting about $1 billion of
cash flows to be coming in with some of the new projects slated to come online late this year. How do you think of
your leverage and funding needs for the next several years as you sort of think about the big capital projects and so
forth? Is the expectation to fund it kind of on a 50/50 debt equity basis? I was just wondering if you can give us a little
bit of color on, I guess, how you think of your current leverage [indiscernible] (29:47).
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Shneur, we would expect the merged partnership to maintain its kind of mid-BBB – Baa2
investment-grade ratings. And to do that, we'll typically be somewhere around 4 times debt-to-EBITDA on a rating
agency-adjusted basis. So, I think that will be the guidepost. We think the business plan that we've put forth with the $5
billion of EBITDA and the 10% to 12% growth rate through our guidance period that ends in 2017 can be financed
with a very modest amount of equity.
Obviously, we have many more opportunities in front of us. Alan highlighted a couple of major ones. I would point out
that those are fairly long lead-time items. So, something like the pipelines that Alan mentioned with kind of in-service
dates, the financing for those is really out principally in 2017 and 2018.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Great. And finally on the Constitution Pipeline, if I saw correctly you've requested to get
the final sign-off within the next 30 days or so. If it takes longer than 30 days, does that delay the project due to
weather issues and tests and so forth? And also, I was wondering if you can comment about whether you think the
length of the pipeline itself will deviate much from the current plan?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Rory, would you please take that?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Yeah. Sure. Well, the timeline right now, as it sits, is very tight. We are hoping to get the
FERC certificate on for Constitution in November. If that happens, then we'll be looking for notice of completion from
the New York DEC along that same timeline. And it is a very tight schedule. But if we get the kind of responses that
we're hoping for and we think are possible, then we can still make the heating season of 2015-2016. We do have some
major delays, we have multi-month delays, then that heating season won't be possible. So, there is a chance that we
could get pushed beyond that. But we're trying to be very clear with everyone involved, I think, the need for the gas is
definitely there. We saw that with the Polar Vortex last heating season. And I think we're just trying to get the message
out to let people know what's at stake. And it is going to take some cooperation, but we think we've got a good shot at
it.
<Q - Shneur Z. Gershuni>: Great. Thank you very much, guys.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Thank you.

the rigs are going to go. But can you give us an idea of how much undedicated acreage is up for grab – that is up for
grabs overlaps with your footprint? And then you kind of mentioned this in your prepared remarks, but given ACMP at
one point was Chesapeake's MLP, are there opportunities for you guys to process the gas that ACMP has the
dedications for on the gathering side or is that already committed to other players? Can you just give some more color
on your synergies there?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Sure, Christine. We can't provide you the detail you're looking for there today. I would just
tell you that there is a very substantial amount of gas that is available for processing from Chesapeake and potentially
now Southwestern. And so, I would just tell you there is a lot of acreage there that needs processing – some gathering
and processing services. And I would just say that we're very well positioned for both of those.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay. All right. With the recent correction in the market, we saw a number of deals get
announced and, obviously, access to capital markets is pretty key in this space. And we just had a brief scare that
maybe non-investment-grade MLPs might have trouble raising capital. And if we see some more of these big
companies spinning out MLPs with multi-billion-dollar backlogs as drop-downs they could do, I would think some of
these private equity players that were hoping to monetize their midstream investments maybe via IPO might have
trouble competing with something like that. Has sentiment of potential sellers changed from where you sit? Can you
kind of give us an idea of what you're seeing on the M&A front?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: I would say that it's varied. Obviously, some of the smart money, I would call it, decided to
take some risk off the table of that early and get out while the getting was good. And I would say that that sentiment's
probably becoming more pronounced. I agree with your – the concern you raise. And I do think that we'll see some
movement in that direction, because I don't think anybody wants to be left being the guy that was too greedy waiting
for any more increase. I think people appreciate that the market's pretty hot. And so, I do think we'll continue to see a
lot of assets coming out of the private equity sector into the market. And I think they'll start to appreciate how much
quality IPO there is that has some pretty major advantages over less-substantial offerings.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay. And then, I guess, kind of piggybacking off your response to that, I think you guys are
now sitting on an option to enter into the Permian. Deal size isn't too big, multiple looks attractive, although you
probably have to spend a couple hundred million to get there. You have the parent of a potential partner as a producer
behind this system. However, you've previously said that you would like to be number one or number two in a basin.
Are there any initial thoughts you can provide us, and is this an area that you would be interested in growing into?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. Christine, thanks for the question. We're not going to respond on exactly our
position on that. We're just not at liberty right now to discuss that. However, I would say that we've been looking at the
Permian from a business development standpoint, particularly the Delaware Basin for quite some time. And I would
say we have a lot of – from a Williams' side, we've had a lot of producing customers that are customers elsewhere that
have been interested in us providing services in the area where there is not much infrastructure. And certainly, we're not
interested in going into areas that are already well-served.
But I would tell you there is a lot of that basin that is not well-served and we have been looking at it that. And I would
say we would like to enter it in a way that; one, it's well-supported from a financial perspective; and two, that
ultimately we get to a scale position that has competitive advantages. And provided that we can accomplish both of
those tasks, then yes we would be interested in entering the basin. But those are two pretty lofty goals in terms of
making sure that the cash flows are well supported and that we have a clear line of sight on gaining scale and
competitive advantage the way we usually enjoy in a basin.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay. And then, last question for me. Appreciate all the color. One of the competing pipes for
your Appalachian Connector project recently announced it was moving forward at least to Station 165. Is there a room
for both projects, or do you think yours is different enough, because it provides a clear route to Station 65? And then
when you also say it's 50% more than Atlantic Sunrise, do you mean 50% of what the CapEx is for the 100% interest or
just your interest?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: On a gross basis, it's 50% more as well.

<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: So, you can use either number, because we said more than, but even more than a gross
amount. In terms of the advantages of that project, I think it is almost two different projects, frankly, because I'll tell
you the strength of the Appalachian Connector project is that it does not just get you to Station 65, it allows you to go
directly to those LDC interconnects, directly to the town borders, directly to those markets. And so, rather than sitting
at a pooling point and being stuck with gas that you've already paid a rate to get there, you don't really have any
options, but to sell it, at that point, you can go to multiple markets and you can go cut deals with people who want to
have growing supplies on their system.
So, I would just tell you that is distinction. It's very major distinction. And as to whether there is room for both, I would
just say that I think our shippers are speaking for themselves, can't really speak for the other project. But I would just
say, given the way the response we've gotten from the shippers that are interested in our project, that would tell me
there is room for two, I guess, if the other project has economic support as well.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Is the shippers for you guys mostly producers?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: It's a mix, pretty substantial mix, just like we've seen on our other big projects like this.
<Q - Christine Cho>: Okay. Thank you so much for your time.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Thanks, Christine.

And we'll now go to Abhi Rajendran with Credit Suisse.
<Q - Abhiram Rajendran>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning, Abhi.
<Q - Abhiram Rajendran>: A couple of quick questions. In the Northeast segment, segment EBITDA was actually
down sequentially in the third quarter. I believe there were some one-offs included in the 2Q results. But could you
help us think about some of the factors preventing maybe a quicker ramp-up in the profits in the segment and how we
should think about that trajectory looking ahead from 4Q and then into next year?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Sure. Jim, you've got that?
<A - James E. Scheel>: Sure. Thanks, Abhi, that's a great question. As we look at the third quarter this year, let's just
take a step back and talk a little bit about volumes. During the last earnings call, we talked about the number of wells
coming on line. We actually had eight wells delayed during the third quarter coming into the OVM system. That was
obviously a disappointing issue for us, some producer issues. But we see those coming online pretty quickly and we
have won a site to 35 more wells coming online over the course of this quarter, two of which are dry Utica wells.
So, as we look at our exit rate for the year for OVM, we're very excited about the opportunity to continue to see a very
robust fourth quarter. And that would be combined with some additional fee-based revenue coming from all of the new
assets that have come online. Obviously, I've been disappointed by the delay in bringing on the stabilization facilities as
well as TXP1. But we've had a lot of assets coming online, and just getting that all put together has been a pretty big
issue. Keeping that as safe and as efficient as possible has been our high priority.
So, those are coming on line really as we speak. We've got commissioning activities coming on today that will also
improve earnings coming into the fourth quarter. We've also seen pretty much the completion of a major expansion
around the Susquehanna Supply Hub. So, volumes there have increased since the close of the third quarter by about
200 million a day, and we're excited about the continued increase there.

So, we've got a great trajectory for future growth. And then when you combine that, one of the things you wanted to
reconcile to was the third quarter. And as we think about that, we had some kind of, I won't call them extraordinary, but
we had some income from Caiman associated with the Natrium fire that came in. And then one of the other changes
that we have to be aware of is with Laurel Mountain Midstream, we have a percentage of gas. Gas prices have been
down for the third quarter, and so we've seen a hit from that as well.
So, if we really look at earnings growth going forward, taking out those two things, we still see a nice improvement as
we look forward to the fourth quarter and into 2015.
<Q - Abhiram Rajendran>: Great. That's very helpful. Shifting gears to Geismar, could you give us some color on the
ramp-up there over the next couple of months? When do you guys expect to kind of get up to commercial levels of
production? And then when could we potentially see operating rates up in the 90%s, like the rest of the industry?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: John, will you take that, please?
<A - John R. Dearborn>: Yeah. Thanks very much for the question. From where we stand today, as you saw in our
announcement, we've announced that construction is complete, and we're fully into the commissioning and start-up
activities. These activities are largely focused on getting the plant dried out and oxygen freed and leak tested and
rotating our major equipment in the plant in preparation for the start-up.
Sitting here today I'd say November 15, plus or minus a few days, is where we should be for making first ethylene as is
signaled by our announcement. And then, as we look forward beyond that, we're expecting a ramp up first to, I would
say, what was the base plant rates in order to make certain that we get the entire machine lined out and make certain
that we've got a good stable operating system at that point of operation. And then, shortly after that, ramping it on up to
the expanded capacity.
The overall timeframe for getting that done from the day we start making first ethylene is going to be notionally around
a month. It's going to be about four weeks. But again, we're going to want to do this in a very disciplined way. We've
brought some unbelievable operational discipline to the plant there in Geismar, and the team is going about this start-up
in a very deliberate way and a very deliberate disciplined way.
But I think that brings, I think, all the color you need to give a sense of how we're going to bring the plant back into
operation.
<Q - Abhiram Rajendran>: Great. Yeah. That's very helpful. And then, last one from me, coming back to the merger
between the MLPs. So, based on the previous iteration of the terms, I think you guys had put out figures expecting
about a 1.2 times dividend coverage for MB in 2015 and 2016. And then, on the revised terms, I think, cash available
after dividends comes in slightly lower. So, could you just give us some color on how to think about maybe the new
excess coverage over the next couple of years and any other puts and takes there?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Abhi, This is Don. In terms of the 1.2 times, we boosted the initial distribution, I think,
before we said at least 3.49, we decided to go with 3.65. So, quite a bit higher initial distribution that reduced the
coverage a bit, but the coverage is still well north of 1.1 times. And in terms of the transactions, we shifted coverage
from Williams to the merged partnership. We thought that that was the right thing to do to create the kind of valuation
in the partnership to make it the lead entity to move Williams to a pure-play GP holdco.
Again, so we shifted the coverage to PZ, again, the more than $1.1 billion of coverage over that three-year period, took
the coverage down at Williams. But nonetheless, we still have over $300 million of cash coverage just in 2015 and
2016, really with no real need for that capital. It's nice to have, and I'm sure we'll find a value-adding use for it, but
nonetheless, rather than run 1.2 times coverage at Williams without a clear need for the excess coverage or having
double coverage, in fact, with the partnership having coverage and Williams having coverage, we didn't see that adding
value.
So, again, really shifted the coverage to be very substantial at the partnership with, again, the industry-leading growth
rate for large cap MLPs and taking the coverage down at Williams to a level that we think is appropriate.

And we'll now go to Brad Olsen with TPH.
<Q - Bradley Olsen>: Hey. Good morning, everyone.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning, Brad.
<Q - Bradley Olsen>: I'd like to focus on the macro and maybe follow on some of the questions that Christine had
about the pipe projects out of the Northeast. Obviously, you guys are in a pretty unique position having multiple
large-scale projects currently out in the market for producers in the Northeast. And when you look at all of the different
markets that Transco serves, do you have a feel – is there a specific market where either producers feel that they don't
have enough access to or the consumers in that market don't feel as though they have enough access to Northeast
production growth? Just trying to get a feel for as you fill the pipe with all this gas, where is it actually going to head?
And where is there economically the most pull for that gas?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Sure. Great question. And I would just tell you that the amount of new gas-fired power
generation, obviously, in the Southeast is a major issue as that area converts off of coal. If you follow some of the
commentary from folks like Southern Company, I think one of their big concerns has been whether there would be
adequate infrastructure built out in time and reliable infrastructure to serve their power generation loads.
And so, I think this project helps answer some of that frankly. As well, we're continuing to see, obviously, a lot of folks
wanting to get to spots where they can deliver to LNG contracts. And by getting all the way to Station 65 with this gas,
that option becomes available as well. And then, of course, we also have like the large methanol project that Transco
has contracted to serve just south of Station 65 as well.
And as well, all of the Southeast, from just a general load standpoint, continues to grow, and so we see that continuing
in those regions as well. So, many projects, like the Dalton Lateral, for instance, are projects that need supply and
demonstrate the growing markets. [ph] Here (49:50) will be expansion to serve Sabal Trail.
So, I would just tell you Transco is winding up kind of being this big high-pressure header that's right in the middle of
all the market growth. And people realize that, and they want to be there, not just to serve any one particular market,
but to have the options of going to where that market growth is. And so, it's really a network value, if you will, where
you have all the best supplies in the country trying to get in to the places where the best markets are, and that mutually
attracts each other to being connected to that big header.
<Q - Bradley Olsen>: That's great color, Alan. I appreciate it. And even further south of 65, I know you guys have
talked about potentially working with PEMEX on the Deepwater projects that they're starting to pursue. But is there an
opportunity maybe for Transco, even in South Texas, where you have some existing infrastructure to participate in any
of the tenders that either PEMEX or CFE have out to import Eagle Ford and other U.S. gas supplies into Northern
Mexico?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: We have a relatively unique project, I would tell you, that we've been working on and we're
not positioned to describe that just yet, but we're pretty excited about it. And we think it's a very low-risk way of
serving that growth in the market, and we're continuing on a nice trajectory to develop that project. But yes, we do have
opportunities and yes we are pursuing those.
<Q - Bradley Olsen>: Okay. Great. And just if we could flip to the ethane side of things, we've recently seen Sasol
received FID for their world-scale cracker, and I think that rounds out six or seven crackers, which are set to proceed.
Interestingly, we've seen kind of ethane exports come out of nowhere and gain quite a bit of steam as well. So, in light
of these recent announcements, how does your view of ethane as a feedstock change? And I guess, asked more directly,
does potential tightening in the ethane market later this decade cause you to rethink what you might use for a feedstock
on a second Geismar project or does it give you pause about a second Geismar world-scale cracker, in general?

<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. I would just say that we think there is a lot of ethane available with these growing
gas supplies. However, what's not getting invested in adequately right now is the infrastructure to be able to recover all
that ethane and get it into all these points of consumption. And obviously, that's a business that we like and one that we
continue to have an eye towards in terms of how we play a critical role in distributing – recovering and distribution all
of that ethane.
So, I think it's a very good question. And it's at a time like this when the market seems to be awash in ethane, people
are unwilling to invest in the infrastructure that it takes to get it recovered and into those markets. But we believe that
just like what we're seeing on the gas side now, where the demand is on the verge of really starting to grow pretty
rapidly, we think the same thing will happen on the ethane side, but it is going to take quite a bit of infrastructure and
we're certainly working hard to plan that.
We're in the process of commissioning our Bayou Ethane project, which extends ethane from Mont Belvieu over into
Lake Charles area in Louisiana and, ultimately, connects – will connect into our system that gets ethane all the way
over to the river. And so, that's just an example of how we're positioning ourselves to help be a solution to the problem
that you described, which is going to eventually catch up with us.
<Q - Bradley Olsen>: Got it. And you mentioned the ethane solution. Are there opportunities as we see the ethylene
market potentially growing 30% or 40% with all these new crackers and brownfield projects, do you see opportunities
on the olefin transportation and storage side as well as on the ethane transportation and storage?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. Let me have John Dearborn, who has been quite a student of that issue, take that
question.
<A - John R. Dearborn>: Yeah. Absolutely, we do in that we continue to promote our projects on the Gulf Coast
around the transport of both propylene, which today will be made from new sources like propane dehydro units, what is
now Flint Hills and Dow, two new markets, as well as some additional propylene splitters that will put new supplies on
to that system. So, that's one pipeline system that we're promoting.
And then, the second is what we call our Promesa project, which is an ethylene pipeline, which is intended to connect
some of the major players on the ethylene side in order to bring some of the really more about reliability there, but as
well give the opportunity to get ethylene into the hub, where ethylene will be able to be traded well in that hub in order
to be able to do some good price discovery of ethylene, which is a service that Williams brought to the market in the
last couple of years.
<Q - Bradley Olsen>: Great. Thanks so much for that color, everyone.

And we'll now go to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Thanks. Just some clean-up stuff here. The Canadian PDH sounds like you're going to – you're
close to FID there. Any sort of ZIP code on the capital involved there? Can you confirm that that will be 100%
fee-based and then the kind of return you'd be looking for?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Until we take that to the board, Ted – and we've got an outside party involved in there as
the customer, and so I think until we get all that wrapped up, we're not – we don't really want to be announcing any of
those details just yet. But as you know, we've continued to try to work that project in a way that it reduces our
commodity exposure in that space and we think we've found a nice way and a nice partner to accomplish that with.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Okay. I wonder if you can just talk a little bit, looking out west here, the implications of Veresen
buying the 50% interest in Ruby. Do you think that helps at all your Pacific Connector Project or should we really just

look to sort of Jordan Cove going to FID [final investment decision]?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Well, I just think it demonstrates their confidence in the project and, certainly, they're the
ones that have the very best seat at the table there. We certainly have worked alongside them and have our own internal
perspective. But I would say anybody's putting their money where their mouth is something you've got to pay attention
to and they certainly have stepped up and done that.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Yeah. And then last one from me is just as you look at the deepwater, any thoughts? We have
seen some of the majors kind of continue with the activity out there of another Gulfstar, maybe more like a Keathley
Canyon-type project. How is the outlook there?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Rory, could you take that please?
<A - Rory Lee Miller>: Sure. Ted, as you know, the timeline on making Deepwater infrastructure investments and, I
guess, the development of Deepwater prospects is pretty long. Usually, it's a four- to six-year cycle to get that started.
So, current oil price is not really too instructive about those decisions. There's a lot of what I would call pent-up
discoveries in the mill, if you will.
A lot of discoveries have been made and they're slow going to sanctioning right now, and that's predominantly, I think,
because producers are waiting on that 20K technology to be made available. I think the target is maybe sometime in the
2019-2020 timeframe that the technology and the equipment will be ready.
And so, that's slowing things down, I think, a little bit more than the price of oil. But we do think we're going to have
an opportunity over the next 12 months to 24 months to deploy another Gulfstar. And as those projects start to get
broken loose, we think we'll be well positioned to transact on something. So, we haven't lost any interest in that. It's
kind of the ebb and the flow of the Deepwater. But most producers are looking out, I think, six years or so in terms of
what they think oil price is going to be at that time.
<Q - Ted J. Durbin>: Okay. Thanks. I'll leave it at that.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Thanks, Ted.

And our next question from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Good morning.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning, Craig.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Picking up on Ted's questioning about Geismar II, have you all given any more thought with
Geismar I ramping up over the next couple of months, possibly neutralizing the commodity risk there over the next
year or two years?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. Craig, we continue to look at that. And obviously, what we're trading off there is the
high margin and the benefit we get from that versus the stability of fee-based structure. And as well, I would tell you,
we really would like to do a transaction that pulls all the way through our infrastructure. In other words, takes
advantage of the ethane supplies and the ethane link that we have via our upstream business and pulls that all the way
through our own infrastructure. And so, that would be our preference on how we would do that. And provided we can
make enough margin in the fee-based side to help offset a large portion of that commodity margin, we would do that.
And so, I would just tell you, we're always weighing that balance internally. But it's a hard margin – especially given
how strong the fundamentals are right now, it's a hard margin to give up. But we do continue to look at that. And I
would say, it would probably come in the way of a fairly large structured transaction for us to get that, because it would
– as I mentioned, it would involve trying to get the value chain all the way back through our assets.

<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Sounds like that's not anything imminent, maybe more like 2016 or beyond?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: It might come with the contracting on Geismar II perhaps, but – and perhaps a portion of
that, so it could come ahead of that.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Okay. Great. And picking up on Christine's questioning, with the MLP set to finalize the
merger in just next couple of months, have you had any formal discussions with customers about amending ACMP's
cost of service arrangements to dovetail with WPZ's infrastructure in kind of a win-win manner?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: I would just say, the answer to your question directly is no, but I would say that we see a
lot of opportunity. We've had some very encouraging meetings with the Chesapeake team. And really, honestly, pretty
impressed, frankly, by the attitude that Doug Lawler's bringing to that and I think kind of a high-trust relationship that
we're used to working in and one that we can really drive win-win solutions for each other in. And so, while we don't
have anything specific there, I would tell you I see a lot of opportunity between our companies to continue to expand
our relationship in a way that's beneficial for both parties.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Great. And there's been some kind of strange trading between WPZ and ACMP since you
announced your finalized merger agreement. Can you discuss anything that would logically push this past the fourth
quarter distribution record date, so that PZ would get the higher February payment versus the combined one?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Craig, I think it's just a typical SEC process. So, we will file the S-4 within the next couple
of weeks, and then it's just a question of how quickly we get through the SEC. It could move very quickly or it could be
a bit longer. So, that's really the wild card. It's just really the SEC clearance process for the S-4. And as we indicated in
our documents, Williams has sufficient votes to ensure that the vote is in favor of the merger. And in fact, we've
already committed vote in favor of the merger. So, there is no doubt as to the outcome. So, it's really just the SEC S-4
clearance process.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Understood. And last question on the – I think you have $275 million of outstanding unpaid
insurance claims. Can you give some more color about what the primary questioning is around this? And to the degree
you don't recover what you had anticipated, does the MLP just kind of chock that up to history, or does MB help out in
any way?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Craig, we're vigorously pursuing the claim and we think we have a very strong claim.
Obviously, the insurers would like to pay less, so there is some level of debate. I don't think we want to go into the
details. But certainly, we're actively engaged in the process. We and our insurers have now agreed to a non-binding
mediation in an effort to resolve differences, and we're going to begin that later in the month of November.
As to what happens if WPZ falls short, it will just be the shortfall in the collection. It will be kind of a one-time item
that, I think – and that's the way we look at it, really no other action that would be related to that. But again, we're
vigorously pursuing the claim and we'll begin the mediation process in late November.
<Q - Craig K. Shere>: Understood. I appreciate the feedback.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Thanks, Craig.

Now we'll go to Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Thank you. Good morning everybody and very much appreciate the time here. Just maybe two
quick areas of cleanup. Alan, if I could first go back to Appalachian Connector, and I'm just sort of curious with some
of the competition that you're seeing there, do you see any potential for either this project to move into – or to have
partners in the structure? And similarly, do you expect any erosion or change, perhaps, in the economics from what you
saw in Atlantic Sunrise as far as return on capital?

<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. Great questions. I would answer the second one first. I think very similar kind of the
targets. Of course, a larger portion of this project is greenfield in terms of the capital amount. So, we get a little less
leverage, if you will, off the existing system. So, potentially – depending on the ultimate size, potentially, could be a
little bit lower than what we enjoyed on Atlantic Sunrise, just because that was pretty extraordinary. But still very
attractive returns on the project.
Secondly, I would say that as to the partnership and arrangements there, we think we've got a good project going ahead.
And while there may be some partners that bring some strategic value to it that we would entertain, right now, I would
tell you, we have a project that we think stands pretty well on its own at this point.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Excellent. And if I can have just one quick follow-up on that, and I guess I ask this in the sense
that all large infrastructure seems to be taking longer than expected to kind of get done these days. And so, I'm just
curious when you all work backwards from a potential late 2018 in service, when do you feel like you need to basically
have shippers locked up? I mean, as far as whether you're getting to the present agreements or following it with a
binding open season, when do you kind of have to have that in hand, do you think?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. I would just tell you, we are in the stage of negotiating those agreements and making
great progress on that. And obviously, the quicker we get them done, the less risk we have on the timing. But I would
tell you, we've got a very sober viewpoint out there these days on what it takes to get these projects built and we've got
that built into our perspective.
But having said that, we can't spend six months, so getting the agreements negotiated, so I would say it's more a couple
of months to get this done that's within our expectations. And again, I think given the appetite that we're seeing, I think,
that's very doable at this point.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Fair enough. I appreciate that. And then, last quick question, just maybe turning to Canada, and
this is really more on the base off gas and the processing. And I think you actually mentioned some of the coker
outages at Suncor and looked like there was maybe been maintenance at Redwater, I think you said [ph] there are
tie-ins in (1:08:40) CNRL. And I guess, maybe my question is, is that do you have a sense of what the missed
opportunity cost was in the quarter from those outages from the lower-equity NGLs? I think you mentioned Geismar,
for instance, being $200 million. I didn't know if you had sort of similar analog for the Canadian side.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: John, would you take that, please?
<A - John R. Dearborn>: Yeah. If I could just make a few comments, though, about how things are going up in
Canada, first of all, we've invested mightily over the last year in reliability up in Canada. So, we are poised to take as
much gas as our partner is ready to deliver to us at that facility. In fact, we've made some improvement projects that
perhaps might allow it to be higher than our earlier expectations.
Secondly, in terms of operational discipline in this last turnaround, we actually got through this turnaround in slightly
less time than we originally planned. We accomplished 100% of the tie-ins that we wanted to accomplish during the
turnaround and came in slightly under budget. So, now the answer to your question – answer to your question is, there's
probably about $20 million in missed opportunity in Canada this quarter, against what would be operations at full
capacity, receiving all the gas that we could from our partner.
<Q - Carl L. Kirst>: Excellent. Thank you so much for the color, guys.
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Thank you.

<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Good morning.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Just following up on your previous comments, have you tried to, I guess, quantify some of the
commercial opportunities you expect to realize, and what type of upside that represents to maybe 2015 guidance for the
merged MLP?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: The only thing that we've put out there, Sharon, obviously, is that the merged MLP of $50
million savings, and I would tell you we think that's very achievable at this point. And we really haven't, though, put a
number to the commercial side, and I would tell you some of it will be pretty hard to characterize. For instance, if we're
able to pick up volumes and develop a project like Atlantic Connector, based on some of those synergies, that's a
longer-term value proposition, but nevertheless valuable. And so, we haven't really put any kind of numbers to the
commercial side of that yet.
And as I said it's such a fluid situation in terms of customer responses and so forth, that's going to be pretty hard for us
to quantify. But we're certainly excited what we're seeing. And Jim Scheel and John Seldenrust, who – John runs that
area for ACMP, are working very closely together to capture a lot of those. And I think both of them are pretty
impressed with the amount of opportunities that we're seeing.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay. That's helpful. And just one last one for me. For the drop-down of the remaining Canadian
assets, is there a specific reason why the drop would occur to WPZ versus the merged entity in 2015?
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Sharon, this is Don. It could go either way. It's our expectation we'll likely drop it to WPZ.
It'll likely happen just prior to the merger, but it could happen concurrent with the merger. But it's something that we've
got some flexibility on, but it's likely going to be first of the year.
<Q - Sharon Lui>: Okay. Thank you.

And we'll go to Timm Schneider with ISI Group.
<Q - Timm A. Schneider>: Hey. Good morning, guys. Just a quick one for me. So, I think it was two weeks ago or so
Sunday night a report hits Bloomberg, Williams amongst bidders for a competitor's Rockies gathering processing
system. Obviously, not expecting you guys to comment on that transaction. What I do – or what I am interested in is
what's your appetite for acquisitions at this point, what are you guys kind of seeing, and then, specifically, how do you
balance that with kind of working through what you already have on your plate? And then, follow-up on that is, how do
you guys look at your securities as currency in this environment?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Yeah. Great questions. I would just tell you, Timm, as we've said all along, we're always
interested in acquisitions that are right down our alley in terms of being strategic and in areas that further strengthen our
hand. But we're not interested in just doing glommed-on acquisitions that aren't additive to our strategy. And so, I
would just say, we're going to be very selective. But given the large footprint that we have, there is a number of
projects that would add a lot of synergy. And I would even suggest something like QEP, not surprising to me that
somebody assume we would be the buyer, because I would tell you, we would be a pretty good buyer for those assets
just given the synergies that we have in the area.
And so, we will certainly be keeping our eyes open. As to the equity value, I would tell you, obviously, we've
demonstrated, we think, we're really undervalued substantially right now. But we think that will correct itself in the
not-too-distant future. And so, we're going to be pretty stingy with our equity, obviously, when it's valued like it is right
now. But we do have our eyes open, and we do have other financing means given the strong step-up in cash flows that
we've got coming our way.
<Q - Timm A. Schneider>: Okay. Thank you.

And we'll go to Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies.
<Q - Christopher P. Sighinolfi>: Hey. Thanks. Thanks, guys. Just want to follow-up on some of Carl's questions on
Canada. John, curious if you talked about or Alan talked about the Redwater outage, the Suncor downtime. You gave
some color on sort of the impact to the quarter. Just wondering where we stand right now. Are there any outages of that
nature we ought to be thinking about on a go-forward that would be sort of profiling over the next four quarters or five
quarters? And then, as you sort of assessed the operations up there, given some of these disruptions, do you still feel
comfortable about the segment profit target that you had previously given for next year? I think it was kind of $170
million to $210 million range.
<A - John R. Dearborn>: Yeah. Great question. And you've asked a lot in that question. So, let's take it piece by
piece. Looking forward into next year, in the fourth quarter, late third quarter, fourth quarter, obviously, we've got to
finish up the tie-ins for the Horizon project, which will be coming online. So, we can expect there'll be some outage
during that time. We try and minimize the impact of these outages by continuing – we keep our wells as dry as possible
ahead of the outages, so that we keep the gas or the liquids flowing out of the LEP unit up at Fort McMurray for as long
as practical. And we minimize the impact. So, that's I think where we are there.
And then, to the second point, as to how do we increase – and perhaps, I would ask the question a little differently, how
do we increase the reliability of the gas flow. We are spending an enormous amount of effort and time in collaboration
with Suncor to help both solve some of their problems, which they have some real problems that need to be solved at
their plant, as well as to obviously assist them in getting more gas to our plant. Until we have multiple sources of gas
getting to our plants, multiple sources of liquids, I think we're always going to be beholden to the reliability of our
single supplier there.
So, I guess I don't want to give the excuse it's out of our control, because we want to work with Suncor in maximizing
our opportunity set at this stage. But until we have the multiple sources, I think we're going to have the risk of the
single source of supply in front of us.
<Q - Christopher P. Sighinolfi>: Okay. Great. That's helpful. I think sticking with Canada for a moment maybe, but
shifting to Don, wondering about the pending dropdown of the project up there, given I guess the fact that they're
in-progress opportunities largely, wondering if you can sort of help us think about the potential multiple we might
expect there. Obviously, nothing specific, but we've seen in-progress opportunities be dropped at book value. Some
companies talk about sort of flywheel effects that are generated from those in-progress opportunities and sort of expand
them up. So, I'm just wondering your thinking now – or thinking the board's thinking about the Canadian opportunities
in light of some of the challenges we've seen up there as of late.
<A - Donald R. Chappel>: Chris, what we're thinking is that the aggregate portfolio of assets, both the project you
mentioned as well as a variety of other prospective projects, would include the Syncrude prospect, the Canadian PDH,
Geismar II and the Gulf Coast pipelines, they're all held by Williams NGL & Petchem Services, would be dropped
together. And we would drop those at about invested capital, so book value, if you will. And that was part of our, I'll
say, negotiations as part of our merger.
<Q - Christopher P. Sighinolfi>: Okay. Great. One more question from me, real quickly. You had some questions,
obviously, in this call and I think Timm hit on it with acquisitions and whatnot. But Alan, just curious, how do you
think about IG rating, the surplus cash you're projecting over next couple of years? It does appear you've retained a lot
of financial flexibility if the execution matches the plan. Your slides indicate, you've stated on the call, you don't think
you're being sort of paid for the distribution and dividend growth that you're projecting right now. So, I'm just
wondering, given that, are you likely to accelerate any of those growth projections or is there – if more headroom
becomes available, or would you rather sort of add coverage, keep optionality sort of on the table as you think about
potential acquisitions that might come, additional projects that might come? Any color on that would be helpful
regarding your priorities.

<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: Sure. Great question. I would just say that we do think we're not being valued for the
growth at either the MLP or at the parent level right now. And frankly, I think that's to be understood given the outage
at Geismar and some of the risks around that and some of these major projects that we're bringing online. And so, I
think now as those issues are cured, I think we could see pretty big step-up on that. So, I would just tell you, we're
pretty energized about how our strategy is playing out. We think there's a lot of acquisition opportunities that would be
dead in line with our strategy and continuing to strengthen that. And certainly, with the major footprint that we have
now with the combination of Access and WPZ, there's just more opportunities out in front of us that we can – that we're
the right buyer for.
And so, I would tell you, I think we're in a pretty offensive posture, but we also – I would say, two things, tamp that a
little bit. One, of course, is that we do need to see our equities valued properly; and two, when you've got such a
tremendous growth in your cash flows built into your model and you're running accretion analysis, you've got a big step
to climb there to be accretive against such a terrific growth pattern that we already have. So, it's a great problem to have
when your base business is growing so strong to look at these acquisitions. But at the end of the day, we're very
focused on our vision of being the player in this natural gas space on the infrastructure side, and we're going to stay
committed to that vision, but do it in a financially-prudent manner.

And we'll take our last question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just one small question follow-up here at the
end. I was just wondering, if you look back towards the end of the Data Book, you have segment profit guidance
reported to adjusted on slide 103, just looking at the 2015 guidance, it seems like there's an item in the Northeast G&P
of $136 million. And I apologize if I missed it, but could you just provide some color on what the item is?
<A - Alan S. Armstrong>: I'm going to turn that to John Porter, because I think he's taken some of these questions and
he can probably best explain it.
<A - John D. Porter>: Yeah, that was an item that we had in the fourth quarter of 2014 that we discussed on our
second quarter call that has now been moved into 2015. We haven't given specific details around that, but it was an
item that we were expecting to come through our GAAP earnings and felt like it should be adjusted out. It's a
contingent-type item.
<Q - Jeremy B. Tonet>: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for your help.

Alan S. Armstrong
Great. Thank you very much. Well, as you can see, this growth is right on the verge of here at WPZ-ACMP continues
to perform extremely well. And the combination of these two great organizations is something to be very excited about.
However, as we think about all this growth, I think one thing I want to recognize to our investor base here is the
tremendous amount of toil and effort that goes on by these teams that are bringing these big projects in. It is not an easy
