For today's agenda, Nick will review our third quarter financial performance and 2014 outlook. I will provide business
segment highlights. And we'll conclude with Ellen's comments, followed by your questions.
With that introduction, it's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Nick.
Nicholas C. Fanandakis
Thank you, Greg.
Starting with slide two, you will see the highlights of our third quarter. We delivered $0.54 operating earnings per share
versus $0.45 last year. That's 20% growth in a sluggish macroeconomic environment outside of North America and
significant year-over-year headwinds in Agriculture.
Sales were down 3%, reflecting the impact of portfolio changes, specifically the sale of GLS/Vinyls, our Sontara and
Stonetech businesses, along with the disposition of our aniline facility at Baytown and the sale of our interest in a joint
venture in Europe. All of these actions are aligned with our strategy to enhance the value creation of our portfolio.
Volume gains were largely offset by price reductions. Total segment operating earnings margin improved 130 basis
points year over year, reflecting our ongoing efforts to enhance the value of our portfolio. In total, the results for the
third quarter are in line with our previous announced expectations and reflect solid performance among our businesses.
Let's turn now to slide three, and I'll cover the results for our reporting segments. We entered the third quarter with
headwinds in Agriculture and continued uncertainty in international markets. We delivered double-digit segment
operating earnings growth in our Safety & Protection and Nutrition & Health segments. Volume gains in Nutrition &
Health along with productivity improvement in Safety & Protection provided substantial margin improvement across
these businesses and contributed to strong operating earnings growth. Nutrition & Health improved margins almost 200
basis points, and Safety & Protection improved margins more than 300 basis points in the quarter.
In Agriculture, earnings were up due to strong insecticide and fungicide volumes in Latin America, which benefited
from new product launches. However, seed sales were lower due to well known reduction in corn seed planted acres
and lower corn seed pricing in Latin America. In our Performance Materials segment, operating earnings were up
slightly year over year, as increased demand for auto and industrial markets was offset by the sale of GLS/Vinyls
earlier in the year. In Performance Chemicals, lower prices for refrigerants and TiO2 coupled with the negative impact
of portfolio changes resulted in 5% lower segment operating earnings in the quarter.
Turning now to slide four, sales were down 3% on a global basis, almost entirely due to the portfolio changes we've
undertaken in line with our strategic focus. Volume gains were offset by lower prices.
Our sales in developing Asia were up 4%, led by China, where most businesses realized volume improvements during
the quarter. In fact, our sales in China delivered more than three-fourths of the growth we saw in developing Asia. The
volume increases were partially offset by currency, price, and the impact of portfolio changes. In EMEA, while about
half of the decline in sales is due to portfolio changes, sales were sluggish in both developing and developed countries,
reflecting weak demand in most markets. We currently see this sluggish demand continuing in EMEA for the
remainder of the year. Sales declines in the Americas were the result of portfolio changes and lower agricultural sales.
Turning now to slide five, you see that our 20% growth in operating earnings per share in the quarter is attributable to a
combination of segment operating earnings growth, lower interest expense, a slightly lower tax rate, and the benefit of
lower shares outstanding. Portfolio changes also had a negative impact to the operating earnings of about $0.03 per
share in the quarter.
As you know, in recent months the dollar has strengthened significantly against nearly all currencies. While adverse
currency impact in the third quarter was minor on a year-over-year basis, we see a strong headwind in the coming
quarters. For the fourth quarter, we now expect at least $0.05 per share year-over-year hurt. This compares to our
expectation in July of virtually no currency impact in the second half.

Turning to slide six, our free cash flow for the first nine months of 2014 versus last year has improved about $400
million. This is due primarily to the absence of tax payments related to the sale of Performance Coatings, which
occurred in 2013. Consistent with prior years, we anticipate strong seasonal cash flow in the fourth quarter. With a
challenging Ag environment, we see additional headwinds, which may impact our full-year free cash flow. Net debt at
September 30 reflects our normal seasonal pattern of cash flows and is up about $800 million from the prior year.
In August, we entered into a $700 million Accelerated Share Repurchase agreement to substantially complete our $2
billion share repurchase commitment for 2014. We expect final settlement of the ASR in the fourth quarter. We
estimate that average diluted shares outstanding for the full year will be about 922 million shares and 913 million
shares for the fourth quarter.
As we've said, share repurchases are one way we return value to our shareholders, and we use them to complement our
strong dividends. Last week our board approved our quarterly dividend of $0.47 to be paid in December. In total, by
year end we will have returned nearly $9 billion to our shareholders since 2009 in the form of dividends, representing a
15% increase in our quarterly payout during that period. In addition, during the same period we will have completed
more than $4 billion in share repurchases. Under our current share repurchase plan that was announced in January of
2014, we have completed $2 billion of the $5 billion program.
Moving now to slide seven, I'll just reiterate that our redesign initiatives are underway and delivering about $0.02 of
benefit in the quarter. For the fourth quarter, our outlook includes about $0.04 of benefit from these actions.
Additionally, as we said in July, we're well on track for our Performance Chemicals separation, with expected filing of
the Form 10 with the SEC in mid-December of this year. And we expect separation costs to be about $0.16 per share
this year and about $0.19 to $0.22 per share next year. In addition, we have now finalized all the key leadership
appointments for the new Performance Chemicals organization to ensure a successful spin in mid-2015.
Regarding our outlook for the fourth quarter, we clearly see uncertainties in the global economy, shifts in the
agricultural industry, along with stiffer currency headwinds. However, we are confident in our ability to continue to
deliver on cost productivity and other corporate initiatives.
Overall, we expect our fourth quarter operating earnings per share to grow about 20% from last year's $0.59 per share,
matching the growth rate achieved in the third quarter and within our previously communicated outlook range of $4.00
to $4.10 per share for the full year. Our outlook for the fourth quarter and full year is in line with current Street
estimates.
On that note, I'll turn it over to Greg. Greg?
Gregory R. Friedman
I'd like now to provide some brief segment insights. As a reminder, the slides with complete segment commentary are
posted on the Investor Center website under Events & Presentations along with the other materials for today's call.
Turning to Safety & Protection on slide eight, third quarter segment operating earnings of $201 million increased 18%,
and operating earnings margin increased over 300 basis points. Operating earnings are benefiting from improved
margins, enriched mix, increased demand from industrial markets, and continued benefits from cost productivity.
Kevlar demand growth was driven by increased sales into transportation, industrial, and wire and cable sectors, while
Nomex demand growth was fueled by thermal industrial automotive applications. Regionally, sales volume growth in
Asia-Pacific and the U.S. was offset by lower volumes in Latin America and Europe.
In the fourth quarter, we anticipate sales growth in the mid-single-digit range and earnings growth in the high
single-digit percent range on higher operating margin and sustained operational productivity.
On slide nine, this was another strong quarter for our Nutrition & Health segment. Sales were up 4%, led by volume
growth in specialty proteins, probiotics and cultures, and continued momentum in enablers. We continued to expand in
emerging markets, growing segment sales 10% in the quarter. Operating earnings were up 23% to $100 million from

the higher sales and operating margin improvement due to mix enrichment, productivity actions, and lower raw
material costs. This was the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating margin improvement.
In the fourth quarter, we expect low single-digit percent sales growth from broad-based volume gains, including
continued growth in emerging markets. This is expected to be partially offset by headwinds in Western Europe, which
remain weak from repercussions of the Russia food import ban and a negative impact from currency. Operating
earnings are expected to be up in the mid-single-digit percent range on sales growth, improved mix, productivity
actions, and lower raw material costs.
In our Agriculture segment on slide 10, third quarter results are largely driven by the summer growing season in Latin
America. The seasonal operating loss of $55 million was slightly better than the prior year and in line with our
expectations heading into the quarter despite an increasingly challenging environment in Agriculture.
During the quarter we saw a further decline in corn and soybean commodity prices, as farmers in North America
anticipate a record harvest. Sales for the quarter were 4% below the prior year, as volume growth in insecticides and
fungicides, mainly in Latin America, was more than offset by lower corn seed and herbicide volumes. Price for the
segment was down 2%, resulting from lower corn seed prices in Brazil, as anticipated, and the negative impact of
currency, primarily the real.
In segment operating earnings, lower seed input costs and operating cost improvements were partially offset by the
lower sales and the absence of a prior-year $26 million gain from the acquisition of a controlling interest in Pannar.
As we wrap up the 2014 North America growing season, the USDA won't issue final 2014 acreage until January of
next year. However, based on the October preliminary estimate of 90.9 million acres, North America corn market share
likely declined between one to two points in 2014, following strong gains in 2013 and over the past several seasons. In
soybeans in North America, 2014 market share is expected to be between one and two points lower, as we continue to
transition our lineup to new higher performing Pioneer T Series varieties and launch products containing the Genuity
Roundup Ready 2 Yield trait.
Turning to the outlook, the fourth quarter in Agriculture is driven by the completion of the Brazil summer season and
shipments to position product for the upcoming safrinha season in Brazil and for the 2015 Northern Hemisphere
season. The operating environment will continue to be challenging, as farmer net income and corn planted area remain
under pressure across the globe. In addition, a stronger U.S. dollar against the real, euro, and rand will likely create
stronger headwinds to sales and operating earnings. In the fourth quarter, we expect sales to be about flat. For the
segment, we expect continued growth in crop protection volumes to be offset by lower corn seed price in Brazil and the
negative impacts of currency. Operating earnings are expected to be positive for the second year in a row and similar to
or above the prior year's fourth quarter.
As we begin to look forward to the 2015 season, we are pleased with what our customers are seeing during the corn and
soybean harvest, and we'll provide further details on Pioneer brand competitive performance in the next few weeks.
The broad scale launch of our Encirca Yield Service with nitrogen management has exceeded our expectations, as
growers look to maximize profitability of every acre.
In Crop Protection, performance of our new product launches in customer fields is very encouraging. While it is too
early to speak for planted area or earnings expectations for next year, we do anticipate 2015 will be a dynamic,
challenging year for farmers, given reduced net cash income and growing global grain stocks following this year's
harvest. However, we remain confident in the long-term fundamentals for sustainable demand growth in Agriculture.
In Performance Materials on slide 11, sales were down 3%, due primarily to the impact of the portfolio change. Absent
the portfolio change, volumes and prices increased across the segment. Operating earnings were up 1% on solid
demand in automotive, construction, and industrial applications. Ethylene margins in the quarter were at record levels,
driven by high ethylene prices and low-cost ethane. Our industry-leading operating margins were near 24%, fueled by
favorable ethylene dynamics and the continued benefit of productivity measures. In the fourth quarter, we anticipate
flat sales, as the impact of portfolio changes offsets anticipated volume growth. We expect operating earnings percent
growth in the high teens on improved margins and mix.

Turning to Industrial Biosciences on slide 12, operating earnings were up 4%, as ethanol industry fundamentals
remained favorable during the quarter, which drove increased volume for DuPont's novel enzymes. In other key end
markets, demand was mixed. Sales of Sorona polymer for carpeting were flat due to softer demand in existing home
sales, partially offset by increased sales of Sorona in apparel. We continue to see solid demand for Axtra PHY in
Animal Nutrition and healthy food enzyme sales. In the fourth quarter, we expect sales will be up in the
mid-single-digit percent range above prior year's record revenue. Fourth quarter operating earnings are expected to be
up substantially on richer mix, higher sales, and improved product costs.
On slide 13, sales in Electronics & Communications were 2% lower in the quarter. Volume growth in several product
lines was more than offset by competitive pressures impacting Solamet paste. Operating earnings of $94 million were
$3 million lower, as lower sales and a decrease in other income were partially offset by productivity gains. Segment
results were negatively impacted by declines in Solamet paste, as intense competition has impacted price and share in
this business.
In the fourth quarter, we expect to launch a new advantaged paste product in the PV market. The photovoltaic market
continues to be an attractive space for DuPont. We are the market and technology leader and are driving a robust
innovation pipeline aimed at furthering solar cell efficiency and module lifetime, which will support continued growth
in the overall market.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, global photovoltaic module installations are expected to grow, fueled by
installations in China. We anticipate the photovoltaic paste market will remain competitive and expect continued
strength in consumer electronics. Fourth quarter sales are expected to be down in the low single-digit percent range,
primarily due to lower metals pricing, with operating earnings up in the mid-single-digit percent range.
In Performance Chemicals on slide 14, segment sales of approximately $1.6 billion were down 8% due to the portfolio
change in chemicals and fluoroproducts. Prices for this segment were lower in aggregate, with slightly higher volumes
in chemicals and fluoroproducts, offset by lower volumes in TiO2. Operating earnings were down 5%, primarily due to
lower segment prices.
In TiO2, volumes were down 2% from the prior year, due primarily to slower demand from economic challenges in
Europe. Year-to-date TiO2 volume has improved 2% versus the prior year. Despite gradual improvement in industry
fundamentals, TiO2 prices were down 1% sequentially and 3% on a year-over-year basis. We believe our customers'
inventory levels are stable and producer levels remain essentially unchanged. In the fourth quarter, we anticipate low
single-digit percent sales growth and operating earnings growth in the high teens percent range on improved volume
and productivity measures.
Now I'll turn it over to Ellen for her closing thoughts.
Ellen Jamison Kullman
Thanks, Greg, and good morning, everyone.
As Nick highlighted, we delivered a solid quarter, with 20% operating earnings per share growth. We accomplished
this despite the weakening environment in Agriculture, softer demand in Europe, and the impact of our portfolio
changes. Our continued focus on productivity, innovation, and disciplined execution served us well. We'll continue to
rely on that formula in the coming quarters to navigate a persistently challenging and volatile external market.
This morning, I'd like to step back and place the progress we are making in the context of our broad strategic plan. We
have been moving steadily forward on a clear path to deliver higher growth and higher value for our shareholders,
executing a plan that is delivering value today while positioning us for future growth.
A key element of that plan, creating two strong independent companies through the spinoff of our Performance
Chemicals business, is on track and on schedule. Following the spin, DuPont will continue to advance our three areas
of strategic priority. In Agriculture and Nutrition, we are extending our leadership position across the high-value

science-driven segments of the agriculture-to-food value chain. In Advanced Materials, we are strengthening and
growing our leading position in high-value materials businesses by leveraging new technologies. In Industrial
Biosciences, we are building transformational new businesses, leveraging our world-leading biotechnology capability.
Through these areas of focus, we are helping customers find solutions to respond to growing global demand for: more,
safer, nutritious food: high-performance, cost-effective, energy-efficient materials for a wide range of industries; and
increasingly renewably sourced bio-based materials and fuels. We know that our progress in these areas and the value it
creates are of primary importance to our customers and our shareholders. As we leverage the full capability of DuPont
to create new outcomes in these spaces, we're building on the key actions we have taken over the past five years to
increase growth and value. These include ongoing portfolio refinements to focus on emerging areas of opportunity,
aggressive cost management and productivity improvements, and disciplined capital allocation.
Our actions have delivered strong results. Since 2008, our total shareholder return through September 30 was more than
250%, substantially above the S&P 500 and our proxy peers. During the 2008 to 2013 time period, we more than
doubled our operating earnings, excluding pharma, and delivered a 650 basis point improvement in our adjusted
segment operating margins due to productivity improvements.
Throughout this period, we also remained committed to returning capital to shareholders. We returned more than $9
billion to shareholders through dividends since 2009. During the same period, we reinvested about $18 billion in capital
expenditures and research and development to grow the long-term value of our company. In addition, share repurchases
have accelerated, and we executed $2 billion of our $5 billion share buyback program. Looking ahead, we are
committed to reinvesting for long-term sustainable growth while returning capital to shareholders.
As most of you know, we describe DuPont as a science company. That's because over the course of our history, we
have created novel solutions for the needs of any given era by connecting our science to the marketplace. We're doing
this today as we leverage our unique combination of world-class science and technology, deep value chain knowledge,
and deep market insight to solve big customers' problems on a global scale. This total system of innovation continually
renews our portfolio by creating entirely new product lines and a steady flow of new end-market applications for our
products.
In parallel, our innovation system also delivers new ways to lower the cost of making our products. This combination
of new products, new market applications, and lower manufacturing costs is how our innovation system has enabled us
to prosper over so many decades. In 2013, this innovation delivery system generated $10 billion in revenue from new
products launched over the prior four years. Our global reach and infrastructure significantly enhances our ability to
access and penetrate new markets, where we deploy our rich offering of product and solutions to new customers.
In developing countries, where our sales have almost doubled in the past five years, our Agricultural business as first
entrant opens the doors for our other businesses. You can see the full force of DuPont's portfolio leverage and
competitive advantages at work in many of our sector categories.
In Energy, for example, our portfolio of products and technologies are delivering complex solutions that help secure a
better energy future and meet a wide range of customer needs. In Advanced Materials, we provide multiple products for
traditional oil and gas applications to increase output or reduce downtime between repairs. We provide no-mix products
for wind energy applications and Solamet and Kevlar products for photovoltaics. In Industrial Biosciences, we are a
global leader in biofuels with our ethanol fuel enzymes and advanced biofuels like cellulosic ethanol and biobutanol,
enhanced by Pioneer's product offering, deep agronomic knowledge, and access to growers. In Performance Materials,
our products and application knowhow are vital to create lightweight vehicles and improve fuel efficiency.
With our current portfolio, we are a single source of multiple solutions, and we are well positioned to shape and
leverage emerging trends. Importantly, we are uniquely positioned to capture the full breadth of the emerging bio-based
opportunity with all the capabilities needed to create new categories of renewably sourced bio-based materials and
fuels. DuPont's pipeline of next-generation renewable products is poised to drive important growth for the company,
which will create long-term benefit for our shareholders. These opportunities draw directly on the knowledge and
science capability of our bio-based businesses, the chemistry and material science of our Advanced Materials

businesses, and the feedstock knowledge from our Agriculture businesses.
With these competitive advantages as a foundation, we recognize that we need to keep driving for improved
productivity and efficiency. This year, we continued to take decisive actions to build on our strengths, focus our efforts
on areas where our science is advantaged, and accelerate our productivity initiatives. In 2014 alone, we have completed
five portfolio actions to further streamline our portfolio aligned with our science. And as I mentioned, we remain on
schedule to separate the Performance Chemicals segment in mid-2015.
Beyond portfolio optimization, we are accelerating our existing cost and productivity efforts. Over the past five years,
we consolidated 23 businesses into 12 and reduced senior leadership by more than 20%. These measures have
strengthened our operating leverage, as evidenced by our strong margin improvements during the same period. Our
improved processes are driving quicker decision-making, yet we recognize the need to do more.
This year, we are implementing a high-performing operating model for the post-spin DuPont, with a streamlined
structure and a smaller cost base. Following a comprehensive review of our cost structure in connection with the
pending Performance Chemicals separation, we announced our Fresh Start redesign initiative, which is expected to
result in savings of at least $1 billion. As we execute our separation plans, we will continue to explore opportunities to
further streamline both companies and deliver value for DuPont's shareholders.
Against this backdrop of progress and momentum, one of our shareholders, Trian Fund Management, has publicly
disclosed a proposal made to DuPont. We value their input as we do the input of all our shareholders. In that regard, we
have held a number of constructive discussions with Trian. We considered Trian's ideas in the context of our plan to
build a higher growth, higher value company, and we believe Trian's proposals in certain important respects are aligned
with the direction we set more than five years ago and the related actions we are taking. However, we know that our
businesses enjoy competitive advantages from being part of DuPont. The combined power of DuPont's science
platform, our global scale, market access, and infrastructure leverage, along with our established brands and solid
financial foundation have enabled us to deliver strong returns and will continue to do so in the future.
In addition, our current capital structure provides us with important financial flexibility we need to pursue strategic
growth opportunities in light of regional and highly seasonal agricultural cash flows. We know our investors share our
goals for delivering increased value, and we will continue to dialogue with all shareholders.
In closing, our Board of Directors, our management team, and I are confident our plan will deliver sustained and
superior value for our shareholders. Our track record demonstrates that we have a winning strategy in place and are
never finished with operational improvement and portfolio refinement guided by our science advantage to create
significant value for our shareholders. We are moving forward with urgency and purpose to deliver the increased value
you expect, and we look forward to sharing our continued progress with you.

Thanks, Ellen. Let's now open the line for questions on the company's third quarter results and our strategy.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Mike Ritzenthaler from Piper Jaffray.
<Q - Michael Ritzenthaler>: Yes, good morning. I'll just maybe kick it off here by asking for a bit more color on
what's driving the conviction behind the 4Q results in Ag being flat or higher year over year, given some of the
uncertainties around 2015 and the some of the price card changes to products that contain Herculex 1 in Brazil. I'm just

looking for you to weigh those kinds of things.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Great, Mike. Thanks for the question. We expect the weaker environment in Ag to
continue, but there are some positives that are occurring. You see it in our Crop Protection volume, with our new
launches like Dermacor that are taking hold. Seed input costs are lower, so that's a benefit from an earnings standpoint.
We expect shipments for North American safrinha to be about similar with what we saw in the fourth quarter last year,
so that's a draw. Certainly, currency is going to be a negative. But as you know, we've been driving productivity and
cost discipline. And so we think as you factor all those things together, we're going to see the kind of results we talked
about in the fourth quarter.
<Q - Michael Ritzenthaler>: Okay, that makes sense, and a question on FX, I guess. It seemed like this quarter – or
I'm sorry, looking into the fourth quarter, the $0.05 headwind being more or less offset by some of the portfolio and
productivity actions. Is that a reasonable framework to think about how things may play out in 2015? It's obviously
impossible to guess where FX is going to go. But in terms of the portfolio actions, the productivity actions that you're
embracing, could that offset potential FX headwinds?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Nick?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Hi, Mike. As you said, it's extremely difficult to try to forecast what 2015 is going to
do. I believe 2015 will remain a currency headwind for us as we start out the year. And we're talking, like I said, the
fourth quarter of this year being at least $0.05 in the way of a headwind, where before we were saying it was going to
be essentially flat.
The work we're doing around Fresh Start in the fourth quarter will go a long way to offsetting that currency headwind
that we're going to experience in quarter four. We're looking to see about $0.04 benefit there from that productivity
effort. And as far as our ongoing efforts, Fresh Start will continue to see value realized from that work as well as our
underlying D&A productivity work that we have going on in all businesses and all functions, where we're always
looking to, at a minimum, offset inflation. But it's too difficult to call at this point in time what the exact tradeoff will
be between the exchange rates for 2015 and some of those other efforts we have underway.

Our next question is from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Thanks very much. Ellen, will the DuPont board formally vote on the Trian proposal of
splitting the company into an industrial piece and call it a life sciences or agricultural piece, or will it not do so?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: As you know, Jeff, we've been actively engaged with constructive dialogue with Trian
for over a year. In each one of these engagements, the board has been informed and/or involved in some of those
discussions. We continue to dialogue with them, and that's part of the process. We do it with all of our shareholders.
And those conversations are private, and we continue to drive forward on delivering our plan for increased guidance.
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Okay. And then for my follow-up, what's your theory of why the North American corn
business lost a point or two of share in corn, and how might that share loss be remedied in the future?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Sure. As you know, just to put it in some perspective...
<Q - Jeffrey Zekauskas>: Sure.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: ...in corn in North America we've gained some, I don't know, seven points of share
between 2008 and 2013, last year even gaining a point of share. And this year, it's a very competitive market. Corn
acres are down. There's a lot of activity going on. And it looks like if the USDA numbers hold true when they come
and finalize them in January that we lost about a point this year or a little more than that.

We're confident in our future. We gained a point last year; this year we lost a little bit. Next year we've got a great
lineup. We're very confident in the pipeline with the new genetics and the expanding Triple portfolio. It's a very
competitive market area by area, county by county. And I think that we have had good momentum over the past few

Our next question is from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Thank you. Ellen, I noticed that R&D spending was actually down 5% this quarter year over
year. Given the focus on R&D overall in the company, is this more of a trend we should see going forward, or how
should we think about R&D spending?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: I think first of all, our strategy relative to R&D has not changed and our focus on it.
There are two things that I would say you have to consider when you take a look at any individual quarter. And one is
that we do have – a portion of our R&D is done by outside vendors with some of the testing and the things like that and
a lot of the work that's done there. But those invoices are lumpy and relatively large, so when it hits in the quarter or
not is always hard to predict.
I think the second thing to consider is that we expect our research and development to be as productive as we expect the
rest of the company. It's not a sacred cow in that they don't have to improve and get more effective every year. And I
think Doug Muzyka has been leading a tremendous effort at really getting more out of the pipeline and getting more
done and leveraging the resources we have. And so I'm really proud of the work done there. I think most importantly,
our strategy around research has not changed.
<Q - David I. Begleiter>: Ellen, just on Fresh Start, and Nick as well, is there a Phase 2 to this program, any way to
accelerate some of the savings into 2015 from even 2016?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: So as you know, we've been very aggressive in terms of what we said we'll
accomplish in 2015 by the end of the fourth quarter being at a run rate of savings of $660 million – [ph] $600 and some
million (41:08) a year out of the $1 billion a year. We continue to work with the businesses and the functions around
the world at the timing of those moves. Some of it has to occur with the spin. Others we're trying to get ahead of. So I
don't know, Nick, if you want to add anything to that.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: I think as you look at the numbers, David, and you look at the accrual that we took
back in June 30 time period, it was about a little over $260 million, and we're talking about $1 billion worth of value
that's going to be created. So obviously, there will be additional work and effort going on around further accruals and
further savings that will be realized as we projectize a lot of this work that we have going on right now.

And our next question is from P.J. Juvekar from Citi.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Thank you. In soybeans, you're ramping up on Roundup Ready 2 soybeans, so that mostly
explains your share loss there. When do you think you'll be fully ramped up on Roundup Ready 2, and will you be able
to stop the share loss?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: I'm sorry, P.J., you broke up a little bit. Was the question when we'll be fully ramped
up on Roundup Ready 2?
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Right. When will you be fully ramped up and when do you expect to stop that share loss?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: So the transitions are occurring now and it starts small, as you know, and we're in the
ramp of a T Series. And the ramp is going to be based on performance. We're out there actively looking at the test plots

this year. We'll have more data coming through the end of the season. We continue to focus on getting it ramped as fast
as possible, but it has to be based on improved performance than the current varieties, so we're very confident in that.
But I think it's hard to give you right now at this point in time an exact percentage and year. And we'll get clearer on
that as we get the data from this season and move in to really establishing it for the 2015 season.
<Q - P.J. Juvekar>: Thank you, and a quick question for Nick. Nick, this year in 2014, you've benefited from lower
pension liability. But with recent rates going down recently, do you expect headwinds in 2015?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: P.J., obviously with the discount rates declining, that is going to have a negative
impact on our pension liabilities as we go forward next year. Just to give you a sizing, if you were to have a 100 basis
points reduction in interest rate, it's roughly about a 10% impact on our unfunded pension portion of the liability. So it
will have an impact. We'll scale that much more definitively as we close out the year. We look at January rates as we
calculate our unfunded pension going forward.

Our next question is from Bob Koort from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - Robert Andrew Koort>: Thank you, good morning. I was wondering if you could talk. You mentioned that the
card prices in Brazil had to reflect some adjustment for the Herculex trait. What do your card prices in North America
look like, and what are you seeing from a competitive standpoint from the smaller players in that market? We've heard
from your large competitor on pricing, but what's happening across the rest of the markets on corn seed?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Sure, thanks, Bob. As you know, seed establishes the yield and the potential, and
farmers take that decision very seriously. Our price cards are flat that we just put out last month, but we think mix is
going to be a driver in 2015 as it was in 2014, so we think there's going to be a positive impact from mix. Our
experience out working in the fields right now is that growers are still demanding high-yielding product, and we're not
seeing a trading down phenomenon I think there was some concern about.
As for our competition, I don't speak for them. So we're still looking at having the new genetics and the expanded
Triple to be a positive for us from a mix standpoint in 2015.
<Q - Robert Andrew Koort>: And my follow-up, from a competitive intelligence standpoint, what do you think is
happening in the TiO2 markets? Because it seems like other than China, we haven't heard a lot about capacity beyond
your own, yet it seems like the industry is unable to get any pricing improvement despite what I think you referenced, a
couple percent improvement in volume for the industry this year.
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Maybe I'll handle that, Bob. So when you look at the TiO2 industry right now and you
look at volume, we're going to be up for the year probably about 2%. And that kind of volume is in line with GDP
volumes, which if you look back over time in this business, it tracks GDP we've always said very closely. So the
volumes are coming back in line from a macro perspective.
The inventories, if you look at the inventories at our customer base, they remain stable and in line with historical levels.
From a producer basis, it's unchanged at about 60 days, and that's in line with historical averages as well. So when you
look at these market dynamics and what's going on, you would say that the market dynamics are getting stronger and
more back to those normalized levels.
As far as the market price, obviously, that's an area we're going to continue to monitor and react as the market allows
for price increases to occur. Today, it's essentially flattish. If you look sequentially, it may be down just a hair, but it's
sequentially flattish, and year over year it's down about 3%. So that's an area we'll continue to monitor.

<Q - John P. McNulty>: Yes, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So with regard to the Fresh Start
program, at the time you were looking into it and the analysis that went into it, did you look to see if the various
business segment leaders and their divisional teams are, in your opinion, incentivized properly to consistently dig out
costs out of their businesses, and for that matter even to grow them and maximize their performance, or are there
tweaks that you think may need to be made with regard to how each of the business leaders think about their
businesses?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Thanks for the question, John. We have streamlined our compensation plans over the
last few years, aligning them much more closely with increasing shareholder value, aligning the business units much
more closely with getting paid on their performance. And that's not only top line, but it's heavily bottom line and cash
generation. And we have sloped some of those curves that are incentivized upsides to the plan, so to go after it. And we
always look at them versus what their competition is doing. What are you doing versus the competition and
understanding where we peg that plan?
So there's a lot of incentive locally to generate the revenue and the return and keeping costs in line in order to be able to
make their plan and to participate fully in the benefits of that from that standpoint, from a compensation standpoint. So
that's one of the first things we looked at coming out of the global financial crisis is how do we make sure that it is
aligned with where we're driving the company, and I'm really happy with where that is right now.
<Q - John P. McNulty>: Great, thanks for taking my question.

Our next question is from Frank Mitsch from Wells Fargo Securities.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: Good morning, folks. Hey, Nick, when you were talking before about the geographic trends,
you mentioned that China was actually a bit of a bright spot in Asia. And obviously, we've been hearing of some
concerns in the media, et cetera, about the pace of business over there. Could you take a moment or two and walk us
through what exactly is going on in that part of the world and what your expectations are?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: Sure. China volume was up for us about 8%. Sales were up about 5% in the region.
All segments really had positive volume there. PV in China is going to be key to us having a very strong fourth quarter.
I think you realize that we're talking about PV industry in the mid-teens in the way of year-over-year growth, and China
probably represents close to half of that. So it's a big part of the overall PV growth, and we're seeing that and we're
expecting that to be strong in the fourth quarter as well. Auto builds for China were up about 10% in the third quarter;
again, strong performance in that regard, and our sales in crop, 9% increase there, DPT [DuPont Protection
Technologies] was up. TiO2 was up. So across the board, we saw increases within the region.
<Q - Frank J. Mitsch>: So what concerns do you have looking out in Q4 and beyond in that area? And I guess on the
same token, you mentioned that EMEA is likely to be sluggish over the next three months. What would your thoughts
be as you look out into 2015 in that part of the world?
<A - Nicholas C. Fanandakis>: EMEA is a concern because it is in a very sluggish mode right now. I read reports that
say that they might be heading towards the third recession since the global financial crisis. So all of Europe is a concern
for me and how quickly it's going to stabilize and start to bounce back. I think EMEA needs a catalyst. It needs a
catalyst for growth. And I'm not sure exactly what that catalyst is going to be, but that's going to be necessary to see a
turnaround within the region.
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Just one thing I would add to that is that automotive has been holding up Europe for a
while, and it has hesitated here towards the end of the year a little bit in Europe. And we think as you take a look at it,
they're predicting automotive to be about the same kind of growth next year as they've seen next year. So that's going to
be a key indicator for us on how we take a look at it.

The other thing I would look at is that Nutrition & Health really is, in China specifically, I'm back to your China
answer, showing great results. We've invested in plants. We're filling those plants. The probiotics are going very, very
well. And they are really doing a great job of penetrating a marketplace in China that is crying out for science-based
solutions to deal with food safety issues and things like that. So that's a real positive for us from a China standpoint.

Our next question is from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.
<Q - Vincent Stephen Andrews>: Thank you and good morning, everyone. Maybe we could talk a bit about seed
input costs for next year. You noted that they were down in the quarter, and so just a couple of things on that. Is what
you're seeing now, is that the continued give back of the price pressures or the cost pressures that came from the 2011
and 2012 drought-type scenario, or is it you're seeing actually continued relief based on the 2014 harvest, the size of the
harvest and the lower commodity prices?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: I think as you take a look at it, it all plays together as you go out through time. The
input prices were going up, the stocks you use were lower, now the stocks you use are much higher. Those input prices
have come down, as we've all seen, and that will have a positive impact on 2015. This is just one element of many that
creates success in that marketplace, but it's one that we actively work and understand how we can make that come out
in the right place.
<Q - Vincent Stephen Andrews>: And I think, Ellen, you said it was about 100 basis points for 2014, if I'm correct.
That was your last estimate there. Is there any update to that, and should we be expecting about the same in 2015?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: I think it's too early to call there. I know we're actively looking at what's coming out
of the fields right now and things like that and what we're doing. And I think we'll be able to speak to that with more
certainty in the coming weeks and months.

Our next question is from Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial.
<Q - Donald D. Carson>: Yes, a follow-up question on Ag, and that's your South American soy strategy. I know
you've launched your Dermacor seed treatment this fall. I was just wondering what types of market acceptance you're
seeing. And longer term, can you meet your growth objectives in South American soy without having access to an
Intacta license?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: First, I want to tell you that I'm very pleased with the Dermacor launch and what we're
seeing. We are on over 3 million acres. It's exceeded our expectation, and I think the team down there has done a great
job in that marketplace with that. So over time, we continue to understand what we require in order to be successful in
that marketplace. It's not only around the germplasm and continuing the genetic side of that, where we've made a lot of
gains over the last few years. And so our product portfolio, we continue to drive it, and we'll see where that goes.
<Q - Donald D. Carson>: And a follow-up on just consolidation in the agricultural space, there seems to be room for
one more large transaction covering both crop protection and seed. What's DuPont's appetite for participating in further
major industry consolidation, and are you disadvantaged if you don't participate?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: So we have been very clear around our acquisition strategy and where we are focused,
and Ag and Nutrition is clearly a focus for us. We understand these marketplaces. We understand the competitive
strengths and weaknesses and our own. And if we ever see that there's an opportunity where there would be benefit to
our shareholders by doing something there, we would absolutely drive it. Because it is about innovation; it is about
connecting to that marketplace. You saw the advantages that we've seen from the Pannar acquisition that we completed
last year, and that's been a real positive for us. So we don't believe we're disadvantaged today, but we understand that

Our next question is from Kevin McCarthy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: Yes, good morning. Brent crude oil, as you know, is off more than 22% since midyear. I
was wondering if you could talk about the impact of that across the portfolio, and in particular address whether or not
you would expect destocking in any product lines. And also whether or not – it looks to be a record margin in
Performance Materials in the quarter, whether you would view that as sustainable with the high end of the global cost
curve coming down overseas for some competitors?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Thanks, Kevin. Oil does have an impact on us, not as big as it used to with our
changing portfolio. It basically impacts us in Performance Materials and Safety & Protection. It's coming down. Will
we see relief on some raw material streams that greatly impact it, and there will be maybe a tailwind there from a 2015
standpoint.
Our Performance Materials margins are industry leading. We do understand that there is a component of that that has to
do with not only the productivity that we're driving but low-cost natural gas and record ethylene costs. So we do think
that there's a parallel impact not only to oil but to natural gas, and we'll see where that comes off. But ethylene will
change over time, and we have to comprehend that in our future plans. But we continue to watch this and drive it very,
very – from a very disciplined standpoint.
<Q - Kevin W. McCarthy>: As a follow-up, if I may, on the Trian proposal, I think they've estimated excess costs of
$2 billion to $4 billion. Do you have any reaction to that? Do you consider it reasonable or unreasonable? And in their
proposed scenario, what would be the dyssynergies of separating the company in a wholesale fashion in terms of tax
and financing and excess overhead, et cetera, any thoughts on that?
<A - Ellen Jamison Kullman>: Let me start by saying that we've been very focused on productivity from a total cost
standpoint for a number of years. If you look just from 2008 to today, we've taken out more than $2 billion in costs
through our productivity efforts. And you've heard me speak before that we're never done. Obviously, with just wage
inflation, there are hundreds of millions of dollars that comes into our expense line every year that we have to offset
that and we have to continue to drive because our marketplaces are very competitive. So productivity is a focus for us.
We announced earlier this year the $1 billion, at least $1 billion from Project Fresh Start. We're continuing to look at
how we structure and support our businesses to succeed in the marketplace and do it in a very efficient manner, and it's
a focus area for us.
So I'm not sure how the $2 billion to $4 billion was exactly calculated. Sales is a very important marketing or very
important cost for us, not only as R&D but that as well. But we're continuing to engage to understand and see whether
there are other ideas out there because we know in a competitive marketplace we have to be very cost effective to be
successful, not only be a great innovator but be very cost effective.

where TiO2 will be when that comes on. But we will act appropriately given the dynamics of the market and make sure
that that business is delivering against its commitments to our shareholders.

rates stay current where they are, I know you gave the fourth quarter, what's the headwind for full-year 2015 at the

the headwind on that would be.
