MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Hello and welcome to Citi's fixed income investor review with Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach and Treasurer
Eric Aboaf. Today's call will be hosted by Peter Kapp, Head of Fixed Income Investor Relations.
We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given
instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you
have any objections, please disconnect at this time.
Mr. Kapp, you may begin.
Peter Kapp
Thank you, Regina. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CFO, John Gerspach, will
speak first. Then Eric Aboaf, our Treasurer, will take you through the fixed income investor review, which is available
for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions.
Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which
are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual
results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors,
including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings
including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2013 Form 10-K.
With that said, let me turn it over to John.

Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased to be hosting our fixed income investor review this
quarter. Eric Aboaf, our Treasurer, will review some specifics on our balance sheet, liquidity profile, and capital
position, as well is an update on our funding plans for 2014.
Before I turn it over to Eric, however, there are some key points from our second quarter results that I'd like to
highlight on slide two. Earlier this week we reported earnings of $181 million for the second quarter of 2014.
Excluding the impact of the mortgage settlement that we announced on Monday as well as CVA/DVA, net income was
$3.9 billion, up slightly from last year.
Before I get into our operating performance, I briefly want to discuss the settlement. The comprehensive settlement
with the U.S. Department of Justice, the state AGs, and the FDIC resolved all pending civil investigations related to our
legacy RMBS and CDO underwriting, structuring, and issuance activities. We also have now resolved substantially all
of our legacy RMBS and CDO litigation. During the quarter, our institutional businesses performed well outside of
markets where macro uncertainty and historically low volatility reduced client activity, clearly impacting our fixed
income and equities revenues.
Corporate and Investment Banking revenue strengthened, led by strong equity and debt underwriting, and our Treasury
and Trade Solutions business again saw underlying revenue growth as volumes continued to increase.
In Consumer Banking, year-over-year comparisons continued to be affected by lower mortgage refinancing activity and
our repositioning efforts in Korea. But we believe these businesses have now stabilized and we're better positioned for
growth in the second half of the year.
Excluding the settlement, Citi Holdings turned a profit for the first time since its formation. And we recently announced
agreements to sell our consumer businesses in Greece and Spain, which will further reduce Holdings assets in the third
quarter.
As Eric will cover in more detail, we maintained a compact balance sheet, and our net interest margin benefited from
our focus on efficiently funding our operations. Despite the mortgage settlement, our capital and liquidity continued to
strengthen. We reached a Basel III Tier 1 common ratio of 10.6% in the quarter, and our liquidity position remained
strong with $435 billion in high-quality liquid assets.
On slide three, we show total Citigroup results adjusted for the settlement and other items noted on the slide. As I just
discussed, on this basis we earned $3.9 billion in the second quarter and $8.1 billion for the first half of 2014, up
slightly from prior periods as lower non-interest revenues were offset by growth in net interest revenue, lower operating
expenses, and a decline in credit costs. Overall, we grew both loans and deposits while improving our operational and
balance sheet efficiency.
And with that, I'll turn it to Eric.
Eric Aboaf
Thank you, John.
Let me start on slide four with a review of how we're managing our balance sheet to achieve several business
objectives. We have deliberately held our balance sheet flat at around $1.9 trillion over the past few years while
expanding our client activity. Managing a compact balance sheet helps us achieve our ROA and leverage ratio goals.
This quarter our assets increased by $15 billion to just over $1.9 trillion.
On the asset side of our balance sheet, net loans were up 4% year over year, as loan growth in Citicorp remained
strong. Cash and investments were 27% of our assets, consistent with recent quarters as we maintained a liquid balance
sheet. We have grown our investment portfolio over the past year to manage our interest rate position and deploy some
of our liquidity. Trading assets and reverses, by contrast, were down 5% year over year, given more muted markets
activity.

On the liability side, we maintained a diversified, stable, and low-cost funding profile. Deposits were roughly half of
our balance sheet, up 3% year over year, as we maintained deposit pricing discipline and continued to improve deposit
quality. Total long-term debt increased by $4 billion during the quarter, as we increased bank-level debt and held debt
at the parent company flat. And repo balances declined as we have reduced our reliance on secured funding at our
broker dealers. Finally, our equity base grew each quarter over the past year through both retained earnings and
preferred stock issuance.
Now turning to slide five, let me discuss our loan growth, which has contributed to our uptick in net interest revenue.
Total Citigroup loans increased 3% year over year excluding the impact of FX and were generally funded with
additional deposits. Consumer loans grew 6%, with broad-based growth across our regions and products. The Best Buy
portfolio acquisition and growth in our U.S. mortgage portfolio led to 6% growth in North America consumer.
International consumer loan volume increased 5%, led by growth in Asia. Corporate loans grew 8%, with contribution
from all four regions. Traditional corporate lending balances increased 9% because we funded previously extended
commitments and generated new loans to our target clients. Trade loans were roughly flat, as we sold the larger portion
of our originations to optimize returns. And private banking loans grew 19%, with growth both internationally and in
North America.
Citi Holdings loans decreased 18% year over year due to expected runoff and asset sales. During the quarter we moved
over $3 billion of loans to held-for-sale, including $2.5 billion of loans related to the sales for our consumer franchises
in Greece and Spain. North American mortgages now represent 81% of total Holdings loans. And credit trends
continue to improve, as you can see on slide 31 in the appendix.
On slide six, I'd like to review the credit trends in Citicorp's consumer and corporate loan portfolios. The top half of the
page illustrates Citicorp's consumer credit trends across our four regions. In the second quarter, global consumer credit
trends remained favorable, with net credit losses declining to 2.39%. In North America, strong credit trends during the
second quarter improved our outlook. And we now anticipate the full-year NCL rate to be roughly in line with the first
half results, slightly better than our previous estimate of around 3%.
Asia remained stable with net credit losses of 85 basis points. In Latin America, we saw a modest uptick in net credit
losses, driven by Mexico cards, as that portfolio continued to season and consumers continued to adjust to fiscal
reforms and the impact of slower economic growth.
The bottom half of the page highlights the high quality of our corporate portfolio. Non-accrual loans as a percentage of
corporate loans continued to improve and were approximately 41 basis points for the entire portfolio at the end of the
second quarter.
On slide seven, we quantify both the developed and emerging markets exposures in our loan portfolios. At the top of
the page, you can see the geographic diversification of our consumer loans. Forty-three percent of our consumer loans
are in the emerging markets, with the five largest countries representing less than 30% of all consumer loans. The
bottom half of the page highlights the geographic diversification of our corporate loan portfolio. Forty-seven percent of
our corporate loans are in the emerging markets, and no single emerging market country accounts for more than 6% of
our total corporate loans.
On slide eight, we provide further context for our consumer credit performance in the emerging markets. We believe
that our favorable credit performance is due in part to our target market focus, which we describe on the left side of the
page. In most of our consumer markets, our retail strategy targets the affluent and emerging affluent in the world's
largest cities. In credit cards and some geographies, we may target a broader spectrum of consumers, including a
portion of the mass market. We believe that these target customers are generally more resilient than the overall market
under a wide range of economic conditions. The Consumer Bank also includes our Commercial Banking business,
which serves small and medium-sized businesses with a focus on companies that value Citi's global capabilities.
On the right side of the page, you can see our consumer credit statistics as well as an assessment of our performance
relative to industry benchmarks for several sub-regions of our franchise. The industry comparison data represents a
composite of statistics available in each country, such as delinquency, non-performing loans, or net credit losses, and it

includes only the portfolios where reliable industry-wide data exists.
Our credit metrics compare favorably to local peers in most of our markets. In Mexico, where we target a broad
spectrum of consumers, our credit performance has been consistently better than or in line with the industry. In many of
our Asian markets, we have executed our target market strategy, yielding low loss rates and favorable credit
performance versus industry peers.
Our credit performance in Korea has been stable, with 90 basis points of NCLs in the second quarter. And our overall
credit quality has been generally in line with peers. Our repositioning efforts in Korea will more closely align our
strategy and target market in Korea with what you see in our large Asia markets.
On slide nine, let me describe our corporate clients, who we serve through a network spanning nearly 100 countries.
Target clients in our institutional businesses are the world's largest corporations, whom we can serve in many countries
and across our business segments and who we also believe are more resilient under a wide range of economic
conditions.
To a significant degree, the geography and composition of our loan portfolio reflects our clients' geographic presence
and banking needs. About three-quarters of our corporate client revenues come from clients we serve in five or more
countries, and approximately 80% of our revenues come from companies with sales greater than $5 billion. We provide
solutions for our clients for a variety of products, including cash management and trade services, foreign exchange,
lending, capital markets, and strategic advisory.
Our emerging market strategy is consistent with our overall corporate strategy and focuses on the overseas operations
of U.S. and European multinationals as well as the emerging champions in these emerging markets. And roughly 80%
of our corporate credit exposures are rated investment-grade.
Now turning to slide 10, let me discuss changes in our deposit base, which continue to serve as a primary source of
funding for the lending activities in our bank. Excluding FX, average deposits grew 4% year over year, despite
continued transfers of deposits from Morgan Stanley following our sale of the MSSB joint venture. Consumer deposits
increased 3%, with growth in each of our regions. Corporate deposits increased 9% year over year, as we saw
continued strong deposit flows in both LatAm and North America.
Our total cost of average deposits decreased five basis points year over year to 51 basis points but increased two basis
points quarter over quarter, due primarily to increases in euro rates and central bank interventions in some of our
emerging markets countries. Deposit costs again declined in North America quarter over quarter.
On slide 11, we highlight the quality of our deposit base across multiple dimensions. Our franchise focuses on sticky,
low-cost deposits to ensure funding stability in times of market stress and which has helped insulate our franchise
somewhat from the reversal of the U.S. quantitative easing. As you see in the first column, approximately 40% of our
deposits are in the U.S., with 60% abroad.
The second column compares time deposits to operating deposit balances. We have continued to reduce our high-cost
time deposits in favor of stickier accounts, such as checking and savings accounts for consumers and cash management
accounts for our institutional clients.
The third column illustrates the liquidity value of our deposit base under the Basel III LCR rules. Under the LCR,
deposits are assigned liquidity values based on their expected stickiness and the type of clients served, generally 90% to
97% for retail deposits, 60% to 75% for corporate deposits, and zero to 75% for financial institution deposits. The
liquidity rules prioritize operating accounts of consumers and corporations and discourage the non-operating balances,
in particular for financial institutions.
Focusing on the deposits that have LCR value, our consumer deposits, including retail and commercial banking
deposits, provide approximately 91% liquidity value, while our institutional businesses have 73% liquidity value,
reflecting regulatory runoff values associated with certain types of deposits. $104 billion of our institutional deposits
have no liquidity value under the Basel III rules, including, for example, corresponding banking balances, some short
tenor time deposits and some deposits by financial institutions. Our historical data suggests that some of these deposits

are actually stickier than the regulations suggest.
On slide 12, let me cover our long-term debt, which is the primary source of funding for our parent company and our
broker dealers and is a valuable liquidity management and funding tool for our banking subsidiaries. During the second
quarter, our long-term debt balances increased by $4 billion to $227 billion. Sequentially, this $4 billion was at the
bank as we prepared for the U.S. version of the Basel LCR. We increased credit card securitizations and long-term
FHLB advances a bit as we purposely strengthened our liquidity buffers to meet the more stringent proposed U.S.
standards. Through the remainder 2014, we are likely to see further modest growth in long-term debt at the bank across
a mix of securitizations and FHLB advances.
By contrast, parent company debt remained flat during the quarter, although we did continue to refinance high-cost
debt with new issuance at lower levels. We expect parent company debt to decline modestly through year-end 2014.
Slide 13 details our debt issuance and redemption activity at our parent company. For full-year 2014, we continue to
expect to issue approximately $20 billion of benchmark long-term debt, consistent with both our previous guidance and
our 2013 issuance levels. We also expect to issue another $10 billion of customer-related and local country debt.
During the first half of 2014, we issued approximately $15 billion, $9 billion of which was benchmark debt. We have
deliberately diversified the composition of our debt issuance this year, with offerings ranging from three years to 30
years, senior to subordinated, and in euros as well as dollars.
We expect maturities of $26 billion in 2014, of which approximately $14 billion occurred in the first half of the year.
We continue to expect to repurchase or redeem $10 billion of debt this year. In the first half of the year, we repurchased
$5 billion through open market buybacks, tender offers, and trust-preferred redemptions, as we continued to refinance
our higher-cost debt at more attractive rates to lower our cost of funds. And we announced a tender offer this week for
up to an additional $2 billion of securities.
Additionally, since 2012 we have issued approximately $9 billion of preferred stock, including $1.7 billion during the
second quarter. As of June 30, our additional Tier 1 capital represented approximately 80 basis points of risk-weighted
assets. We expect to continue to issue preferred stock between now and when the Basel III rules are fully implemented
in 2019 at a measured pace. As we have previously indicated, we expect our preferred stock issuance volume in 2014
will be below 2013 levels. Market developments, the evolution of our balance sheet, and further clarity around
minimum debt requirements or other regulatory developments could alter our outlook for expected issuance and
redemptions.
On slide 14, we cover Citibank's recent securitization activity and our issuance plans for 2014. Our securitization
activity helps us diversify Citibank's funding sources and optimize the firm's liquidity position at cost-effective pricing
levels. Throughout 2014, we expect to issue a total of $15 billion of securitization debt, primarily backed by credit
cards, somewhat more than our previous guidance and in response to investor demand and growth in our bank balance
sheet. This additional securitization activity will complement deposit growth and other funding sources as we plan for
the U.S. LCR rules.
Separately, during the quarter, OneMain Financial successfully completed its inaugural securitization, establishing an
independent source of financing. OneMain issuance is not included in this slide.
On slide 15, I'd like to update you on our liquidity profile. We size our liquidity portfolio to meet our operating needs
and to withstand a variety of internal and regulator-defined stress scenarios on a consolidated basis and at our operating
units. As of June 30, we had $435 billion of high-quality liquid assets based on the Basel III LCR rules, up by $10
billion from last quarter. Our Basel III LCR rose to 123% from 120% last quarter, driven by increased bank level debt
issuance and an improvement in our deposit quality.
We purposely increased our liquidity buffers to prepare for the U.S. LCR, which we expect to be finalized later this
year. As we have indicated previously, the proposed U.S. rules are more stringent than the Basel standards. Based on
our current interpretation of the U.S. LCR proposal, we believe we exceed the proposed minimum requirement. Certain
details, however, regarding how we calculate the LCR under the U.S. rules remain under discussion. So as we clarify

our understanding of the proposal, we expect there could be further refinement to our estimates.
We are also assessing the impact of the Basel Committee's standards regarding the net stable funding ratio, which
measures our liquidity under a 12-month stress scenario. Based on what we know today, we believe that we are in
compliance with the NSFR based on the Basel Committee's standards. We expect further clarity from the Basel
committee later this year and an NPR from the U.S. regulators in 2015.
On slide 16, you can see how our active balance sheet management has helped us maintain a stable net interest margin
during an extended low rate environment while growing our net interest revenue. Net interest revenue was $11.9 billion
in the second quarter, up 2% from last year, driven by higher loan volume and an improvement in funding costs.
Sequentially, our net interest margin declined three basis points to 287 bps in the second quarter, driven by lower asset
yields, partially offset by lower funding costs.
As I described earlier, deposit costs increased by two basis points this quarter due to increases in prevailing rates in
euros as well as central bank interventions in certain emerging markets. This increase was more than offset by
continued declines in the cost of our long-term debt of 19 basis points this quarter and 68 basis points year over year, as
we refinanced maturities at lower rates and bought back higher-cost debt. We currently believe that net interest margin
should remain roughly flat to second quarter levels for the remainder of the year.
Turning to slide 17, let me summarize how we have positioned our balance sheet to create opportunities for higher
revenues in a rising rate environment. We evaluate our overall interest rate position under a range of scenarios,
considering the effect of interest rate changes on net interest revenue and on our capital position.
On the left side of the page, you can see that we have adjusted our interest rate position progressively over time, with
the intention of benefiting from potential increases in interest rates. As of June 30, we estimate that a 100 basis point
parallel rate shock would increase our net interest revenue by $1.9 billion in the first year, of which $1.3 billion relates
to U.S. dollar positions. This would benefit our net interest margin by 11 basis points. In this rate scenario, we estimate
that the value of our securities portfolio would lead to a decline in AOCI of approximately $3.4 billion, for a reduction
of approximately 38 basis points in our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio.
In scenarios two and three on the right side of the page, we illustrate that our net interest revenues would benefit more
from increases in short rates than from long rates. However, these rising rate scenarios only capture part of the potential
benefit to net interest revenue. In many cases, we would expect to see even more revenue upside in later years as we
reinvest our cash in higher rates farther out the curve. These estimates necessarily incorporate many assumptions about
customer behavior, new business, pricing decisions, and prepayment rates, for example.
Turning to slide 18, let me summarize our capital position, which remains among the strongest in the industry. Citi's
estimated Basel III Tier 1 common ratio under the advanced approaches for the second quarter increased at 10.6% from
10.5% in the first quarter, despite the mortgage settlement cost in the quarter. Risk-weighted assets under the advanced
approach have increased by $13 billion, in line with balance sheet growth.
Under the standardized approach, our Basel III Tier 1 common ratio declined to 10.8%. Risk-weighted assets under the
standardized approach grew due to balance sheet growth, including growth in loans and ongoing refinements to our
models. Our estimated SLR increased to 5.7%, aided by the $1.7 billion of preferred stock we issued this quarter.
Citibank's SLR remains in excess of 6%.
On slide 19, we detail the growth in our regulatory capital this quarter, which led to an increase in our capital ratios, as
I just described. On the right side of the page, you can see that both Citicorp and Citi Holdings contributed to the $1.1
billion of DTA utilization. On the left side, we show that the Basel III Tier 1 common equity increased by almost $4
billion this quarter. Of that, $2.2 billion was due to DTA utilization and an increase in the amount of allowable DTA
under the 10% and 15% buckets. The remainder was primarily related to an increase in AOCI related to gains in our
securities portfolios.
Moving to our last slide, let me summarize four major points. First, during the quarter we saw continued progress on a
number of our business priorities. Our consumer and institutional businesses performed well in a difficult operating

environment. We resolved another major legacy issue with our mortgage settlement. Citi Holdings turned a profitable
quarter on an adjusted basis, and we utilized another $1.1 billion in DTA.
Second, we have actively managed our balance sheet with an eye towards achieving our overall financial targets,
maintaining total assets around $1.9 trillion, and optimizing our assets and liabilities to support stable net interest
margin and earnings. Overall credit trends remain favorable across both our consumer and corporate portfolios.
Third, our deposit base remains a key strength as we continue to grow high-quality deposits. Our 2014 issuance plans
are on track and are designed to support the operating and regulatory demands of both the bank and the parent.
And lastly, our capital and liquidity position remains strong relative to the industry.
That concludes our fixed income review. John and I will be happy to take your questions.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ryan O'Connell with Morgan Stanley. Please go
ahead.
<Q - Ryan O'Connell>: Thank you. Very thorough presentation, and in particular I really appreciated the added detail
on the various consumer businesses. Two questions, if I could. One, as you know, Goldman reported that it had reduced
the amount of repo financing it's providing to certain clients for reasons they failed the CCAR, Basel III, things like
that. And so my first question is, has Citi changed the level of its activity in that area?
<A - Eric Aboaf>: Ryan, it's Eric. You can see in our balance sheet report in our supplement that if you look at repo as
one individual line, reverse repo activity is down about $10 billion – $15 billion versus the prior year and prior quarter.
So it was down modestly, but it really bounces around on that line.
I think the broader answer to your question is that active balance sheet management for us is nothing new. We've been
at it for two, three, four years. We've been disciplined about supporting our clients in their financing needs. You see our
loan book has gently grown over the years. And we've also been disciplined on the other side with some of our markets
activities where we see less demand and less activity. And you see that we're pretty willing to adjust our positions in a
way that's quite thoughtful. And I think the net result of that has really been a balance sheet that's pretty flat in a time
where it could have grown, and it's something that we'd like to continue.
<Q - Ryan O'Connell>: Okay, thanks. That's very helpful. Then the second question is just the outlook for
international consumer, which is down about 30% year over year and down quarter too. So I think John had talked
about this on the call, the costs of the credit repositioning, the higher credit provisions in Latin America. And I guess
what I wanted to clarify the comment on the conference call, I think John, you said that repositioning changes would
stay at the Q2 level for a while. Did I get that right?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Ryan, I think the comment you're referring to is that the repositioning charges I said for the
second half of the year for all of Citigroup will be about the same level as we had for the first half of the year.
<Q - Ryan O'Connell>: Okay, so not specifically for international consumer?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, that was a comment for the overall repositioning charges at the group level.
<Q - Ryan O'Connell>: Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then just in terms of what's going on with credit quality in
Mexico, again, you've been very candid about that. But is it a given what's going on with the 90 days in the NCLs? Is it
reasonable to assume that provisions will stay at this level for a while for LatAm?
<A - Eric Aboaf>: What we said on the call was that our expectation is that the NCL rate for Latin America for the
second half of the year again should be roughly equivalent with what we had in the first half of the year, so we'll let it

Your next question will come from the line of Robert Smalley with UBS. Please go ahead.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Hi, a couple different questions and thanks for doing the call, John and Eric. John, you started
off you mentioned the settlement. In there, there is a material amount of consumer relief. Could you talk about the
accounting for that? Do these loans get written down and then go back on performing? And I think you had another
settlement where you've had another amount of consumer relief as well. How do you look at that in terms of drag on
the NIM or just not as productive assets as they could be?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: The answers to your questions are not quite, yes, and a little bit. In starting where I think
you started with the consumer relief portions of the current settlement, there are a lot of different elements that
comprise the consumer relief in a portion of the settlement that we announced on Monday. Some of them involve
forgiveness of loans or interest on loans. A good portion of them also involve where we will provide financing to help
the various government agencies, HUD, provide affordable housing, specifically construction of rental units in certain
areas of the country. So there are a variety of elements.
Some of the loans where we will be providing very specific relief, those are loans where we may have already taken
write-downs, and then some of them could be loans where we're taking new actions. So depending upon what category
the specific consumer relief comprises, you're going to get different treatments on the assets. I don't know if that gives
you specifics.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: That's helpful. And just in terms of the overall impact, P&L impact, some but not a lot I guess
is your answer.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: What we've done is we've looked at all the different components of the $2.5 billion worth of
consumer relief. We've come up with an estimate as to what those components will cost us over the timeframe in which
we'll be conducting those relief efforts. And that cost, what we estimate to be the full cost of those efforts, was included
in the $3.8 billion charge that we took in the quarter.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Okay, that makes sense. Thank you. Secondly on OCI, and thank you for the other detail on
slide 34. I was hoping to link the two. When I'm looking at slide 17, you've got a 10-year rate rising by 100 basis points
and the AOCI – I'm sorry, the Basel III Tier 1 effect 13 basis points. I'm mapping that to on page 34 what we saw in the
second quarter of 2013, where we had a 64 basis point rise. And if I'm reading this right, then in terms of rate and other
OCI, that cost 14 basis points. So what it appears to me is that you've got the extra call it 36 basis points similar type of
impact. So what have you done with the portfolio between then and now to insulate against higher rates? And have you
actually tried to take out more of the risk of spikes as opposed to just a general rise?
<A - Eric Aboaf>: Rob, it's Eric. Let me give you a little bit of color first in terms of interpreting the slide 17 scenario
and the slide 34 actuals, and then I'll touch on the question a little more broadly. Just to be clear, slide 17 is a very
simple rate shock. It's a 100 basis point shock in interest rates across the full curve, from overnight all the way to
30-year. It is around the world for every interest rate in every currency, so it's a globally synchronized shock, and we
do that just as a point of reference.
What you see in contrast on page 34 is actually the actual rate changes that occurred. What we listed out here, just for
reference, is the U.S. dollar 10-year yield change across each of those quarters, including the 64 basis points that you
referenced in the second quarter of 2013. But obviously, the curve didn't move in a full parallel shock in the U.S. let
alone by those amounts in each of those international currencies. So that's what's going to result in a different amount
of AOCI change that you see on the table at the bottom of page 34 relative to what you see on page 17, just to try to be

clear.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Okay, good.
<A - Eric Aboaf>: And then I think the broader question you asked is did we adjust our interest rate position on our
portfolio, and the answer is that we gently adjusted the position. You see that on page 17, but moved a little bit on a
one-year interest rate exposure basis. And you can imagine that we – and as we've said, we like to run short to be
prepared for rising rates. And what we'll do as we see shifts in the curve, whether it's the dollar curve, the euro curve, or
some of the emerging market currencies, we will tactically adjust our positions at the front end or the back end, and
that's really what ends up moving the [IRE] numbers on page 17 around as you saw.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Okay, but no dramatic changes in strategy or outlook?
<A - Eric Aboaf>: No, not at this point.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Okay, last one for me. On FICC earnings, everybody came in a little better than expected,
where flat or slightly down was much better than down a lot. As far as your operations go, your FICC trading business
and underwriting business are as big as anyone's at this point. I think last call we talked a little bit about trying to
dimension/size the operation with respect to the market. My question is, what kind of metrics are you using to judge
success here? In terms of return on equity targets, what are they, allocated capital? And are you including some of the
other ancillary things you need to do to do those businesses, say, extending loans and revolvers to clients in order to get
equity and debt underwriting businesses in that calculation?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: So, Robert, it's John. I'm not going to go into the individual metrics of the businesses. But
first and foremost, we look at the overall returns of the ICG because again, for us, the ICG is not so much a collection
of individual product areas. It's really a client-centric business.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Right, obviously.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: So we view all of these product areas as means to provide solutions for our clients. And so
our first set of targets really are the overall returns, both from an ROTCE and ROE and an efficiency ratio
measurement that we establish for the ICG. And we've shared with you the efficiency target that we have for the ICG.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: Right.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: And in the investor deck we used both at the conference that we spoke at, at the end of May
as well as with the deck that we used with Monday's investor call, we also showed you the current return on allocated
tangible common that we're getting out of the ICG. So those are the real measurements.
After that, it becomes one of how do we want to apportion our resources then and what's the right capacity in each of
the product areas that we use to provide solutions for our clients? And that's been an ongoing recalibration. We've had a
certain amount of discussion, both within our shop and I think the whole industry has as far as how much of the impact
that we've all seen in the FICC markets have been cyclical impacts as opposed to secular. And so we have clearly
adjusted our capacities in each of the products, both from the amount of balance sheet that we will devote to the FICC
products as well as the level of front office and back office head count that we have in those businesses. So it's very
much an ongoing recalibration of the business as we try to manage to the overall returns for the ICG.
<Q - Robert Smalley>: That's very helpful. Thanks a lot, I appreciate it.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Not a problem.

<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hi, James.
<Q - James D. Strecker>: Thanks for having the call. I just wanted to echo with what Brian and Rob both said. We
really appreciate the additional color here. I think it differentiates you versus your peers and definitely helps your
spreads, in all honesty; a couple of high-level questions and then maybe one on the funding side. Going back to the
settlement from Monday, any color you can offer on the CDO component of that as we try to just size that piece of it?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No. As we said on Monday, it was a comprehensive settlement negotiated over a pretty
extended period of time. So I'm not going to break the various cost elements down. I'm not quite sure that I could give
you precision there. But clearly for us, it was very important that we get as broad a relief as possible on the CDO
activities. And so we think that the terms of the settlement as announced give us the release that we were looking for
with regard to the CDO structuring activity that we had.
<Q - James D. Strecker>: Okay, fair enough. I figured I'd ask. Maybe then I'll just jump into the funding side of it. So
as we sit here and try to dimension the ultimate Tier 2 bucket for the advanced approaches banks, I know it's pretty
hard to do right now because you've got differences in terms of like transitional, whether you're being held to the
standardized versus advanced approaches in a given quarter. But if we look at it from a fully phased-in basis, is it fair to
say that you all would try to run as close as possible toward the 60 basis points of allowable loan loss reserves? Or how
should we think about that bucket because obviously it makes a big difference in terms of potential sub debt need?
<A - Eric Aboaf>: James, it's Eric. I think in asking your question, you actually threw out a number of the dimensions
that we look at, whether it's Basel I, whether it's Basel III transitional or Basel III fully phased-in, and therein lies some
of the answer, as you surmised, which is over time we'll find a way to converge, but it will take time.
In terms of if you fast-forward to the Basel III era, clearly Tier 2 capital has two components. It's got the underlying
qualifying sub debt and then it has what are actually excess reserves over expected credit losses, which is a risk-based
calculation. And we'll have to see how we run year after year and quarter after quarter on that latter category. And then
we'll effectively fill in the rest of the two percentage points of Tier 2 with sub debt. And so you'll see us monitoring
that. You'll see us phasing that in. Just like some of our other work that we've done, like in the alternative Tier 1 space,
we'll do that over time.
<Q - James D. Strecker>: Okay. Is it fair to say that given that regulators and investors are presumably looking for an
elevated level of loan loss reserves versus the pre-crisis norm that you would view that more favorably? I'm not trying
to box you into anything here. I'm just trying to think about potential supply. And since you need to have it anyway,
why necessarily come to the sub debt market to fill that entire bucket? Is that fair?
<A - Eric Aboaf>: I think that's a fair hypothesis. The way I'd say it is pre-crisis, there were not very many loan loss
reserves on the books of banks.
<Q - James D. Strecker>: Right.
<A - Eric Aboaf>: And so they wouldn't have gotten the benefit in the Tier 2 bucket of excess reserves as it's now
calculated. I think going forward, it's much more likely we will have some contribution from the excess reserves. The
question will be how much, and that will be the first port of call as to how to think about Tier 2, and then the balance
will be sub debt.
<Q - James D. Strecker>: Okay, and then maybe a high-level one for John, if you don't mind. Obviously, the situation
in the Ukraine and Russia has escalated in the last day. In Q2, Citi called out some hedging losses in EMEA,
presumably around this same situation. How should we think about your exposure there, what your willingness is to put
on additional hedges, things like that, for the current quarter?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Let's separate it actually into two separate discussions. One is, as we did in the first quarter
10-Q, we'll clearly update you as to what our various positions in Russia are. And in general, I think we laid out our
exposure in Russia as about $9.6 billion or so worth of credit exposure and a capital base of $1.7 billion or so. We'll
update you on those figures. You can assume that the exposure is down somewhat from the first quarter.

With regard to the losses that I spoke about on the call on Monday, they were not losses specific to our Russia
franchise. They were derisking positions that we had put on for our overall equity portfolio back early in the second
quarter when we were first looking at what some of the impacts might be. Those positions, as I said, were lifted
because the markets did not react as badly as we thought we had and we absorbed the losses that we had on those
positions in the second quarter. As to what extent we'll think in terms of putting on hedges for the current situation, I'm
really not going to go into that at this point in time.
<Q - James D. Strecker>: Okay, understandable, one last ticky-tacky one, if you don't mind. Was there a market gain
in the quarter and what was the geography of that if there was one?
<A - Eric Aboaf>: We did have a gain on the equity investment that we had in market. It was included in our equities
figures.

Your next question will come from the line of Michael Rogers with Conning Asset Management. Please go ahead.
<Q - Michael J. Rogers>: Yes, good morning. You mentioned in the early comments that the settlement had resolved
all pending civil investigations. I'm just wondering. Are there any criminal investigations that remain ongoing?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: All I can say as far as ongoing investigations is we give you a listing of all the significant
investigations that we're currently involved with in our 10-K and our 10-Q, and you should take a look at what's going
on in there.
<Q - Michael J. Rogers>: Okay, I will check that, John. Secondly, any update on when we can expect – I know there's
an ongoing question. Certainly it's getting a little old, but when we can expect any further info on OLA? And I guess
related to that, to the extent that S&P uses that as the catalyst for a possible one to two notch downgrade of you and
some of your peers' senior debt ratings, how might that affect counterparties' ability to continue to do business with you
in the same magnitude that they were able to do before any downgrades?
<A - Eric Aboaf>: Michael, it's Eric. We don't have new news on OLA. I think we're awaiting some rulemaking or
some announcement, but I don't know anything that anything is imminent and we really don't have timing at this point.
So probably I think we're all in the same bucket of wait and see.
In terms of catalysts, I suppose it could be a catalyst for S&P. S&P has been clear that they're monitoring the situation.
They on an ongoing basis are taking a look at it. We'll just have to see. I think to the more tactful question you asked,
which is how would that affect your position with counterparties and so forth, I guess I'd have to tell you that over the
last couple years as we've seen ratings changes, we've not seen a lot of changes in terms of those willing to do business
and not willing to do business with us. You've seen our CDS have not reacted and our bond spreads have not reacted
very much, and so we don't really see much of an impact.
<Q - Michael J. Rogers>: Okay, thank you for that, and last one I guess I have for John. John, aside from the
geopolitical risks that have already come up in the discussion, what would be your chief worry at the present moment?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: I'd be afraid to give you that on the basis that I'd miss two or three others. I think if you
asked any of our peer institution CFOs, they'd tell you they tend to sleep at night like a baby; they wake up every two
hours and cry. So I'm not quite sure that there's any one in particular item that I would give you.
<Q - Michael J. Rogers>: Okay, thank you both.

Your next question will come from the line of Pri de Silva with CreditSights. Please go ahead.
<Q - Pri de Silva>: Good morning, John and Eric. In terms of – is the cash consideration of the settlement reflected in
your second half funding plans?
<A - Eric Aboaf>: Pri, it's Eric. The funding plan that I've given you is an all-in funding plan for the whole company
and includes all the changes in the balance sheet that we expect. It includes changes in lending assets, in trading assets,
in reverses. I could go down the 10 lines of the asset side of the balance sheet and the 10 lines of the liability side of the
balance sheet. And so it absolutely incorporates everything, including any sort of settlements.
<Q - Pri de Silva>: And the second question that I have, Ryan went in there. In terms of the SLR, I know that we all
had some time to evaluate the finalized version. How do you see it impacting the balance sheet, particularly on the repo
side of the trading book? And also, do you see it impacting various businesses and leading to lower levels of activity
and also wider bid/ask spreads, especially for the fixed income side?
<A - Eric Aboaf>: Pri, it's Eric. I think that's a fair question. I think you saw that we reported an SLR of 5.7%, so we're
well above the standard and we have every intention of staying there. I think what you have seen is that the SLRs had
different impacts on different banks around the U.S. and around the world. Some banks are a good bit below the 5%
standard and have to literally exit portions of their book, and we've seen some of that over the recent quarters. And
other banks like us have actively managed our balance sheet for a number of years, and so we haven't have had to take
any drastic actions recently.
I think what you'll see us do is continue to be careful and disciplined in how much client financing in the form of
reverse repo that we do. We don't have the largest book out there. We don't have any intention of having the largest
book out there. And so we'll continue to run it in a very targeted and thoughtful way for our best clients. That's what we
do. And in other areas, we'll also be very disciplined. You saw our loan book continues to grow in the mid-single digits.
We've seen some nice opportunities in corporate loans in particular that have grown high single digits.
On the other hand, in trade finance we've seen more limited opportunities to earn the returns and spreads that we would
like that would support our ROA or SLR objective. And so we've moved to more of an originate-to-sell model and
actually limited the balance sheet growth in that product. So those are the kinds of actions and approaches we're taking.
And like I said, it's something we've been doing for several years and obviously will continue to do as we conform to
the variety of rules and incentives.
<Q - Pri de Silva>: Thank you. That was actually very helpful, thank you.

<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Thank you very much for having me participate on the call; John, a question for you
following up from the call earlier in the week regarding the Shared National Credit exam. I wasn't completely clear
whether your results reflect the possible reclassifications that may have occurred to some of the loans on your books
from the Shared National Credit exam that the regulators of course do every spring. Is that the case or no, or is the
reserving not really reflective of that yet?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Gerard, it's always nice to talk to you, especially twice in one week. We don't have a rule
against double dipping, so we're more than happy to talk to you twice.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Thank you.

Having said that, we have gotten the preliminary feedback from the regulators concerning this year's exam; and I would
say that based upon that preliminary feedback, we'd have minimal changes to either our ratings, our classifications, or
our reserving actions.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Great, that's very helpful. Another question, there were a couple of stories in The Wall
Street Journal in June about some potential problems in China with loans that are secured by I think inventories of
some types of commodities and there may be some fraud related. But Citigroup was mentioned in the story along with
Standard Chartered, maybe a few others. Do you guys have any further color on that?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: When you look at the stories that are hitting the paper, in total we've got – I think our
exposure is we've got roughly $400 million worth of repo commodity financing to our clients in China. I'd say
approximately $280 million or so of that exposure is related to the two ports that are most in question, Penglai and
Qingdao. Those are the two ports that I think most people have mentioned as far as being involved with fraud around
the sale and storage of physical metal. But at this stage, we believe the activities are isolated and just specific to those
very specific locations.
Now it's important though when you take a look at the numbers that I've given you, the financing that I'm talking about,
we have provided to clients that are non-Chinese subsidiaries of large multinational corporations and the contracts are
guaranteed by the parent companies. So we have no direct exposure to local Chinese counterparties.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: That's very helpful, thank you. And then finally, I know it's been I guess since April when
Mexico came out with their competitive studies, how they want the financial services industry in Mexico, the banking
industry, to become more competitive. Have you guys given it more thought on the long-term implications of what that
might do for Banamex? Will it affect its profitability? Have you been able to determine that yet on what you understand
what these changes are going to be?
<A - John C. Gerspach>: No, Gerard. We're still working through all of the implications of the report. It's something
that we'll certainly continue to discuss, and we'll take all of that into consideration as we think in terms of how to
position the franchise for 2015 and beyond.
<Q - Gerard S. Cassidy>: Thank you, John. I really appreciate it. Thank you, again.

Your next question will come from the line of Louise Pitt with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Louise Pitt>: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks very much for doing the call. I guess it's good afternoon just
now. A lot of them have been asked, but I just wanted to clarify some of the comments that you made about potential
issuance. And specifically you said that you would do fewer prefs this year than you did in 2013. I think you're
currently year to date around $750 million to $800 million below last year's level. Does that mean there's room for one
more issuance of prefs this year if the market is available, or are you done for this year?
<A - Eric Aboaf>: Louise, it's Eric, fair question. I think last year we did just north of about $4 billion of issuance.
You've seen what we've done this year so far in aggregate. And I think we've been pretty clear we'd like to continue to
issue. But we're planning on doing less than last year. I give you that data on a full-year basis because I think it's a little
more helpful that way. Hopefully that helps you.
<Q - Louise Pitt>: Okay, great, and then a follow-up question. I make it from the numbers that you provided for
maturities, redemptions, issuance, et cetera, that there's probably slightly over $10 billion of benchmark issuance left
for this year. Are you looking primarily at the dollar market for that, or are looking internationally given the mix of
your funding right now?

<A - Eric Aboaf>: Louise, we tend to do the bulk of our issuance in dollars. I think you've seen that over the last few
years. That said, some of the foreign currency basis and the embedded credit spread that we can issue at in euros has
started to normalize with dollars. Yen has gotten a little closer. So we continue to look around the world and see where
there are opportunities. But in effect, what we do because we are a dollar-based firm is we look at it on an
apples-to-apples basis. And so I think primarily dollars, and we will supplement that outside as we see some nice
opportunities. Currently we like a wide footprint, so we'll continue in that direction.
<Q - Louise Pitt>: Okay, perfect. I'm sorry, just a last, more detailed question. In terms of the liability management
exercises, I know you guys always provide a generic reason behind it. But given the one that you announced this week,
is there anything specific behind the bonds that are included in this latest one? I know I always ask the same question,
but it's a little random from you guys.
<A - Eric Aboaf>: Nothing particularly specific. We continue to look for opportunities. I think if you had a chance to
look on our average balance sheet schedule which shows our cost of funds and our yields, you see our cost of funds
have been systematically brought down on the long-term debt line. And a lot of what we've been actively doing in
liability management is working those funding costs. And so the general heuristic is we look for debt that is more
expensive than it should be that might trade wide to the curve. And we tend to like to retire those bonds and then
reissue something that is closer to benchmark.
<Q - Louise Pitt>: Okay, perfect. Thanks a lot.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Thank you.

Your final question will come from the line of Jeff Bernstein with Cutwater. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jeffrey Bernstein>: Hi. I had a question about Citi Holdings. Obviously, we've been watching the charts for quite
a long time and watching the numbers come down and improve. How long would you say we should be looking for Citi
Holdings as an entity? On a run rate basis, we could be looking at this thing for a very long time. I wanted to know if
you had made any comments as to how long this could go on.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Hi. It's John. I don't want to put a time span on Citi Holdings. I don't think – if you take it to
the extreme, to your point, if we wait until the absolute last mortgage pays off, Holdings could go on for decades yet. I
don't see that happening. At the same point in time, I don't see it going away while we still have the assets, the level of
assets that we currently have in Holdings and the fact that it still includes a wide array of businesses in it.
So I think it has served a very useful purpose for us by being able to, one, differentiate the future of Citi as opposed to
the past. And more importantly from a management point of view, by putting a very specific team against the Holdings
assets, I think that it has really enabled us to bring those assets down much faster and with a much more concerted
effort than we would have had had we left all of those assets in the various businesses. So I'd say it's got some time yet
to run, but I wouldn't say it's going to be around very, very long.
<Q - Jeffrey Bernstein>: Thank you very much.
<A - John C. Gerspach>: Okay, not a problem.
