Clay C. Williams
Thank you, Loren. This morning we announced that National Oilwell Varco earned $1.42 per fully diluted share from
continuing operations and $1.44 per share attributable to the company for all operations in its second quarter ended
June 30, 2014. Consolidated revenues from continuing operations were $5.3 billion, up 7% sequentially and up 12%
year-over-year.
Operating profit from continuing operations excluding transaction costs was $945 million, or 18% of sales. EBITDA
from continuing operations excluding nonrecurring items was $1.141 billion, or 21.7% of sales. The second quarter
included $31 million pre-tax or $0.05 per share after tax in transaction-related charges, mostly due to the spin-out of
our DistributionNOW business, which we completed during the second quarter. Adding these back our earnings were
$1.47 per fully diluted share from continuing operations. Continuing earnings excluding non-recurring items of $1.47
are consistent with what we had reported in the past. And on this basis for all periods, second quarter earnings were up
14% sequentially and up 19% from the second quarter last year.
We've seen many changes at National Oilwell Varco this quarter, including our spinout of our DistributionNOW
business. This morning we will be detailing our results along new business segments with new disclosures following
our reorganization during the second quarter. Among these is our reporting of certain amortization expenses of
purchased intangible assets. These were $91 million pre-tax or $0.14 per share after tax for the second quarter of 2014.
Excluding these and excluding discontinued operations and non-recurring items, second quarter 2014 operating
non-GAAP earnings per fully diluted share were $1.61, up 13% sequentially and up 16% year-over-year on the same
basis for all quarters. We offer this supplemental non-GAAP disclosure to lend more transparency to our cash flow
generating capability per share, and Jeremy will speak to this more in a few moments.
Overall on either basis of presentation, we are pleased with double-digit earnings growth for our shareholders for the
second quarter, which reflects skillful execution of projects and backlog and improving market conditions across North
America and other parts of the world. In particular, we are seeing the major North American shale plays growing.
Domestic E&P wellhead cash flows are rising with increased production and strong commodity prices and producers
are choosing to plow back more of their cash into new shale drilling.
While activity gains were partly offset by seasonal break-up in Canada, our outlook for Canada is strengthening for the
second half. Activity is leading to rising demand for frac equipment, coiled tubing units and for new build land rigs
required to maximize shale drilling efficiency, adding to continued strong land rig demand overseas, particularly in
Latin America and the Middle East.
Offshore demand held up well through the second quarter, but as we discussed last quarter, we expect the second half
of 2014 to be more challenging. We see the market for new floating rigs softening for at least the next few quarters due
to lower day rates pressured by new uncontracted capacity coming into the market. Nevertheless, we still see some
floater demand through this period for special capabilities required for the Arctic, for high-pressure 20,000 PSI
prospects, for the North Sea Midwater market and for well intervention and construction activity. And with very few
floaters scheduled to be delivered in 2017, we could see opportunistic investors, whether traditional drilling contractors
or entrepreneurs, decide to place orders some point in 2015.
So with respect to rig systems capital orders, we expect a decline for new build floaters, but some level of demand for
these special floating rigs continuing. We see steady demand for jack-ups, at least for the second half of 2014, and we
see a pronounced increase in demand for land rigs for the next several quarters. But land rigs and jack-ups will not fully
offset falling floater demand.
Importantly, analysis of NOV's financial results in rig building through the past decade demonstrates that earnings and
cash flow can and do remain strong through cyclical order downturns. Over the next several quarters we expect the
following factors to underpin solid revenue and earnings performance within our Rig Systems segment. One, our record
backlog with approximately 180 offshore new builds underway today; two, equipment demand associated with
five-year special periodic surveys of offshore rigs, which we see tripling between now and 2017; three, general
equipment upgrade demand around offshore rig hookload capacity and BOPs; and four, rising backlog for land rigs and

land equipment. Expect these to buffer Rig Systems' segment revenues from the volatility in deepwater new build
orders.
Offshore rig new build projects, floaters and jack-ups accounted for approximately $1.4 billion or 27% of NOV's
consolidated second quarter revenues, all within the Rig Systems segment. That segment also generated almost $1
billion from the sale of land rig new builds and replacement and upgrade components for both land and offshore
drilling rigs. Again, our backlog should help sustain results for the former for the next several quarters while rising
demand should strengthen the latter for the next several quarters.
During the second quarter, the Rig Systems segment won orders totaling $2.3 billion, up 8% from the first quarter, and
its book-to-bill was 110%, lifting backlog to a record level of $15.4 billion for this segment. Backlog for Rig Systems
is up 2% since year-end 2013 and up 41% since year-end 2012.
Offshore new build orders included five floaters and two jack-ups during the second quarter. Our new Rig Aftermarket
segment is closely related to the Rig Systems segment operationally and serves to support the growing install base of
NOV drilling equipment operating in the field. This segment grew 5% sequentially and 17% year-over-year in the
second quarter, consistent with its annual growth results for the past several years. It is high margin and highly strategic
to our offering in the drilling equipment space. That's why we continue to invest heavily in facilities and skilled
personnel to ensure that NOV continues to provide the high level of aftermarket support our customers expect. It
provides clear differentiation to premium NOV drilling technology and we foresee a bright future as our install base of
rigs continues to expand.
Our new Wellbore Technologies segment provides critical products and services designed to improve drilling
performance. Drill bits; drill pipe, including IntelliServ wire drill pipe; tubular inspection and coating; drilling motors
and reamers; solids control; waste management; drilling fluids; drilling optimization; and instrumentation services
provided by the group all serve to improve efficiency, safety and environmental impact of drilling operations. Although
this segment is levered to drilling activity, it posted 13% sequential growth despite the second quarter global rig count
decline arising from the Canadian break-up. Year-over-year, Wellbore Technologies segment second quarter sales were
up 18%.
Finally, our new Completion & Production Solutions segment provides equipment to complete and produce wells,
along with some sales into certain industrial markets. This group engineers and manufactures equipment into hydraulic
fracture stimulation operations, wireline and coil tubing technologies, composite piping solutions and critical
technologies such as turret mooring systems and flexible pipe to support deepwater field developments. The group
posted 12% sequential revenue growth and 7% year-over-year growth.
Orders for the Completion & Production Solutions segment were extraordinarily strong, $1.1 billion for the second
quarter, more than double first quarter orders and representing a book-to-bill of 186%. Growth was across the board.
Floating production system components and subsea flexible pipe won some very large second quarter orders, which we
don't expect to repeat in the third quarter, but strong second quarter frac and stimulation equipment demand appears to
be continuing to build as we enter the third quarter. Second quarter ending backlog for Completion & Production
Solutions was a record $2.1 billion, up 31% from year-end 2013 and up 60% from year-end 2012. Jeremy will provide
more color on markets and operations in just a moment.
As I mentioned earlier, NOV's second quarter marked the successful spinout of DistributionNOW, which as of the 1st
of June is a standalone independent company trading under the symbol DNOW on the New York Stock Exchange.
Market reception to this exciting new company has been outstanding, owing to DNOW's leadership and growth plans,
and we are pleased that the move has unlocked significant value for our shareholders. I'd like to thank the employees of
both companies for your hard work to help make this happen. Our second quarter results include two months of our
Distribution Services business as a discontinued operation.
Concurrent with the spinout, we reorganized our business into the four reporting segments I detailed earlier, organized
around customers. In June, we released pro forma historical financial results going back five years by quarter on this
new segment framework to enable you to update your models and trend the data to better assess how we are

performing. We're also disclosing depreciation and amortization expenses by segment to enable investors to compare
our EBITDA margins to our peers.
I'm pleased to congratulate the new operating heads of our segments on their new responsibilities. Joe Rovig is leading
our Rig Systems and Rig Aftermarket segments, Mike Matta is heading our new Wellbore Technologies segment, and
Kirk Shelton is leading the Completion & Production Solutions segment. I'm grateful for the extraordinary team that
we have in place and I want to thank all of our hardworking employees and business leaders for continuing to support
the critical needs of our customers through our busy second quarter.
Each new segment is presently engaged in a strategic review of its businesses against the backdrop of the four major
trends we see providing opportunity to our organization over the next several years, namely: one, the build-out of the
deepwater rig fleet; two, the build-out of infrastructure to support the development of deepwater oil and gas fields;
three, the retooling of the worldwide jack-up fleet; and finally, four, the continued growth and proliferation of
unconventional shale technologies worldwide.
We've explained many times before how we see these shaping the global energy equation and NOV's fortunes for
decades to come. Our strategic goal is to determine how we will deploy resources to enhance NOV's competitive
advantage and financial returns within these trends. As we answer these questions this summer, we will be quantifying
specific personnel, facilities and capital needs to execute our strategic plans to grow organically and to enhance our
business through selective acquisitions.
On the topic of acquisitions, we have closed five small transactions so far this year for about $110 million in aggregate
at less than six times trailing EBITDA and less than five times current EBITDA run rates. We are pursuing a number of
conversations around smaller transactions now, generally focused on finding excellent buys that fit our strategy,
strengthen our franchises and offer strong returns on capital employed. This takes tremendous diligence. Even though
we are almost always a strategic buyer, meaning that we have access to efficiencies and cost savings that financial
buyers usually don't, we are nevertheless frequently outbid. Rather than chase expensive deals ever higher, we will sort
through many potential targets to focus on rifle shot singles and doubles with disciplined returns demanded of the
acquisitions we execute.
NOV will also continue to focus on organic growth, research and development and better technologies and products,
tight management around costs, investments in more efficient production and operational excellence, expansion
investments into new regions and aftermarket support, all of which will translate into more organic growth. Disciplined
investment in both acquisition opportunities and organic growth opportunities will enhance our future financial
performance.
Turning to our balance sheet and record of cash generation, we are also exploring other ways to enhance shareholder
value by optimizing our balance sheet and capital structure. Like many multi-nationals, we had challenges around
repatriating cash from overseas. We are exploring ways to either put this excess capital to work or return it to
shareholders.
We announced a 77% increase in our regular dividend during the second quarter and believe that as we reassess our
organic growth capital needs through our strategic planning process, we can then turn to look at ways to return more
capital to our shareholders. NOV has a strong record of cash generation and reasonable expectations of strong future
cash generation, meaning that we should have capacity to return more capital to shareholders in the future. Finally, we
look forward to sharing our detailed strategic plans with investors in November.
With that, let me turn it over to our Chief Financial Officer to give you more color on the second quarter operating
results. Jeremy?
Jeremy D. Thigpen
Thanks, Clay. Before we begin our discussion of the quarterly operating results, let me take a quick moment to explain
the change that we have made to the calculation of our adjusted EPS. From this point forward, our adjusted EPS metric

will exclude the impact of the amortization of purchased intangible assets as well as discontinued operations and
non-recurring items, as we always have. Going forward we will be referring to these adjusted earnings per share results
as operating non-GAAP earnings per share. Here's why we're doing it. Since amortization expense of purchased
intangible assets is a non-cash period expense, we believe that this supplemental adjustment will help investors to more
clearly understand how NOV's earnings per share relate to our periodic cash flow per share. Purchased intangible assets
arise from the allocation of the purchase price of acquisitions in excess of the fair market value of working capital and
fixed assets of acquired businesses.
Amortization of these differ from depreciation, another non-cash periodic charge, in that depreciation expense reflects
consumption of hard assets which must eventually be replaced, used to produce periodic results, whereas amortization
of purchased intangibles reflects the initial start-up costs of acquisition capital. Obviously, we will continue to report
GAAP earnings and continue to provide a reconciliation between GAAP and our new operating non-GAAP earnings
metric, which you can see on the last page of our second quarter 2014 earnings release. We intend this to be a
supplemental disclosure, not a replacement for GAAP earnings per share, but rather to provide the investing public
additional insight into the periodic cash results of our operations on a per share basis.
Now let's discuss the quarterly results. Since Clay already thoroughly covered the consolidated results, I would just like
to offer one comment before transitioning into the results of our new segments. Given the additional time and energy
associated with the spin-off of our distribution business and the reorganization of our remaining businesses, delivering
a quarter with 7% growth and 35% flow-through on a sequential basis and 12% growth and 30% flow-through on a
year-over-year basis is quite an accomplishment. So I would just like to say thank you to each member of the NOV
family for your unwavering commitment, your focus and your hard work throughout this past quarter. Your efforts and
contributions are noticed and appreciated. So thank you very much.
Now let's turn to the operating results of our newly formed segments. The Rig Systems segment generated revenues of
$2.4 billion in the second quarter, up 5% sequentially, driven largely by a significant increase in land-related sales,
which before eliminations accounted for approximately 22% of segment revenues. That's up from 18% in the first
quarter of 2014 and up from 15% in the second quarter of 2013.
Compared to the second quarter of 2013 Rig Systems revenues were up 14% as, one, heightened demand for new
high-spec land rigs, primarily in the U.S., Latin America and the Middle East, resulted in incremental year-over-year
sales in complete rigs as well as critical components, such as top drives, BOPs and pipe handling equipment. And, two,
recent capacity additions have enabled us to convert 14% more revenue out of our backlog for both land and offshore
projects. Operating profit for the segment was $501 million and operating margins were 21.1%, which represented 110
basis point improvement over the previous quarter and a 220 basis point improvement over the prior year. EBITDA for
the segment was $523 million or 22% of sales.
As we move into the third quarter, we believe that Rig Systems revenues should remain relatively flat and that
operating margins could remain in the 20% to 21% range. As we look at Rig Systems margins for the balance of the
year and then throughout 2015, we see a number of puts and takes, which could result in some modest margin
expansion as we move through next year.
On the plus side, the price increases that we pushed through in 2013 have resulted in improving margins in our Rig
Systems backlog. Additionally, in time, we believe that we will start to recognize some efficiency gains from the new
capacity that we added last year. However, some of the benefit associated with price increases and operational
efficiencies will be offset by a growing percentage of Brazil and China-related work, which we expect to be
challenging. Naturally, we will continue to aggressively pursue opportunities to improve our already industry-leading
equipment margins, but we believe that margins for the Rig Systems segment in the second half of 2014 will look very
similar to the margins we delivered in the first half of the year.
Now let's transition to the capital equipment orders for our Rig Systems segment. As Clay already stated, for the
quarter we booked four drill ships, one semi and two jackups as well as some other packages and discrete components,
including lifting and handling equipment, jacking systems, spare BOP stacks and other equipment upgrades. In addition
to the strong orders offshore, we continued to see heightened demand for complete new land rigs, as well as land

equipment packages and components for the U.S., Latin America and Middle East markets.
Of the $2.3 billion of new Rig Systems orders, 59% was driven by new-build construction for jackups, semis and drill
ships, while sales of land rigs, land rig components and replacement upgrade components to support existing offshore
rigs accounted for the 41% balance of new bookings. This $2.3 billion of new orders in the quarter was mostly offset
by revenues out of backlog of $2.1 billion resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.1 times and another record quarter ending
backlog of $15.4 billion for the segment. Of this total backlog, approximately 93% is offshore and 94% is destined for
international markets.
Looking into the third quarter of 2014, we believe that orders for new floaters will be limited. However, we could see
solid orders for jackups, as a number of opportunities slipped from the second quarter. We also believe that demand
should remain strong for individual offshore components as well as complete land rigs, land equipment packages and
individual land components. Overall, we expect a healthy quarter for orders. However, as we stated on the previous
conference call, for the Rig Systems segment we do not at this time expect to achieve a one-to-one book-to-bill in the
third quarter.
The Rig Aftermarket segment posted revenues of $785 million in the second quarter of 2014, up 5% sequentially and
up 17% over the second quarter of 2013 as our large and growing install base of equipment combined with the
investments that we've made in additional personnel, training, global warehousing and service infrastructure and
inventory, have resulted in mid-teens percentage growth for the past few years.
Operating profit for the segment was $217 million or 27.6% of revenue, up 210 basis points sequentially, but down 60
basis points from the prior year due to slightly unfavorable mix. EBITDA for this segment was $224 million or 28.5%
of revenue. As we move into the third quarter, we feel that Aftermarket revenues could continue to improve in the
low-single digit percentage range, maintaining that mid-teens percentage year-over-year growth trajectory and we
believe that operating margin should continue to hold fairly steady in the third quarter and for the foreseeable future.
However, I would like to take this opportunity to communicate that this business due to product mix and the timing of
service work and repairs has a tendency to be somewhat lumpy. On an annual basis I feel comfortable providing an
outlook of mid-teens percent growth and fairly steady margins. However, there will undoubtedly be some swings from
quarter to quarter, so please be prepared for some slight quarterly choppiness in this segment. Despite these quarterly
fluctuations, we are very excited about the exceptional growth profile and profitability of this segment of our business
and we look forward to providing additional insight into this business in the coming quarters.
The Wellbore Technologies segment posted revenues of $1.4 billion, up 13% sequentially and up 18% from the second
quarter of last year. As previously stated, the Wellbore Technologies business is driven by activity; more rigs drilling
more wells in more footage require more solids control equipment, more fluids, more drill pipe, the inspection and
coding of that drill pipe, more downhole drilling tools, more drill bits and more rig monitoring and drilling optimization
services. As such, despite the seasonal decline in Canada, the continued strengthening of the U.S. market coupled with
the fact that our customers have clearly worked through the excess inventory that they carried into the first half of 2013
has led to outsized growth for this segment.
On this $1.4 billion in revenue, the Wellbore Technologies segment generated $269 million in operating profit or
18.6% of revenues, which represented a 110 basis point improvement over the first quarter of 2014, or 27% flow
through or leverage on the 13% increase in revenue. On a year-over-year basis, operating margins improved 260 basis
points or 33% flow through or leverage on the 18% increase in revenue.
EBITDA for this segment was 26.1%. As you've undoubtedly noticed, this particular segment carries a fairly heavy
load of depreciation and amortization expenses because, one, the businesses in this segment have made significant
investments in roof line and machinery to manufacture and service equipment and tools globally. Two, three of these
businesses have invested heavily in their respective rental fleets of downhole drilling tools, instrumentation tools and
solids control equipment, which account for a sizable percentage of their respective revenue strains. And, three, we've
made significant investments in game-changing acquisitions in this segment, including but not limited to: Grant Prideco
drill pipe, ReedHycalog drill bits, Robbins & Myers drilling motors, and Andergauge downhole technologies, all of

which improved and expanded our product and service offerings to our customers and further strengthened our
competitive position.
Looking into the third quarter of 2014, we believe that Wellbore Technologies segment revenues could improve in the
low to mid-single digit percentage range as Canada comes out of break-up, the U.S. market continues to modestly
improve and our other key markets in aggregate remain relatively steady. And while our actual results will always
depend upon product, customer and geographic mix, we believe on average that this segment should generate plus or
minus 30% flow through on each dollar of additional revenue.
The Completion & Production Solutions segment generated revenues of $1.1 billion, up 12% sequentially and up 7%
year-over-year. On a sequential basis, the revenue growth was driven primarily by a strong delivery quarter out of our
sub-sea businesses and an improving market for our well intervention and stimulation equipment, including coil tubing
units, coil tubing, pressure pumping equipment, well service pumps, fluid and expendables and flow line.
On a year-over-year basis, substantial growth in both our floating production and sub-sea businesses, which were up
82% and 45%, respectively, more than offset the year-over-year decline in sales for our stimulation equipment.
Operating profit for the segment was $158 million or 14% of revenues, which was relatively flat with the first quarter
of 2014 and down 140 basis points from the second quarter of 2013. As you probably surmised, the year-over-year
decline was almost entirely attributable to product mix, with a lower percentage of higher-margin stimulation
equipment revenues and a higher percentage of lower-margin floating production and sub-sea revenues. Of note, we're
also continuing to incur high start-up costs for our flexibles plant in Brazil, resulting in low leverage on higher
sequential flexible pipe sales. But on that topic, we're pleased to report that we're nearing the finish line on this
state-of-the-art facility and hope to see improvements as we exit the year.
Second quarter EBITDA for this segment was 18.7%. While the delta between operating margins and EBITDA
margins is not as pronounced as it is within the Wellbore Technologies segment, the Completion & Production
Solutions segment also carries a fairly heavy D&A load related to investments in roof line and machinery, as well as
some fairly recent transformational acquisitions, such as APL, NKT, Interflow, and the pumps, frac wellheads and frac
manifolds from Robbins & Myers.
For the third quarter, we believe that revenues for our Completion & Production Solutions segment could improve in
the mid- to high-single digit percentage range as we continue to see increasing demand for our well intervention and
stimulation equipment as well as improved revenues for our floating production and sub-sea businesses. And for the
quarter, depending on the overall mix, we could see a slight uptick in operating margins as we benefit from increasing
demand for our well stimulation equipment and associated consumables.
Now let's transition to the capital equipment orders for our Completion & Production Solutions segment. During the
quarter the segment had very strong bookings of $1.1 billion, which was partially offset by almost $600 million in
shipments out of backlog, resulting in a 1.8 times book-to-bill and a quarter-ending record backlog of $2.1 billion for
this segment. Of the $1.1 billion in new orders, approximately 70% of the total was driven by production-related
equipment and 30% from our well intervention and stimulation equipment businesses.
As we move into the third quarter, we believe that new orders for production equipment will slow substantially owing
to timing of projects, but that new orders for coil tubing units and pressure pumping equipment should strengthen,
resulting in a book-to-bill for the Completion & Production Solutions segment that could approach, if not exceed,
one-to-one.
While on the topic of backlog and book-to-bill, it's important to note that only 53% of the segment's second quarter
revenue came out of backlog and the remaining portion of this business is selling quick turn spare parts and
consumables to support and/or enhance the equipment that we sell from this segment.
Now that we've walked through the new segments, let's turn to the remaining elements of National Oilwell Varco's
consolidated second quarter 2014 income statement. Gross margin improved 130 basis points sequentially and 150
basis points year-over-year to 27.7%. SG&A increased $38 million sequentially and $54 million year-over-year.

However, as a percentage of revenue, it has remained relatively flat at 9.7%.
Non-recurring items, primarily related to the spin-off of the distribution business, totaled $32 million in the quarter.
Interest expense increased $1 million sequentially to $27 million and interest income increased $1 million to $5
million. Equity income in our Voest-Alpine JV was strong at $23 million, as the JV experienced across-the-board
increases in sales of green tube, OCTG and line pipe. But, as is typically the case, we do expect a significant decline in
equity income in the third quarter, as the plant will be shut down for two weeks for routine maintenance.
Other expense for the quarter was $21 million versus zero in the first quarter. As you may remember, in the first quarter
we benefited from favorable movements in currencies and we also recognized a gain on the sale of fixed assets. By
contrast, in the second quarter we incurred losses related to foreign exchange, slight losses on the sale of fixed assets as
well as higher bank fees.
The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 31.8%, which was higher than the 30.4% rate that we posted in the
first quarter of 2014 as we recognized a much higher percentage of U.S.-generated income in the quarter. Given our
belief that the U.S. will continue to be a source of growth in the third quarter, we expect an effective tax rate of 32%,
33% for the balance of the year. And finally, if you turn to the last supplemental schedule you will see that depreciation
and amortization was $190 million, down $1 million from the first quarter. And EBITDA excluding transaction charges
was $1.1 billion, or 21.1% of sales.
Turning to the balance sheet, I would like to start by highlighting a few key points in the quarter. Number one, we
continue to see the results of our focus on working capital. Number two, we continue to strategically deploy capital into
our business through acquisitions that complement our existing businesses and through infrastructure investments to
improve efficiencies, to shorten lead times, improve customer service and enhance competitive advantage. And three,
we provided our shareholders with a much larger dividend. Our June 30, 2014 balance sheet employed working capital
excluding cash of $5.2 billion, down $1.2 billion sequentially.
Accounts receivable decreased $883 million or 17% sequentially, with the reduction being driven by a combination of
the DNOW spinoff and strong collections by NOV businesses, where accounts receivable from continuing operations
were down $130 million despite a $366 million sequential increase in revenue. We also continue to realize
improvements in customer financing, where milestone invoicing on major products outpaced costs incurred by $50
million.
Inventory decreased $461 million or 8%, with an $844 million reduction associated with the Distribution spin being
partly offset by a $383 million build in our continuing operations to execute a record backlog and to support
heightening demand for our products in the U.S. market. Capital spending in the quarter was $175 million due to
several significant ongoing operational expansion efforts. Dividend payments were $198 million, representing an $87
million sequential increase.
The remaining uses of cash included tax payments of $572 million, cash interest payments of $45 million, acquisitions
of $100 million and $253 million in cash went with DistributionNOW. As a result the company generated free cash
flow, as defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures, from continuing operations of $610 million, which
was a 69% increase sequentially. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $3.9 billion and a net cash position of
$737 million. Of the $3.9 billion in cash, only 7% of the balance was in the U.S. at June 30.
Now let me turn it back to Clay.
Clay C. Williams
Thank you, Jeremy. So to sum it up, this morning we are pleased to report strong double-digit earnings growth both
sequential and year-over-year for our second quarter, record backlogs for both Rig Systems and Completion &
Production Solutions, with both posting book-to-bills north of 1 in the quarter, a 77% increase in our regular dividend
during the quarter, completion of a $3.5 billion spin-out to our shareholders of an exciting new public company, a
whole bunch of new granular disclosure and our path forward to develop and communicate our strategic plan.

So with that, Shannon, I think we're ready to open it up for questions.
Q&A
Operator
Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from
Jeff Tillery from Tudor Pickering and Holt (sic) [Tudor Pickering Holt]. Please go ahead.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: Hi. Good morning, guys.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Good morning, Jeff.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Hi.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: As you think about the M&A program, can you give us color around kind of businesses that were
acquired, things that are interesting, where you see the best opportunities?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Yeah, Jeff. Generally, as I noted in my opening comments, we have a lot of conversations
under way. They're generally with smaller companies. And I think I mentioned we've closed five transactions
year-to-date that I think are indicative of what that population looks like. I would say the flavor of these is continued
investment in our aftermarket support of the growing install base of rig equipment and so a couple of these have to do
with that strategic thrust.
We have a lot going on in our tubular services world and have seen great organic growth and acquisition growth in our
capability to repair tubulars around the globe and we're continuing to invest in that. But the overarching theme here is
generally I think we're seeing smaller transactions and believe that those offer better purchase economics. The bigger
these deals become, the more attention they attract and, when that happens, generally the price goes up, the multiples
go up and our returns go down. So looking forward would really like to put more focus on those smaller transactions
and benefit from the higher economics that they can bring to our operation.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: Great. The second question I had is just around Rig Systems. Obviously, with the segment
recasting, some of the benchmarks we've had historically have moved. But as you think about the medium to
longer-term margin goals, is that still in the low to mid 20s%? Is that how you think about a normalized margin for the
Rig Systems segment?
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Yeah, I think low 20s% is probably more accurate for normalized margins. As you'll
remember, part of our margin enhancement story was around growth in certain product lines that were accretive to the
oil rig tech margins.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: Sure.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Those have now moved into the Aftermarket segment and, of course, the Completion &
Production Solutions segment. So I think low 20%s normalized margins is probably appropriate.
<Q - Jeff Tillery>: Okay. Thank you very much.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Thanks, Jeff.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Thanks.

<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Good morning, guys.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Good morning, Jim.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Hey, Jim.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: You mentioned challenges in going forward in Brazil and China. And I know the flex pipe
plant in Brazil is a little behind schedule in getting fully operational. Can you talk to us a little bit about Brazil, what to
expect, what's going on, what should we see over the next 12 months or so in Brazil?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: The good news so far so good in Brazil, Jim. We're working on about half a dozen rigs
currently. The first should be delivered in September of next year. And so we're getting well into this buildout for NOV
21 deepwater floaters for that market. All of our customers, though, are pressing ahead. And so I would say so far so
good.
To put it in perspective, it's building in terms of its contribution quarter by quarter. So in the second quarter, we did
about $180 million in revenue within Rig Systems associated with that effort. And the challenges that we were
referring to stem from a couple things. One is that we won that work, if you recall, back in the 2009, 2010 time period
when pricing was under pressure.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Not as good as it is today, yeah.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Yeah. So the margins are good, but they're not great. And so the intrinsic margins in the work
is a little lower than the rest of our backlog. Number two, it's Brazil. We've been at work in Brazil for 30 plus years.
Very challenging from a regulatory standpoint, from local content requirement standpoint, from a tax standpoint, from
a currency standpoint. So we're just being realistic about the incremental margins that will continue to flow from Brazil
as we get deeper and deeper into the program. But, again, operationally, so far so good.
And to round out the picture, we are very excited about the expansion that we've had underway in Brazil to support
both that new construction as well as all of the rigs that we have at work in Brazil supporting those on an ongoing basis
from an aftermarket standpoint. So these are sort of dual-purpose facilities. And I think middle of next year we're going
to open our new riser manufacturing plant. We've got other expansion initiatives going on around Brazil and so it will
continue to be a very, very important market for us.
On China, the other part of the comment, we've seen a lot of our offshore rig building work shift into Chinese
shipyards, predominantly with jack-ups, although there's a few semis coming together in Chinese yards as well. And
what we know from experience – and to be clear, we've worked closely with Chinese shipyards quite a bit in the past,
but we know from experience that sometimes those projects can be a little more challenging. But we're not losing a lot
of sleep over the China shift. It's just, again, being realistic. We know that sometimes it's a little more challenging in
those yards vis-à-vis the yards in Korea or the yards in Singapore.
<Q - Jim K. Wicklund>: Okay. That's not bad for Brazil, considering everybody else's issues there. My follow-up, if I
could, in Completion & Production. Coil tubing, you mentioned coil tubing a couple of times. Demand for coil tubing
is picking up. That has been one segment that has lagged from an operating point of view in the U.S. Is your pick-up in
demand in coil tubing primarily international, or are we seeing demand pick up in the U.S. as well?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Most of the incremental is U.S. and North America really. A lot of demand for components
going into larger diameter coil tubing. So a lot of the incremental coil tubing demand is around 2 inch, 2 3/8 inch, 2 5/8
inch diameters. And so real trailers and...
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Injector heads.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: ...injector heads going into modify and upgrade actually older coil tubing units is a trend
we've seen lately. But generally, orders are on the upswing and a lot more optimism about that market. The
international market has remained steadier. It didn't fall off the same way North America did. And so we're seeing some
resumed demand overseas as well, but it never plummeted the way North America did back in 2012, 2013.

<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Yeah, in early 2013 we saw a slight drop in demand internationally as some of the
U.S.-based customers were shipping excess equipment overseas to fulfill needs. But in the back half of 2013, we started
to see more orders for new coil tubing units going into the international markets. And it has been pretty steady.

Our next question comes from Kurt Hallead from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Good morning.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Hi, Kurt.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Hey, Kurt.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hey, guys. I just wanted to follow up. You talked about the prospects of looking at varying
dynamics to return additional cash to shareholders. And one of the bottlenecks in that process had been the fact that you
have only 37% of your existing cash in the U.S. So in that context, I just wonder if you can provide us with maybe
some insights on how you may be able to accomplish some of those goals in terms of returning more cash to
shareholders and how serious of a consideration doing a levered recap might be.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: So, first, it's 7% of our cash in the U.S. Did you say 37%?
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Oh, 7%. Yeah. Sorry. I must have misheard what you said on the call. Thanks for clarifying that.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Only 7%. So we are essentially dividending out our U.S. cash flow. So we're already
pushing the envelope in the U.S. And so, yes, internally we are looking at different ways to get cash back to the U.S. in
a tax efficient manner. It is challenging, but we're certainly doing that. And to your next question...
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Yeah, so $3.5 billion plus in cash overseas. Some of the things we're looking at presently are
ways to repatriate that and to improve the ability to repatriate U.S. cash generated overseas, which would give us more
flexibility around either share a buyback or upping the dividend with that cash we have on our balance sheet or
alternatively looking for really good solid acquisitions overseas or probably a combination of both is what we're
looking at, Kurt.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: So a levered recap not necessarily the forefront of your thoughts?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Not in the near term. And partly I think I detailed the fact that our new segments and new
segment leaders are going through a deep dive on strategic reviews and strategic plans of their businesses this summer.
And so first things first is to get the strategic – and we're not expecting major departures, but let's get settled on the
strategic plans going forward and the capital needs around those. And then I think that will then lead us into a
conversation later this year around new opportunities to return capital to shareholders.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Okay, great. Thanks. And then my follow-up question is just on the Rig Systems' second half
outlook on the order book. We can make our own guesses and assumptions as we have in the past. You've provided
some general directional guidance of having a book-to-bill being under one. There's a big range of that. So are we
talking about a absolute plummet in orders in the back half of the year or more of a gradual decline?
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Yeah. Kurt, over the last two quarters we provided a little more granularity into our order
intake and really broken out what was from new build construction for jack-ups and floaters versus everything else. I
wouldn't call everything else a baseline because that fluctuates each quarter as well, but it'll give you some indication as
to what we think future orders could look like in that space. And then we also provided some guidance that we think
jack-ups could continue to be strong in Q3 and fairly steady in Q4. So you could probably back into a number that way.

They're not going away.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Yeah, they're not going to zero. Let me be clear on that. So there's a lot of things cooking out
there. Land rigs demand is ascending and it's a small piece now but it's growing and growing quickly. And as Jerry
mentioned, we've had a lot of jack-ups that pushed from Q2 to Q3. And so that outlook for the back half of the year for
jack-ups at least is pretty good.
And then I would add, too, I touched on a number of specific floating rig opportunities that are continuing to work out
there around 20,000 psi capabilities, around Artic capabilities. And so even in the floater space it's not going to zero. So
I'm not sure we can be a lot more quantitative than that, but directionally that's where the three main groups are going.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: All right. I think that helps clarify it. If I may just sneak one more point in on your guidance
relating to the Wellbore Technologies group. You had a significant increase in revenue sequentially as indicated at
13%, even with the break-up in Canada and now suggesting a more moderate sequential increase into the third quarter,
even with the Canadian rebound. Just trying to help connect the dots there because it appears to us that rig activity, well
activity, is on the rise in the U.S., you've got a rebound in Canada. So just not quite sure why the sequential increase
would be, say, more than half of what it was in the second quarter.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Yeah, I think there's a possibility for that, Kurt, but really what we've seen in this segment
historically, and really thinking back to our PS&S businesses, when activity starts to pick up and customers work
through their inventories, they kind of start to buy in bulk and add some inventory so that they're not compromised if
activity continues to grow. So we think there was a little bit of that going on in the second quarter. And don't know if
that will continue in the third or if they just go to replenishing inventory as they consume it at that point in time.
<Q - Kurt Hallead>: Hey, that's great color. Perfect. Thanks, guys.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Thanks, Kurt.

Our next question comes from Bill Sanchez from Howard Weil. Please go ahead.
<Q - William D. Sanchez>: Thanks. Good morning.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Hi.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Good morning, Bill.
<Q - William D. Sanchez>: Clay or Jeremy, I was hoping perhaps maybe you could give us an outlook on two things.
One, I know this is the second quarter now you've discussed the expectation of book-to-bill in Rig Systems going
below 1. Just curious if you had any thoughts on the duration of how long you might see book-to-bill stay below that
target, I guess is my first question.
As my follow-up, I've got to believe the revenue capacity or the revenue efficiency continues to increase. I know,
Jeremy, you were able to give us an expectation on Aftermarket growth year-over-year. Is there any thought as we look
2014 and maybe even next year what type of top-line growth we could perhaps expect out of Rig Systems?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Well, the first question, Bill, with regards to the duration of this downturn, we're not sure.
We believe it's not a one quarter dip. We've got at least a few quarters, and it could extend beyond that overall. Long
term, our outlook is still very, very bright. There's an awful lot of development drilling and exploration drilling that still
needs to go on in deepwater basins that require floating rigs. So we think the fundamental demand is there, but a lot of
capacity flowing into the market last year, this year, next year is giving rise to this.
I mentioned some of the special purpose rigs that we're looking at, another interesting set of conversations, we've got a
couple of folks looking at 2017, 2018, not seeing any floater deliveries scheduled outside of Brazil and thinking there
may be opportunities to introduce, go ahead and sign up for new builds to try to hit that point in the market when very

few new rigs are coming in. And so there's lots of conversations that are underway. So our expectation is we're headed
for a cyclical soft patch here. I'm not sure I have a lot of insight to offer around how long that may last.
With regards to what your, I'm sorry – your second question was top-line growth for which segments?
<Q - William D. Sanchez>: For Rig Systems around capacity.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Yeah. Yeah, that we have a lot of visibility into with $15.4 billion of firm orders. And you do
the math, that means we've got a couple of years of work ahead of us with rising prospects for land rigs. And so far
continued demand for jack-ups as well for at least the next couple of quarters. And so I'm not prepared at this point to
give you a number year-to-year, 2014 to 2015 what that might look like, but certainly orders will not be the gating item.
As you correctly point out, we've been adding a lot of capacity throughout our infrastructure to deal with record
backlogs, a lot of challenges in the supply chain to deal with these record backlogs and so a lot of continued capacity
coming on line to handle this work. To connect the dots there, though, if the downtown in floater demand does stay
down for a while, we're not overly concerned because we foresee a big pick-up in special periodic surveys, particularly
as we move into 2017, and I think this is something I referenced in my comments as well.
Every five years all floating rigs need to come back to the shipyard for hull inspections and for drilling equipment to be
inspected and recertified and get new certificates of compliance. And when we look at the demographics of the birth
years of the growing offshore fleet, what we see is that they're all starting to stack up in 2017 and 2018. And so there's
going to be a lot of work for us to do, even if it's not necessarily building as many new deepwater floaters as we have in
the past.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: And specifically to your question, Bill, in terms of revenue conversion out of backlog, we
had the big capacity, the major capacity additions in 2012 and early 2013. We're now getting comfortable with those
additions. And if you'll look, we've been running at between $2 billion and $2.2 billion in revenue out of backlog for
the last couple – few quarters. And I think that's probably a reasonable proxy for the future.
<Q - William D. Sanchez>: Yeah, that's helpful, Jeremy, just to quantify that. I appreciate it. If I could ask just one
more, with regard to the amortization of the intangible assets, as we look through the press release, I was just trying to
basically identify that back to a specific segment or segments, Jeremy. Is that concentrated in one particular area as we
try to reconcile what may be the...
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: It really shows up if you look at the difference between EBIT margins and EBITDA
margins, you can see the disconnect really. And it's really in Wellbore Technologies primarily but also in Completion
& Production Solutions.
<Q - William D. Sanchez>: Okay.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Yeah, a little bit in Rig.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: A little bit in Rig, but not as pronounced as it is in those two segments.
<Q - William D. Sanchez>: But as we look at the restated numbers, at least the first quarter comparison, that's an
apples-to-apples comparison as we think about the 2Q.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Correct.
<Q - William D. Sanchez>: Okay. Great.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Yeah. Yeah.
<Q - William D. Sanchez>: Thank you all for the...
<A - Clay C. Williams>: By the way, on that topic, we're going to continue to break out. It'll be running about $0.14 a
share.

Operator
Our final question comes from Waqar Syed from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.
<Q - Waqar M. Syed>: Thank you for taking my question. In terms of the five-year surveys, we've seen some offshore
drillers defer or even cancel their five-year surveys, waiting for better visibility in the market. Are you seeing that in
your discussions with the offshore drillers? And how does that factor into your guidance on the Aftermarket business
for the coming years?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Waqar, I think they may be able to defer that, but they need to do it before they go back to
work because it's a statutory, I think, regulatory requirement. It's been required for decades and it's the practice across
the industry that every five years these come in. We've been in industry dialog around how to make that more efficient,
because right now we've been on a run rate of about 40 rigs a year going into the shipyards and, as I mentioned earlier,
see that going up to 130 rigs in 2017 and that's just based on NOV-delivered kit. And we're going to have to do
something different to accommodate that. That's a tremendous amount of work. And so we're exploring with the
industry ideas to make that more efficient. We've also reorganized internally to bring some of our project management
expertise within Rig Systems to bear on these projects.
The planning for these is critical. As you can imagine, taking a rig off day rate and putting it in a shipyard to
accommodate the periodic survey is a high opportunity cost because it's off day rate. So our customers want to get as
much done as they can while that rig is in the shipyard. And that can be made much more efficient and minimize
opportunity cost if a lot of very tight planning goes into that project well in advance and as long as we can get out to the
rigs and survey that equipment. And so our plan is to try to work with the industry to develop a better way that's more
efficient and enables them to get the rigs through and minimize the opportunity cost associated with that requirement.
<Q - Waqar M. Syed>: So just to understand, in your forecast are you assuming any major rig retirements of older
rigs? Or you feel that every single rig that's due for its five-year surveys gets that done?
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Well, if rigs are not on contract at the time, I suppose they may be able to defer. I don't know
that for sure. But nevertheless, there's a lot of new iron out there required by the Coast Guard to come in. So I think
that's a fairly safe bet from our perspective.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: The other thing to point out, too, is that we're in conversations with these customers a year
in advance of their SPS surveys. So we know if and when they're coming in and what kind of upgrades they're going to
require. So this is part of that challenge in streamlining this process that Clay was talking about. So we know what's
coming in.
<Q - Waqar M. Syed>: Okay. Great. And just one last on the Chinese shipyards regarding jack-ups. There's also the
view that's being floated around by the offshore drillers saying that many of the rigs that are being built, the jack-ups
being built in Chinese shipyards, may not actually get built. Are you hearing any cancelations there or any concern on
the part of the shipyards that the rigs may not get built?

<A - Clay C. Williams>: No, I think what you're referring to, the Chinese generally were offering very attractive
terms. For instance, 10% down, 90% at delivery. So China's financing the build-out of these rigs and whether or not
their customer shows up and makes the final payment or not, we've got very, very strong contracts with our customers
there. And so we're not concerned about this. We went through a massive downturn economically in 2009 and had a
very small, I think 2%, 3%, 4% of our backlog, where customers defaulted and the projects went away.
So I think we've demonstrated before our contracts are pretty solid and our expectation is that our customers in China
are going to see those projects through. And many of these, too, although they're not necessarily contracted now, you've
got PEMEX talking about picking up a dozen rigs next year and another 20 or 30 a few years after that, a lot of interest
out of the Far East, out of India. So there's a lot of jack-up interest out there. And then the final thing is if you look at
the demographics of the jack-up rig fleet, what you're seeing here is retooling, rejuvenating that fleet in earnest. And
that's the fundamental driver for demand for these rigs.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: Yeah, and to be clear, we're not offering that financing to our shipyard customers.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Right.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: In fact, we're getting paid as we go.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Right.
<A - Jeremy D. Thigpen>: So we stay cash positive, cash neutral at worst, on these projects.
<A - Clay C. Williams>: Yes. Thank you, Jeremy. Important point.
<Q - Waqar M. Syed>: All right. Well, thank you very much. Thanks, guys.
Clay C. Williams
Thank you. Well, that wraps up our call. We appreciate everyone joining us and look forward to speaking to you next
quarter. Thanks very much.
