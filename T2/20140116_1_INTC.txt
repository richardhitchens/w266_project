Thanks, Mark.
Q4 was a solid finish to a year of transition, both for the computing market and for Intel. We spent the year building a
foundation in important growing segments of computing and as a result we are better positioned as we enter 2014.
Importantly the beat rate of innovation inside the company has also improved. I'll touch on each of these themes but I'd
like to start with our results.
The company's revenue was down 1% for the year driven by a declining PC TAM. The PC client group was down 4%
for the year but the business began to stabilize and actually grew a bit in the fourth quarter, achieving all-time record i5
and i7 unit shipments. The desktop business was particularly strong in Q4, growing 11% over last year.
In the Data Center we finished the year up 7% with record storage units and revenue. Cloud was up 35%. Storage was
up 24%. And High Performance Computing was up 18%. Enterprise, however, fell short of our expectations for the
fourth quarter and the year as we overestimated the rate of recovery among corporate buyers.
In our other businesses, the Intelligence Systems business we saw a growth of 21% in Retail up 16% and
Transportation up 21% for the year. Networking grew 31% for the year. And rounding out the list our NAND and
McAfee businesses grew 15% and 4% respectively, both achieving record revenue.
When I spoke with you in November, I shared my vision. If a device computes, it does it best with Intel, from the
internet of things to the data center. I outlined the areas that are changing to make that vision a reality. Among the
changes was a shift towards a more outside-in view of our industry and an intense focus on bringing innovation to
market quickly.
Last week at CES, there was evidence of our progress as we demonstrated technologies that weren't on our roadmap
just six months ago, technology that we expect will be available this year. We showed you Edison, an Intel-based
platform for Internet of Things in the form of an SD card. We unveiled several innovative wearable solutions and we
announced Intel Device Protection smart technology to harden IA-based Androids for the enterprise.
Our disclosure in November of a new smartphone and tablet roadmap that will include SoFIA, our first IA SoC with
integrated comms, later this year is further evidence that we are innovating and bringing products to market at a faster
pace.
Looking ahead, 2014 will be an exciting year as we build further on this new foundation. We've established a goal to
grow our tablet volume to more than 40 million units, with an emphasis on the value segment. After finishing 2013
with more than 10 million units and a strong book of design wins, we're off to a good start. We also exit the year
having made important strides on our 14-nanometer process technology. Yields improved significantly in Q4 putting us
squarely on track to be in Broadwell production later this quarter.
Our customers and partners also continue to evolve the computing experience. By the time we enter the back-to-school
selling season, we'll have nearly 70 unique 2-in-1designs with outstanding battery life and performance across a range
of price points and form factors.
And later this quarter we'll launch Ivy Bridge EX, which will bring the largest generation-to-generation improvement in
MP server performance since 2010. Our work to improve our velocity and position the company for the future of
computing isn't done, but our recent progress is testament to what's possible when we focus and bring all of Intel's
assets to bear. We're building on a foundation upon which we'll compute for years to come and we're beginning this
year in a better position than we began last year.
With that, let me turn the call over to Stacy.

Thanks, Brian.
The fourth quarter came in consistent with expectations, with a return to financial growth and was a solid ending to a
challenging year. For the fourth quarter, revenue came in at $13.8 billion, up 3% from a year ago. PC Client Group
revenue was flat from a year ago. Our Data Center Group grew 8% from a year ago. And relative to our expectations at
the beginning of the quarter, we saw higher PC Client Group revenue partially offset by lower growth in our Data
Center Group.
Gross margin of 62% was flat to the third quarter and one point above our guidance. Operating income for the fourth
quarter was $3.5 billion, up 12% from a year ago. Earnings per share was $0.51, up 6% from a year ago. For full year
2013, revenue was $52.7 billion, gross margin was 60%, operating income was $12.3 billion, net income was $9.6
billion and earnings per share was $1.89.
While the PC market was down on the year, we saw the market stabilize in the back half of the year with fourth quarter
PC units up from a year ago. Additionally we saw strong tablet growth in the back half of the year and inclusive of PC
and tablets our unit growth in the fourth quarter was up almost 10% from a year ago. We decreased inventory levels by
almost $400 million in the fourth quarter and across the worldwide supply chain, inventory levels continue to be
healthy.
Gross margin of approximately 60% in 2013 is down two points from 2012, driven by higher 14-nanometer factory
start-up costs. Spending on R&D and NG&A was $18.7 billion in 2013, 35% of revenues, down from the forecast at
the beginning of the year, but higher than our long-term model. Operating income was $12.3 billion, down 16%
year-over-year. Earnings per share was $1.89, down 11% from a year ago.
The business continued to generate significant cash with almost $21 billion of cash from operations in 2013. Total cash
balance at the end of the year was roughly $20 billion, up approximately $2 billion from a year ago. We purchased $11
billion in capital assets, paid $4.5 billion in dividends and repurchased over $2 billion of stock.
As we look forward to the first quarter of 2014, we are forecasting the midpoint of the revenue range at $12.8 billion,
down 7% from the fourth quarter. This forecast is in line with the average seasonal decline for the first quarter. We are
forecasting the midpoint of the gross margin range for the first quarter to be 59%. The 3-point decline from the fourth
quarter is primarily driven by higher platform write-offs as we start pre-production builds of Broadwell in
14-nanometer and overall lower platform volumes, in line with seasonal trends.
Turning to 2014, we are planning for revenues to be approximately flat. We expect the Data Center Group revenue to
be up in the low double digits and the PC Client Group revenue to be down in the midsingle digits. We are forecasting
the midpoint of our gross margin range at 60%, flat to 2013. We expect start-up costs to decline, partially offset by the
impact of tablets as we ramp our volume and provide contra-revenue support to our customers. And we are forecasting
spending for the year at $18.6 billion and expect capital spending of $11 billion, both of which are approximately flat to
2013. Within the flat spending, we're advancing the strategy of the company by shifting investments towards the data
center, tablets and low-power SoCs.
The fourth quarter was a solid finish to a challenging year. Financially, the fourth quarter of 2013 was better than the
fourth quarter of 2012. More importantly, we are making changes that continue to improve our competitive position.
For devices that compute, our vision is, if it computes, it does it best with Intel. Towards that end, we are well on our
way to reinventing the personal computer. With all-in-ones, two-in-ones, convertibles and detachables, the amount of
innovation in the PC market is unprecedented.
Building on this leadership, we will start production wafers on Broadwell, a 14-nanometer product targeting these form
factors in the first quarter. In the tablet market, we launched the Bay Trail SoC and have started to expand our footprint
and market segment share in this growing market. And in the Internet of Things market, we are bringing new
architectures, like Quark and Edison, to build on our current leadership position.
We are uniquely situated to benefit from the other end of the compute continuum as the infrastructure that supports all
these devices expands. Our Data Center business continues to see robust growth as a result of the build-out of the cloud

and the explosion of devices that compute and connect to the Internet. In 2013, we extended our leadership at the high
end of the data center with the launch of the Ivy Bridge-based Xeon product line. And at the low end of the data center,
we extended our leadership with the launch of Avoton, targeting the micro-server market. We plan to build on this
foundation as we launch the Haswell-based Xeon family in 2014.
At the foundation of this innovation, we continue to advance Moore's law faster than the rest of the industry. This gives
us the world's highest-performance and lowest-power transistors and will result in a growing cost advantage over time.
With that, let me turn it back over to Mark.
Mark Henninger
All right. Thank you, Brian and Stacy. As we move on to the Q&A, as is our normal practice, we would ask each
participant to ask one question and just one follow-up if you have one.
Jamie, please go ahead and introduce our first questioner.
Q&A
Operator
[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.
<Q - Mark J. Lipacis>: Thanks for taking my question. At the Analyst Day, you addressed your view on transistor
density and your expectation for leadership on that vector. But I have to say, in discussing that idea with investors,
there's a consensus view that seems to be that Intel has an inherent wafer cost disadvantage relative to TSMC that
neutralizes or more than neutralizes your transistor density advantage. And the argument is that TSMC ships more
wafers and therefore has better purchasing power than you and has lower labor costs and net net, they have just a big
huge advantage on wafer costs that you should have a hard – too hard of a time to overcome. So my question is, do you
think that's a fair view? Can you help us talk to the relative elements of the wafer costs and how you think you can
compare? Any kind of help that you could give us on the cost dimension would be extremely helpful. Thank you.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure. This is Brian. I think the first thing to remember is that what really counts in all of
this is transistor cost. And what we really talk about in our Moore's law curves and when we talk about transistor
density, is driving a consistent cost reduction of the transistors. And so wafer cost is one segment of that. I'm not going
to comment on TSMC's wafer costs versus our wafer costs, but we feel confident that our relative level of scaling and
our internal wafer costs are such that we believe we have a leadership position in transistor costs.
Remember when you're talking about any product, whatever it is, a logic product that's a low-end microprocessor for a
wearable or an Internet of Things or high-end Xeon Server, you're talking about the number of gates and hence the
number of transistors required to put that logic device together. It doesn't matter whose technology it's on, to some
extent, it doesn't matter what node. And so the more cost-effective those transistors are, whether it's 500 million or 3
billion, the lower the product cost is. And that's really what we focus on and why we focus on transistor cost. So I think
we stand by our – what we said at the Investor Meeting.
<Q - Mark J. Lipacis>: Thank you. And if I could have a follow up, there's been some news reports about the Fab 42.
Could you help us understand what's going on and how we should think about what's going on there? Thank you.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure. I'll start and then Stacy can talk to you about any of the financial discussion of it.
When you start these construction projects, we've talked about it in the past, it – you have to start them three years,
roughly, in advance. They're very complex, some of the most complex if not the most complex construction projects
you could imagine. So you start those three years in advance to when you're ready for operation.

We started this one about three years ago. If you go back and look three years ago, our view of the PC industry and PC
growth, it was much more robust than what has played out, and is our forecast today. And so what we've done as we've
brought it online is, we've been very conservative with our – how we manage the project. We've brought it up until the
shell is complete and facilitated from a construction standpoint, and we've held back putting equipment in until we see
the demand requirement. And that's really what we've done.
We've done that in the past. You can – I've been in Intel's manufacturing for 30 years. You can go back in time and we
did that fairly frequently. And that's what we've done with Fab 42 as well, we've held it back until the demand
requirement comes about.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, it – I don't have a lot to add to that. I would just say that the financial impact of this is
actually pretty minimal. The – as Brian said, we built a shell but we didn't equip it, and we did that before we need it.
We will ultimately use it so the economic cost is just the time value of the money, which is a pretty modest cost. And
this is pretty normal for us, it's – we actually always want to have some pre-positioned space to grow into as the market
grows. As Brian said, it's three years to construct one of these things. So it's economically quite detrimental to get
caught short, and the costs of having all those extra spaces is pretty high. It doesn't impact depreciation, doesn't impact
gross margin.
<Q - Mark J. Lipacis>: Thank you.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: You're welcome.
Operator
Your next question comes from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.
<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess the first one is on DCG. Can you give
us a little more color on what happened in the fourth quarter, especially given the confidence that you had as recently as
November on the growth there? And also, what gives you confidence given the fourth quarter miss in forecasting still
low-double digit growth in 2014?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, let me take that. This is Stacy. So if you look at the trends in the fourth quarter, I think the
trends actually reinforce the growth rate among cloud, high-performance computing, networking, storage. They all
came in consistent with what we thought. Brian went through a lot of the year on your growth rates there. Still very
robust growth rates. It actually increased our confidence in that.
What we saw, very specific to the enterprise was, we did return to growth. It was a little bit less growth than what we
had thought as we entered the quarter. As we kind of stepped back and looked at what happened there, we think there's
two elements that hit us. One was, we had a pretty robust growth rate in Q3. As we entered Q4, we saw that we had –
there was more inventory out in the world than we knew when we started the quarter, so that had to be burned-off.
And then secondly, we saw a tapering-off in order patterns across certain customers in certain segments at the end of
the quarter, and we think that, that was driven by the government shutdown and the uncertainty around the debt ceiling,
because when you look at the customers in the segments it's pretty clearly in those segments.
We had a range around growth rates for 2014 and at the investor meeting we said 10% to 15% based on a slower
growth in enterprise in Q4, and maybe a slower recovery in enterprise over the course of 2014, I'd say we're now at the
lower end of that range. So we're more at the 10% range than the 15% part of that range.
<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: Great. Then I guess as my follow-on, switching gears a little bit to the OpEx side. You
guided sequentially flat, but it looks like if you just hold R&D as part of that sequentially flat for the full year, it seems
to imply that R&D as a singular expense will be coming down as the year progresses. Is that math correct, and if so,
what's driving that decline throughout the year?

Page 6 of 13
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, that math is correct. So I think Q1 will be the high point in terms of quarterly spending. It
will come down quarter by quarter. We'll be bringing employment down over the course of the year. And beyond that,
as we talked about at the investor meeting, we're going to be making some significant new investments in things like
the Data Center, tablets, low power SoCs, those kinds of things. So even beyond the headline number there's going be a
significant shift in investment over the course of the year. But you have the math right, and it's doing be due to just
shifting on projects and bringing down employment over the course of 2014.
<Q - Ross C. Seymore>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Mark Henninger>: Thanks, Ross.
Operator
The next question comes from Glen Yeung from Citi.
<Q - Glen S. P. Yeung>: Sorry. Thanks. Brian or Stacy, either one, to what extent could you be misreading the
enterprise server market, in the sense that the virtualization curve is probably now over and maybe you don't see the
recovery in enterprise server with the economy that one might normally see?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: I think we'd say there is some impact. As Diane showed you, we're showing a kind of long-term
growth rate in enterprise that's less than what it was three years ago. I think she said there was some impact associated
with the virtualization curve having played out. But that doesn't stop the fact that we think that there's growth in the
enterprise segment. We just changed our view for 2014. We think the recovery just plays out a bit slower than we
would have thought a quarter ago.
<Q - Glen S. P. Yeung>: All right. And then kind of similar question, but on the PC side. To what extent do you think
that the strength you're seeing – relative strength you're seeing in PCs today is a function of the software transition at
Microsoft, and does it therefore end in April, or do you think this is a more sustainable recovery?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: So as we said in our script that what drove a lot of it was desktop. And we're seeing the
mature markets, enterprise be the strongest, with the emerging markets still flat to slightly down. So our view that, if
you look out from a PC perspective was that, we forecast with a relatively cautious and careful view looking out. We
compared against the third parties. We think we're in line with what third parties have forecasted as well. Some of the
contribution to fourth quarter was the XP transition, which is really what you're talking about. We don't think that was
the only thing. As I said, it was most – a lot of the growth came from desktop, but the desktop was largely enterprise in
the mature markets.
That really we think has to do with a lot of great form factors that are coming in, all-in-ones, the great innovation that's
coming in there. We saw some of the highest units of i5 and i7 in the Enthusiast area. I think those are some great
gaming platforms. So we think there's a lot more to the desktop growth. We also introduced the Haswell-based NUC
[Next Unit of Computing], which is the smallest form factor desktop machine that you can have. So it's those kinds of
innovations that are driving this Desktop growth as much or more than the software transition.
<Q - Glen S. P. Yeung>: That's great. Thank you very much.
Operator
The next question comes from Stacy Rasgon from Sanford Bernstein.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I want to dig into the full year guidance a little
bit. There's something I don't understand. So you just basically took your Data Center guidance down for 2014 by a
little bit. It doesn't sound like you're taking – you're improving your full year PC guidance at all. You're still saying
kind of like single digits. And you didn't take your full year revenue outlook down. So what's making up the
difference? And if there's nothing making up the difference, why didn't you take the full year revenue guidance down?

Page 7 of 13
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, I think, Stacy, you're assuming a level of precision around approximately flat that doesn't
exist. Approximately flat can encompass a little bit up, a little down. If you think about the Data Center being $10
billion if we're at the higher end of the range versus the lower end of the range that we've put out, you change the full
year on a $50 billion plus business by a few hundred million dollars.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: So is the bias more to a little bit down versus a little bit up, at least more than it was in
November?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: At this point, again, you're assuming a level of precision that, I think, isn't appropriate when
you're talking something that will play out over the next 12 months. We had a positive data point on PCs. We had a
little bit of a negative data point on one element of the enterprise, and our tablet momentum looks good. So you just
kind of look at it and I'd say our view is pretty consistent with what it was back in November.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Yeah, but you don't book any revenues on the tablets, right?
<A - Mark Henninger>: Stacy, thanks for the question. We're going to move on to the next questioner.
<Q - Stacy Aaron Rasgon>: Okay.
Operator
The next question comes from Christopher Danely from JPMorgan.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Mr. Danely, you may be on mute. We can't hear you.
<Q - Chris B. Danely>: Is that better?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, that's better. There you go.
<Q - Chris B. Danely>: One of these days I've got to figure out how to work my own phone.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, technology's tough.
<Q - Chris B. Danely>: Tell me about it. So anyway my first question is on gross margins. So you gave us the Q1 and
the full-year guidance. Can you just talk about how things are supposed to trend after Q1? And then maybe also talk
about some of the levers on gross margins up or down?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Sure. Let me – I'll anchor it on Q1 and then give you a sense of how I see it playing out over the
course of the year since we provided specific guidance for Q1. We've guided Q1 at 59% coming down from Q4. We
were at 62% in Q4, so down to 59%. The elements there that bring us down, we have about 1.5 points down associated
with the start of production on Broadwell, prior to its qualification for sale.
So you've seen this from us in the past that that build will be reserved out until we reach the formal qualification date.
And then we're about a point down in Q1 as a result of it just being a seasonally lower quarter. And so, yeah, I think
you kind of understand and expect both of those. 60% for the year, so algebra would say an improving gross margin
over the course of the year. I think when we get into the back half of the year, we have a gross margin that's back into
the low 60s.
When I think about the headwinds and tailwinds to that, the tailwinds are that we expect that we'll see a falling off of
14-nanometer startup costs. We talked about that at the investor meeting, and I think that's consistent with what you'd
expect from us. We see volume and unit costs getting better over the course of the year, and reserves will get a bit
better as we progress through the year. Again we have this Broadwell reserve in the first quarter.
The big offset to that, then, are the dollars that we're providing in terms of contra-revenue dollars for tablets that we
also talked about in some depth at the investor meeting. We're not seeing a lot of those in the first quarter. They really
build over the course of the year. So we have the positives that I outlined and then you'll see that offset as a result of

those temporary contra-revenue dollars that we're providing to our customers as we take our tablet product line broadly
through the different OSes and price points.
<Q - Chris B. Danely>: Great. And for my follow-up, I guess it's kind of on that question. So on the tablet strategy to
get to $40 million, you're saying it's going to be a 1.5 percentage hit. Let's say you guys get into the second half of the
year and you're not quite to the $40 million. If it's a pretty significant shortfall, would you consider canning that
strategy? I guess I'm just wondering what the commitment is if the volumes aren't there but the cost is there by the end
of the year.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure. So this isn't a price reduction as a normal price reduction would be. It's not where
you're just simply reducing. It's truly a BOM cost equalizer, and, remember, a lot of our 40 million tablets in 2014 will
be based on Bay Trail. Bay Trail was originally designed for Atom-based PC segment and the upper-end tablet, and so
it's – what we're doing here is doing a BOM cost delta relative to what the mid- and lower-end tablets require.
And so those are things like Bay Trail may require more layers of a printed circuit board for the board itself, more
components on the board and tighter power management controls and things like that. We have a whole program to
reduce those throughout the year. So that gives us confidence that as we go through the year, the BOM cost delta will
shrink. But if the volume didn't show up, for some reason, and I'm not going to say that that's what's going happen, but
I'm confident it will, but if it didn't, it's on a per unit basis. And so the spending on that contra would be reduced
equivalently.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: And I'd just add, as Brian said, we're doing a lot of enabling across the industry to take the
BOM cost down and keep in mind these are costs at the system level not at our chip level. And it will vary a lot by
SKU but to give you a sense for a Bay Trail platform from the beginning of the year to the end of the year we think
that, that BOM penalty drops by more than half. And so it kind of gets better out in time and then when we get to the
Broxton generation we think it's de minimis.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Both Broxton and SoFIA...
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: SoFIA.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Are specifically designed to eliminate that delta.
<Q - Chris B. Danely>: Got it. Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. That's very helpful.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Sure.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Thanks, Chris.

The next question comes from Tristan Gerra from Baird.
<Q - Tristan Gerra>: Hi. Good afternoon. If we look at tablets and smartphone, what type of units do you need to
reach for that business to start having a material impact in gross margin from a standpoint of higher utilization rates and
excluding the contra revenue impact and offset?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: You were asking tablets and phones?
<Q - Tristan Gerra>: Yeah, so looking at the 40 million units target for this year, what type of volume do you need to
get in order for gross margin to start appreciating from the rest of the business if you exclude the contra revenue
impact?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yes. It's hard to say. I mean, I'll bridge back to our strategy here. Our strategy is that we're
going to use our process technology to lead, we'll have leadership products that also are competitive or maybe even
leadership in terms of cost. And I showed some data at the investor meeting that just kind of showed the die sizes we

progressed from Bay Trail to Broxton to SoFIA. And so you can get a sense of the kinds of cost structure that we're
going to have. On a per unit basis, I don't think it causes – or on a percentage basis, yeah, I can't – I'm not envisioning a
situation where it causes the gross margin percentage to go up. But you can definitely get to a space once we get
through these contra revenue enabling dollars where every unit we sell is accretive on a gross margin dollars per unit.
It's utilizing factories that we have in place for PCs. And so it's a nice adder at a gross margin dollars per unit
standpoint.
<Q - Tristan Gerra>: Okay. And then quick follow up. You talked about enterprise desktop being strong. Any color
that you can provide in notebooks in terms of whether it tracked in line with expectation and whether was it more
driven by consumer or enterprise?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: It was pretty much in line with expectations. We didn't see any surprise on the notebook side.
We saw overall PC units a little bit higher and that was really desktop. And that was, as Brian said, broad based across
desktops. It was all in ones and corporate and consumer, everything was just a little stronger on the desktop side.
<Q - Tristan Gerra>: Great. Thank you.

The next question comes from John Pitzer from Credit Suisse.
<Q - John W. Pitzer>: Yeah, good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the solid results. Brian, I guess my first
question relative to the seasonal guide for the March quarter, is there any sort of granularity you can give us between
sort of the PC Group, the Data Center Group and kind of other IA. And I guess the reason why I'm asking the question
is, I get, in the absence of knowing, just guiding to seasonal makes sense, but you do have Bay Trail Android tablets in
Q1 that you didn't have in Q4. And then when you look at availability of SKUs in the PC Group, you actually have a
lot better availability of kind of the SKUs I think people like in Q1 versus Q4, both of which would kind of argue for
better seasonality. So maybe you can give us a little granularity there, that would be helpful.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Sure. Let me try and Stacy can add some of the financial detail. Part of it is – let's go back. It's
seasonality off growth from Q4, right, so a stronger Q4. So it's a good quarter. I don't want to say that just growing at
seasonality is not a good thing. Second thing I would say is you're right, on the PC we do see a lot of the 2-in-1s come
in. But also Q1 is just – there's not a lot of events that happen that can drive upsides like holidays and things like that.
Now in one of your comments you said we'll start seeing Bay Trail Android tablets. Most of the Bay Trail Android
tablets really start showing up more in Q2 than in Q1, and that's again purely – remember we made a shift, our original
program for Bay Trail was all Windows. As we came in through the midpoint of the year, we said let's shift and make it
Windows and Android. And so, our OEM partners as well are targeting more towards Q2 and it's just, when do you go
and start putting back in that back-to-school event, which is the next seasonal place where upsides usually occur.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, and the only thing I would add to that, I'd say – I guess I'd say if, I certainly hope you're
right and it's better than seasonal and we have all the ability in the world to respond to that. So that said, it ends up
being a good answer.
The thing you want to keep in mind as you work through seasonality over the course of the year is that these
contra-revenue dollars that we're providing to the customers for tablet enabling, that's – that that will come off of
revenue. So it's a gross margin hit, but it'll also be a decrement to revenue while we support them. So, it's not so much a
Q2 issue but as you get into the back half, it's going be one of the minuses out there.
<Q - John W. Pitzer>: And that's helpful. And then, guys, just relative to DCG, at the Analyst Day in November you
talked about your expectation for Enterprise kind of being I believe a 7%- or 8%-type long-term grower. I know
relative to Glen's question around virtualization, you answered that. I guess my question is, have you taken into account
sort of Cloud and Enterprise as kind of offloading infrastructure into the Cloud? I know at the Analyst Day, you talked
about two-thirds of Cloud growth being Consumer and not Business. But if you start to lose dollars in Enterprise to

Cloud, is it kind of a one-to-one loss? If you lose it to Enterprise, you'll just make it up in Cloud? Or how do I think
about that dynamic?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: I think it's close enough for government work. If that's how it plays out, it should be
dollar-for-dollar or close enough that you don't care. One of the phenomena that we've seen is that we've seen the mix
in the Cloud actually moving up. So if you look at the ASP impact inside of Servers, John, it's more driven by Cloud
than anything else right now, and so they're buying a richer and richer mix and that's why I think you're probably pretty
close if you start to see an offload that way. And utilization rates inside of Enterprises tend to be pretty high on the
kinds of things that they move into the Cloud, so I think you're pretty close to one-to-one.

The next question comes from Alex Gauna from JMP Securities.
<Q - Alex D. Gauna>: Thanks so very much for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk about how you
see Asia specifically, and what's going on for you with the holiday build there and how that's factoring into your Q1
expectations? Thank you.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: We – like we said in Q4, we saw Asia continue to be soft. We've built in our seasonal
growth. We don't expect anything big to shift there, we see Asia continuing that they'll have that same seasonal growth
as well. We – the forecast stands. We don't see anything different occurring there, so to speak.
<Q - Alex D. Gauna>: Is there any evidence within your build and your ODM build into the Server market that – I
know some of that's coming back to service Data Center, but what about the opportunity in Asia for them to become a
stronger Data Center or Enterprise customer going forward?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Certainly. I mean, if you look at one of the places we look at for Data Center growth, and
we are seeing it, for both – I mean, it's across enterprise, cloud is growing very well. A lot of the cloud growth is driven
out of Asia. We absolutely see Asia as a growth area for the Data Center in general.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, I would just – exactly. And I would just say on the Client side, we think what we're
seeing in Asia is just that the tablet penetration rate increased. That's offset by a couple of years from what we saw in
mature markets. And so that's why I think we're seeing some stabilization and improvement in mature markets that's
ahead of emerging markets is we just reached a saturation point on tablet penetration and in the emerging markets, it's
still increasing. It's much more of Client phenomenon than a Data Center phenomenon.
<Q - Alex D. Gauna>: Would you expect the lag in Asia to be driven more by Bay Trail later on in the year?
<A - Mark Henninger>: Alex...
<Q - Alex D. Gauna>: Or Haswell?

Page 11 of 13
<Q - Vivek Arya>: Thanks for taking my question. So first on the smartphone or on tablet space, I think it is true that
Intel has a manufacturing lead. But do you think your cost reduction efforts and then the Moore's Law advantages ever
progress faster than the ASP declines in this space? In other words, do you think Intel can be sustainably profitable in
the mobile space which is maturing?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Yes. We absolutely do. You saw at the investor meeting products like SoFIA which really
are going be put on to 14-nanometer, fully integrated, all the way through with a 3G option or an LTE option and that
LTE is with carrier aggregation. Those kinds of products, we believe, are very, very cost competitive, in fact, leading
from a cost position.
In addition, we don't talk a lot about, but we are already in that low-cost Asia market. We are in Shenzhen. We are
working with ODMs there. That's actually where a lot of the innovation is coming out of for some of these cost
reductions on tablets and where we're getting the cost reduction ideas. So we're in that market now. We sold out of that
Shenzhen low-cost market in Q4. We'll continue through it through 2014. And with products like SoFIA on
leading-edge technology, we are very comfortable that we can get into those very low price points.
<Q - Vivek Arya>: Okay. Thanks, Brian. And as for my follow-up, there seems to be this race to provide 64-bit
capability in application processors. And I think you guys have always had the 64-bit support with Atom like – in fact,
all your products. So the question is what do you think is the value proposition of 64-bit? And how can you leverage
your 64-bit capabilities to win market share in mobile?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Sure. You're right. All of our products have always been 64-bit, including Atom. And so
OEMs who build with our products now can already go out and start to utilize 64-bit. We're out there working with the
OSes, all of the OSes, and the OEMs to go enable that. The real usages and the values are going to be in those
high-compute areas. Things like video. Things like media transfer, media manipulation. All the classic things around
computing that you saw drive the compute cycles on PC, and people are doing more and more with tablets and phones,
are going to be the same things that drive 64-bit utilization on these mobile devices. I think you'll also see it in security.
All of those things are going to drive a desire for 64-bit.
<Q - Vivek Arya>: Great. Thank you.

The next question comes from Mike McConnell from Pacific Crest.
<Q - Michael C. McConnell>: Thanks. I wanted to ask about, again, going back to enterprise and DCG. Since you
said that some of the fall-off late in the quarter was due to some of the government issues, shutdown, debt ceiling, et
cetera, and now that that the debt deal has been reached, have you gotten any feedback from some of these enterprise
customers that they're feeling more comfortable now to start to re-spend?
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: We'll watch it over the first quarter. I think the headline here is that the first half of the year we
saw an enterprise market that was declining. When we got into the back half of the year, it was growing. It was just
growing a little less fast than we thought, and the recovery was a little less fast than we thought. My expectation is we'll
see that segment kind of pop back to the normal rate.
I also think that we were just a bit ahead of ourselves in terms of how fast the enterprise market was going to recover
and grow. So we have a little bit more of a cautious view of that as we progress through 2014. So I guess the short
answer is yes, I'd expect that piece to come back. I still believe we'll be at the lower end of the guidance. We probably
were just a little overheated in Q4.
<Q - Michael C. McConnell>: I understand. And then my follow-up would be just, Stacy, can you remind us about
linearity in DCG? I guess would we have to wait until the second half of 2014 to kind of see the re-acceleration? Or do
you think we could still see growth in the first half of the year? Thanks.

<A - Stacy J. Smith>: No, I think you'll see year-on-year growth rates. I mean, remember, DCG's a – the order pattern
particularly with some of these big cloud customers can be very lumpy. But when you step back and look at it on a
year-on-year basis, I think we'll see year-on-year growth rates just kind of progress through the year.
<Q - Michael C. McConnell>: Sequentially though as well? Or is that -
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Sequentially it would be more based on kind of normal seasonality. But again for DCG, my
litmus test is always year-on-year growth rates tends to be a more meaningful indicator.

The next question comes from Hans Mosesmann from Raymond James.
<Q - Hans C. Mosesmann>: Thank you for letting me ask a question. Brian, real simple. If you can, can you split out
the types of servers that you sent or shipped in the quarter via enterprise, networking, if you can provide that level of
granularity. Thanks. Or splits.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: Yeah, we don't provide that level of granularity, but if you go back to Brian's prepared – this is
Stacy – you go back to Brian's prepared remarks, what you heard a lot of data on year-on-year growth rates across
cloud, networking, high-performance computing, and then I'm giving you for the enterprise piece, it was growth. It was
just a lower level of growth than we thought. So it's pretty – if you go back to the investor meeting stuff then take what
Brian showed you, what you'll see is for all those other segments was very consistent with how we modeled it.
Enterprise growth but a little bit less growth.
<Q - Hans C. Mosesmann>: Okay. And then as a follow-up, the Broadwell SoC – timing still second half of 2014?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Yes. I said that we'd made great progress on our 14-nanometer yields, and we were
actually very happy with the results that we got out of Q4, and we're squarely on target for our second half launch and
for, as Stacy said, starting production in Q1.
<Q - Hans C. Mosesmann>: Okay.
<A - Mark Henninger>: Thanks, Hans, and, operator, if you can, go ahead and introduce our last question.
Operator
The final question comes from Jim Covello from Goldman Sachs.
<Q - James V. Covello>: Thank you so much, guys. I appreciate it. I know that on the pickup in desktops you had said
it wasn't all corporate refresh, but obviously some of it was. Is there any chance that enterprise just had a fixed budget
and so more of it went to the corporate refresh in the fourth quarter and so they had a little bit less to spend on the data
center? And that could account for some of the delta there?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: We don't have a signal that suggests that, Jim. From what we've heard from the OEMs and
the customers is more around like, as Stacy said, a little bit of inventory coming into Q3 and into Q4 and then the
government shutdown. And if you looked at the order pattern, it really kind of followed that from what we could tell
from our position as well.
<A - Stacy J. Smith>: And I'd just add to that, as Brian said earlier, we had record shipments in the desktop on the
Core i7. We know that SKU is not an enterprise SKU at all. It's a consumer SKU. Our data as we look across consumer
was strong, all in ones were strong. So a lot of – i7 was strong. A lot of things that we know don't go into enterprise
were strong. So I don't think that was the driver of what happened in the client side of enterprise. And we don't have
any data points that would suggest that was what happened on the server side of enterprise.

<Q - James V. Covello>: Yeah, if I could just quickly on the follow up on the tablet. Could you give us some
perspective on the design wins that are not being supported by the contra revenue? In other words, sort of maybe a split
between design win activity that is supported by contra revenue that versus ones that aren't?
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: Yeah, I mean, we can't go into specifics of each one.
<Q - James V. Covello>: No. Sure, maybe just percentages or something.
<A - Brian M. Krzanich>: I'd say the majority of the projects that we have in 2014 use some level of contra revenue
to bring their BOMs, or their Bill of Materials – I want to make sure we don't use acronyms everywhere – their bill of
materials, to parity. And so it really is very SKU-by-SKU dependent. It's not a fixed number out there.
We work with each OEM, and that's how I'm comfortable that we're going to work this out over the next year or so. We
work with each OEM depending on what – are they targeting a high-end SKU, a mid-range SKU, a low-level SKU?
What type of display and graphics and all of those things they want to put in that system, we have a delta in BOM that
we're working out. So we go and work with them on that, and it's literally at that level. SKU by SKU.
