MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION SECTION
Operator
Welcome to Devon Energy's First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only
mode. After the prepared remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. The call is being recorded.
At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. Vince White, Senior Vice President of Communications and
Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.
Vincent W. White
Thank you, and welcome, everybody, to Devon's first quarter earnings call and webcast. Before we get started, I want
to make sure that everyone is aware that we have prepared a handful of slides to supplement today's presentation. The
slides are integrated with today's webcast but they're also available for download in PDF form on Devon's home page at
devonenergy.com. For those that are not participating via webcast, we'll make sure we refer to slide numbers during our
prepared remarks so that you can follow along.
Today's call will follow our usual format. That is, I will first cover a few preliminary items and then turn the call over
to our President and CEO, John Richels, for his comments, then Dave Hager, our Chief Operating Officer, will provide
an operations update; and we'll wrap up our commentary with a financial review by our CFO, Tom Mitchell. After our
financial discussion, we'll have a Q&A session, and we'll conclude the call after about an hour and a replay will be
available later today on our website. The Investor Relations team will also be available this afternoon should you have
any follow up questions.
On the call today, we're going to update some of our forward-looking information. In addition to the updates that we
are providing on the call, we will file an 8-K later today containing the details of our updated 2014 estimates. A copy of
this updated 8-K will be available within the Investor Relations section of the Devon website. The guidance that we are
providing today includes plans, forecasts, expectations, and estimates which are all considered forward-looking
statements under U.S. Securities law, and these are of course subject to a number of assumptions, risks and

At this point, I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, John Richels.
John Richels
Thank you, Vince, and good morning, everyone. Before we get into the business for the quarter, I'd like to take just a
moment here to welcome our latest addition to Devon's team of senior executives and that's our Chief Financial Officer,
Tom Mitchell. Many of you already know Tom and you know that Tom brings a wealth of industry experience and
considerable financial sophistication, and we're thrilled to have him onboard. As Vince already mentioned, you're going
to hear from Tom later on in the call and as you have the opportunity in the coming months to meet with him, please
join us in welcoming Tom to Devon.
So with that, let's take a look at our results. The first quarter was another excellent one for Devon. As shown on slide 3,
our disciplined focus on high-margin oil development opportunities led to another quarter of outstanding growth in oil
production that drove significant operating margin improvements. Additionally, we made meaningful progress in our
efforts to high-grade our go-forward asset portfolio. This progress was evidenced by the closing of our Eagle Ford
acquisition, the completion of the EnLink Midstream combination, our exit from the conventional gas business in
Canada, and our recently announced bolt-on acreage acquisition in Cana. In addition, we once again raised our
dividend during the quarter.
Now let's take a look at some of the highlights in more detail. In the first quarter, we achieved year-over-year oil
production growth of 21% from our go-forward asset base, reaching an average daily rate of 176,000 barrels per day.
As can be seen on slide 4, this growth was driven entirely by light sweet crude production from our retained U.S.
assets, which increased an impressive 56% compared to the first quarter of 2013.
With our success in growing high-margin production, we expect oil and natural gas liquids to approach nearly 60% of
Devon's go-forward production mix by year-end. In addition to our robust growth in high-margin oil production, we
benefited from the sharp rise in natural gas pricing and improved Canadian heavy oil realizations. This increased first
quarter upstream revenue by 42% compared to the first quarter of 2013. As shown on slide 5, 67% of our upstream
revenue came from liquids. Higher revenues coupled with our low-cost structure drove operating margins by more than
50% year-over-year.
Another notable first quarter financial highlight was a 9% increase in Devon's quarterly cash dividend to $0.24 per
share. This is Devon's ninth dividend increase since 2004, representing an annual compound growth rate of 23%. Our
dividend increase reflects Devon's long-term commitment to returning cash to our shareholders and ultimately
underscores the confidence we have in our business.
Looking beyond our operating and financial results for the quarter, we did an outstanding job in the past few months in
executing our portfolio transformation, which is now nearly complete. The first major milestone occurred on February
28 with the closing of our Eagle Ford acquisition. This acquisition of 82,000 net acres in the economic heart of the
play, adds a new light oil core area to Devon's portfolio, offering some of the highest rate of return drilling
opportunities in North America. While we've only owned this position for a short time, the reservoir performance that
we've seen to-date has been outstanding, fully supporting our production growth targets and double-digit accretion in
cash flow per debt-adjusted share.
One week later, on March 7, we closed on our midstream combination with Crosstex to form EnLink Midstream.
EnLink units are now trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbols ENLC for the general partner
and ENLK for the MLP. And while the assets we contributed were valued in the transaction at about $4.8 billion, the
ownership interest in the EnLink securities that we received had a market value at yesterday's close of more than $7.5

billion or approximately 27% of our current market capitalization. This valuable ownership was obtained by
contributing most of Devon's U.S. midstream assets to EnLink. The contributed assets accounted for only 7% of
Devon's cash flow last year. Furthermore, the loss of this direct midstream cash flow was offset by our receipt of
quarterly distribution payments from EnLink and EnLink's assumption of the associated capital obligations.
Looking beyond these immediate benefits, we're also excited about the attractive long-term growth prospects associated
with this business. The stable, fixed-fee structure, the deep backlog of liquids-oriented projects, and the future
drop-down potential from both Devon and from the general partner provide a foundation for EnLink to deliver
attractive distribution growth for many years.
We took another significant step forward in our transformation in early April by closing the sale of our Canadian
conventional business for C$3.125 billion. This was the largest divestiture package in our non-core asset sales process
and we attractively monetized these gas-weighted assets at nearly seven times EBITDA which is a substantial premium
to Devon's current trading multiple.
After adjusting for currency exchange and taxes associated with both the sale and the repatriation of the funds to the
U.S., we're receiving net proceeds of US$2.7 billion. For our remaining divestiture assets, which are all located in the
U.S., we're putting the final touches on the data rooms with the expectation to complete the sale of all non-core assets
by year-end.
Most recently, we opportunistically added to our core Cana-Woodford position by acquiring an additional 50,000 net
acres and 5,800 equivalent barrels per day of production. These assets directly overlap our existing core Cana position
and expand our opportunity set with exposure to other western Oklahoma oil and gas plays. This move is consistent
with our philosophy of building scale and scope in our core play areas. Later on in the call, Dave will discuss some
recent positive developments at Cana that led to our decision to acquire the additional interests.
The bold steps we've recently taken to high-grade our asset base have positioned Devon with a formidable and
balanced portfolio, focused on fewer core areas in some of the most attractive basins in North America. Our retained
asset base consists of three world-class oil development plays in the Permian Basin, the Eagle Ford, and Canadian oil
sands, and two of the best liquids-rich gas areas in the U.S., the Barnett Shale and the Anadarko Basin. Each of these
core areas has the inventory to materially grow production and sufficient scale to generate substantial amounts of cash
flow. Our capital budget for these retained properties in 2014 is around $5 billion, concentrated in our three
high-margin oil development plays.
Looking at slide 6, company-wide oil production is expected to grow by more than 30% year-over-year led by a
70%-plus increase in U.S. oil production. This should drive growth of about 10% in top line production on an energy
equivalent basis, or 20% higher on a 20:1 price equivalency basis. As evidenced by our solid first quarter performance,
we are well on our way to achieving these attractive growth targets.
In addition to the growth we're delivering in 2014, Devon's also positioned for significant high-margin oil growth in
2015 and beyond. That's illustrated on slide 7 where you can see that we expect Devon's retained asset base to generate
organic oil production growth in excess of 20% in 2015. Let's take a look at the specific drivers of this oil growth. Our
most significant growth next year will come from low-risk infill drilling in the Eagle Ford where we expect production
to average well over 100,000 BOEs per day. In addition to this exceptional volume growth trajectory, this
highly-profitable production will also deliver a powerful free cash flow stream that should exceed $1 billion based on
current prices. So just to be clear, that free cash flow is cash flow in excess of our capital investment.
Another driver of growth in 2015 will be the acceleration of drilling activity in the Delaware Basin, specifically in
Southeast New Mexico. Over the next year, we will accelerate development of our rapidly-growing resource potential
in that area and Dave is going to provide more details on our significantly expanding inventory and significantly
growing resource potential in this prolific basin later on in the call. And lastly in Canada, the startup of our Jackfish 3
facility later this year will commence another leg of multi-year oil production growth from our thermal oil business. In
2015, we expect net oil production from our Jackfish complex to increase to a range of between 62,000 barrels per day
and 67,000 barrels per day representing a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 30%.

Furthermore the completion of Jackfish 3 will lower Devon's overall capital intensity and begin an era of free cash flow
from our Jackfish complex with the potential to generate up to $1 billion annually for many years. As you can see on
slide 8, this wall of cash provides a significant source of capital for E&P investment, debt reduction, dividends, and
share repurchases.
So, in summary, I've never been more excited about Devon's future than today. As outlined on slide 9, Devon has
established itself as one of the largest oil producers among our North American onshore peers. When you combine the
growth potential of our top tier oil development projects with our high-quality natural gas optionality, we are
well-positioned for extremely competitive growth rates for years to come. What makes our growth story even more
compelling is Devon's attractive valuation. Backing out the value of the EnLink securities from our enterprise value on
EBITDA reveals that our E&P business is trading at just over four times EBITDA. As we continue to execute on our
growth plan, Devon's shares have the potential to benefit not only from improving margins and higher cash flow, but
also through multiple expansion.
So with that, I will turn the call over to Dave Hager for a more detailed operations review. Dave?
David A. Hager
Thanks, John. Good morning, everyone. Let's begin with a quick recap of our first quarter capital expenditures.
Exploration and development capital for the first quarter totaled $1.2 billion, just below the bottom-end of our previous
guidance range. Based on our planned activity levels for the remaining three quarters of 2014, we remain on track with
full-year drilling and completions capital guidance range of $4.8 billion to $5.2 billion for our go-forward assets.
As John indicated earlier, our focus on high-margin oil projects led to another quarter of outstanding growth in oil
production. Let's take a closer look at some of the first quarter operating highlights.
Beginning with the Permian, first quarter production averaged a record 91,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. This
record was driven by robust growth in oil production, which increased 36% compared to the first quarter of 2013 and
was 9% higher than the previous quarter. Light oil production continues to account for 60% of our total Permian
production.
In the Delaware Basin, our Bone Spring horizontal program is the most significant driver of our Permian oil growth. In
the first quarter, we brought 35 Bone Spring wells online with average 30-day IP rates approaching 700 barrels of oil
equivalent per day, of which 80% was light oil.
Also in the Delaware Basin, we commenced production on two high-rate oil wells targeting the Delaware Sands in Lea
County, New Mexico. Initial 30-day production from these two wells averaged in excess of 1,000 BOE per day, and
consisted of nearly 90% light oil. The tremendous results we continue to see from our Delaware Basin drilling
programs, coupled with our ongoing reservoir characterization work, has allowed us to substantially increase our risked
inventory in the Delaware Basin.
To help you more fully appreciate the scale and scope of our potential in the Delaware Basin, I want to turn your
attention to slide 10, which illustrates our acreage position by prospective formation.
As you can see, the stacked pay nature of our position in the Delaware Basin provides us with exposure not only to the
Bone Spring and Delaware Sands, but also the Leonard Shale, Wolfcamp, and several other oil zones. If you add up
this leasehold by formation, you can see we have approximately 500,000 net acres to appraise and develop.
Turning to slide 11, you can see this translates into a significant inventory of undrilled locations for Devon. Our largest
and most economic opportunity is in the Bone Spring. We recently completed a comprehensive reservoir evaluation on
a large portion of our Bone Spring acreage position. This work, combined with strong well performance and successful
appraisal drilling in several step-out areas, has allowed us to add some 1,900 additional locations to our Bone Spring
inventory. This boosts our undrilled Bone Spring inventory to 3,500 locations. Adding locations in the Delaware Sands,
Leonard Shale, and several other formations brings our total risked inventory in the Delaware Basin to more than 5,000

undrilled locations.
To put this in perspective, at our current activity levels, this represents more than 25 years of drilling inventory in the
Delaware Basin. Keep in mind, these are risked locations and do not include any location for our Wolfcamp acreage
which we are currently evaluating. We fully expect additional inventory increases over time as Devon and the industry
continue to de-risk this world-class oil basin.
With this significant inventory in the Delaware Basin, I'd like to provide some thoughts on how we will approach
converting this resource into production and cash flow. Today, we are running 12 rigs in the Delaware Basin, the
appropriate level of activity given the availability in Southeast New Mexico of gas gathering and processing capacity,
high-quality rigs, completion services, and manpower. Our program in 2014 is focused almost entirely on our high-rate
of return and low-risk Bone Spring development opportunities. Over the next year, we expect additional capacity
build-out within this portion of the Permian to support additional activity to further exploit our rapidly-growing
resource inventory in the region.
While we are not ready to provide specific plans, our preliminary view on 2015 is that we will have the opportunity to
significantly increase our drilling activity next year. This would allow us to continue aggressively developing our
highly-profitable Bone Spring and accelerate the government and appraisal of our Delaware Sands, Leonard Shale, and
Wolfcamp well inventories. Given our outlook for significant cash flow growth next year, we clearly have the means to
fund a more robust level of activity. As John highlighted in his opening remarks, the acceleration of drilling activity in
the Delaware Basin is a visible source of future light oil production in 2015 and will remain a cornerstone asset for
Devon for many years to come.
Shifting to the Southern Midland Basin, we continue to see solid results from our oil development program in the
Wolfcamp Shale, where we have a joint venture partnership with Sumitomo. During the first quarter, we tied-in 26
Wolfcamp Shale wells, increasing our average net production in the play to an average of 10,000 BOE per day.
Compared to the first quarter of 2013, this represents production growth of 8,000 BOE per day.
Moving to the Eagle Ford, as John mentioned, we completed our acquisition of 82,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford on
February 28, resulting in one month of production in our first quarter reported results. Although, we have only owned
these assets for a couple of months now, we couldn't be more pleased with the quality and with our joint venture
relationship with BHP in DeWitt County. The well and reservoir performance we have seen to-date reinforces our
previous forecast for average net daily production of 70,000 BOE per day to 80,000 BOE per day for the 10 months we
will own this asset this year. We're also on track to deliver well in excess of 100,000 BOE per day in 2015.
As many of you are aware through recent BHP disclosures, March production on our DeWitt County acreage was
temporarily constrained by third-party gathering system downtime and the timing of well tie-ins. In Eagle Ford, the
production growth profile for most operators is somewhat lumpy due to nature of pad drilling, and the Devon-BHP
partnership is no exception. With wells being brought on in groups as many as 20 at a time and the timing of bringing
on necessary infrastructure to tie-in the wells, the production growth will tend to come in step changes.
For March, our first month of ownership, our net Eagle Ford production averaged 49,000 barrels of oil equivalent per
day; however, as shown on slide 12, an increase in well tie-ins at the end of March and in April, have driven our net
daily production up to 64,000 BOE per day currently. We expect to average between 65,000 BOE per day and 70,000
BOE per day for the second quarter. And for the second half of the year, we expect our Eagle Ford production to
increase to a range of 80,000 BOE per day to 85,000 BOE per day.
Our growth in the Eagle Ford in the second half of this year is being driven by a large number of well tie-ins during that
period. Our Eagle Ford drilling program remains on plan, and at quarter end we had an inventory of about 120 wells
drilled but not yet producing. In the second half of the year, we expect this inventory to trend downward as we catch-up
on pad tie-ins and necessary transportation system improvements are completed in DeWitt County. As I mentioned
earlier, for the 10 months we will own the asset in 2014, we are on track to achieve our previously announced guidance
of an average of 70,000 barrels per day to 80,000 barrels per day.

In addition to world-class oil development in DeWitt County, we are excited about the emerging opportunities we see
ahead of us on our 32,000 net acres in Lavaca County. As you can see on slide 13, recently announced well results by
industry in this area, represented in blue, have included initial oil production rates of more than 1,000 barrels of oil per
day. These results have far exceeded our expectations for the area, and with less than 10% of the acquisition value
assigned to our 32,000 net acres, we are extremely encouraged with the upside potential on this acreage. We expect to
bring our first Lavaca County wells online in the second quarter, and as previously disclosed, expect to participate in
roughly 30 gross wells for the full-year.
And lastly, I want to briefly mention another potential upside we have identified across our entire position in the Eagle
Ford. We have mapped our acreage position in Lavaca and DeWitt County and believe that most of our acreage is
prospective for the Upper Eagle Ford formation. Our belief is supported by recent industry results as noted in green on
slide 13. We are evaluating these results and the timing of our first operated well to test the Upper Eagle Ford.
Moving now to our thermal oil projects in Northeast Alberta on slide 14, first quarter gross production from our two
Jackfish projects averaged roughly 62,000 barrels of oil per day or roughly 52,000 barrels per day after royalties. At
Jackfish 1, gross production averaged 37,000 barrels per day or 29,000 barrels per day net of royalties. The success of
our ongoing efforts to improve steam efficiency and well productivity allowed us to exceed the facility's nameplate
capacity of 35,000 barrels a day during the quarter. Recently, we have seen excellent results from efficiency
modifications to our steam generators, lowering steam chamber pressures, optimizing the temperature profile in the
steam chamber, and conducting well stimulations.
Continued success from these and other efforts underway to lower our steam oil ratio could result in continued growth
in production above nameplate capacity. Construction of Jackfish 3 is essentially complete and plant commission
activities are well underway. We expect to begin injecting steam in the third quarter of this year. Delivery of first oil is
scheduled to occur late this year, with production ramping up throughout 2015.
At Pike, our thermal oil sands joint venture with BP, the approval process for the first phase of the Pike development
remains on track and we expect to receive regulatory approval later this year. As a reminder, the Pike 1 development
project will have ultimate gross production capacity of 105,000 barrels of oil per day. Devon operates Pike with a 50%
working interest.
Shifting now to the Anadarko Basin in Western Oklahoma, our liquids-rich Cana-Woodford Shale play averaged a
record 60,000 BOE per day in the first quarter. As John mentioned, our recently announced transaction in the
Cana-Woodford allows us to increase our scale and scope in one of our core liquids-rich gas plays and at a cost of less
than $2 per BOE for the roughly 150 million barrels of risked resource. The additional 50,000 net acres increases our
core Cana position to approximately 300,000 net acres.
We were particularly excited to acquire this acreage after seeing some positive results from our recent technical work in
the area. With the asset team's focus on managing base production, we discovered through reservoir engineering,
including pressure transient analysis, that we had enhancement opportunities on many of our core area producing wells.
We have now performed these enhancements on about 70 producing wells and the results have been outstanding. In
most cases, this inexpensive treatment took production per well from around 1 million cubic feet equivalent per day up
to 3 million a day or more. We believe these efforts should increase EURs by about a Bcf per well with a payback
period of less than three months.
We have identified more than 200 additional wells that can be treated in the core area including wells on our new
acreage. In addition to this technical work, we've continued to make improvements to our completion design. With our
most recent wells, we have doubled the number of frac stages and increased the amount of proppant pumped to about 6
million pounds per well, a 70% increase over our previous jobs. The results from these completion improvements as
well as our down-hole work on the existing producers have been outstanding. Production performance from these wells
are exceeding our type curve model and significantly enhancing our rate of return.
These stronger returns have improved the competitiveness of our Cana drilling within our portfolio which ultimately
led us to take advantage of the opportunity to acquire additional acreage. We are evaluating the impact of the

acquisition and the recent technical advancements at Cana on our capital allocation plan and will discuss any
modification during next quarter's call.
Looking at our Mississippian-Woodford Trend position in North Central Oklahoma, we brought 63 operated wells
online during the quarter within the Sinopec joint venture area with overall results supporting our type curve
expectations. Solid performance from these wells helped drive our average first quarter production in the Trend to
19,000 BOE per day, of which 50% was light oil. This represents a production growth rate of 35% compared to the
fourth quarter of 2013. The focus of our activity this year is on the JV area where we have the benefit of a carry and are
seeing the most consistent results.
And finally, our Rockies assets continued to deliver excellent results with net production averaging 20,000 BOE per
day in the first quarter. Liquids production in the Rockies increased 21% compared to the first quarter of last year and
account for nearly half of Devon's product mix in the region. Our activity was highlighted by two high-rate oil wells
brought online during the quarter, an Iberlin Ranch well targeting the Frontier formation was tied-in with initial 30-day
production rates averaging 2,000 BOE per day, including more than 1,700 barrels of oil per day. We also commenced
production on a well targeting the Parkman formation with 30-day production rates averaging in excess of 1,100 BOE
per day, of which 96% was light oil. Devon has 150,000 net acres in the Powder River Basin, prospective for multiple
formations including the Parkman, Turner, and Frontier. The company has identified approximately 1,000 risked
locations across the Powder River Basin and expects its drilling inventory to increase as the company de-risks this oil
opportunity.
So in summary, we had another strong quarter of execution across our entire North American onshore portfolio. The
core focus areas that I discussed today on the call are delivering highly economic and robust production growth for
Devon. And with our growing inventory of opportunities, we are poised to deliver impressive oil growth in 2014 and
beyond.
With that, I'll turn the call over to Tom for the financial review and outlook. Tom?
Thomas L. Mitchell
Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll take you through a brief review of our financial and
operating results in the first quarter and, where called for, provide updated guidance. Before I get started, I wanted to
remind everyone of the changes in our first quarter financial reporting, resulting from the EnLink transaction.
Now that Devon is the majority owner in EnLink, accounting rules require that 100% of EnLink's revenues, expenses,
debt, and capital are consolidated within our financial statements. The minority ownership interest from the portion that
we do not own will be netted and deducted on a line item in the financials entitled non-controlling interests. Due to
these accounting changes, the comparability of first quarter results to prior quarters from a trend analysis perspective is
challenging. However, in our earnings release and in our upcoming SEC filings, we're providing supplemental
schedules that will break-out the results of our upstream business from that of EnLink.
Since John covered the first quarter production highlights earlier in the call, I will begin with a quick review of our
outlook of production. In the second quarter, we expect our go-forward asset portfolio to deliver total production of
609,000 BOE per day to 631,000 BOE per day. This represents top line growth from our retained assets of
approximately 15% compared to the second quarter of 2013. Most importantly, this expected increase in production is
underpinned by strong, high-margin oil growth. For our go-forward properties, we are forecasting oil production in the
second quarter to increase by roughly 30% year-over-year to a range of between 200,000 and 210,000 barrels per day.
This excellent growth in high-margin oil production is driven by a full-quarter of Eagle Ford production and continued
success in our Permian development programs. For the full-year, we remain comfortable with our previous guidance
range, and are on track to produce between 579,000 BOE per day and 622,000 BOE per day from our go-forward
business driven by a full-year growth rate in excess of 30%.

Moving to our upstream revenue, in the first quarter, improved price realizations for all products combined with higher
oil production drove our E&P upstream revenue to $2.6 billion. This represents an increase in oil, gas, and NGL sales
of 42% compared to the year-ago quarter. The most notable improvements in regional pricing were attributable to our
Canadian heavy oil production, strong gas realizations from our retained U.S. portfolio, and a meaningful price uptick
in Mid-Continent NGLs. In the first quarter, oil sales alone, excluding NGLs, accounted for more than 50% of our E&P
revenue.
Turning now to our midstream business, once again our midstream business delivered excellent results, generating
$183 million of operating profit in the first quarter, a 47% increase compared to the first quarter of last year and about
20% above the high-end of our guidance range. Improved price realizations and effective cost management were the
key drivers behind our first quarter outperformance. Our first quarter results did include 25 days of contribution from
EnLink, which amounted to $50 million of operating profit. Based on our strong start to the year, we're confident of our
full-year forecast for midstream operating profit of $685 million to $755 million.
Moving to expenses, overall our first quarter pre-tax expenses were generally in line with our expectations, totaling
$1.8 billion. Excluding the costs associated with the consolidation of EnLink, pre-tax expenses were 8% higher than the
first quarter of 2013. The increase in unit cost is attributable to higher production tasks and operating expenses
associated with the company's rapidly growing high-margin oil production. In addition, $22 million of non-recurring
G&A transaction expenses associated with EnLink and the GeoSouthern transactions, and a change in our timing of our
annual stock-based compensation grant resulted in an increase in the first quarter G&A. The stock-based equity grants
were previously made in the fourth quarter of each year. However, to better link stock-based compensation to the year's
performance, the 2013 grant was delayed to the first quarter of 2014, resulting in no grant during the calendar year of
2013.
In the upcoming quarter, we expect improvements in our unit cash costs. Looking specifically at our largest cash costs,
lease operating expense, we expect second quarter LOE to decline by about 5% sequentially to a range of $9 to $9.25
per BOE. This expected improvement in unit LOE cost is driven by our first full-quarter of production from our
low-cost Eagle Ford assets, and the sale of our high-cost Canadian conventional business that took effect at the
beginning of April.
For those of you modeling Devon, it's important to incorporate the change in our go-forward DD&A rates. In the
second quarter, we expect DD&A expense to increase to a range of $13 to $14 per BOE. This increase in DD&A
which, of course, is a non-cash expense, is primarily attributable to a full-quarter of depletion expense associated with
our newly acquired Eagle Ford properties and the consolidation of EnLink. For the full-year, our DD&A forecast
remains unchanged at $12.50 to $14.50 per BOE. Cutting to the bottom line, our non-GAAP earnings increased to $547
million, or $1.34 per share. This is more than double our earnings per share in the year-ago quarter and comfortably
exceeded the Wall Street consensus expectations. This improved profitability translated into higher cash flows with
first quarter operating cash flow totaling $1.4 billion, a 41% increase year-over-year.
Before we open the call to Q&A, I'll conclude my remarks with a quick review of our balance sheet and liquidity. At
the end of the first quarter, our financial position remains strong, reflecting an investment grade credit rating across the
board. With cash balances of $2 billion, we exited the quarter with a net debt balance of $13.5 billion. Of this amount,
$1.5 billion of net debt is attributable to EnLink and is non-recourse to Devon. If you include the proceeds from the
closing of our Canadian conventional divestiture package in early April, our net debt decreases to about $11 billion or
just over $9 billion if you exclude EnLink's net debt. Looking ahead, any proceeds from our U.S. divestiture process
will be utilized to reduce debt, further strengthening our high-quality balance sheet.
So with that, I'll turn the call back over to Vince for Q&A. Vince?

Q&A
Operator
Your first question comes from the line of Arun Jayaram from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: Good morning, gentlemen. It seems like the story of the quarter was the Delaware Basin
inventory update, so I was just wondering if you can maybe elaborate a little bit on what drove the increase in the
inventory. I believe your type curve was around 500 MBO. Any thoughts on overall well performance? And I know
you're not ready to talk about the program next year, but could we see a pretty significant increase in activity? And then
what do – how many rigs are you running today in the Delaware?
<A - David A. Hager>: Hi, Arun. This is Dave. I'll take a stab at that. We're currently running 12 rigs in the Delaware.
And yes, as we said, we do anticipate a significant increase next year as we work our way through all of the limitations
that currently exist out there at the availability of gas processing capacity, the availability of rigs, completion crews,
manpower, et cetera, and we're working through all of those factors as we speak.
Yes, this was a big story for us and there were really two key things that factored into this. One is, we have continued
to appraise our acreage position throughout the Delaware Basin, particularly in Lea and Eddy County. And so as we're
getting those results, it's given us greater confidence to up our risked inventory, and obviously the results from those
wells have been outstanding throughout our acreage position. And second, frankly, we've just taken the time to look at
it in a more comprehensive manner than we've been able to do previously. And when we look at it more
comprehensively, coupled with the outstanding well results across our entire acreage position, we suspected it was
there but were basically able to move it from an – into our risked inventory.
And so we feel very good, and I would point that the slide that we included there, on slide 11, did not include anything
for the Wolfcamp. And the Wolfcamp, we think, has tremendous prospectivity in Southeast New Mexico, there's just
not a lot of wells have been drilled there yet. So we think as there's additional wells drilled in that area that that
inventory is going to increase also.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: Okay. My second question is just on the Eagle Ford. It sounds like you're well on track in terms
of 2014 despite the lower March. But as we think about the 2015 program, a lot of confidence here around production
well north of or in excess of 100,000 barrels a day. Can you just talk about the confidence in the ramp and what's given
you that confidence? Is there early well results or what?
<A - David A. Hager>: Yeah, I'll take a stab at that again, Arun. Absolutely, the well results have been 100%
consistent with our acquisition expectations. These are outstanding wells. These are wells in the core of the core of the
Eagle Ford, and so that gives us tremendous confidence. Our infrastructure needs are continuing to be build-out.
Frankly, we've been able to – we think already in the first couple months we've owned the asset to bring some
improved efficiency to the overall process. And all of that put together gives us tremendous confidence that we're going
to have the ramp that we talk about.
<A - John Richels>: And, Arun, it's John. One thing I'd just toss in here to what Dave has already said, you'll recall
that when we did that acquisition, we indicated that GeoSouthern and BHP, prior to the acquisition, had drilled at least
one well on every drilling unit across the DeWitt County acreage. So this confidence that Dave's talking about is
bolstered by the fact that we have a pretty darn good idea about what every drilling unit on that acreage looks like.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: Okay, that's great. And then just my final question, as we think about heavy oil for the balance
of the year, just thoughts on how you see that market playing out, and I know in 2015 one of the potential headwinds is
just on the Alberta Clipper which hasn't been approved yet by the State Department. Any thoughts on 2015 heavy oil
differentials and is there enough rail maybe to soften the blow of the Alberta Clipper?
<A - Darryl G. Smette>: Yeah, this is Darryl. You're exactly on point. We do expect that we're going to see increased
takeaway capacity with the Flanagan South pipeline. That's due to come on mid-2014, probably later part of July is the

date we're getting now from Enbridge. That's a 585,000 barrel a day pipeline. They have a couple permits that they
have to get from the BLM, but anticipate that that will come on-stream. That will bring additional capacity from
Chicago down to the Cushing hub and then onto the Gulf Coast.
The Alberta Clipper is the line that runs from Hardisty in Alberta down to the connect points in the Mid-Continent.
That would add about 800,000 barrels a day of capacity. That is generally requiring only additional pump stations
where more horsepower, not additional line looping. They are waiting on – or they are waiting, Enbridge is waiting on
the government to issue those permits. The latest indication we have from them is that they will expect those permits
later on this year so that capacity should be operational sometime in 2015.
<Q - Arun Jayaram>: Thanks a lot.
<A - Vincent W. White>: Darryl, could you bring that all together and summarize? You have a lot of detailed
knowledge there clearly but summarize what this means for differentials.
<A - Darryl G. Smette>: Well, in terms of differentials, they've been fairly volatile since we have supply and demand
that's been fairly balanced over the last couple years and we have seen that volatility range anywhere from $20 up to as
high as $40 and $50. With that additional capacity coming on-stream, including some additional capacity at some of the
refineries, we think those differentials will have downward pressure. So while they'll still remain volatile, we think that
they'll be in that $20 barrel to $25 barrel range, maybe $26 barrel range, consistently, rather than the volatility that
we've seen from $20 up to $40 or $45.
<A - Vincent W. White>: Thank you.
<A - Darryl G. Smette>: Vince, I'd like to also add just as an addition there. So we do have, as an industry, a lot of rail
capacity now. Two years ago, as an industry, we had about 125,000 barrels of rail capacity out of Canada to the United
States. By the end of this year, that will be close to 650,000 barrels a day. So not only are we hopeful with the pipelines
coming on-stream but there is also the additional rail capacity that makes us feel very good about where differentials
are going.
<A - Vincent W. White>: Great. Operator, I want to remind everybody to limit their questions to one initial inquiry
and one follow up and we're ready for the next participant.
Operator
Your next question comes from Doug Leggate from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Thanks. I appreciate you getting me in, guys. I'll try two quick ones hopefully. So I'm trying to
understand how we should interpret the balance sheet comment because you've obviously got substantial inventory
potential in the Delaware but it looks like the Eagle Ford inventory is going up and now you've got the Rockies and I
guess the Cana is additive as well. Should we think of you spending your cash flow like old Devon or should we think
about you starting to use your balance sheet to accelerate the overall pace? I know you're not ready to give us details
specifically yet but just talk high level how should we think about activity levels.
<A - Vincent W. White>: Well, my first – this is Vince – my first observation is while we have this growing resource
inventory, we also have a lot of growth in cash flow. So when you look at 2015 with the free cash flow thrown off by
the Eagle Ford over and above the capital requirements and by our thermal projects, we've got a lot of capacity to
invest in this expanding inventory.
<A - John Richels>: And, Doug, we're in the position now – the reason we're so excited about where we are as a
company frankly, we're in the position now where we think we can grow our oil production, which is obviously our
highest-margin product, by 20% or more for considerable period of time while living within cash flow. And with a $9
billion debt level, we're probably at a fairly – appropriate place for us to be, and we haven't been in the position in the
past few years of being able to grow that kind of production, which, and the important part of it is, of course, we're also
growing – commensurately growing our cash flow per share without ramping up debt or shoveling a bunch of equity

out the door. And that's a pretty exciting position for us to be in. And that kind of growth rate for a company our size I
think stacks up pretty well.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: A big change from six months ago that's for sure. My follow up real quick is ownership in the
GP, just big picture comments there in terms of – 70%, it just seems there's no need to [indiscernible] (49:57) how big
of a position. I'm just curious is how you're thinking about that. And I'll leave at that there. Thank you.
<A - John Richels>: That's turned out really well for us. As you know, as we said we put those assets in at about $4.8
billion, we're at the better part of $8 billion today. So there's been a huge amount of accretion. And it's a strategic asset
for us. We've always wanted to keep control of those assets or have some influence over those assets because they're so
integral to our operations. And we're – we think there's going to be a lot of value accretion at the EnLink level over the
next few years, not only from a bunch of really exciting ideas that the management team at EnLink has, but also
through the continuation of the drop-downs from the general partner, and also from Devon. And you'll recall we've
given the rate of first offer to EnLink to purchase the expanded Access Pipeline in Canada when it's complete. So we're
going to see lot of growth.
Now having said that, you're absolutely right, that there – we've got a larger position today than we ultimately need to
control. But that's not lost on us. We'll always look at ways to realize that. But frankly, we've got to do something that
is creative and innovative, Doug, because selling a bunch of units and paying a lot of tax isn't the way to do it. So we're
really actually excited about that position and the continued growth but we'll always keep our eye on that.
<Q - Doug Leggate>: Appreciate the answers. Thank you.
<A - Vincent W. White>: Operator, we're ready for the next question.
Operator
Great. Your next question comes from the line of Brian Singer from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - John Richels>: Good. Hi, Brian.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: You touched on Canadian oil realizations earlier, but wanted to ask on U.S. oil realizations
which looks like they widened out a bit. I assume some of that is adding condensate in the Eagle Ford. But wanted to
see how you think your differentials will fall-out as we go forward both on the condensate front and the Eagle Ford,
and then if you expect any bottlenecks in the Permian both from a midstream ability to get oil out and then also if there
are changes in your gravity and related realizations of the Delaware Basin?
<A - Darryl G. Smette>: Yeah, this is Darryl again. Let's first take Permian. We have seen differentials widened there
since the end of last year into the first quarter where differentials both for West Texas sour and West Texas sweet were
about $3.50; fourth or the second quarter of this year looks like that's going to be closer to $8, that's driven by a couple
facts. There just been increased production out of the Permian Basin, plus, there was some refinery maintenance that
extended longer than was anticipated, about three weeks. That's caused a bottleneck in the buildup of supply. All of that
should be relieved by the end of this quarter as we have another 350,000 barrels a day of pipeline capacity coming
on-stream. 50,000 barrels a day is an expansion of the Longhorn system put in place last year. 300,000 of that is
BridgeTex.
So when you add all of that capacity, that gives you about 5.6 million barrels of export capacity, there's about 400
million barrels I guess of refining and production out there is around 1.5 million barrels. So right now we think the
differentials while they're $8, that's going to narrow somewhat less than $2.50 as we go through the rest of the year. So
we feel pretty good about that.
As we look at differentials in the Eagle Ford, our average gravity in the Eagle Ford is about 52 degrees. The first month
that we had that asset, our net differential off WTI was about $7. We expect that to continue to be volatile as more of

that type of crude is produced, but we think that's going to be volatile in the range of about $6 to $12 off WTI. That
should work itself out, we think, based on the projects that are ongoing in terms of splitters that will allow some of that
lighter-end product to be split out. In the next quarter we think that differential will narrow down to the $6 to $8 range
as we go forward. All of these are things that we have anticipated when we made the acquisition. Our view still hasn't
changed.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: Great. Thank you. That's helpful. And then just thinking into 2015, your comments on
increasing activity, again, particularly on the Permian Basin, how or what are you – what is Devon doing to mitigate
the cost inflation, and what level of cost increases are you expecting or able to withstand when you think about adding
CapEx in activity levels?
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, the economics on these plays are pretty robust, so all of the plays could handle higher
CapEx. We do a lot of work to avoid that situation, obviously, and we have just actually finished for this year, just
recently our rebidding of all our stimulation work for the year. We're able to – we have very good relationships with the
key vendors; have had them over multiple years. We were able to avoid any significant price increases. It's going to be
basically flat in 2014 versus 2013. And we anticipate that these type of relationships are going to help us significantly
in the future. I can't predict exactly what 2015 is going to look like, but you can think of 2014 has already had
rapidly-increasing activity in the Permian, but there is at the same time a lot of additional capacity coming into the
Permian. So I don't think we're going to have a significant issue there.
<Q - Brian A. Singer>: Great. Thank you.
<A - Vincent W. White>: Operator, next question?
Operator
Your next question comes from the line of Subash Chandra from Jefferies. Your line is open.
<Q - Subash V. Chandra>: Yeah, hi. Just want to confirm that Eagle Ford guidance did not include Lavaca County?
<A - David A. Hager>: It does include Lavaca County. That includes our entire Eagle Ford position, the 70,000 BOE
per day to 80,000 BOE per day, which is what we originally guided to also.
<Q - Subash V. Chandra>: Right. Okay, got it. Okay. And the second one on the Permian and Bone Spring, it looks
like it'll be a Bone Spring heavy program. What sort of initiatives are there potential for more water recycling out in the
Delaware, and what are sort of the technical challenges of doing that, if any?
<A - David A. Hager>: Yeah, probably one of the biggest challenges that we have is, and you can get an idea from the
map that we included in there, that our acreage is spread out throughout Lea and Eddy Counties. So to the degree that
we have contiguous position that has sufficient scale, that allows us to get into where water recycling can work more
efficiently and we're working through that right now. We're already doing that in the South Midland Basin, as we
speak, and we're looking for opportunities to expand that into the Delaware Basin.
<Q - Subash V. Chandra>: And just along those lines, some of these other horizons, Leonard, et cetera, are they drier
than the Bone Springs [indiscernible] (57:27)?
<A - David A. Hager>: Well, we have included in our count essentially the oily areas of each of these because these
are the ones that we think are economic. So these are – the Leonard, I think some of the industry competition has been
talking about wells they're drilling in the Leonard. And we're right in and amongst those wells, so frankly we have as
good if not better acreage position than some of the other people talking about it. So we feel very good, and actually the
Wolfcamp extends further to the West and we have outlined on the map. But we've just really highlighted what we
think is the oily portion of the Wolfcamp on that map. So no, these are essentially – these are really oil opportunities
that have strong economics right now.

Your next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Campbell from Tuohy Brothers Investments. Your line is open.
<Q - Jeff L. Campbell>: Thank you. Good morning.
<A - John Richels>: Good morning, Jeff.
<A - Vincent W. White>: Good morning.
<Q - Jeff L. Campbell>: I wanted to ask – kind of jump to the Powder River. How contiguous is your position there?
And along with that, do you have multiple zone exposure on some of the acreage, or do the Frontier and the Parkman
and the Turner tend to occur individually on discrete locations?
<A - David A. Hager>: We have acreage throughout Campbell County, but we also have some very nice positions that
are contiguous in that area. To give you an idea, we have so far been what I would consider, appraisal mode, appraising
areas throughout Campbell County. Now we are in the position in the Parkman and, to a large degree, also in the
Turner where we're going to go into full development mode on those formations.
And so what you're going to see from us in the future is better overall economic results as we can focus on
development, get our costs down, get our EURs up even more consistently. So we're seeing outstanding results. And I
can tell you that our program in the last quarter really delivered good results and you're going to see a continuous
movement in that direction as we get out of the mode of appraising our entire acreage position and get into the mode of
focusing on the most economic development areas.
<Q - Jeff L. Campbell>: So just a follow up on what you just said, as you go into development mode, will we start to
see a significant rise in rigs as we're going to see in the Delaware? Or does there still need to be more work done before
you...?
<A - David A. Hager>: We think the opportunity is there. We're going to have three rigs working right now. We want
to walk before we run I guess you'd say. But there's certainly opportunity to raise the rig count in the future. But we're
going to see how these developments go and if they work out the way we think they're going to work out, the
opportunity is certainly there to raise the rig count in the future.
<Q - Jeff L. Campbell>: Great. If I could ask just another quick question. Can you tell me what your current well
spacing assumptions are for your 2015 production projections in the Eagle Ford?
<A - David A. Hager>: There are various well spacing assumptions depending on exactly where the wells are located
throughout our acreage position. They vary on the order of 40 acres to 80 acres, to the average about 60-acre spacing.
<Q - Jeff L. Campbell>: Okay, great. Thank you.

First, I think we've done an excellent job of improving our portfolio in a very short period of time. Devon's emerged
with a formidable portfolio that's on track to deliver multiyear oil production growth in excess of 20% while generating
free cash flow. And as evidenced by our Q1 results, our pursuit of high-margin production is significantly expanding
our margins and profitability. And finally, the resource potential associated with our world-class Permian position
continues to get better with time and is clearly a cornerstone growth asset for Devon.
As I mentioned earlier, as I look ahead, I've never been more excited about the future prospects for Devon. Even with
all of the exciting changes, our approach to the business remains unchanged. We will continue to aggressively pursue
our top strategic objective of maximizing shareholder returns by optimizing long-term growth in debt adjusted cash
flow per share. So we look forward to talking with you again at the next call. And thank you very much for joining us
today.
